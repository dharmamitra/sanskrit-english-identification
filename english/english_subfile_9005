this is called the discrimination of meaning and on hearing phassā vedano etc he knows that that is not the individualessence languageparticularly in that of MagadhaQuestioning is questioning about defining the meaning of even a single stanzaIn arisings of consciousness with two rootcauses ie with nongreed and non hate but without nondelusion or without rootcause understanding does not occurJust as pleasure is not invariably inseparable from happiness so perception and consciousness are not invariably inseparable from understandingBut just as happiness is invariably inseparable from pleasure so understanding is invariably inseparable from perception and consciousnessA phenomenons own essence or existing essence is its individual essence Knowledge that is classified under meaning as capable of effecting the explanation and definition of specific characteristics of the meaning class is called atthapaṭisambhidāand so with the other threeIe the four paths with the first jhāna and those with the second third and fourth out of the fiveThe Chapter of Similes is the Chapter of Twin Verses in the Dhammapada  they say Others say that it is the Book of Pairs in the First Fifty  HOW IS IT DEVELOPED Now tHE THINGS CLASSed as aggregates bases elements faculties truths dependent origination etc are the soil of this understandingand the first two purifications namely purification of virtue and purification of consciousness are its rootsConsequently one who is perfecting these should first fortify his knowledge by learning and questioning about those things that are the soil after he has perfected the two purifications that are the roots then he can develop the five purifications that are the trunkThis is in briefThe detail is as follows When it was said above the things classed as aggregates bases elements faculties truths dependent origination etc are the soil the aggregates here are the five aggregates that is to say the materiality aggregate the feeling aggregate the perception aggregate the formations aggregate and the consciousness aggregatewhile the five purifications namely purification of view purification by overcoming doubt purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path purification by knowledge and vision of the way and purification by knowledge and vision are the trunkHaving understood this again as regards these same aggregatesKnowledge of aggregates is classed As to order and distinctionAs to neither less nor more And likewise as to simileAnd twice as to how to be seen And as to good for one seeing thusThis is the way of exposition That a wise man should rightly knowHerein as to order order is of several kinds namely order of arising order of abandoning order of practice order of plane order of teachingHerein First there comes to be the foetus in the first stage then there comes to be the foetus in the second stage  etc is order of arisingThings to be abandoned by seeing things to be abandoned by development  etc is order of abandoningPurification of virtue  purification of consciousness  etc is order of practiceThe sense sphere the fine material sphere  etc is order of planeThe four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts  etc or Talk on giving talk on virtue  etc is order of teachingOf these firstly order of arising is not applicable here because the aggregates do not arise in the order in which they are successively dealt with as is the case with the foetus in the first stage etcfor there are those people who while teachable have fallen into assuming a self among the five aggregates owing to failure to analyze them and the Blessed One is desirous of releasing them from the assumption by getting them to see how the seeming compactness of mass in the five aggregates is resolved and being desirous of their welfare he first for the purpose of their easy apprehension taught the materiality aggregate which is gross being the objective field of the eye etcand lastly consciousness which these things beginning with feeling have as their support and which dominates them This in the first place is how the exposition should be known as to order As to distinction as to the distinction between aggregates and aggregates asobjectsofclingingBut what is the distinction between them Firstly aggregates is said without distinguishingAggregates as objects of clinging is said distinguishing those that are subject to cankers and are liable to the clingingsBhikkhus I shall teach you the five aggregates and the five aggregates as objects of clinging Listen And what bhikkhus are the five aggregates Any kind of materiality whatever bhikkhus whether past future or present  far or near this is called the materiality aggregateAny kind of feeling whatever  Any kind of perception whatever  Any kind of formations whatever  Any kind of consciousness whatever  far or near this is called the consciousness aggregateThese bhikkhus are called the five aggregatesAnd what bhikkhus are the five aggregates as objects of clingingAny kind of materiality whatever  far or near that is subject to cankers and liable to the clingings this is called the materiality aggregate as object of clingingAny kind of feeling whatever  Any kind of perception whatever  Any kind of formations whatever  Any kind of consciousness whatever  far or near that is subject to cankers and liable to the clingings this is called the consciousness aggregate as object of clingingThese bhikkhus are called the five aggregates as objects of clinging Now while there is feeling etc both free from cankers and subject to them not so materialityHowever since materiality can be described as a simple aggregate in the sense of a total it is therefore mentioned among the simple aggregatesAnd since it can be described as an aggregate that is the object of clinging in the sense of a total and in the sense of being subjected to cankers that same materiality is therefore mentioned among the aggregates as objects of clinging tooBut feeling etc are only mentioned among the simple aggregates when they are free from cankersWhen they are subject to cankers they are mentioned among the aggregates as objects of clingingAnd here the meaning of the term aggregates as objects of clinging should be regarded as this aggregates that are the resort of clinging are aggregates of clingingBut here all these taken together are intended as aggregatesAs to neither less nor more but why are five aggregates neither less nor more mentioned by the Blessed One Because all formed things that resemble each other fall into these groups because that is the widest limit as the basis for the assumption of self and what pertains to self and because of the inclusion by them of the other sorts of aggregates When the numerous categories of formed states are grouped together according to similarity materiality forms one aggregate through being grouped together according to similarity consisting in materialityfeeling forms one aggregate through being grouped together according to similarity consisting in feelingSo they are stated as five because similar formed things fall into groups And this is the extreme limit as the basis for the assumption of self and what pertains to self that is to say the five beginning with materialityFor this is said Bhikkhus when matter exists it is through clinging to matter through insisting upon matter that such a view as this arises This is mine this is I this is my selfWhen feeling exists  When perception exists  When formations exist  When consciousness exists it is through clinging to consciousness through insisting upon consciousness that such a view as this arises This is mine this is I this is my selfSo they are stated as five because this is the widest limit as a basis for the assumption of self and what pertains to self And also since those other sorts of aggregates stated as the five aggregates of things beginning with virtue are comprised within the formations aggregate they are included here tooTherefore they are stated as five because they include the other sorts This is how the exposition should be known as to neither less nor moreAs to simile the materiality aggregate as object of clinging is like a sickroom because it is the dwellingplace as physical basis door and object of the sick man namely the consciousness aggregate as object of clingingThe feeling aggregate as object of clinging is like the sickness because it afflictsThe perception aggregate as object of clinging is like the provocation of the sickness because it gives rise to feeling associated with greed etc owing to perception of sense desires and so onThe formations aggregate as object of clinging is like having recourse to what is unsuitable because it is the source of feeling which is the sicknessThe consciousness aggregate as object of clinging is like the sick man because it is never free from feeling which is the sicknessAlso they are like the prison the punishment the offence the punisher and the offender And they are like the dish the food the curry sauce poured over the food the server and the eater This is how the exposition should be known as to simileTwice as to how to be seen the exposition should be known twice as to how to be seen namely in brief and in detailIn brief that is collectively the five aggregates as objects of clinging should be seen as an enemy with drawn sword in the Snake Simile as a burden according to the Burden Sutta as a devourer according to the Tobedevoured Discourse and as impermanent painful not self formed and murderous according to the Yamaka Sutta In detail that is individually matter should be regarded as a lump of froth because it will not stand squeezingIn particular even sublime internal materiality should be regarded as foul As to good for one seeing thus good comes to be accomplished in one who sees in the two ways thus in brief and in detail And the way of definition should be known according to thatthat is to say firstly one who sees the five aggregates as objects of clinging in the form of an enemy with drawn sword etc is not worried by the aggregates but one who sees materiality etcAnd in particular one who sees internal materiality as foul fully understands nutriment consisting of physical nutrimentHe abandons the perversion of perceiving beauty in the foul  he crosses the flood of sense desire he is loosed from the bond of sense desire he becomes cankerfree as regards the canker of sense desire he breaks the bodily tie of covetousness He does not cling with sensedesire clingingOne who sees feeling as pain fully understands nutriment consisting of contact He abandons the perversion of perceiving pleasure in the painful He crosses the flood of becoming He is loosed from the bond of becoming He becomes cankerfree as regards the canker of becoming He breaks the bodily tie of ill will He does not cling with rulesandvows clingingOne who sees perception and formations as notself fully understands nutriment consisting of mental volition He abandons the perversion of perceiving self in the notself He crosses the flood of views He is loosed from the bond of viewsHe breaks the bodily tie of interpretations that This is the truth He does not cling with selftheory clingingOne who sees consciousness as impermanent fully understands nutriment consisting of consciousness He abandons the perversion of perceiving permanence in the impermanent He crosses the flood of ignorance He is loosed from the bond of ignorance He becomes cankerfree as regards the canker of ignorance He breaks the bodily tie of holding to rules and vows He does not cling with false view clingingSuch blessings there will be From seeing them as murderers and otherwiseTherefore the wise should see The aggregates as murderers and otherwisein the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Understandingnor is order of abandoning applicable because the profitable and indeterminate are not to be abandonednor is order of practice because what is unprofitable is not to be practicednor is order of plane because feeling etc are included in all four planesOrder of teaching is appropriate howeverthen formations which form volitionally through the means of perceptionand after that feeling which feels matter as desirable and undesirablethen perception which apprehends the aspects of feelings objective field since What one feels that one perceives according as it is saidand so with perception and the other twofor it is said Feeling as feeling is the formed that they form and likewise Because of unprofitable kamma having been performed and stored up resultant bodyconsciousness has arisen accompanied by pain feeling as a bubble on water because it can only be enjoyed for an instantperception as a mirage because it causes illusionformations as a plantain trunk because they have no coreand consciousness as a conjuring trick because it deceives feeling should be regarded as painful because it is never free from the three kinds of suffering perception and formations as notself because they are unmanageableand consciousness as impermanent because it has the nature of rise and fallin detail as a lump of froth etc is not one who sees a core in the corelesscalled The Description of the AggregatesThe fourteenth chapterConsciousness dominates because of the words Dhammas have mind as their forerunner  Dhammas that have parallel turnover with consciousness  and The king lord of the six doors When all formed dhammas are grouped together according to similarity they naturally fall into five aggregatesHerein it is the items that are the same owing to the sameness consisting respectively in molesting etc that are to be understood as similarAmong them those that are strong in the volition whose nature is accumulating with the function of forming the formed are called the formations aggregateAnd the others that is contact etc which are devoid of the distinguishing characteristics of being molested etc may also be so regarded under the generality of forming the formed But the similarities consisting in touching are not describable separately by the word aggregate and so that is why no aggregates of contact etc have been stated by the Perfect One who knows the similarities of dhammasBhikkhus whatever ascetics or brahmans there are who are asserters of eternity and declare the self and the world to be eternal all do so depending and relying on these same five aggregates or on one or other of them  and so onConsciousness is like the offender because it is afflicted by feeling Consciousness is like the eater because it is helped by feelingThe formations aggregate is like the punisher because it is a cause of feeling The formations aggregate is like the server because it is a cause of feelingand service is included since one who is taking a meal is usually servedPerception is like the offence because owing to perception of beauty etc it is a cause of the punishment which is feeling Perception is like the curry sauce because owing to perception of beauty etc it hides the food which is feelingThe matter of the body is like the prison because it is the site of the punishment Again matter is like the dish because it bears the foodThe faculties listed next to the elements are the twentytwo faculties namely eye faculty ear faculty nose faculty tongue faculty body faculty mind faculty femininity faculty masculinity faculty life faculty bodily pleasure faculty bodily pain faculty mental joy faculty mental grief faculty equanimity faculty faith faculty energy faculty mindfulness faculty concentration faculty understanding faculty Ishallcometoknowtheunknown faculty final knowledge faculty finalknower facultyHerein As to meaning character and so on Order should be knowndivided and undivided Likewise function and also plane The exposition Herein firstly the meaning of eye etc is explained in the way beginning It relishes  thus it is an eye  But as regards the last three the first is called the Ishallcometoknowtheunknown faculty because it arises in the initial stage of the streamentry path moment in one who has entered on the way thus I shall come to know the deathless state or the Dhamma of the Four Truths not known and because it carries the meaning of faculty The second of them is called the finalknowledge faculty because of knowing finally and because it carries the meaning of facultyThe third is called the finalknower faculty because it arises in one who has destroyed cankers who possesses final knowledge and whose task of getting to know the four truths is finished and because it carries the meaning of facultyBut what is this meaning of faculty that they have The meaning of being the mark of a ruler is the meaning of faculty  The meaning of being taught by a ruler is the meaning of faculty The meaning of having been fostered by a ruler is the meaning of facultyThe Blessed One Fully Enlightened is a ruler because of supreme lordshipAnd so is kamma profitable and unprofitable for no one has lordship over the kinds of kammaSo here the faculties  which are created by kamma are the mark of profitable and unprofitable kammaAnd since they are prepared by it they are faculties in the sense of being the mark of a ruler and in the sense of having been prepared by a rulerBut since they have also been correctly made evident and disclosed by the Blessed One they are all faculties in the sense of being taught by a ruler and in the sense of being seen by a rulerAnd since some of them were cultivated by the Blessed One Ruler of Sages in his cultivation of domain and some in his cultivation of development they are faculties in the sense of being fostered by a rulerFurthermore they are faculties in the sense of lordship called predominanceFor predominance of the eye etc is implied in the occurrence of eyeconsciousness etc because of the keenness when that faculty is keen and slowness when it is slowThis firstly is the exposition as to meaning As to character and so on the meaning is that the exposition of the eye and so on should be known according to characteristic function manifestation proximate cause and so onBut these characteristics etc of theirs are given above in the Description of the Aggregates For the four beginning with the understanding faculty are simply nondelusion as to meaningThe rest are each given there as suchAs to order this too is only order of teaching Herein the noble plane which is the stage of streamentry etc is attained through the full understanding of internal states and so the eye faculty and the rest included in the selfhood are taught firstThen the femininity faculty and masculinity faculty to show on what account that selfhood is called woman or manNext the bodily pleasure faculty etc to make it known  and that all feeling is ultimately sufferingNext the faith faculty etc to show the way since these things are to be developed in order to make that suffering ceaseNext the Ishallcometoknowtheunknown faculty to show that the way is not sterile since it is through this way that this state is first manifested in oneselfNext the finalknowledge faculty because it is the fruit of the lastmentioned faculty and so must be developed after itNext the finalknower faculty the supreme reward is taught last to make it known that it is attained by development and that when it is attained there is nothing more to be done This is the order here As to divided and undivided here there is only division of the life facultyfor that is twofold as the materiallife faculty and the immateriallife facultyThere is no division of the others This is how the exposition should be known here as to divided and undividedAs to function what is the faculties functionFirstly because of the words The eye base is a condition as faculty condition for the eyeconsciousness element and for the states associated therewith the eye facultys function is to cause by its own keenness slowness etc the occurrence of eye consciousness and associated states etc in a mode parallel to its own which is called their keenness slowness etc this function being accomplishable through the state of faculty conditionSo too in the case of the ear nose tongue and bodyBut the function of the mind faculty is to make conascent states subject to its own masteryThat of the life faculty is to maintain conascent statesThat of the femininity faculty and the masculinity faculty is to allot the modes of the mark sign work and ways of women and menThat of the faculties of pleasure pain joy and grief is to govern conascent states and impart their own particular mode of grossness to those statesThat of the equanimity faculty is to impart to them the mode of quiet superiority and neutralityThat of the faculties of faith etc is to overcome opposition and to impart to associated states the mode of confidence and so onThat of the Ishallcometoknowtheunknown faculty is both to abandon three fetters and to confront associated states with the abandonment of themThat of the finalknowledge faculty is both to attenuate and abandon respectively lust ill will etc and to subject conascent states to its own masteryThat of the finalknower faculty is both to abandon endeavour in all functions and to condition associated states by confronting them with the Deathless This is how the exposition should be known here as to functionAs to plane the faculties of eye ear nose tongue body femininity masculinity pleasure pain and grief are of the sense sphere onlyThe mind faculty life faculty and equanimity faculty and the faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and understanding are included in the four planesThe joy faculty is included in three planes namely sense sphere finematerial sphere and supramundaneThe last three are supramundane only This is how the exposition should be known here as to planeThe monk who knows the urgent need To keep the faculties restrainedBy fully understanding them Will make an end of sufferingThis is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the faculties The meaning of being seen by a ruler is the meaning of facultyAnd all that applies here in one instance or another The meaning of having been prepared by a ruler is the meaning of facultyNext the life faculty to make it known that although that selfhood is twofold still its existence is bound up with the life facultythat there is no remission of these feelings as long as that selfhood continuesIn the noble path moments initial stageLet a wise man with mindfulness So practice that he may beginTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus I shall teach you the character of a true man and the character of an untrue man Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisHere an untrue man who has gone forth from an aristocratic familySo he lauds himself and disparages others because of his aristocratic familyThis is the character of an untrue manBut a true man considers thus It is not because of ones aristocratic family that states of greed hatred or delusion are destroyedEven though someone may not have gone forth from an aristocratic family yet if he has entered upon the way that accords with the Dhamma entered upon the proper way and conducts himself according to the Dhamma he should be honoured for that he should be praised for thatSo putting the practice of the way first he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his aristocratic familyThis is the character of a true manMoreover an untrue man who has gone forth from a great familyfrom a wealthy familyfrom an influential familySo he lauds himself and disparages others because of his influential familyThis too is the character of an untrue manBut a true man considers thus It is not because of ones influential family that states of greed hatred or delusion are destroyedEven though someone may not have gone forth from an influential family yet if he has entered upon the way that accords with the Dhamma entered upon the proper way and conducts himself according to the Dhamma he should be honoured for that he should be praised for thatSo putting the practice of the way first he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his influential familyThis too is the character of a true manMoreover an untrue man who is well known and famousSo he lauds himself and disparages others because of his renownThis too is the character of an untrue manBut a true man considers thus It is not because of ones renown that states of greed hatred or delusion are destroyedEven though someone may not be well known and famous yet if he has entered upon the way that accords with the Dhamma entered upon the proper way and conducts himself according to the Dhamma he should be honoured for that he should be praised for thatSo putting the practice of the way first he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his renownThis too is the character of a true manMoreover an untrue man who gains robes almsfood resting places and requisites of medicineSo he lauds himself and disparages others because of gainThis too is the character of an untrue manBut a true man considers thus It is not because of gain that states of greed hatred or delusion are destroyedEven though someone has no gain yet if he has entered upon the way that accords with the Dhamma entered upon the proper way and conducts himself according to the Dhamma he should be honoured for that he should be praised for thatSo putting the practice of the way first he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of gainThis too is the character of a true manMoreover an untrue man who is learnedSo he lauds himself and disparages others because of his being a onesession eaterThis too is the character of an untrue manBut an untrue man considers thus It is not because of being a onesession eater that states of greed hatred or delusion are destroyedEven though someone may not be a onesession eater yet if he has entered upon the way that accords with the Dhamma entered upon the proper way and conducts himself according to the Dhamma he should be honoured for that he should be praised for thatSo putting the practice of the way first he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his being a onesession eaterThis too is the character of a true manMoreover quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states an untrue man enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionHe considers thus I have gained the attainment of the first jhana but these other bhikkhus have not gained the attainment of the first jhanaSo he lauds himself and disparages others because of his attainment of the first jhanaThis too is the character of an untrue manBut a true man considers thus Nonidentification even with the attainment of the first jhana has been declared by the Blessed OneSo putting nonidentification first he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his attainment of the first jhanaThis too is the character of a true manMoreover with the stilling of applied and sustained thought an untrue man enters upon and abides in the second jhanaWith the fading away as well of rapturehe enters upon and abides in the third jhanaWith the abandoning of pleasure and painhe enters upon and abides in the fourth jhanaMoreover by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing an untrue man enters upon and abides in the base of nothingnessSo he lauds himself and disparages others because of his attainment of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThis too is the character of an untrue manBut a true man considers thus Nonidentification even with the attainment of the base of neitherperceptionnornon perception has been declared by the Blessed OneSo putting nonidentification first he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his attainment of the base of neither perceptionnornonperceptionThis too is the character of a true manMoreover by completely surmounting the base of neither perceptionnornonperception a true man enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feelingThis bhikkhu does not conceive anything he does not conceive in regard to anything he does not conceive in any wayThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsWhen he has quite cleared up his discerning of materiality then the immaterial states become evident to him through one of three aspects that is through contact through feeling or through consciousnessHow When he discerns the four primary elements in the way beginning The earth element has the characteristic of hardness  contact becomes evident to him as the first conjunction Then the feeling associated with that as the feeling aggregate the associated perception as the perception aggregate the associated volition together with the aforesaid contact as the formations aggregate and the associated consciousness as the consciousness aggregate Likewise when he has discerned them in this way In the head hair it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness  in the in breaths and outbreaths it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness  contact becomes evident as the first conjunction Then the feeling associated with it as the feeling aggregate  the associated consciousness as the consciousness aggregateThis is how immaterial states become evident through contact To another who discerns the four primary elements in the way beginning The earth element has the characteristic of hardness the feeling that has that as its object and experiences its stimulus as pleasant etc becomes evident as the feeling aggregate the perception associated with that as the perception aggregate the contact and the volition associated with that as the formations aggregate and the consciousness associated with that as the consciousness aggregate Likewise to one who discerns them in this way In the head hair it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness  in the inbreaths and outbreaths it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness the feeling that has that as its object and experiences its stimulus becomes evident as the feeling aggregate  and the consciousness associated with that as the consciousness aggregateThis is how the immaterial states become evident through feeling To another who discerns the four primary elements in the way beginning The earth element has the characteristic of hardness the consciousness that cognizes the object becomes evident as the consciousness aggregate the feeling associated with it as the feeling aggregate the associated perception as the perception aggregate and the associated contact and volition as the formations aggregate Likewise to one who discerns them in this way In the head hair it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness  in the inbreaths and outbreaths it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness the consciousness that cognizes the object becomes evident as the consciousness aggregate  and the associated contact and volition as the formations aggregateThis is how the immaterial states become evident through consciousnessIn the case of the ways of discerning materiality as consisting of the forty two aspects of the elements beginning with the head hairs that is thirtytwo aspects of the body four aspects of the fire element and six aspects of the air element either by these same means given above or by means of the method beginning In the kammaoriginated head hairs it is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardnessand also in the case of the methods of discerning materiality as consisting of the eye etcby means of the four primary elements in each the construing should be done by working out all the differences in each methodNow it is only when he has become quite sure about discerning materiality in this way that immaterial states become quite evident to him in the three aspectsTherefore he should only undertake the task of discerning the immaterial states after he has completed that not otherwiseIf he leaves off discerning materiality when say one or two material states have become evident in order to begin discerning the immaterial then he falls from his meditation subject like the mountain cow already described under the Development of the Earth Kasiṇa But if he undertakes the task of discerning the immaterial after he is already quite sure about discerning materiality thus then his meditation subject comes to growth increase and perfectionHe defines the four immaterial aggregates that have thus become evident through contact etc as mentality And he defines their objects namely the four primaries and the materiality derived from the four primaries as materialitySo as one who opens a box with a knife as one who splits a twin palmyra bulb in two he defines all states of the three planes the eighteen elements twelve bases five aggregates in the double way as mentality materialityand he concludes that over and above mere mentalitymateriality there is nothing else that is a being or a person or a deity or a BrahmāAll states of the three planes is said allinclusively owing to the necessity not to omit anything suitable for comprehension For it must be fully understood without any exception and greed must be made to fade away absolutely so that the mind may be liberated by the fading away of greedThat is why the Blessed One saidBhikkhus without directly knowing without fully understanding all without causing the fading away of greed for it without abandoning it the mind is incapable of the destruction of sufferingBhikkhus it is by directly knowing by fully understanding all by causing the fading away of greed for it by abandoning it that the mind is capable of the destruction of suffering If all the states of the three planes are taken as mentalitymateriality without exception then how should one deal with what has been conceived by those outside the Dispensation as verbal meanings such as the Primordial Essence  etc eg of the Sāṃkhya the substance  etc eg of the Vaieika the soul  etc and the body  etc Since these are like the hallucination of lunatics and are taught by the not fully enlightened what other way of dealing with them is there than to ignore themOr alternatively their existence or nonexistence can be understood as established by their inclusion within mentality materialityWherever the verbal meaning of self is expressed by some such metaphor as worldsoul  self  soul  etc these being themselves conceived in their various ways on the basis of mere mentalitymateriality are mere mentalitymateriality tooAfter defining mentalitymateriality thus according to its true nature then in order to abandon this worldly designation of a being and a person more thoroughly to surmount confusion about beings and to establish his mind on the plane of nonconfusion he makes sure that the meaning defined namely This is mere mentalitymateriality there is no being no person is confirmed by a number of suttasFor this has been saidAs with the assembly of parts The word chariot is countenancedSo when the aggregates are present A being is said in common usage Again this has been said Just as when a space is enclosed with timber and creepers and grass and clay there comes to be the term house so too when a space is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin there comes to be the term material form  And again this has been saidIt is ill alone that rises Ill that remains ill that departsNothing rises else than ill And nothing ceases else than ill So in many hundred suttas it is only mentalitymateriality that is illustrated not a being not a personTherefore just as when the component parts such as axles wheels frame poles etc are arranged in a certain way there comes to be the mere term of common usage chariot yet in the ultimate sense when each part is examined there is no chariotThe vision of one who sees in this way is called correct visionBut when a man rejects this correct vision and assumes that a permanent being existsIf he concludes that it does not come to be annihilated he falls into the eternity viewIf he concludes that it does come to be annihilated he falls into the annihilation viewWhyBecause the assumption precludes any gradual change like that of milk into curdSo he either holds back concluding that the assumed being is eternalHence the Blessed One saidAnd how do some hold backDeities and human beings love becoming delight in becoming rejoice in becomingWhen Dhamma is taught to them for the ceasing of becoming their minds do not enter into it become settled steady and resoluteThus it is that some hold backAnd how do some overreachSome are ashamed humiliated and disgusted by that same becoming they are concerned with nonbecoming in this way Sirs when with the breakup of the body this self is cut off annihilated does not become any more after death that is peaceful that is sublime that is trueThus it is that some overreachAnd how do those with eyes seeHere a bhikkhu sees what is become as become Having seen what is become as become he has entered upon the way to dispassion for it to the fading away of greed for it to its cessationThis is how one with eyes sees Therefore just as a marionette is void soulless and without curiosity and while it walks and stands merely through the combination of strings and woodThis is how it should be regardedHence the Ancients saidThe mental and material are really hereBut here there is no human being to be foundFor it is void and merely fashioned like a dollJust suffering piled up like grass and sticksAnd this should be explained not only by means of the simile of the marionette but also by means of the analogies of the sheaves of reeds and so on For just as when two sheaves of reeds are propped one against the other each one gives the other consolidating support and when one falls the other falls so too in the fiveconstituent becoming mentalitymateriality occurs as an interdependent state each of its components giving the other consolidating supportand when one falls owing to death the other falls tooHence the Ancients saidThe mental and material Are twins and each supports the otherWhen one breaks up they both break up Through interconditionalityAnd just as when sound occurs having as its support a drum that is beaten by the stick then the drum is one and the sound another the drum and the sound are not mixed up together the drum is void of the sound and the sound is void of the drum so too when mentality occurs having as its support the materiality called the physical basis the door and the object then the materiality is one and the mentality is another the mentality and materiality are not mixed up together the mentality is void of the materiality and the materiality is void of the mentality yet the mentality occurs due to the materiality as the sound occurs due to the drumHence the Ancients saidThe pentad based on contact comes not from the eyeOr from things seen or something that is in betweenDue to a cause it comes to be and formed as wellJust as the sound that issues from a beaten drumThe pentad based on contact comes not from the earOr yet from sound or something that is in between Due to a cause The pentad based on contact comes not from the noseOr yet from smells or something that is in between Due to a cause The pentad based on contact comes not from the tongueOr yet from tastes or something that is in between Due to a cause The pentad based on contact comes not from the bodyOr yet from touch or something that is in between Due to a cause Being formed it does not come from the material basisNor does it issue from the mentaldatum baseDue to a cause it comes to be and formed as wellJust as the sound that issues from a beaten drumFurthermore mentality has no efficient power it cannot occur by its own efficient power It does not eat it does not drink it does not speak it does not adopt posturesAnd materiality is without efficient power it cannot occur by its own efficient powerFor it has no desire to eat it has no desire to drink it has no desire to speak it has no desire to adopt postures But rather it is when supported by materiality that mentality occurs and it is when supported by mentality that materiality occurs When mentality has the desire to eat the desire to drink the desire to speak the desire to adopt a posture it is materiality that eats drinks speaks and adopts a postureBut for the purpose of explaining this meaning they gave this simile as an example a man born blind and a stoolcrawling cripple wanted to go somewhere The blind man said to the cripple Look I can do what should be done by legs but I have no eyes with which to see what is rough and smoothThe cripple said Look I can do what should be done by eyes but I have no legs with which to go and comeThe blind man was delighted and he made the cripple climb up on his shoulderHerein the blind man has no efficient power he is impotent he cannot travel by his own efficient power by his own strength And the cripple has no efficient power he is impotent he cannot travel by his own efficient power by his own strength But there is nothing to prevent their going when they support each other So too mentality has no efficient power it does not arise or occur in such and such functions by its own efficient powerAnd materiality has no efficient power it does not arise or occur in such and such functions by its own efficient power But there is nothing to prevent their occurrence when they support each otherHence this is saidThey cannot come to be by their own strengthOr yet maintain themselves by their own strengthRelying for support on other statesWeak in themselves and formed they come to beThey come to be with others as conditionThey are aroused by others as their objectsThey are produced by object and conditionAnd each by something other than itselfAnd just as men depend upon A boat for traversing the seaSo does the mental body need The matterbody for occurrenceAnd as the boat depends upon The men for traversing the seaSo does the matterbody need The mental body for occurrenceDepending each upon the other The boat and men go on the seaAnd so do mind and matter both Depend the one upon the otherThe correct vision of mentality and materiality which after defining mentalitymateriality by these various methods has been established on the plane of nonconfusion by overcoming the perception of a being is what should be understood as purification of viewOther terms for it are defining of mentality materiality and delimitation of formationsin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Understandingin the ultimate sense there is only mentalitymaterialityso too when there are the five aggregates as objects of clinging there comes to be the mere term of common usage a being a person yet in the ultimate sense when each component is examined there is no being as a basis for the assumption I am or Ijust as when trunk branches foliage etc are placed in a certain way there comes to be the mere term of common usage tree yet in the ultimate sense when each component is examined there is no treewith surrounding walls houses states etc citywith elephants horses etc armywith body and strings luteand just as when the fingers thumb etc are placed in a certain way there comes to be the mere term of common usage fistand just as when the component parts of a house such as wattles etc are placed so that they enclose a space in a certain way there comes to be the mere term of common usage house yet in the ultimate sense there is no househe has to conclude either that it comes to be annihilated or that it does notor he overreaches concluding that it comes to be annihilatedThere are two kinds of view bhikkhus and when deities and human beings are obsessed by them some hold back and some overreach only those with eyes seeyet it seems as if it had curiosity and interestedness so too this mentality materiality is void soulless and without curiosity and while it walks and stands merely through the combination of the two together yet it seems as if it had curiosity and interestednessSitting on the blind mans shoulder the cripple spoke thus Leave the left take the right leave the right take the leftcalled The Description of Purification of ViewThe eighteenth chapterThe knowledge established by getting to know the path and the not path thus This is the path this is not the path is called purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the pathOne who desires to accomplish this should first of all apply himself to the inductive insight called comprehension by groupsBecause knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path appears in connection with the appearance of illumination etc in one who has begun insightFor it is after illumination etc have appeared in one who has already begun insight that there comes to be knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path And comprehension by groups is the beginning of insightThat is why it is set forth next to the overcoming of doubtBesides knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path arises when fullunderstanding as investigation is occurring and fullunderstanding as investigation comes next to full understanding as the known  So this is also a reason why one who desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path should first of all apply himself to comprehension by groupsHere is the exposition there are three kinds of mundane fullunderstanding that is fullunderstanding as the known fullunderstanding as investigation and fullunderstanding as abandoningwith reference to which it was said Understanding that is directknowledge is knowledge in the sense of being knownUnderstanding that is fullunderstanding is knowledge in the sense of investigatingUnderstanding that is abandoning is knowledge in the sense of giving up Herein the understanding that occurs by observing the specific characteristics of such and such states thus Materiality has the characteristic of being molested  feeling has the characteristic of being felt is called full understanding as the knownThe understanding consisting in insight with the general characteristics as its object that occurs in attributing a general characteristic to those same states in the way beginning Materiality is impermanent feeling is impermanent is called fullunderstanding as investigationHerein the plane of fullunderstanding as the known extends from the delimitation of formations up to the discernment of conditions The plane of fullunderstanding as investigation extends from comprehension by groups up to contemplation of rise and fall The plane of fullunderstanding as abandoning extends from contemplation of dissolution onwards for from there onwards the seven contemplations that effect the abandoning of the perception of permanence etc predominate thus Contemplating formations as impermanent a man abandons the perception of permanence Contemplating them as painful he abandons the perception of pleasure Contemplating them as notself he abandons the perception of self Becoming dispassionate he abandons delighting Causing fading away he abandons greed Causing cessation he abandons originating Relinquishing he abandons grasping So of these three kinds of fullunderstanding only fullunderstanding as the known has been attained by this meditator as yet which is because the delimitation of formations and the discernment of conditions have already been accomplished the other two still remain to be attainedHence it was said above Besides knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path arises when fullunderstanding as investigation is occurring and fullunderstanding as investigation comes next to fullunderstanding as the known So this is also a reason why one who desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path should first of all apply himself to comprehension by groups Here is the textHow is it that understanding of defining past future and present states by summarization is knowledge of comprehensionAny materiality whatever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or nearhe defines all materiality as impermanent this is one kind of comprehensionHe defines it as painful this is one kind of comprehensionHe defines it as notself this is one kind of comprehensionAny feeling whatever  Any perception whatever  Any formations whatever  Any consciousness whatever  He defines all consciousness as impermanent  He defines it as notself this is one kind of comprehensionThe eye   ageinganddeath whether past future or present he defines it as impermanent this is one kind of comprehensionHe defines it as painful this is one kind of comprehension He defines it as notself this is one kind of comprehensionUnderstanding of defining by summarization thus Materiality whether past future or present is impermanent in the sense of destruction painful in the sense of terror notself in the sense of having no core is knowledge of comprehensionUnderstanding of defining by generalization thus Feeling   Consciousness  Eye   Ageinganddeath whether past  is knowledge of comprehensionUnderstanding of defining by summarization thus Materiality whether past future or present is impermanent formed dependently arisen subject to destruction subject to fall subject to fading away subject to cessation is knowledge of comprehensionUnderstanding of defining by generalization thus Feeling   Consciousness  Eye   Ageinganddeath whether past future or present is impermanent formed dependently arisen subject to destruction subject to fall subject to fading away subject to cessation is knowledge of comprehensionUnderstanding of defining by summarization thus With birth as condition there is ageinganddeath without birth as condition there is no ageingand death is knowledge of comprehensionUnderstanding of defining by generalization thus In the past and in the future with birth as condition there is ageinganddeath without birth as condition there is no ageinganddeath is knowledge of comprehensionUnderstanding of defining by generalization thus With becoming as condition there is birth  With ignorance as condition there are formations without ignorance as condition there are no formations is knowledge of comprehensionUnderstanding of defining by generalization thus In the past and in the future with ignorance as condition there are formations without ignorance as condition there are no formations is knowledge of comprehensionKnowledge is in the sense of that being knownHence it was said Understanding of defining past future and present states by summarization is knowledge of comprehension Herein the abbreviation The eye   Ageinganddeath should be understood to represent the following sets of things elided  The states that occur in the doors of consciousness together with the doors and the objects  The five aggregates  The six doors  The six objects  The six kinds of consciousness  The six kinds of contact  The six kinds of feeling  The six kinds of perception  The six kinds of volition  The six kinds of craving  The six kinds of applied thought  The six kinds of sustained thought  The six elements  The ten kasiṇas  The thirtytwo bodily aspects  The twelve bases  The eighteen elements  The twentytwo faculties  The three elements  The nine kinds of becoming  The four jhānas  The four measureless states  The four immaterial attainments  The twelve members of the dependent originationFor this is said in the Paṭisambhidā in the description of what is to be directly knownAnd what is all that is to be directly knownEye is to be directly knownEar  Mind  feeling pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnor pleasant that arises due to mindcontact is also to be directly known Materiality is to be directly known  consciousness is to be directly known Eye  mind  Visible objects  mental objects  Eyeconsciousness  mindconsciousness  Eyecontact  mindcontact   Eyecontactborn feeling  mindcontactborn feeling  Perception of visible objects  perception of mental objects  Volition regarding visible objects  volition regarding mental objects  Craving for visible objects  craving for mental objects  Applied thought about visible objects  applied thought about mental objects  Sustained thought about visible objects  sustained thought about mental objects Since all this detail is given there it has been abbreviated hereBut what is thus abbreviated includes the supramundane states These should not be dealt with at this stage because they are not amenable to comprehensionAnd as regards those that are amenable to comprehension a beginning should be made by comprehending those among them that are obvious to and easily discernible by the individual meditatorHere is the application of the directions dealing with the aggregates Any materiality whatever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near he defines all materiality as impermanent this is one kind of comprehensionHe defines it as painful this is one kind of comprehension He defines it as notself this is one kind of comprehension At this point this bhikkhu takes all materiality which is described without specifying as any materiality whatever and having delimited it in the eleven instances namely with the past triad and with the four dyads beginning with the internal dyad he defines all materiality as impermanent he comprehends that it is impermanentHowIn the way stated nextFor this is said Materiality whether past future or present is impermanent in the sense of destructionAccordingly he comprehends the materiality that is past as impermanent in the sense of destruction because it was destroyed in the past and did not reach this becomingAnd he comprehends the materiality that is internal as impermanent in the sense of destruction since it is destroyed as internal and does not pass on to the external stateAnd he comprehends the materiality that is external  gross  subtle  inferior  superior  far  And he comprehends the materiality that is near as impermanent in the sense of destruction since it is destroyed there and does not pass on to the far state And all this is impermanent in the sense of destructionAccordingly there is one kind of comprehension in this waybut it is effected in eleven waysSo this is also painful in the sense of terror Accordingly there is one kind of comprehension in this way toobut it is effected in eleven waysAnd just as it is painful so too all that materiality is notself in the sense of having no coreHence it is said Bhikkhus were materiality selfSo this is also notself in the sense of having no core Accordingly there is one kind of comprehension in this way toobut it is effected in eleven waysThe same method applies to feeling and so onBut what is impermanent is necessarily classed as formed etc and so in order to show the synonyms for that impermanenceor in order to show how the attention given to it occurs in different ways it is restated in the text thus Materiality whether past future or present is impermanent formed dependently arisen subject to destruction subject to fall subject to fading away subject to cessation WhyThe understanding consisting in insight with the characteristics as its object that occurs as the abandoning of the perception of permanence etc in those same states is called fullunderstanding as abandoningfor in this interval the penetration of the specific characteristics of states predominatesfor in this interval the penetration of the general characteristics predominatesand understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding thatBhikkhus all is to be directly knownvisible objects are to be directly known eyeconsciousness  eyecontact  feeling pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises due to eyecontact is also to be directly knownThe first jhāna  the fourth jhāna  The minddeliverance of loving kindness  the minddeliverance of equanimity  The attainment of the base consisting of boundless space  the attainment of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception  Ignorance is to be directly known  ageing anddeath is to be directly known The sensedesire element  the finematerial element  the immaterial element  Sensedesire becoming  finematerial becoming

kasiṇa  Head hairs  brain and he comprehends the materiality that is future as impermanent in the sense of destruction since it will be produced in the next becoming will be destroyed there too and will not pass on to a further becomingand he comprehends the materiality that is present as impermanent in the sense of destruction since it is destroyed here and does not pass beyondAnd all that materiality is painful in the sense of terrorIn the sense of terror because of its terrifyingnessfor what is impermanent brings terror as it does to the deities in the Sīhopama Sutta In the sense of having no core because of the absence of any core of self conceived as a self an abider a doer an experiencer one who is his own masterfor what is impermanent is painful  and it is impossible to escape the impermanence or the rise and fall and oppression of self so how could it have the state of a doer and so onit would not lead to affliction  and so onThe same method applies to feeling and so onComprehension by placing together in groups the states that are differentiated into past future and present is comprehension by groups This it seems is the term used by the inhabitants of Jambudīpa However insight into states by means of the method beginning Any materiality whatever is inductive insight This it seems is the term used by the inhabitants of Tambapaṇṇidīpa That is why he said to inductive insight called comprehension by groupsThese are apprehended as though they were attributive material instances because they have to be apprehended under the respective headings of dissolution and rise and fall of oppression and of insusceptibility to the exercise of masteryHardness touching etc as the respective characteristics of earth contact etc which are observable at all three instants of arising presence and dissolution are apprehended by their being established as the respective individual essences of definite materialness But it is not so with the characteristics of impermanence and so onContemplating as impermanent is contemplating comprehending formations in the aspect of impermanenceThe perception of permanence is the wrong perception that they are permanent eternalthe kinds of consciousness associated with wrong view should be regarded as included under the heading of perceptionSo too with what followsBecoming dispassionate is seeing formations with dispassion by means of the contemplation of dispassion induced by the contemplations of impermanence and so onDelighting is craving accompanied by happinessCausing fading away is contemplating in such a way that greed for formations does not arise owing to the causing of greed to fade by the contemplation of fading away for one who acts thus is said to abandon greedCausing cessation is contemplating in such a way that by the contemplation of cessation formations cease only they do not arise in the future through a new becomingsince one who acts thus is said to abandon the arousing of formations because of producing the nature of nonarisingRelinquishing is relinquishing in such a way that by the contemplation of relinquishment formations are not grasped anymorehence he said He abandons grasping or the meaning is that he relinquishes apprehending them as permanent and so onNow when the Blessed One was expounding conformity knowledge he asked the question By means of what forty aspects does he acquire liking that is in conformity By means of what forty aspects does he enter into the certainty of rightness    In the answer to it comprehension of impermanence etc is set forth by him analytically in the way beginningSeeing the five aggregates as impermanent as painful as a disease a boil a dart a calamity an affliction as alien as disintegrating as a plague a disaster a terror a menace as fickle perishable unenduring as no protection no shelter no refuge as empty vain void notself as a danger as subject to change as having no core as the root of calamity as murderous as due to be annihilated as subject to cankers as formed as Māras bait as subject to birth subject to ageing subject to illness subject to death subject to sorrow subject to lamentation subject to despair subject to defilementthis meditator also comprehends these five aggregates by means of that kind of comprehensionHow does he do itHe does it by means of comprehension as impermanent etc stated specifically as follows He comprehends each aggregate as impermanent because of nonendlessness and because of possession of a beginning and an endas fickle because of fickle insecurity due to sickness ageing and death and to the worldly states of gain etcNow there are fifty kinds of contemplation of impermanence here by taking the following ten in the case of each aggregate as impermanent as disintegrating as fickle as perishable as unenduring as subject to change as having no core as due to be annihilated as formed as subject to deathThere are twentyfive kinds of contemplation of notself by taking the following five in the case of each aggregate as alien as empty as vain as void as notselfThere are one hundred and twentyfive kinds of contemplation of pain by taking the rest beginning with as painful as a disease in the case of each aggregateSo when a man comprehends the five aggregates by means of this comprehending as impermanent etc in its two hundred aspects his comprehending as impermanent painful and notself which is called inductive insight is strengthenedThese in the first place are the directions for undertaking comprehension here in accordance with the method given in the textsSo in order to strengthen that same comprehension of impermanence pain and notself in the five aggregatesAnd seeing that the cessation of the five aggregates is the permanent Nibbāna he enters into the certainty of rightness Seeing the five aggregates as impermanent he acquires liking that is in conformityas painful because of oppression by rise and fall and because of being the basis for painas a disease because of having to be maintained by conditions and because of being the root of diseaseas a boil because of being consequent upon impalement by suffering because of oozing with the filth of defilements and because of being swollen by arising ripened by ageing and burst by dissolutionas a calamity because of having to be condemned because of bringing loss and because of being the basis for calamityas a dart because of producing oppression because of penetrating inside and because of being hard to extractas a plague because of bringing various kinds of ruinas disintegrating because of crumbling through sickness ageing and deathas a disaster because of bringing unforeseen and plentiful adversityas alien because of inability to have mastery exercised over them and because of intractabilityas an affliction because of restricting freedom and because of being the foundation for afflictionand because of being the basis for all kinds of terror and because of being the opposite of the supreme comfort called the stilling of all sufferingas a menace because of being bound up with many kinds of adversity because of being menaced by ills and because of unfitness as a menace to be entertainedas perishable because of having the nature of perishing both by violence and naturallyas unenduring because of collapsing on every occasion and because of lack of solidityas no protection because of not protecting and because of affording no safetyas no shelter because of unfitness to give shelter and because of not performing the function of a shelter for the unshelteredas no refuge because of failure to disperse fear in those who depend on themas empty because of their emptiness of the lastingness beauty pleasure and self that are conceived about themas vain because of their emptiness or because of their triviality for what is trivial is called vain in the worldas void because devoid of the state of being an owner abider doer experiencer directoras notself because of itself having no owner etcas danger because of the suffering in the process of becoming and because of the danger in suffering or alternatively as danger because of resemblance to misery  since danger means that it is towards misery that it moves  goes advances this being a term for a wretched man and the aggregates are wretched tooas subject to change because of having the nature of change in two ways that is through ageing and through deathas having no core because of feebleness and because of decaying soon like sapwoodas the root of calamity because of being the cause of calamityas murderous because of breaking faith like an enemy posing as a friendas due to be annihilated because their becoming disappears and because their nonbecoming comes aboutas subject to cankers because of being the proximate cause for cankersas formed because of being formed by causes and conditionsas Māras bait because of being the bait laid by the Māra of death and the Māra of defilementas subject to birth to ageing to illness and to death because of having birth ageing illness and death as their natureas subject to sorrow to lamentation and to despair because of being the cause of sorrow lamentation and despairas subject to defilement because of being the objective field of the defilements of craving views and misconductLiking that is in conformity in conformity with the attainment of the pathfor that is called the rightness beginning with right view and also the certainty of an irreversible trendThe certainty of rightness is the noble pathliking for knowledge that is Actually the knowledge itself is the liking since it likes  it endures defining by going into the individual essence of its objective fieldWhile thus engaged in inductive insight however if it does not succeed he should sharpen his faculties of faith etc in the nine ways stated thus The faculties become sharp in nine ways he sees only the destruction of arisen formations and in that occupation he makes sure of working carefully he makes sure of working perseveringly he makes sure of working suitably and by apprehending the sign of concentration and by balancing the enlightenment factors he establishes disregard of body and life wherein he overcomes pain by renunciation and by not stopping halfway He should avoid the seven unsuitable things in the way stated in the Description of the Earth Kasiṇa and cultivate the seven suitable things and he should comprehend the material at one time and the immaterial at anotherWhile comprehending materiality he should see how materiality is generatedthat is to say how this materiality is generated by the four causes beginning with kammaHerein when materiality is being generated in any being it is first generated from kammaFor at the actual moment of rebirth linking of a child in the womb first thirty instances of materiality are generated in the triple continuity in other words the decads of physical heartbasis body and sex And those are generated at the actual instant of the rebirthlinking consciousnesss arisingAnd as at the instant of its arising so too at the instant of its presence and at the instant of its dissolutionHerein the cessation of materiality is slow and its transformation ponderous while the cessation of consciousness is swift and its transformation quick For the lifecontinuum consciousness arises and ceases sixteen times while one material instant enduresWith consciousness the instant of arising instant of presence and instant of dissolution are equalbut with materiality only the instants of arising and dissolution are quick like those of consciousnessThe second lifecontinuum arises with the prenascent physical heart basis as its support which has already reached presence and arose at the rebirthlinking consciousnesss instant of arisingThe third lifecontinuum arises with the prenascent physical basis as its support which has already reached presence and arose together with that second lifecontinuum consciousnessThe occurrence of consciousness can be understood to happen in this way throughout lifeBut in one who is facing death sixteen consciousnesses arise with a single prenascent physical heartbasis as their support which has already reached presenceThe materiality that arose at the instant of arising of the rebirthlinking consciousness ceases along with the sixteenth consciousness after the rebirth linking consciousnessThat arisen at the instant of presence of the rebirthlinking consciousness ceases together with the instant of arising of the seventeenthThat arisen at the instant of its dissolution ceases on arriving at the instant of presence of the seventeenthAlso seventy instances of materiality occur in the same way with the sevenfold continuity beginning with the eye decad of those apparitionally bornHerein as regards kammaborn materiality the analysis should be understood thus kamma what is originated by kamma what has kamma as its condition what is originated by consciousness that has kamma as its condition what is originated by nutriment that has kamma as its condition what is originated by temperature that has kamma as its condition Herein kamma is profitable and unprofitable volitionWhat is originated by kamma is the kammaresultant aggregates and the seventy instances of materiality beginning with the eye decadWhat has kamma as its condition is the same as the last since kamma is the condition that upholds what is originated by kammaWhat is originated by consciousness that has kamma as its condition is materiality originated by kammaresultant consciousnessWhat is originated by nutriment that has kamma as its condition is so called since the nutritive essence that has reached presence in the instances of materiality originated by kamma originates a further octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth and the nutritive essence there that has reached presence also originates a further one and so it links up four or five occurrences of octadsWhat is originated by temperature that has kamma as its condition is so called since the kammaborn fire element that has reached presence originates an octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth which is temperatureoriginated and the temperature in that originates a further octadwith nutritiveessenceas eighth and so it links up four or five occurrences of octadsThis is how the generation of kammaborn materiality in the first place should be seenAlso as regards the consciousnessborn kinds the analysis should be understood thus consciousness what is originated by consciousness what has consciousness as its condition what is originated by nutriment that has consciousness as its condition what is originated by temperature that has consciousness as its conditionHerein consciousness is the eightynine kinds of consciousnessAmong these Consciousnesses thirtytwo And twentysix and nineteen tooAre reckoned to give birth to matter Postures also intimation Sixteen kinds of consciousness Are reckoned to give birth to noneAs regards the sense sphere thirtytwo consciousnesses namely the eight profitable consciousnesses  the twelve unprofitable  the ten functional excluding the mind element  and the two directknowledge consciousnesses as profitable and functional give rise to materiality to postures and to intimationThe twentysix consciousnesses namely the ten of the finematerial sphere and the eight of the immaterial sphere excluding the resultant in both cases and the eight supramundane  give rise to materiality to postures but not to intimationThe nineteen consciousnesses namely the ten lifecontinuum consciousnesses in the sense sphere  the five in the finematerial sphere  the three mind elements  and the one resultant mindconsciousness element without root cause and accompanied by joy  give rise to materiality only not to postures or to intimationThe sixteen consciousnesses namely the two sets of five consciousnesses  the rebirthlinking consciousness of all beings the death consciousness of those whose cankers are destroyed and the four immaterial resultant consciousnesses do not give rise to materiality or to postures or to intimationAnd those herein that do give rise to materiality do not do so at the instant of their presence or at the instant of their dissolution for consciousness is weak thenBut it is strong at the instant of arising Consequently it originates materiality then with the prenascent physical basis as its supportWhat is originated by consciousness is the three other immaterial aggregates and the seventeenfold materiality namely the sound ennead bodily intimation verbal intimation the space element lightness malleability wieldiness growth and continuityWhat has consciousness as its condition is the materiality of fourfold origination stated thus Postnascent states of consciousness and consciousness concomitants are a condition as postnascence condition for this prenascent body What is originated by nutriment that has consciousness as its condition the nutritive essence that has reached presence in consciousnessoriginated material instances originates a further octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth and thus links up two or three occurrences of octadsWhat is originated by temperature that has consciousness as its condition the consciousnessoriginated temperature that has reached presence originates a further octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth and thus links up two or three occurrencesThis is how the generation of consciousnessborn materiality should be seenAlso as regards the nutrimentborn kinds the analysis should be understood thus nutriment what is originated by nutriment what has nutriment as its condition what is originated by nutriment that has nutriment as its condition what is originated by temperature that has nutriment as its conditionHerein nutriment is physical nutrimentWhat is originated by nutriment is the fourteenfold materiality namely that of the octadwithnutritive essenceaseighth originated by nutritive essence that has reached presence by obtaining as its condition kammaborn materiality that is clung to and basing itself on that and space element lightness malleability wieldiness growth and continuityWhat has nutriment as its condition is the materiality of fourfold origination stated thus Physical nutriment is a condition as nutriment condition for this body What is originated by nutriment that has nutriment as its condition the nutritive essence that has reached presence in nutrimentoriginated material instances originates a further octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth and the nutritive essence in that octad originates a further octad and thus links up the occurrence of octads ten or twelve timesNutriment taken on one day sustains for as long as seven daysbut divine nutritive essence sustains for as long as one or two monthsThe nutriment taken by a mother originates materiality by pervading the body of the child in gestationAlso nutriment smeared on the body originates materialityKammaborn nutriment is a name for nutriment that is clung toThat also originates materiality when it has reached presence And the nutritive essence in it originates a further octad Thus it links up four or five occurrencesWhat is originated by temperature that has nutriment as its condition nutrimentoriginated fire element that has reached presence originates an octad withnutritiveessenceaseighth that is thus temperatureoriginatedHere this nutriment is a condition for nutrimentoriginated material instances as their progenitor It is a condition for the rest as support nutriment presence and nondisappearance This is how the generation of nutrimentborn materiality should be seenAlso as regards the temperatureborn kinds the analysis should be understood thus temperature what is originated by temperature what has temperature as its condition what is originated by temperature that has temperature as its condition what is originated by nutriment that has temperature as its conditionHerein temperature is the fire element of fourfold origination but it is twofold as hot temperature and cold temperatureWhat is originated by temperature the temperature of fourfold origination that has reached presence by obtaining a clungto condition originates materiality in the bodyThat materiality is fifteenfold namely sound ennead space element lightness malleability wieldiness growth continuityWhat has temperature as its condition is so called since temperature is a condition for the occurrence and for the destruction of materiality of fourfold originationWhat is originated by temperature that has temperature as its condition the temperatureoriginated fire element that has reached presence originates a further octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth and the temperature in that octad originates a further octad Thus temperatureoriginated materiality both goes on occurring for a long period and also maintains itself as well in what is not clung toWhat is originated by nutriment that has temperature as its condition the temperatureoriginated nutritive essence that has reached presence originates a further octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth and the nutritive essence in that originates a further one thus it links up ten or twelve occurrences of octadsHerein this temperature is a condition for temperatureoriginated material instances as their progenitor It is a condition for the rest as support presence and nondisappearance This is how the generation of temperatureborn materiality should be seenOne who sees the generation of materiality thus is said to comprehend the material at one time hence it is said Bhikkhus I see no other one thing that is so quickly transformed as the mind while the instant of its presence is long and lasts while sixteen consciousnesses arise and ceaseIt goes on occurring thus for as long as the recurrence of births continuesIt is first generated from kamma because the temperatureborn kinds etc are rooted in thatBy obtaining as its condition kammaborn materiality that is clungto by this he points out that external unclungto nutritive essence does not perform the function of nourishing materialityAnd clungto is specifically mentioned in order to rule out any question of there being a kamma born method for materiality originated by consciousness that has kamma as its condition just because it happens to be rooted in kamma There is no such methodHe said and basing itself on that meaning that its obtaining of a condition is owing to its being supported by what is kammabornWhat is intended is head hair body hair nails teeth skin callosities warts etc which are separate from the flesh in a living body otherwise a corpse and so onWhen the generation of materiality is seen its dissolution also is seen and so he said One who sees the generation of materiality thus is said to comprehend the material at one time because of the brevity of states occurrencefor it is not the seeing of mere generation that is called comprehension but there must be seeing of rise and fall besidesSo too the apprehending of generation in the other instancesAnd just as one who is comprehending the material should see the generation of the material so too one who is comprehending the immaterial should see the generation of the immaterialAnd that is through the eightyone mundane arisings of consciousnessthat is to say it is by kamma accumulated in a previous becoming that this immaterial mentality is generated And in the first place it is generated as one of the nineteen kinds of arisings of consciousness as rebirthlinking But the modes in which it is generated should be understood according to the method given in the Description of the Dependent Origination That same nineteenfold arising of consciousness is generated as lifecontinuum as well starting from the consciousness next to rebirthlinking consciousness and as death consciousness at the termination of the life spanAnd when it is of the sense sphere and the object in the six doors is a vivid one it is also generated as registrationIn the course of an existence eyeconsciousness together with its associated states supported by light and caused by attention is generated because the eye is intact and because visible data have come into focusFor it is actually when a visible datum has reached presence that it impinges on the eye at the instant of the eye sensitivitys presenceWhen it has done so the lifecontinuum arises and ceases twiceNext to arise is the functional mind element with that same object accomplishing the function of advertingNext to that eyeconsciousness which is the result of profitable or of unprofitable kamma and sees that same visible datumNext the resultant mind element which receives that same visible datumNext the resultant rootcauseless mindconsciousness element which investigates that same visible datumNext the functional mindconsciousness element without rootcause and accompanied by equanimity which determines that same visible datumNext it is generated either as one from among the profitable  unprofitable  or functional kinds of consciousness belonging to the sense sphere either as consciousness accompanied by equanimity and without rootcause  or as five or seven impulsionsNext in the case of sensesphere beings it is generated as any of the eleven kinds of registration consciousness conforming as to object with the impulsionsThe same applies to the remaining doorsBut in the case of the mind doorexalted consciousnesses also ariseThis is how the generation of the immaterial should be seen in the case of the six doorsOne who sees the generation of the immaterial thus is said to comprehend the immaterial at another time This is how one meditator accomplishes the development of understand ing progressing gradually by comprehending at one time the material and at another time the immaterial by attributing the three characteristics to themThis refers to determiningAnother comprehends formations by attributing the three characteristics to them through the medium of the material septad and the immaterial septadHerein one who comprehends them by attributing the characteristics in the following seven ways is said to comprehend by attributing through the medium of the material septad that is to say as taking up and putting down as disappearance of what grows old in each stage as arising from nutriment as arising from temperature as kammaborn as consciousnessoriginated and as natural materialityHence the Ancients said As taking up and putting down As growth and decline in every stageAs nutriment as temperature As kamma and as consciousnessAs natural materiality He sees with seven detailed insightsHerein taking up is rebirthlinkingPutting down is deathSo the meditator allots one hundred years for this taking up and putting down and he attributes the three characteristics to formationsHowAll formations between these limits are impermanentWhyBecause of the occurrence of rise and fall because of change because of temporariness and because of preclusion of permanenceBut since arisen formations have arrived at presence and when present are afflicted by ageing and on arriving at ageing are bound to dissolve they are therefore painful because of continual oppression because of being hard to bear because of being the basis of suffering and because of precluding pleasureAnd since no one has any power over arisen formations in the three instances Let them not reach presence Let those that have reached presence not age and Let those that have reached ageing not dissolve and they are void of the possibility of any power being exercised over them they are therefore notself because void because ownerless because unsusceptible to the wielding of power and because of precluding a self Having attributed the three characteristics to materiality allotted one hundred years for the taking up and putting down thus he next attributes them according to disappearance of what grows old in each stageHerein disappearance of what grows old in each stage is a name for the disappearance of the materiality that has grown old during a stage of lifeThe meaning is that he attributes the three characteristics by means of thatHowHe divides that same hundred years up into three stages that is the first stage the middle stage and the last stageHerein the first thirtythree years are called the first stageSo after dividing it up into these three stages he attributes the three characteristics thus The materiality occurring in the first stage ceased there without reaching the middle stage therefore it is impermanentAlso the materiality occurring in the middle stage ceased there without reaching the last stage therefore it is impermanent too and painful and notselfAlso there is no materiality occurring in the thirtythree years of the last stage that is capable of outlasting death therefore that is impermanent too and painful and notself This is how he attributes the three characteristics Having attributed the three characteristics according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage thus by means of the first stage etc he again attributes the three characteristics according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage by means of the following ten decades the tender decade the sport decade the beauty decade the strength decade the understanding decade the decline decade the stooping decade the bent decade the dotage decade and the prone decadeHerein as to these decades in the first place the first ten years of a person with a hundred years life are called the tender decade for then he is a tender unsteady childThe next ten years are called the sport decade for he is very fond of sport thenThe next ten years are called the beauty decade for his beauty reaches its full extent thenThe next ten years are called the strength decade for his strength and power reach their full extent thenThe next ten years are called the understanding decade for his understanding is well established by then Even in one naturally weak in understanding some understanding it seems arises at that timeThe next ten years are called the decline decade for his fondness for sport and his beauty strength and understanding decline thenThe next ten years are called the stooping decade for his figure stoops forward thenThe next ten years are called the bent decade for his figure becomes bent like the end of a plough thenThe next ten years are called the dotage decadeThe next ten years are called the prone decade for a centenarian mostly lies proneHerein in order to attribute the three characteristics according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage by means of these decades the meditator considers thus The materiality occurring in the first decade ceases there without reaching the second decade therefore it is impermanent painful notselfThe materiality occurring in the second decade  the materiality occurring in the ninth decade ceases there without reaching the tenth decadethe materiality occurring in the tenth decade ceases there without reaching the next becoming therefore it is impermanent painful notself That is how he attributes the three characteristics Having attributed the three characteristics according to disappear ance of what grows old in each stage thus by means of the decades he again attributes the three characteristics according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage by taking that same hundred years in twenty parts of five years eachHowHe considers thus The materiality occurring in the first five years ceases there without reaching the second five years therefore it is impermanent painful notselfThe materiality occurring in the second five years  in the third  in the nineteenth five years ceases there without reaching the twentieth five yearsThere is no materiality occurring in the twentieth five years that is capable of outlasting death therefore that is impermanent too painful notself Having attributed the three characteristics according to disappear ance of what grows old in each stage thus by means of the twenty parts he again attributes the three characteristics according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage by taking twentyfive parts of four years each Next by taking thirtythree parts of three years each by taking fifty parts of two years each by taking a hundred parts of one year each Next he attributes the three characteristics according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage by means of each of the three seasons taking each year in three partsHowThe materiality occurring in the four months of the rains ceases there without reaching the winter The materiality occurring in the winter ceases there without reaching the summer The materiality occurring in the summer ceases there without reaching the rains again therefore it is impermanent painful notself Having attributed them thus he again takes one year in six parts and attributes the three characteristics to this materiality according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage thus The materiality occurring in the two months of the rains ceases there without reaching the autumn The materiality occurring in the autumn  Having attributed them thus he next attributes the characteristics by means of the dark and bright halves of the moon thus The materiality occurring in the dark half of the moon ceases there without reaching the bright half Next he attributes the three characteristics by means of night and day thus The materiality occurring in the night ceases there without reaching the daythe materiality occurring in the day ceases there without reaching the night therefore it is impermanent painful notself Next he attributes the three characteristics by taking that same day in six parts beginning with the morning thus The materiality occurring in the morning ceased there without reaching the noon Having attributed them thus he again attributes the three characteristics to that same materiality by means of moving forward and moving backward looking toward and looking away bending and stretching thus The materiality occurring in the moving forward ceases there without reaching the moving backwardtherefore it is impermanent painful notself  Next he divides a single footstep into six parts as lifting up shifting forward shifting sideways lowering down placing down and fixing downHerein lifting up is raising the foot from the groundShifting forward is shifting it to the frontShifting sideways is moving the foot to one side or the other in seeing a thorn stump snake and so onLowering down is letting the foot downPlacing down is putting the foot on the groundFixing down is pressing the foot on the ground while the other foot is being lifted upHerein in the lifting up two elements the earth element and the water element are subordinate and sluggish while the other two are predominant and strongLikewise in the shifting forward and shifting sidewaysIn the lowering down two elements the fire element and the air element are subordinate and sluggish while the other two are predominant and strongLikewise in the placing down and fixing downHe attributes the three characteristics to materiality according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage by means of these six parts into which he has thus divided itHowHe considers thus The elements and the kinds of derived materiality occurring in the lifting up all ceased there without reaching the shifting forward therefore they are impermanent painful notselfLikewise those occurring in the shifting forward  the shifting sidewaysthose occurring in the shifting sideways  the lowering downWhen he sees formations stage by stage with insight thus his comprehension of materiality has become subtleHere is a simile for its subtletyA border dweller it seems who was familiar with torches of wood and grass etc but had never seen a lamp before came to a city Seeing a lamp burning in the market he asked a man I say what is that lovely thing calledWhat is lovely about that It is called a lamp Where it goes to when its oil and wick are used up no one knowsAnother told him That is crudely put for the flame in each third portion of the wick as it gradually burns up ceases there without reaching the other partsHerein the meditators attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by the hundred years as taking up and putting down is like the mans knowledge stated thus Where it goes when its oil and wick are used up no one knows Having in various ways thus attributed the three characteristics to materiality according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage he analyzes that same materiality and divides it into four portions as arising from nutriment etc and he again attributes the three characteristics to each portionHerein materiality arising from nutriment becomes evident to him through hunger and its satisfactionFor materiality that is originated when one is hungry is parched and stale and it is as ugly and disfigured as a parched stump as a crow perching in a charcoal pitThat originated when hunger is satisfied is plump fresh tender smooth and soft to touchDiscerning thatThat arising from temperature becomes evident through cool and heatFor materiality that is originated when it is hot is parched stale and uglyMateriality originated by cool temperature is plump fresh tender smooth and soft to touchDiscerning that The materiality occurring when it is hot ceases there without reaching the time when it is coolThe materiality occurring when it is cool ceases there without reaching the time when it is hot therefore it is impermanent painful notself he attributes the three characteristics to it thus  The kammaborn becomes evident through the sense doors that is the base of consciousnessFor in the case of the eye door there are thirty material instances with decads of the eye the body and sex but with the twentyfour instances originated by temperature consciousness and nutriment that is to say three bare octads which are their support there are fiftyfourLikewise in the case of the doors of the ear nose and tongueIn the case of the body door there are fortyfour with the decads of body and sex and the instances originated by temperature and so onIn the case of the mind door there are fiftyfour too with the decads of the heartbasis the body and sex and those instances originated by the temperature and so onDiscerning all that materiality he attributes the three characteristics to it thus The materiality occurring in the eye door ceases there without reaching the ear door The consciousnessoriginated becomes evident through the behaviour of one who is joyful or grieved For the materiality arisen at the time when he is joyful is smooth tender fresh and soft to touchThat arisen at the time when he is grieved is parched stale and uglyDiscerning that he attributes the three characteristics to it thus The materiality occurring at the time when one is joyful ceases there without reaching the time when one is grievedthe materiality occurring at the time when one is grieved ceases there without reaching the time when one is joyful therefore it is impermanent painful notselfWhen he discerns consciousnessoriginated materiality and attributes the three characteristics to it in this way this meaning becomes evident to himLife person pleasure pain just these aloneJoin in one conscious moment that flicks byGods though they live for fourandeighty thousandEons are not the same for two such momentsCeased of those dead or aliveaggregates Are all alike gone never to returnAnd those that break up meanwhile and in futureHave traits no different from those ceased beforeNo world is born if consciousness is not Produced when that is present then it livesWhen consciousness dissolves the world is dead The highest sense this concept will allowNo store of broken states no future stockThose born balance like seeds on needle pointsBreakup of states is foredoomed at their birthThose present decay unmingled with those pastThey come from nowhere break up nowhere goHaving attributed the three characteristics to that arising from nutriment etc he again attributes the three characteristics to natural materialityNatural materiality is a name for external materiality that is not bound up with faculties and arises along with the eon of world expansion for example iron copper tin lead gold silver pearl gem beryl conch shell marble coral ruby opal soil stone rock grass tree creeper and so on That becomes evident to him by means of an asokatree shootFor that to begin with is pale pink then in two or three days it becomes dense red again in two or three days it becomes dull red next brown the colour of a tender mango shoot next the colour of a growing shoot next the colour of pale leavesnext the colour of dark green leavesDiscerning that he attributes the three characteristics to it thus The materiality occurring when it is pale pink ceases there without reaching the time when it is dense redthe materiality occurring when it is the colour of dark green leaves  the time when it is withered foliageThis is how firstly he comprehends formations by attributing the three characteristics to them by means of the material septadthe next thirtyfour years are called the middle stageand the next thirtythree years are called the last stagewhat is impermanent is painfulwhat is painful is notselffor he is doting then and forgets what he doesin the spring the materiality occurring in the summer ceases there without reaching the rains again therefore it is impermanent too painful notselfin the cool in the winter the materiality occurring in the bright half ceases there without reaching the dark half therefore it is impermanent painful notselfthe materiality occurring in the noon  without reaching the eveningthe materiality occurring in the evening  the first watchthe materiality occurring in the first watch  the middle watchthe materiality occurring in the middle watch ceased there without reaching the last watchthe materiality occurring in the last watch ceased there without reaching the morning again therefore it is impermanent painful not selfthe materiality occurring in the bending ceases there without reaching the stretchingthe materiality occurring in the looking away  the bendingthe materiality occurring in the moving backward  the looking towardthe materiality occurring in the looking toward  the looking awaytherefore they are impermanent painful notselfthus formations keep breaking up like crackling sesame seeds put into a hot pan wherever they arise there they cease stage by stage section by section term by term each without reaching the next partthose occurring in the lowering down  the placing downthose occurring in the placing down cease there without reaching the fixing downOther told him That is crudely put too for the flame in each inch in each halfinch in each thread in each strand will cease without reaching the other strandsbut the flame cannot appear without a strandThe meditators attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by means of each part namely moving forward etc and lifting up etc is like the mans knowledge stated thus The flame in each strand will cease without reaching the othersThe meditators attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by means of the dark and bright halves of the moon by means of night and day and by means of morning etc taking one night and day in six parts is like the mans knowledge stated thus The flame in each thread will cease without reaching the othersThe meditators attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by the fourmonth and twomonth periods by classing the year as threefold and sixfold respectively according to the seasons is like the mans knowledge stated thus The flame in each halfinch will cease without reaching the othersThe meditators attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by the periods of ten five four three two years one year is like the mans knowledge stated thus The flame in each inch will cease without reaching the othersThe meditators attribution of the three characteristics according to disappearance of what grows old in each stage to the materiality delimited by the third part of the hundred years is like the mans knowledge stated thus The flame in each third portion of the wick ceases without reaching the other partsThe materiality occurring when hunger is satisfied ceases there without reaching the time when one is hungry therefore it is impermanent painful notself he attributes the three characteristics to it thus the materiality occurring in the ear door  the nose doorthe materiality occurring in the nose door  the tongue doorthe materiality occurring in the tongue door  the body doorthe materiality occurring in the body door ceases there without reaching the mind door therefore it is impermanent painful notselfFlash in and out as lightning in the skyAfter it has become the colour of dark green leaves as it follows out the successive stages of such material continuity it eventually becomes withered foliage and at the end of the year it breaks loose from its stem and falls offthe materiality occurring when it is dense red  dull redthe materiality occurring when it is dull red  the colour of a tender mango shootthe materiality occurring when it is the colour of a tender mango shoot  the colour of a growing shootthe materiality occurring when it is the colour of a growing shoot  the colour of pale green leavesthe materiality occurring when it is the colour of pale green leaves  the colour of dark green leavesthe materiality occurring when it is withered foliage ceases there without reaching the time when it breaks loose from its stem and falls off therefore it is impermanent painful notself He comprehends all natural materiality in this wayNo one not even the Blessed One has such masteryfor it is impossible for anyone to alter the three characteristicsThe province of supernormal power is simply the alteration of a stateBecause of precluding a self means because of precluding the self conceived by those outside the Dispensationfor the nonexistence in dhammas of any self as conceived by outsiders is stated by the words because void but by this expression it is stated that there is no self because there is no such individual essenceListen and attend closely to what I shall sayBhikkhus what is the character of an untrue manThe headings of what was called above the immaterial septad are these by groups by pairs by moments by series by removal of false view by abolition of conceit by ending of attachmentHerein by groups means the states belonging to the contact pentadHere he comprehends by groups means that a bhikkhu considers thus The states belonging to the contact pentad arising in the comprehending of head hairs as impermanent painful notself the states belonging to the contact pentad arising in the comprehending of body hairs as  in the contemplation of brain as impermanent painful notselfall these states disintegrate section by section term by term like crackling sesame seeds put into a hot pan each without reaching the next therefore they are impermanent painful notselfThis firstly is the method according to the Discourse on PurificationAccording to the Discourse on the Noble Ones Heritages however he is said to comprehend by groups when by means of a subsequent consciousness he comprehends as impermanent painful notself that consciousness which occurred comprehending materiality as impermanent painful notself in the seven instances of the material septad given aboveAs this method is more suitable we shall therefore confine ourselves to it in explaining the rest By pairs after the bhikkhu has comprehended as impermanent painful notself the materiality of the taking up and putting down  he comprehends that consciousness with which he was comprehending the materiality too as impermanent painful notself by means of a subsequent consciousnessAfter he has comprehended as impermanent painful notself the materiality of the disappearance of what grows old in each stage and that arising from nutriment arising from temperature kammaborn consciousnessoriginated and natural he comprehends that consciousness too as impermanent painful notself by means of a subsequent consciousnessIn this way he is said to comprehend by pairs By moments after the bhikkhu has comprehended as impermanent pain ful notself the materiality of the taking up and putting down he comprehends that first consciousness with which he was comprehending the materiality as impermanent painful notself by means of a second consciousness and that second consciousness by means of a third and the third by means of a fourth and the fourth by means of a fifth and that too he comprehends as impermanent painful notselfBy series after he has comprehended as impermanent painful not self the materiality of the taking up and putting down he comprehends that first consciousness as impermanent painful notself by means of a second consciousness and the second by means of a third and the third by means of a fourth  and the tenth by means of an eleventh and that too he comprehends as impermanent painful notselfBut both the material meditation subject and the immaterial meditation subject become familiar when the comprehending is taken as far as the tenth consciousnessThat is why it is said that it can be stopped at the tenthIt is when he comprehends in this way that he is said to comprehend by seriesBy removal of false view  by abolition of conceit  by ending of attachment there is no individual method for any of these threeBut when he has discerned this materiality as described above and this immateriality as described here then he sees that there is no living being over and above the material and the immaterialAs soon as he no longer sees a being the perception of a being is removedWhen he discerns formations with consciousness from which perception of a being has been removed then false view does not arise in himWhen false view does not arise in him then false view is said to be removedWhen he discerns formations with consciousness from which false view has been removed then conceit does not arise in himWhen conceit does not arise conceit is said to be abolishedWhen he discerns formations with consciousness from which conceit has been abolished then craving does not arise in himWhen craving does not arise in him attachment is said to be ended This firstly is what is said in the Discourse on PurificationBut in the Discourse on the Noble Ones Heritages after setting forth the headings thus As removal of false view as abolition of conceit as ending of attachment the following method is set forthThere is no abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus I see thoroughly with insight I see well with insightThere is no ending of attachment in one who is pleased with insight thus I am able to see with insightThere is removal of false view in one who sees thus If formations were self it would be right to take them as self but being notself they are taken as self Therefore they are notself in the sense of no power being exercisable over them they are impermanent in the sense of nonexistence after having come to be they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fallThere is abolition of conceit in one who sees thus If formations were permanent it would be right to take them as permanent but being impermanent they are taken as permanent Therefore they are impermanent in the sense of nonexistence after having come to be they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall they are notself in the sense of no power being exercisable over themThere is ending of attachment in one who sees thus If formations were pleasant it would be right to take them as pleasant but being painful they are taken as pleasant Therefore they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall they are impermanent in the sense of nonexistence after having come to be they are notself in the sense of no power being exercisable over themthere comes to be the abolishing of conceit in one who sees them as impermanentSo this insight is valid in each instanceThis is how he comprehends formations by attributing the three characteristics to them by means of the immaterial septadAt this stage both the material meditation subject and the immaterial meditation subject have become familiar to himHaving thus become familiar with the material and immaterial meditation subjects and so having penetrated here already a part of those eighteen principal insights which are later on to be attained in all their aspects by means of full understanding as abandoning starting with contemplation of dissolution he consequently abandons things opposed to what he has already penetratedEighteen principal insights is a term for understanding that consists in the kinds of insight beginning with contemplation of impermanenceNow as regards these One who develops the contemplation of impermanence abandons the perception of permanence one who develops the contemplation of pain abandons the perception of pleasure one who develops the contemplation of notself abandons the perception of self one who develops the contemplation of dispassion abandons delighting one who develops the contemplation of fading away abandons greed one who develops the contemplation of cessation abandons origination one who develops the contemplation of relinquishment abandons grasping one who develops the contemplation of destruction abandons the perception of compactness one who develops the contemplation of fall of formations abandons accumulation of kamma one who develops the contemplation of change abandons the perception of lastingness one who develops the contemplation of the signless abandons the sign one who develops the contemplation of the desireless abandons desire one who develops the contemplation of voidness abandons misinterpreting  one who develops the insight into states that is higher understanding abandons misinterpreting due to grasping at a core one who develops correct knowledge and vision abandons misinterpreting due to confusion one who develops the contemplation of danger abandons misinterpreting due to reliance one who develops the contemplation of reflection abandons nonreflection one who develops the contemplation of turning away abandons misinterpreting due to bondage Now the meditator has seen formations by means of the three characteristics beginning with impermanence and so he has therefore already penetrated among these eighteen insights the contemplations of impermanence pain and notselfAnd then the contemplation of impermanence and the contemplation of the signless are one in meaning and different only in the letterConsequently these have been penetrated by him as wellBut insight into states that is higher understanding is all kinds of insightConsequently these two have been penetrated by him as wellAs to the remaining kinds of insight some have been penetrated and some not We shall deal with them belowFor it was with reference only to what has already been penetrated that it was said above having thus become familiar with the material and immaterial meditation subjects and so having penetrated here already a part of those eighteen principal insights which are later on to be attained in all their aspects by means of full understanding as abandoning starting with contemplation of dissolutionHowAfter he has comprehended as impermanent painful notself the materiality of disappearance of what grows old in each stage and that aris ing from nutriment arising from temperature kammaborn conscious nessoriginated and natural he comprehends that first consciousness as im permanent painful notself by means of a second consciousness and that second consciousness by means of a third and the third by means of a fourth and the fourth by means of a fifth and that too he comprehends as impermanent painful notselfComprehending thus four consciousnesses from each discerning of materiality he is said to comprehend by momentsAfter he has comprehended as impermanent painful notself the materiality of the disappearance of what grows old in each stage and that arising from nutriment arising from temperature kammaborn consciousnessoriginated and natural he comprehends that consciousness as impermanent painful notself by means of a second consciousness and the second by means of a third  and the tenth by means of an eleventh and that too he comprehends as impermanent painful notself It would be possible to go on comprehending it in this way with serial insight even for a whole dayThere is no removal of false view in one who takes it thus I see with insight my insightthere is removal of false view in one who takes it thus Only formations see formations with insight comprehend define discern and delimit themthere is abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus Only formations see formations with insight comprehend define discern and delimit themthere is ending of attachment in one who takes it thus Only formations see formations with insight comprehend define discern and delimit themThus there comes to be the removal of false view in one who sees formations as notselfthere comes to be the ending of attachment in one who sees them as painfuland so are the contemplation of pain and the contemplation of the desirelessand so are the contemplation of notself and the contemplation of voidness and correct knowledge and vision is included in purification by overcoming doubt he consequently abandons things opposed to what he has already penetrated Contemplation of destruction is the contemplation of the momentary dissolution of formationsPerception of compactness is the assumption of unity in a continuity or mass or function or objectContemplation of destruction is contemplation of non existence after having been they sayContemplation of destruction is the understanding by means of which he resolves the compact into its elements and sees that it is impermanent in the sense of destructionIts completion starts with contemplation of dissolution and so there is abandoning of perception of compactness then but before that there is not because it has not been completedSeeing change in the two ways through aging and through death in what is born or seeing another essence subsequent to the delimitation of such and such an essence supervening in what was discerned by means of the material septad and so on is contemplation of change by its means he abandons the perception of lastingness the assumption of stabilityhis consciousness does not incline with craving to the occurrence of that aggregateprocess of existence for the purpose of which one accumulates kammaThe seeing of the dissolution of formations both by actual experience and by inference and the directing of attention to their cessation in other words their dissolution is contemplation of fall through it accumulation of kamma is abandoned The three beginning with contemplation of the signless are the same as the three beginning with contemplation of impermanencefor owing to it the mind retreats and recoils from all formations like a water drop on a lotus leaf so by its means he abandons the misinterpretation due to bondage which is the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense desire and so onEquanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are contemplation of turning awayThe knowledge of reflection that is the means to deliverance from formations is contemplation of reflection by its means he abandons the ignorance that is nonreflection on impermanence etc and is opposed to reflection on themThe knowledge consisting in the seeing of danger in all kinds of becomings etc which has arisen owing to the appearance of terror is contemplation of danger by its means he abandons the craving occurring as misinterpreting due to reliance because he does not see any reliance or supportby its means he abandons the misinterpreting due to confusion that begins thus Was I in the past and that begins thus Thus the world is created by an Overlord Correct knowledge and vision is a term for the seeing of mentalitymateriality with its conditionsInsight that occurs by knowing an object consisting of a visible datum etc and by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that visible datum etc as its object and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution thus Only formations dissolve there is nothing beyond the death of formations is the higher understanding and that is insight into states thus it is insight into states that is higher understanding by its means he abandons the view accompanied by craving that is the misinterpretation occurring as grasping at a permanent core and so onIt is owing to their opposing the sign etc that the contemplations of impermanence etc are called by the names of signless etc so they should be regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign etc just as they are to the perception of permanence and so onMisinterpreting is misinterpreting as selfDesire is longing for pleasure or it is desire consisting in greed and so on it means inclinationto formations owing to cravingThe sign is the mere appearance of formations as if graspable entities which is due to the individualization of particular functions and which owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass is assumed to be temporarily enduring or permanentSaid in the Discourse on the Noble Ones HeritagesNow when he is a beginner of insight with this tender insight ten imperfections of insight arise in himFor imperfections of insight do not arise either in a noble disciple who has reached penetration of the truths or in persons erring in virtue neglectful of their meditation subject and idlersThey arise only in a clansman who keeps to the right course devotes himself continuously to his meditation subject and is a beginner of insightBut what are these ten imperfectionsThey are illumination knowledge rapturous happiness tranquillity bliss  resolution exertion assurance equanimity and attachmentFor this is saidWhen a man is bringing formations to mind as impermanent illumination arises in him He adverts to the illumination thus Illumination is a Noble Ones state The distraction due to that is agitationWhen his mind is seized by that agitation he does not understand correctly their appearance as impermanenthe does not understand correctly their appearance as painful he does not understand correctly their appearance as notselfLikewise when he is bringing formations to mind as impermanent knowledge arises in him  happiness  tranquillity  bliss  resolution  exertion  establishment  equanimity  attachment arises in him He adverts to the attachment thus Attachment is a Noble Ones state The distraction due to that is agitationhe does not correctly understand their appearance as painful he does not correctly understand their appearance as notself  Herein illumination is illumination due to insightWhen he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition the course of his insight is interruptedHe drops his own basic meditation subject and sits just enjoying the illuminationBut this illumination arises in one bhikkhu illuminating only as much as the seat he is sitting onBut in the Blessed One it arose illuminating the tenthousandfold worldelementThis story illustrates how it varies Two elders it seems were sitting inside a room with a double wall at CittalapabbataIt was the Uposatha of the dark of the moon that day All directions were covered by a blanket of cloud and at night the fourfactored gloom prevailedThen one elder said Venerable sir the flowers of the five colours on the lion table on the shrine terrace are visible to me nowThe other said What you say is nothing wonderful friend Actually the fishes and turtles in the ocean a league away are visible to me nowThis imperfection of insight usually arises in one who has acquired serenity and insightBecause the defilements suppressed by the attainments do not manifest themselves he thinks I am an Arahant like the Elder MahāNāga who lived at Uccavālika like the Elder MahāDatta who lived at Haṅkana like the Elder Cūḷa Sumana who lived in the Nikapenna meditation house at CittalapabbataHere is one story as an illustration The Elder Dhammadinna it seems who lived at Talaṅgaraone of the great ones with cankers destroyed who possessed the categories of discriminationwas the instructor of a large community of bhikkhusOne day as he was sitting in his own daytime quarters he wondered Has our teacher the Elder MahāNāga who lives at Uccavālika brought his work of asceticism to its conclusion or not  He saw that he was still an ordinary man and he knew that if he did not go to him he would die an ordinary man He rose up into the air with supernormal power and alighted near the elder who was sitting in his daytime quarters He paid homage to him doing his duty and sat down at one sideTo the question Why have you come unexpectedly friend Dhammadinna he replied I have come to ask a question venerable sirHe was told Ask friend If we know we shall say He asked a thousand questionsThe elder replied without hesitation to each questionTo the remark Your knowledge is very keen venerable sir when was this state attained by you he replied Sixty years ago friendDo you practice concentration venerable sir That is not difficult friendThen make an elephant venerable sirNow venerable sir make that elephant come straight at you with his ears outstretched his tail extended putting his trunk in his mouth and making a horrible trumpeting The elder did soSeeing the frightful aspect of the rapidly approaching elephant he sprang up and made to run awayThen the elder with cankers destroyed put out his hand and catching him by the hem of his robe he said Venerable sir is there any timidity in one whose cankers are destroyed Then he recognized that he was still an ordinary man He knelt at Dhammadinnas feet and said Help me friend DhammadinnaVenerable sir I will help you that is why I came Do not worry Then he expounded a meditation subject to himThe elder took the meditation subject and went up on to the walk and with the third footstep he reached ArahantshipThe elder was a bhikkhu of hating temperament it seems Knowledge is knowledge due to insightAs he is estimating and judging material and immaterial states perhaps knowledge that is unerring keen incisive and very sharp arises in him like a lightning flashRapturous happiness is happiness due to insightPerhaps at that time the five kinds of happiness namely minor happiness momentary happiness showering happiness uplifting happiness and pervading happiness arise in him filling his whole bodyTranquillity is tranquillity due to insightAs he is sitting at that time in his night or day quarters perhaps there is no fatigue or heaviness or rigidity or unwieldiness or sickness or crookedness in his body and his mind but rather his body and mind are tranquillized light malleable wieldy quite sharp and straightWith his body and mind aided by this tranquillity etc he experiences at that time the superhuman delightwith reference to which it is saidA bhikkhu when his mind is quiet Retires to an empty placeAnd his right insight in the Dhamma Gives him superhuman delightIt is because he comprehends The rise and fall of aggregatesThat he finds happiness and joy And knows it to be deathless This is how tranquillity associated with lightness etc arises in him bringing about this superhuman delightBliss is bliss due to insightAt that time perhaps there arises in him exceedingly refined bliss flooding his whole bodyResolution is faithFor strong faith arises in him in association with insight in the form of extreme confidence of consciousness and its concomitants Exertion is energyFor wellexerted energy neither too lax nor too strained arises in him in association with insight Assurance is mindfulnessFor wellestablished  wellfounded mindfulness which is dug in and as immovable as the king of mountains arises in him in association with insightWhatever subject he adverts to consciously reacts to gives attention to reviews appears to him owing to mindfulness which descends into it enters into it just as the other world does to one who has the divine eye Equanimity is both equanimity about insight and equanimity in advertingIt is also equanimity in adverting in the mind doorFor whatever the subject he adverts to his adverting works as incisively and sharply as a lightning flash like a redhot spear plunged into a basket of leavesAttachment is attachment due to insightFor when his insight is adorned with illumination etc attachment arises in him which is subtle and peaceful in aspect and it relies on that insightAnd as in the case of illumination so too in the case of the other imperfections that may arise the meditator thinks thus Such knowledge  such rapturous happiness  tranquillity  bliss  resolution  exertion  assurance  equanimity  attachment never arose in me before I have surely reached the path reached fruition Thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruitionWhen he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition the course of his insight is interruptedHe drops his basic meditation subject and sits just enjoying the attachmentAnd here illumination etc are called imperfections because they are the basis for imperfection not because they are kammically unprofitableBut attachment is both an imperfection and the basis for imperfectionAs basis only they amount to tenbut with the different ways of taking them they come to thirtyHowWhen a man takes it thus illumination has arisen in me his way of taking is due to false view When he takes it thus How agreeable this illumination that has arisen is his way of taking is due to pride  When he relishes the illumination his way of taking is due to craving So there are three ways of taking it in the case of illumination that is to say due to false view to pride  and to cravingLikewise with the rest So they come to thirty with the three ways of taking themOwing to their influence an unskilful unwary meditator wavers and gets distracted about illumination etcHence the Ancients saidHe wavers about illumination And knowledge rapturous happinessAbout the tranquilness the bliss Whereby his mind becomes confusedHe wavers about resolution Exertion and assurance tooThe advertingequanimity And equanimity and attachment How does the mind come to be seized by agitation about higher statesWhen his mind is seized by that agitation he does not correctly understand their appearance as impermanentWhen it arises the meditator thinks Such illumination never arose in me before I have surely reached the path reached fruition thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruitionin another the interior of his roomin another the exterior of his roomin another the whole monastery  a quarter league  a half league  a league  two leagues  three leagues in another bhikkhu it arises making a single light from the earths surface up to the BrahmāworldThe elder made an elephant all whiteSuch bhikkhus waver on account of illuminationFor equanimity about insight which is neutrality about formations arises strongly in him at that timeand he is not able to discern that attachment as a defilementand he sees each one of themillumination and the restas This is mine this is I this is my self Equanimity about insight is neutrality in the investigation of formations owing to the objective field having been already investigatedBut in meaning when it occurs thus it is only neutralityThe volition associated with minddoor adverting is called equanimity in adverting because it occurs in adverting as onlooking Illumination due to insight is the luminous materiality originated by insight consciousness and that originated by temperature belonging to his own continuityOf these that originated by insight consciousness is bright and is found only in the meditators body The other kind is independent of his body and spreads all round over what is capable of being experienced by knowledge It becomes manifest to him too and he sees anything material in the place touched by itHe adverts to it as Nibbāna or as the path or as fruitionThe agitation the distraction that occurs about whether or not the illumination etc are noble states is agitation about higher statesFriends any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who declares the attainment of Arahantship in my presence has always arrived there by four paths or by one of themWhat fourHere friends a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity While he is developing insight preceded by serenity the path is born in him He cultivates develops repeats that pathAs he does so his fetters are abandoned and his inherent tendencies are brought to an endAgain friends a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insight  He develops serenity and insight yoked equallyAgain friends a bhikkhus mind is seized by agitation about highest states When that consciousness settles down internally becomes steady unified and concentrated then the path is born in him  his inherent tendencies are brought to an endBut when illumination etc arise a skilful wary meditator who is endowed with discretion either defines and examines it with understanding thus This illumination has arisen But it is impermanent formed conditionally arisen subject to destruction subject to fall subject to fading away subject to cessationTherefore it is notself in the sense of no power being exercisable over it it is impermanent in the sense of nonexistence after having come to be it is painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall all of which should be treated in detail according to the method given under the immaterial septad And as in the case of illumination so too with the restHaving investigated it thus he sees the illumination as This is not mine this is not I this is not my selfHence the Ancients saidSo when a man of understanding has Examined these ten things and is now skilledIn agitation about higher states He no more falls a prey to wavering So he unravels this thirtyfold skein of imperfections without falling a prey to wavering The states consisting in illumination etc are not the pathbut it is insight knowledge that is free from imperfections and keeps to its course that is the path He defines what is the path and what is not the path thus The knowledge that is established in him by his coming to know the path and the notpath thus This is the path this is not the path should he understood as the purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the pathSo at this point the defining of three truths has been effected by himHowThe defining of the truth of suffering has been effected with the defining of mentalitymateriality in the purification of viewThe defining of the truth of origination has been effected with the discerning of conditions in the purification by overcoming doubtThe defining of the truth of the path has been effected with the emphasizing of the right path in this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path So the defining of three truths has been effected firstly by means of mundane knowledge onlyin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Understandingcalled The Description of Purification by Knowledge and Vision of What Is the Path and What is Not the PathOr he thinks If illumination were self it would be right to take it as selfbut being notself it is taken as selfHe sees knowledge   attachment as This is not mine this is not I this is not my selfSeeing thus he does not waver or vacillate about the illumination and so onThe twentieth chapterNow insight reaches its culmination with the eight knowledges and knowledge in conformity with truth is ninth these are what is called purification by knowledge and vision of the wayThe eight should be understood as follows knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall which is insight free from imperfections and steady on its course knowledge of contemplation of dissolution knowledge of appearance as terror knowledge of contemplation of danger knowledge of contemplation of dispassion knowledge of desire for deliverance knowledge of contemplation of reflection and knowledge of equanimity about formationsKnowledge in conformity with truth as ninth is a term for conformitySo one who wants to perfect this should make these kinds of knowledge his task starting with knowledge of rise and fall free from imperfectionsBut why does he again pursue knowledge of rise and fallTo observe the three characteristicsThe knowledge of rise and fall already dealt with being disabled by the ten imperfections was not capable of observing the three characteristics in their true natureSo he should pursue it again here in order to observe the characteristicsNow the characteristics fail to become apparent when something is not given attention and so something conceals them What is thatFirstly the characteristic of impermanence does not become apparent because when rise and fall are not given attention it is concealed by continuityThe characteristic of pain does not become apparent because when continuous oppression is not given attention it is concealed by the posturesThe characteristic of notself does not become apparent because when resolution into the various elements is not given attention it is concealed by compactnessHowever when continuity is disrupted by discerning rise and fall the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent in its true natureWhen the postures are exposed by attention to continuous oppression the characteristic of pain becomes apparent in its true natureWhen the resolution of the compact is effected by resolution into elements the characteristic of not self becomes apparent in its true natureAnd here the following differences should be understood the impermanent and the characteristic of impermanence the painful and the characteristic of pain the notself and the characteristic of notselfHerein the five aggregates are impermanentWhyBecause they rise and fall and change or because of their nonexistence after having beenRise and fall and change are the characteristic of impermanence or mode alteration in other words nonexistence after having been is the characteristic of impermanenceThose same five aggregates are painful because of the words What is impermanent is painful WhyBecause of continuous oppression The mode of being continuously oppressed is the characteristic of painThose same five aggregates are notself because of the words What is painful is notself WhyBecause there is no exercising of power over them The mode of insusceptibility to the exercise of power is the characteristic of not selfThe meditator observes all this in its true nature with the knowledge of the contemplation of rise and fall in other words with insight free from imperfections and steady on its coursebut once freed from imperfections it is able to do soHe calls conformity knowledge knowledge in conformity with truth because it is suitable for penetrating the truths owing to the disappearance of the grosser darkness of delusion that conceals the truthsKnowledge of rise and fall that has become familiar should be understood as belonging to fullunderstanding as abandoningThe contemplation of only the dissolution of formations is contemplation of dissolution that same contemplation as knowledge is knowledge of contemplation of dissolutionOne who owing to it sees things as they are is terrified thus it is terror The knowledge that seizes the terrifying aspect of states of the three planes when they appear as terrifying is knowledge of appearance as terrorOne desires to be delivered thus it is one desiring deliverance that is either as a consciousness or as a person His state is desire for deliverance That itself as knowledge is knowledge of desire for deliveranceKnowledge that occurs in the mode of reflecting again is knowledge of contemplation of reflectionKnowledge that occurs as looking on at formations with indifference is knowledge of equanimity about formationsWhen continuity is disrupted means when continuity is exposed by observing the perpetual otherness of states as they go on occurring in successionFor it is not through the connectedness of states that the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent to one who rightly observes rise and fall but rather the characteristic becomes more thoroughly evident through their disconnectedness as if they were iron dartsFor when material and immaterial states have arisen mutually steadying each other mentality and materiality for example then owing to misinterpreting that as a unity compactness of mass is assumed through failure to subject formations to pressure And likewise compactness of function is assumed when although definite differences exist in such and such states functions they are taken as one And likewise compactness of object is assumed when although differences exist in the ways in which states that take objects make them their objects those objects are taken as one But when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the hand They are mere states occurring due to conditions and void In this way the characteristic of notself becomes more evidentWhen the postures are exposed means when the concealment of the pain that is actually inherent in the postures is exposedFor when pain arises in a posture the next posture adopted removes the pain as it were concealing it But once it is correctly known how the pain in any posture is shifted by substituting another posture for that one then the concealment of the pain that is in them is exposed because it has become evident that formations are being incessantly overwhelmed by painResolution of the compact is effected by resolving what appears compact in this way The earth element is one the water element is another etc distinguishing each one and in this way Contact is one feeling is another etc distinguishing each oneWhen the resolution of the compact is effected means that what is compact as a mass and what is compact as a function or as an object has been analyzedHaving been it is not therefore it is impermanentit is impermanent for four reasons that is in the sense of the state of rise and fall of change of temporariness and of denying permanence It is painful on account of the mode of oppressionit is painful for four reasons that is in the sense of burning of being hard to bear of being the basis for pain and of opposing pleasure It is notself on account of the mode of insusceptibility to the exercise of power it is notself for four reasons that is in the sense of voidness of having no ownermaster of having no Overlord and of opposing selfAs when a saucer falls and breaks impermanence is obviousbut unless there is the arising of a Buddha the characteristic of notself is not made knownWhether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise the characteristics of impermanence and pain are made knownthe characteristic of notself is not obvious pain is obviousAs when a boil appears in the bodyThese modes that is the three characteristics are not included in the aggregates because they are states without individual essence and they are not separate from the aggregates because they are unapprehendable without the aggregatesBut they should be understood as appropriate conceptual differences that are reason for differentiation in the explaining of dangers in the five aggregates and which are allowable by common usage in respect of the five aggregatesWhen he repeatedly observes in this way and examines and investigates material and immaterial states to see that they are impermanent painful and notself then if his knowledge works keenly formations quickly become apparent Once his knowledge works keenly and formations quickly become apparent he no longer extends his mindfulness to their arising or presence or occurrence or signbut brings it to bear only on their cessation as destruction fall and breakupWhen insight knowledge has arisen in him in this way so that he sees how the field of formations having arisen thus ceases thus it is called contemplation of dissolution at that stagewith reference to which it is saidUnderstanding of contemplation of dissolution after reflecting on an object how is this knowledge of insightConsciousness with materiality as its object arises and dissolves Having reflected on that object he contemplates the dissolution of that consciousnessHe contemplates how does he contemplateHe contemplates as impermanent not as permanent he contemplates as painful not as pleasant he contemplates as notself not as self he becomes dispassionate he does not delight he causes fading away of greed he does not inflame it he causes cessation not origination he relinquishes he does not graspContemplating as impermanent he abandons the perception of permanenceContemplating as painful he abandons the perception of pleasure Contemplating as notself he abandons the perception of self Becoming dispassionate he abandons delight Causing fading away he abandons greed Causing cessation he abandons originating Relinquishing he abandons graspingConsciousness with feeling as its object  Consciousness with perception as its object  with formations as its object  with consciousness as its object  with eye as its object   with ageinganddeath as its object  Relinquishing he abandons graspingThe substitution of the object The transference of understandingThe power of advertingthese Are insight following reflectionDefining both to be alike By inference from that same objectIntentness on cessationthese Are insight in the mark of fallHaving reflected on the object Dissolution he contemplatesAppearance then as emptythis Is insight of higher understandingSkilled in the three contemplations And in the fourfold insight tooSkilled in the three appearances The various views will shake him notKnowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding in the sense of the act of understanding that Hence it was said Understanding of contemplating dissolution after reflecting on an object is knowledge of insight Herein after reflecting on an object is having reflected on having known any object the meaning is having seen it as liable to destruction and fallUnderstanding of the contemplation of dissolution any understanding of the contemplation of the dissolution of the knowledge arisen after reflecting on the object as liable to destruction and fall is called knowledge of insightHow has the meaning of a question showing desire to expoundNext in order to show how that comes about consciousness with materiality as its object etc is saidHerein consciousness with materiality as its object arises and dissolves rūpārammaṇaṃ cittaṃ uppajjitvā bhijjati is the equivalent of rūpārammaṇaṃ cittaṃ uppajjitvā bhijjatiHaving reflected on that object having reflected on having known that object consisting of materiality the meaning is having seen it as liable to destruction and fallHe contemplates the dissolution of that consciousness by means of a subsequent consciousness he contemplates the dissolution of that consciousness with which that object consisting of materiality was seen as liable to destruction and fallHence the Ancients said He sees with insight both the known and the knowledgeHe contemplates  he sees always accordingly  the meaning is he sees again and again in various modesHence it is said He contemplates how does he contemplateHe contemplates as impermanent and so onHerein dissolution is the culminating point of impermanence and so the meditator contemplating dissolution contemplates the whole field of formations as impermanent not as permanentThen because of the painfulness of what is impermanent and because of the nonexistence of self in what is painful he contemplates that same whole field of formations as painful not as pleasantBut what is impermanent painful notself is not something to delight inWhen he does not inflame greed thus he causes cessation of greed not its origination which happens firstly by means of mundane knowledgeOr alternatively having thus caused the fading away of greed and caused the cessation of the seen field of formations he causes the cessation of the unseen too by means of inferential knowledge he does not originate itHe gives attention only to its cessationProgressing in this way he relinquishes he does not graspWhat is meantWhat is meant is that this contemplation of impermanence etc is also called both relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into because by substitution of opposite qualities it gives up defilements along with aggregate producing kammaformations and because by seeing the unsatisfactoriness of what is formed it also enters into by inclining towards Nibbāna which is the opposite of the formedTherefore the bhikkhu who possesses that contemplation gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way statedHence it was said he relinquishes he does not graspNow in order to show which states are abandoned by these three kinds of knowledge contemplating as impermanent he abandons the perception of permanence etc is saidHerein delight is craving accompanied by happinessThe rest is as already statedAs to the stanzas the substitution of the object means that after seeing the dissolution of materiality there is the substitution of another object for that first object by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness by which the dissolution of materiality was seenTransference of understanding is the abandoning of rise and the specializing in fallThe power of adverting is the ability after seeing the dissolution of materiality to advert immediately for the purpose of seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that dissolution as its objectAre insight following reflection this is called contemplation of dissolution after reflecting on an objectDefining both to be alike by inference from that same object the meaning is that by inference by induction from the object seen by actual experience he defines both the seen and the unseen to have a single individual essence thus The field of formations dissolved in the past and will break up in the future just as it does in the presentAnd this is said by the AncientsWith vision of those present purifiedHe infers those past and future to be alikeHe infers that all formations disappearLike dewdrops when the morning sun comes upor the meaning is rūpārammaṇabhāve cittaṃ uppajjitvā bhijjati alternative grammatical substitutionhe contemplates it as notself not as selfand what is not something to delight in is not something to arouse greed forconsequently when that field of formations is seen as impermanent painful notself in accordance with the contemplation of dissolution then he becomes dispassionate he does not delighthe causes fading away of greed he does not inflame itthe meaning is he does not cause originationhe sees only its cessation not its origin is the meaninghe does not grasp defilements by causing rebirth nor does he grasp a formed object through failing to see its unsatisfactorinessIntentness on cessation after thus giving to both a single definition based on their dissolution he thus becomes intent on cessation in other words on that same dissolution The meaning is that he attaches importance to it inclines tends leans towards itAre insight in the mark of fall what is meant is that this is called insight into the characteristic of fallHaving reflected on the object having first known the object consisting of materiality and so onDissolution he contemplates having seen the dissolution of that object he contemplates the dissolution of the consciousness that had that as its objectAppearance then as empty while he is contemplating dissolution in this way he succeeds in making formations appear as void thus Only formations breakup their breakup is death there is nothing else at allHence the Ancients saidAggregates cease and nothing else existsBreakup of aggregates is known as deathHe watches their destruction steadfastlyAs one who with a diamond drills a gem Is insight of higher understanding what is meant is that the reflection on the object the contemplation of dissolution and the appearance as void are called insight of higher understandingSkilled in the three contemplations a bhikkhu who is competent in the three beginning with contemplation of impermanenceAnd in the fourfold insight too in the four kinds of insight beginning with dispassionSkilled in the three appearances and owing to skill in this threefold appearance namely as liable to destruction and fall as terror and as voidThe various views will shake him not he does not vacillate on account of the various kinds of views such as the eternity viewWhen he no longer vacillates and so constantly bears in mind that the unceased will also cease the undissolved will also dissolve then he disregards the arising presence occurrence and sign of all formations which keep on breaking up like fragile pottery being smashed like fine dust being dispersed like sesame seeds being roasted and he sees only their breakupJust as a man with eyes standing on the bank of a pond or on the bank of a river during heavy rain would see large bubbles appearing on the surface of the water and breaking up as soon as they appeared so too he sees how formations break up all the timeThe Blessed One said of such a meditatorAnd he who looks upon the world As one who looks upon a bubbleAs one who looks upon a mirage Is out of sight of Death the King When he constantly sees that all formations thus break up all the time then contemplation of dissolution grows strong in himbringing eight advantages which are these abandoning of false view of becoming giving up attachment to life constant application a purified livelihood no more anxiety absence of fear acquisition of patience and gentleness and conquest of aversion and sensual delightHence the Ancients saidOn seeing these eight perfect qualitiesHe comprehends formations constantlylike the sage with burning turbanSeeing breakup in order to attain The Deathless Knowledge of contemplation of dissolution is endedThe keenness of knowledge comes about owing to familiarity with developmentAnd when it is familiar development occurs as though it were absorbed in the object owing to the absence of distractionArising is the alteration consisting in generationthe appearance of formations like graspable entities which is due to compactness of mass etc and to individualization of function is the sign of formationsThe sign is the sign of formationsOccurrence is the occurrence of what is clung toPresence is the arrival at presence ageing is what is meantHe contemplates as impermanent here not by inferential knowledge thus Impermanent in the sense of dissolution like one who is comprehending formations by groups  nor by seeing fall preceded by apprehension of rise like a beginner of insight  but rather it is after rise and fall have become apparent as actual experience through the influence of knowledge of rise and fall that he then leaves rise aside in the way stated and contemplates formations as impermanent by seeing only their dissolution But when he sees them thus there is no trace in him of any apprehension of them as permanentCauses cessation he causes greed to reach the cessation of suppression he suppresses it is the meaningThat is why he said by means of mundane knowledgeAnd since there is suppression how can there be arousing Therefore he said not its originationHere in this world there is no self that is something other than and apart from the aggregatesAs a skilled man drilling a gem with a tool watches and keeps in mind only the hole he is drilling not the gems colour etc so too the meditator wisely keeps in mind only the ceaseless dissolution of formations not the formationsThe three appearances in the threefold appearance as impermanent and so onFor appearance as destruction and fall is appearance as impermanent appearance as terror is appearance as pain and appearance as void is appearance as notselfAs he repeats develops and cultivates in this way the contemplation of dissolution the object of which is cessation consisting in the destruction fall and breakup of all formations then formations classed according to all kinds of becoming generation destiny station or abode of beings appear to him in the form of a great terror as lions tigers leopards bears hyenas spirits ogres fierce bulls savage dogs rutmaddened wild elephants hideous venomous serpents thunderbolts charnel grounds battlefields flaming coal pits etc appear to a timid man who wants to live in peaceWhen he sees how past formations have ceased present ones are ceasing and those to be generated in the future will cease in just the same way then what is called knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at that stageHere is a simile a womans three sons had offended against the king it seems The king ordered their heads to be cut offShe went with her sons to the place of their executionWhen they had cut off the eldest ones head they set about cutting off the middle ones headSeeing the eldest ones head already cut off and the middle ones head being cut off she gave up hope for the youngest thinking He too will fare like themNow the meditators seeing the cessation of past formations is like the womans seeing the eldest sons head cut off His seeing the cessation of those present is like her seeing the middle ones head being cut off His seeing the cessation of those in the future thinking Formations to be generated in the future will cease too is like her giving up hope for the youngest son thinking He too will fare like themWhen he sees in this way knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at that stageAlso another simile a woman with an infected womb had it seems given birth to ten childrenOf these nine had already died and one was dying in her hands There was another in her wombSeeing that nine were dead and the tenth was dying she gave up hope about the one in her womb thinking It too will fare just like themHerein the meditators seeing the cessation of past formations is like the womans remembering the death of the nine children The meditators seeing the cessation of those present is like her seeing the moribund state of the one in her hands His seeing the cessation of those in the future is like her giving up hope about the one in her wombWhen he sees in this way knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at that stageBut does the knowledge of appearance as terror itself fear or does it not fearIt does not fearFor it is simply the mere judgment that past formations have ceased present ones are ceasing and future ones will ceaseJust as a man with eyes looking at three charcoal pits at a city gate is not himself afraid since he only forms the mere judgment that all who fall into them will suffer no little painor just as when a man with eyes looks at three spikes set in a row an acacia spike an iron spike and a gold spike he is not himself afraid since he only forms the mere judgment that all who fall on these spikes will suffer no little painso too the knowledge of appearance as terror does not itself fear it only forms the mere judgment that in the three kinds of becoming which resemble the three charcoal pits and the three spikes past formations have ceased present ones are ceasing and future ones will ceaseHere is the text about its appearance to him as terrorWhen he brings to mind as painful what appears to him as terrorWhen he brings to mind as notself what appears to him as terrorWhen he brings to mind as impermanent the sign appears to him as terrorWhen he brings to mind as painful occurrence appears to him as terrorWhen he brings to mind as notself the sign and occurrence appear to him as terror Herein the sign is the sign of formationsThis is a term for past future and present formations themselvesHe sees only the death of formations when he brings them to mind as impermanent and so the sign appears to him as a terrorOccurrence is occurrence in material and immaterial becomingHe sees occurrencethough ordinarily reckoned as pleasureonly as a state of being continuously oppressed when he brings them to mind as painful and so occurrence appears to him as a terrorHe sees both the sign and the occurrence as empty vain void without power or guide like an empty village a mirage a goblin city etc when he brings them to mind as notselfKnowledge of appearance as terror is endedBut it is called appearance as terror only because formations in all kinds of becoming generation destiny station or abode are fearful in being bound for destruction and so they appear only as a terrorWhen he brings to mind as impermanent what appears to him as terrorand so the sign and occurrence appear to him as a terrorAs he repeats develops and cultivates the knowledge of appearance as terror he finds no asylum no shelter no place to go to no refuge in any kind of becoming generation destiny station or abodeIn all the kinds of becoming generation destiny station and abode there is not a single formation that he can place his hopes in or hold on toThe three kinds of becoming appear like charcoal pits full of glowing coals the four primary elements like hideous venomous snakes  the five aggregates like murderers with raised weapons  the six internal bases like an empty village the six external bases like villageraiding robbers  the seven stations of consciousness and the nine abodes of beings as though burning blazing and glowing with the eleven fires  and all formations appear as a huge mass of dangers destitute of satisfaction or substance like a tumour a disease a dart a calamity an affliction HowThey appear as a forest thicket of seemingly pleasant aspect but infested with wild beasts a cave full of tigers water haunted by monsters and ogres an enemy with raised sword poisoned food a road beset by robbers a burning coal a battlefield between contending armies appear to a timid man who wants to live in peaceAnd just as that man is frightened and horrified and his hair stands up when he comes upon a thicket infested by wild beasts etc and he sees it as nothing but danger so too when all formations have appeared as a terror by contemplation of dissolution this meditator sees them as utterly destitute of any core or any satisfaction and as nothing but dangerHow is it that understanding of appearance as terror is knowledge of danger Understanding of appearance as terror thus Arising is terror is knowledge of dangerUnderstanding of appearance as terror thus Occurrence is terror  The sign is terror  Accumulation is terror  Rebirthlinking is terror  Destiny is terror  Generation is terror  Rearising is terror  Birth is terror  Ageing is terror  Sickness is terror  Death is terror  Sorrow is terror  Understanding of appearance as terror thus Lamentation is terror is knowledge of danger Understanding of appearance as terror thus Despair is terror is knowledge of danger Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nonarising is safetyKnowledge of the state of peace is this Nonoccurrence is safety   Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nondespair is safety Knowledge of the state of peace is this Arising is terror nonarising is safetyKnowledge of the state of peace is this Occurrence is terror non occurrence is safety   Knowledge of the state of peace is this Despair is terror nondespair is safety Understanding of appearance as terror thus Arising is suffering is knowledge of dangerUnderstanding of appearance as terror thus Occurrence is suffering   Despair is suffering is knowledge of danger Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nonoccurrence is bliss  Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nondespair is bliss Knowledge of the state of peace is this Arising is suffering non arising is blissKnowledge of the state of peace is this Occurrence is suffering nonoccurrence is bliss   Knowledge of the state of peace is this Despair is suffering nondespair is bliss Understanding of appearance as terror thus Arising is worldly is knowledge of dangerUnderstanding of appearance as thus Occurrence is worldly   Despair is worldly is knowledge of danger Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nonarising is unworldlyKnowledge of the state of peace is this Nonoccurrence is unworldly   Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nondespair is unworldly Knowledge of the state of peace is this Arising is worldly nonarising is unworldlyKnowledge of the state of peace is this Occurrence is worldly nonoccurrence is unworldly   Knowledge of the state of peace is this Despair is worldly nondespair is unworldly Understanding of appearance as terror thus Arising is formations is knowledge of dangerUnderstanding of appearance as terror thus Occurrence is formations   Despair is formations is knowledge of danger Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nonarising is Nibbāna Knowledge of the state of peace is this Arising is formations non arising is NibbānaKnowledge of the state of peace is this Occurrence is formations nonoccurrence is Nibbāna   Knowledge of the state of peace is this Despair is formations nondespair is NibbānaHe contemplates as suffering Arising occurrence and the signAccumulation rebirthlinking And this his knowledge is of dangerHe contemplates as bliss no arising And no occurrence and no signNo accumulation no rebirthlinking And this his knowledge is of peaceThis knowledge about danger has Five sources for its originKnowledge of peace has also five Ten knowledges he understandsWhen skilled in these two kinds of knowledge The various views will shake him notKnowledge is in the sense of that being knownHence it was said Understanding of appearance as terror is knowledge of danger Herein arising is appearance here in this becoming with previous kamma as conditionOccurrence is the occurrence of what has arisen in this wayThe sign is the sign of all formationsAccumulation is the kamma that is the cause of future rebirthlinkingRebirthlinking is future appearanceDestiny is the destiny in which the rebirthlinking takes placeGeneration is the generating of aggregatesRearising is the occurrence of kammaresult stated thus In one who has attained to it or in one who has been reborn in it Birth is birth with becoming as its condition itself a condition for ageing and so onAgeing sickness death etc are obviousAnd here only the five beginning with arising are mentioned as actual objects of knowledge of dangerFor the pair generation and birth are synonyms both for arising and for rebirthlinkingThe pair destiny and rearising are synonyms for occurrenceAgeing etc are synonyms for the signHence it was saidHe contemplates as suffering Arising occurrence and the signAccumulation rebirthlinking And this his knowledge is of dangerAnd This knowledge about danger has Five sources for its origin Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nonarising is safety etc this however should be understood as said for the purpose of showing the opposite kind of knowledge to knowledge of dangerOr when it is stated in this way that there is safety without terror and free from danger it is for the purpose of comforting those who are upset in their hearts by seeing danger through appearance as terrorOr else when arising etc have clearly appeared to a man as terror his mind inclines towards their opposites and so this is said for the purpose of showing the advantages in the knowledge of danger established by the appearance as terrorAnd here what is terror is certainly sufferingand what is suffering is purely worldly since it is not free from the worldliness of the rounds of becoming of the world and of defilementsand what is worldly consists solely of formationsTherefore it is said that understanding of appearance as terror thus Arising is suffering is knowledge of danger and so onAnd while this is so still there is a difference to be understood here in the way these things beginning with arising occur since there is a difference in their mode with the mode of terror the mode of suffering and the mode of worldlinessTen knowledges he understands one who understands knowledge of danger understands penetrates realizes ten kinds of knowledge that is the five based on arising etc and the five on nonarising and so onWhen skilled in these two kinds of knowledge with skill in the two that is knowledge of danger and knowledge of the state of peaceThe various views will shake him not he does not vacillate about views that occur such as The ultimate Nibbāna is here and nowKnowledge of contemplation of danger is endedKnowledge of the state of peace is this Nonoccurrence is Nibbāna   Knowledge of the state of peace is this Nondespair is Nibbānaand understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding thatthe rest are synonyms for themThe rest is clearWorldliness of the round is that of the threefold round of past future and present becomingworldliness of the world is the five cords of sense desire because they are accessible to defilementsworldliness of defilement is the defilements themselvesWhen he sees all formations in this way as danger he becomes dispassionate towards is dissatisfied with takes no delight in the manifold field of formations belonging to any kind of becoming destiny station of consciousness or abode of beingsJust as a golden swan that loves the foothills of Citta Peak finds delight not in a filthy puddle at the gate of a village of outcastes but only in the seven great lakes  so too this meditator swan finds delight not in the manifold formations seen clearly as dangerAnd just as the lion king of beasts finds delight not when put into a gold cage but only in Himalaya with its three thousand leagues extent so too the meditator lion finds delight not in the triple becoming of the happy destiny but only in the three contemplationsAnd just as Chaddanta king of elephants all white with sevenfold stance possessed of supernormal power who travels through the air finds pleasure not in the midst of a town but only in the Chaddanta Lake and Wood in the Himalaya so too this meditator elephant finds delight not in any formation but only in the state of peace seen in the way beginning Nonarising is safety and his mind tends inclines and leans towards thatKnowledge of contemplation of dispassion is endedKnowledge of contemplation of danger is the same as the last two kinds of knowledge in meaningHence the Ancients saidit aroused the appearance of danger in those same formations thus the name contemplation of danger arosebut only in the seven contemplations because he delights in developmentKnowledge of appearance as terror while one only has three names It saw all formations as terror thus the name appearance as terror aroseit arose becoming dispassionate towards those same formations thus the name contemplation of dispassion aroseAlso it is said in the text Understanding of appearance as terror knowledge of danger and dispassion these things are one in meaning only the letter is different When owing to this knowledge of dispassion this clansman becomes dispassionate towards is dissatisfied with takes no delight in any single one of all the manifold formations in any kind of becoming generation destiny station of consciousness or abode of beings his mind no longer sticks fast cleaves fastens on to them and he becomes desirous of being delivered from the whole field of formations and escaping from itLike whatJust as a fish in a net a frog in a snakes jaws a jungle fowl shut into a cage a deer fallen into the clutches of a strong snare a snake in the hands of a snake charmer an elephant stuck fast in a great bog a royal nāga in the mouth of a supaṇṇa the moon inside Rāhus mouth a man encircled by enemies etc just as these are desirous of being delivered of finding an escape from these things so too this meditators mind is desirous of being delivered from the whole field of formations and escaping from itThen when he thus no longer relies on any formations and is desirous of being delivered from the whole field of formations knowledge of desire for deliverance arises in himKnowledge of desire for deliverance is endedBeing thus desirous of deliverance from all the manifold formations in any kind of becoming generation destiny station or abode in order to be delivered from the whole field of formations he again discerns those same formations attributing to them the three characteristics by knowledge of contemplation of reflectionHe sees all formations as impermanent for the following reasons because they are noncontinuous temporary limited by rise and fall disintegrating fickle perishable unenduring subject to change coreless due to be annihilated formed subject to death and so onHe sees them as painful for the following reasons because they are continuously oppressed hard to bear the basis of pain a disease a tumour a dart a calamity an affliction a plague a disaster a terror a menace no protection no shelter no refuge a danger the root of calamity murderous subject to cankers Māras bait subject to birth subject to ageing subject to illness subject to sorrow subject to lamentation subject to despair subject to defilement and so onHe sees all formations as foul the ancillary characteristic to that of painfor the following reasons because they are objectionable stinking disgusting repulsive unaffected by disguise hideous loathsome and so onHe sees all formations as notself for the following reasons because they are alien empty vain void ownerless with no Overlord with none to wield power over them and so onIt is when he sees formations in this way that he is said to discern them by attributing to them the three characteristicsBut why does he discern them in this wayIn order to contrive the means to deliveranceHere is a simile a man thought to catch a fish it seems so he took a fishing net and cast it in the water He put his hand into the mouth of the net under the water and seized a snake by the neck He was glad thinking I have caught a fishIn the belief that he had caught a big fish he lifted it up to see When he saw three marks he perceived that it was a snake and he was terrified He saw danger felt dispassion for what he had seized and desired to be delivered from it Contriving a means to deliverance he unwrapped the coils from his hand starting from the tip of its tail Then he raised his arm and when he had weakened the snake by swinging it two or three times round his head he flung it away crying Go foul snake Then quickly scrambling up on to dry land he stood looking back whence he had come thinking Goodness I have been delivered from the jaws of a huge snake Herein the time when the meditator was glad at the outset to have acquired a person is like the time when the man was glad to have seized the snake by the neck This meditators seeing the three characteristics in formations after effecting resolution of the compact into elements is like the mans seeing the three marks on pulling the snakes head out of the mouth of the net The meditators knowledge of appearance as terror is like the time when the man was frightenedKnowledge of contemplation of danger is like the mans thereupon seeing the danger Knowledge of contemplation of dispassion is like the mans dispassion for what he had seizedKnowledge of desire for deliverance is like the mans deliverance from the snake The attribution of the three characteristics to formations by knowledge of contemplation of reflection is like the mans contriving a means to deliveranceFor just as the man weakened the snake by swinging it keeping it away and rendering it incapable of biting and was thus quite delivered so too this meditator weakens formations by swinging them with the attribution of the three characteristics rendering them incapable of appearing again in the modes of permanence pleasure beauty and self and is thus quite deliveredThat is why it was said above that he discerns them in this way in order to contrive the means to deliveranceAt this point knowledge of reflection has arisen in himWhen he brings to mind as painful When he brings to mind as impermanent there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on the signWhen he brings to mind as painful there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on occurrenceWhen he brings to mind as notself there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on the sign and occurrence As here after reflecting on the sign means having known the sign of formations by means of the characteristic of impermanence as unlasting and temporaryOf course it is not that first having known subsequently knowledge arises but it is expressed in this way according to common usage as in the passage beginning Due to mind and mental object mindconsciousness arises  and so onOr alternatively it can be understood as expressed thus according to the method of identity by identifying the preceding with the subsequentThe meaning of the remaining two expressions that is occurrence and the sign and occurrence should be understood in the same wayKnowledge of contemplation of reflection is endedwith reference to which it is saidWhen he brings to mind as impermanent there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on whatas notself there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on whatHaving thus discerned by knowledge of contemplation of reflection that All formations are void  he again discerns voidness in the double logical relation thus This is void of self or of what belongs to self When he has thus seen that there is neither a self nor any other thing or being occupying the position of a self s property he again discerns voidness in the quadruple logical relation as set forth in this passage I am not anywhere anyones owning nor is there anywhere my owning in anyone   This meditator thinking I  not anywhere  does not see a self anywhereThis is how he discerns voidness in the quadruple logical relationHaving discerned voidness in the quadruple logical relation in this way he discerns voidness again in six modesHowEye is void of self or of the property of a self or of permanence or of lastingness or of eternalness or of nonsubjectness to change  mind visible data  mental data Having discerned voidness in the six modes in this way he discerns it again in eight modesFeeling  perception  formations  consciousness  eye   ageinganddeath has no core is coreless without a core as far as concerns any core of permanence or core of lastingness or core of pleasure or core of self or as far as concerns what is permanent or what is lasting or what is eternal or what is not subject to changeJust as a reed has no core is coreless without corejust as a castoroil plant an udumbara tree a setavaccha tree a pāḷibhaddaka tree a lump of froth a bubble on water a mirage a plantain trunk a conjuring trick has no core is coreless without core so too materiality   ageinganddeath has no core  or what is subject to change  Nidd II  Having discerned voidness in eight modes in this way he discerns it again in ten modes How He sees materiality as emptyas vain as notself as having no Overlord as incapable of being made into what one wants as incapable of being had as one wishes as insusceptible to the exercise of mastery as alien as secluded from past and futureHe sees feeling   consciousness as empty  as secluded Having discerned voidness in ten modes in this way he discerns it again in twelve modesthat is to say Materiality is no living being no soul no human being no man no female no male no self no property of a selfFeeling   consciousness  not anyones  Nidd II  Having discerned voidness in twelve modes in this way he discerns it again in fortytwo modes through fullunderstanding as investigating He sees materiality as impermanent as painful as a disease a tumour a dart a calamity an affliction as alien as disintegrating a plague a disaster a terror a menace as fickle perishable unenduring as no protection no shelter no refuge as unfit to be a refuge as empty vain void notself as without satisfaction as a danger as subject to change as having no core as the root of calamity as murderous as due to be annihilated as subject to cankers as formed as Māras bait as subject to birth subject to ageing subject to illness subject to death subject to sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair as arising as departing as danger as escapeHe sees feeling   consciousness  as escape And this is said too When he sees materiality as impermanent  as escape he looks upon the world as voidWhen he sees feeling   consciousness as impermanent  as escape he looks upon the world as voidLet him look on the world as void Thus Mogharāja always mindfulHe may escape the clutch of death By giving up belief in selfFor King Death cannot see the man That looks in this way on the worldWhen he has discerned formations by attributing the three characteristics to them and seeing them as void in this way he abandons both terror and delight he becomes indifferent to them and neutral he neither takes them as I nor as mine he is like a man who has divorced his wifeSuppose a man were married to a lovely desirable charming wife and so deeply in love with her as to be unable to bear separation from her for a moment He would be disturbed and displeased to see her standing or sitting or talking or laughing with another man and would be very unhappyand thereafter even though he saw her doing whatever it might be with whomsoever it might be he would not be disturbed or displeased but would on the contrary be indifferent and neutralSo too this meditator wanting to get free from all formations discerns formations by the contemplation of reflection then seeing nothing to be taken as I or mine he abandons both terror and delight and becomes indifferent and neutral towards all formationsWhen he knows and sees thus his heart retreats retracts and recoils from the three kinds of becoming the four kinds of generation the five kinds of destiny the seven stations of consciousness and the nine abodes of beings his heart no longer goes out to them Either equanimity or repulsiveness is establishedJust as water drops retreat retract and recoil on a lotus leaf that slopes a little and do not spread out so too his heart  And just as a fowls feather or a shred of sinew thrown on a fire retreats retracts and recoils and does not spread out so too his heart retreats retracts and recoils from the three kinds of becoming  Either equanimity or repulsiveness is establishedIn this way there arises in him what is called knowledge of equanimity about formationsBut if this knowledge sees Nibbāna the state of peace as peaceful it rejects the occurrence of all formations and enters only into NibbānaIf it does not see Nibbāna as peaceful it occurs again and again with formations as its object like the sailors crowWhen traders board a ship it seems they take with them what is called a landfinding crow When the ship gets blown off its course by gales and goes adrift with no land in sight then they release the landfinding crowIt takes off from the masthead and after exploring all the quarters if it sees land it flies straight in the direction of itif not it returns and alights on the mastheadSo too if knowledge of equanimity about formations sees Nibbāna the state of peace as peaceful it rejects the occurrence of all formations and enters only into NibbānaIf it does not see it it occurs again and again with formations as its objectas though sifting flour on the edge of a trayAnd in so doing this insight knowledge enters upon the state of the triple gateway to liberation and it becomes a condition for the classification of noble persons into seven kindsIt enters upon the state of the triple gateway to liberation now with the predominance of one of three faculties according as the contemplation occurs in one of the three waysFor it is the three contemplations that are called the three gateways to liberationBut these three gateways to liberation lead to the outlet from the world that is to say to the seeing of all formations as limited and circumscribed and to the entering of consciousness into the signless element to the stirring up of the mind with respect to all formations and to the entering of consciousness into the desireless element to the seeing of all things as alien and to the entering of consciousness into the voidness element These three gateways to liberation lead to the outlet from the world Herein as limited and circumscribed means both as limited by rise and fall and as circumscribed by themTo the seeing  as alien to contemplating them as not self thus Not I Not mineSo these three clauses should be understood to express the contemplations of impermanence and so onHence in the answer to the next question asked in the Paṭisambhidā it is said When he brings them to mind as impermanent formations appear as liable to destructionWhen he brings them to mind as painful formations appear as a terrorWhen he brings them to mind as notself formations appear as void What are the liberations to which these contemplations are the gatewaysThey are these three namely the signless the desireless and the voidFor this is said When one who has great resolution brings formations to mind as impermanent he acquires the signless liberationWhen one who has great tranquillity brings them to mind as painful he acquires the desireless liberationWhen one who has great wisdom brings them to mind as notself he acquires the void liberation And here the signless liberation should be understood as the noble path that has occurred by making Nibbāna its object through the signless aspectIn the same way the path that has occurred by making Nibbāna its object through the desireless aspect is desirelessAnd the path that has occurred by making Nibbāna its object through the void aspect is voidBut it is said in the Abhidhamma On the occasion when he develops the supramundane jhāna that is an outlet and leads to dispersal having abandoned the field of false views with the reaching of the first grade secluded from sense desires he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna which is desireless  is void thus mentioning only two liberations This refers to the way in which insight arrives at the path and is expressed literallyHowever in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge is expressed as follows Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting them as permanentknowledge of contemplation of pain is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting them as pleasant Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign of formations as permanent Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the desireless liberation since it liberates from desire for formations as permanentBut although stated in this way insight knowledge is not literally signless because there is no abandoning of the sign of formations as formed here as distinct from their sign as impermanent and so onIt is however literally void and desirelessAnd it is at the moment of the noble path that the liberation is distinguished and that is done according to insight knowledges way of arrival at the pathThat it should be understood is why only two liberations are stated in the Abhidhamma namely the desireless and the voidThis firstly is the treatise on the liberations hereIt was said above It becomes a condition for the classification of noble persons into seven kinds Herein there are firstly these seven kinds of noble person the faith devotee one liberated by faith the body witness the bothways liberated the Dhamma devotee one attained to vision and one liberated by understanding This knowledge of equanimity about formations is a condition for their being placed as these seven classesWhen a man brings formations to mind as impermanent and having great resolution acquires the faith faculty he becomes a faith devotee at the moment of the streamentry pathand in the other seven instances that is in the three higher paths and the four fruitions he becomes one liberated by faithWhen a man brings them to mind as painful and having great tranquillity acquires the faculty of concentration he is called a body witness in all eight instancesHe is called bothways liberated when he has reached the highest fruition after also reaching the immaterial jhānasWhen a man brings them to mind as notself and having great wisdom acquires the faculty of understanding he becomes a Dhamma devotee at the moment of the streamentry pathThis is saidWith the faith faculty in excess he acquires the streamentry path Hence he is called a faith devotee Likewise When he brings formations to mind as impermanent the faith faculty is in excess in him With the faith faculty in excess the fruition of stream entry is realized Hence he is called one liberated by faith It is said furtherAt the moment of the first path he has been liberated by having faith  thus he is one liberated by faithhe first experiences the experience of jhāna and afterwards realizes cessation Nibbāna thus he is a body witnessAs to the remaining four however the word meaning should be understood thus he follows faith thus he is a faith devotee  or he follows he goes by means of faith thus he is a faith devoteeLikewise he follows the Dhamma called understanding or he follows by means of the Dhamma thus he is a Dhamma devoteeHe is liberated in both ways by immaterial jhāna and the noble path thus he is bothways liberatedUnderstanding he is liberated thus he is one liberated by understandingHence the Ancients said This knowledge of equanimity about formations is one only and has three names At the outset it has the name of knowledge of desire for deliverance In the middle it has the name knowledge of reflection At the end when it has reached its culmination it is called knowledge of equanimity about formationsHow is it that understanding of desire for deliverance of reflection and of composure is knowledge of the kinds of equanimity about formationsUnderstanding of desire for deliverance of reflection and composure occupied with arising is knowledge of equanimity about formationsSo in the first stage it is desire to give up the desire to be delivered from arising etc in one who has become dispassionate by knowledge of dispassion that is desire for deliveranceIt is reflection in the middle stage for the purpose of finding a means to deliverance that is reflectionIt is equanimous onlooking in the end stage on being delivered that is composureIt is said with reference to this Arising is formations he looks with equanimity on those formations thus it is equanimity about formations  and so onSo this is only one kind of knowledgeFurthermore it may be understood that this is so from the following textNow when this clansman has reached equanimity about formations thus his insight has reached its culmination and leads to emergenceInsight that has reached culmination or insight leading to emergence are names for the three kinds of knowledge beginning with equanimity about formations that is equanimity about formations conformity and changeoflineageIt has reached its culmination because it has reached the culminating final stageIt is called leading to emergence because it goes towards emergenceThe path is called emergence because it emerges externally from the objective basis interpreted as a sign and also internally from occurrence of defilement It goes to that thus it leads to emergence the meaning is that it joins with the pathHerein for the purpose of clarification there is this list of the kinds of emergence classed according to the manner of interpreting after interpreting the internal it emerges from the internal after interpreting the internal it emerges from the external after interpreting the external it emerges from the external after interpreting the external it emerges from the internal after interpreting the material it emerges from the material after interpreting the material it emerges from the immaterial after interpreting the immaterial it emerges from the immaterial after interpreting the immaterial it emerges from the material it emerges at one stroke from the five aggregates after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the impermanent after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the painful after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the notself after interpreting as painful it emerges from the painful after interpreting as painful it emerges from the impermanent after interpreting as painful it emerges from the notself after interpreting as notself it emerges from the notself after interpreting as notself it emerges from the impermanent after interpreting as notself it emerges from the painfulHowHere someone does his interpreting at the start with his own internal formations After interpreting them he sees themBut emergence of the path does not come about through seeing the bare internal only since the external must be seen too so he sees that anothers aggregates as well as unclungto formations inanimate things are impermanent painful notselfAt one time he comprehends the internal and at another time the externalAs he does so insight joins with the path while he is comprehending the internalIt is said of him that after interpreting the internal it emerges from the internalSimilarly in the case of after interpreting the external it emerges from the external and from the internalAnother does his interpreting at the start with materiality When he has done that he sees the materiality of the primaries and the materiality derived from them all togetherBut emergence does not come about through the seeing of bare materiality only since the immaterial must be seen tooAt one time he comprehends the material and at another the immaterialAs he does so insight joins with the path while he is comprehending materiality It is said of him that after interpreting the material it emerges from the materialBut if his insight joins with the path at the time when he is comprehending the immaterial it is said of him that after interpreting the material it emerges from the immaterialWhen he has done his interpreting in this way All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation  and so too at the time of emergence it is said that it emerges at one stroke from the five aggregatesOne man comprehends formations as impermanent at the startBut emergence does not come about through mere comprehending as impermanent since there must be comprehension of them as painful and notself too so he comprehends them as painful and notselfAs he does so emergence comes about while he is comprehending them as impermanent It is said of him that after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the impermanent But if emergence comes about in him while he is comprehending them as painful  as notself then it is said that after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the painful  from the notselfAnd whether they have interpreted at the start as impermanent or as painful or as notself when the time of emergence comes if the emergence takes place while contemplating as impermanentIf the emergence is from the painful then the three persons acquire the faculty of concentration since they have great tranquillity they are liberated by the desireless liberation and in all eight states they are body witnessesOf them the one who has an immaterial jhāna as the basis for his insight is in the case of the highest fruition bothways liberatedAnd then if the emergence takes place while contemplating as notself the three persons acquire the faculty of understanding since they have great wisdom they are liberated by the void liberation They become Dhamma devotees at the moment of the first path In the next six instances they become attained to vision In the case of the highest fruit they are liberated by understandingNow twelve similes should be understood in order to explain this insight leading to emergence and the kinds of knowledge that precede and follow itHere is the listThe fruit bat the black snake and the house The oxen and the ghoul the childHunger and thirst and cold and heat And darkness and by poison tooA pause can be made to bring in these similes anywhere among the kinds of knowledge from appearance as terror onwardsBut if they are brought in here then all becomes clear from appearance as terror up to fruition knowledge which is why it was said that they should be brought in here The Fruit Bat There was a fruit bat it seems She had alighted on a honey tree with five branches thinking I shall find flowers or fruits here She investigated one branch but saw no flowers or fruits there worth takingAnd as with the first so too she tried the second the third the fourthShe thought This tree is barren there is nothing worth taking here so she lost interest in the tree She climbed up on a straight branch and poking her head through a gap in the foliage she looked upwards flew up into the air and alighted on another treeHerein the meditator should be regarded as like the fruit bat The five aggregates as objects of clinging are like the honey tree with the five branches The meditators interpreting of the five aggregates is like the fruit bats alighting on the tree His comprehending the materiality aggregate and seeing nothing there worth taking comprehending the remaining aggregates is like her trying each branch and seeing nothing there worth taking trying the rest His triple knowledge beginning with desire for deliverance after he has become dispassionate towards the five aggregates through seeing their characteristic of impermanence etc is like her thinking This tree is barren there is nothing worth taking here and losing interest His conformity knowledge is like her climbing up the straight branch His changeof lineage knowledge is like her poking her head out and looking upwards His path knowledge is like her flying up into the air His fruition knowledge is like her alighting on a different treeThe Black Snake This simile has already been given But the application of the simile here is this Changeoflineage knowledge is like throwing the snake away Path knowledge is like the mans standing and looking back whence he had come after getting free from it Fruition knowledge is like his standing in a place free from fear after he had got away This is the differenceThe House The owner of a house it seems ate his meal in the evening climbed into his bed and fell asleep The house caught fire When he woke up and saw the fire he was frightened He thought It would be good if I could get out without getting burnt Looking round he saw a way Getting out he quickly went away to a safe place and stayed thereHerein the foolish ordinary mans taking the five aggregates as I and mine is like the houseowners falling asleep after he had eaten and climbed into bedKnowledge of appearance as terror after entering upon the right way and seeing the three characteristics is like the time when the man was frightened on waking up and seeing the fire Knowledge of desire for deliverance is like the mans looking for a way out Conformity knowledge is like the mans seeing the way Changeoflineage is like the mans going away quickly Fruition knowledge is like his staying in a safe placeThe Oxen One night it seems while a farmer was sleeping his oxen broke out of their stable and escaped When he went there at dawn and looked in he found that they had escaped Going to find them he saw the kings oxenHe thought that they were his and drove them back When it got light he recognized that they were not his but the kings oxen He was frightened Thinking I shall escape before the kings men seize me for a thief and bring me to ruin and destruction he abandoned the oxen Escaping quickly he stopped in a place free from fearHerein the foolish ordinary mans taking the five aggregates as I and mine is like the mans taking the kings oxen The meditators recognizing the five aggregates as impermanent painful and notself by means of the three characteristics is like the mans recognizing the oxen as the kings when it got light Knowledge of appearance as terror is like the time when the man was frightened Desire for deliverance is like the mans desire to leave them and go away Changeoflineage is like the mans actual leaving The path is like his escaping Fruition is like the mans staying in a place without fear after escapingThe Ghoul A man went to live with a ghoul it seems At night thinking he was asleep she went to the place where the dead were exposed and ate human fleshHe wondered where she was going and followed her When he saw her eating human flesh he knew that she was a nonhuman being He was frightened and he thought I shall escape before she eats me Quickly escaping he went to a safe place and stayed thereHerein taking the aggregates as I and mine is like the mans living with the ghoul Recognizing the aggregates as impermanent etc by seeing the three characteristics is like the mans recognizing that she was a ghoul on seeing her eating human flesh in the place for the dead Appearance as terror is like the time when the man was frightened Desire for deliverance is like his desire to escape Changeoflineage is like his leaving the place for the dead The path is like his escaping quickly Fruition is like his standing in the place without fearThe Child A woman was very fond of her son it seems While sitting on an upper floor she heard the sound of a child in the street Wondering Is someone hurting my child  she hurried down Mistaking the child for her own son she picked up someone elses sonThen she recognized that it was someone elses son and she was ashamed and looked about her She thought Let no one say I am a baby thief and she put the child down there and then and she quickly returned to the upper floor and sat downHerein taking the five aggregates as I and mine is like the womans mistaking someone elses child for her own The recognition that This is not I not mine by means of the three characteristics is like her recognizing it as someone elses child Knowledge of desire for deliverance is like her looking about her Conformity knowledge is like her putting the child down there and then Changeoflineage is like the time when she stood in the street after putting the child down The path is like her return to the upper floor Fruition is like her sitting down after returning Hunger Thirst Cold Heat Darkness and By Poison These six similes however are given for the purpose of showing that one with insight that leads to emergence tends inclines and leans in the direction of the supramundane statesJust as a man faint with hunger and famished longs for delicious food so too the meditator famished with the hunger of the round of rebirths longs for the food consisting of mindfulness occupied with the body which tastes of the deathlessJust as a thirsty man whose throat and mouth are parched longs for a drink with many ingredients so too this meditator who is parched with the thirst of the round of rebirths longs for the noble drink of the Eightfold PathJust as a man frozen by cold longs for heat so too this meditator frozen by the cold of craving and selfish affection in the round of rebirths longs for the fire of the path that burns up the defilementsJust as a man faint with heat longs for cold so too this meditator scorched by the burning of the eleven fires in the round of rebirths longs for NibbānaJust as a man smothered in darkness longs for light so too this meditator wrapped and enveloped in the darkness of ignorance longs for the light of knowledge consisting in path developmentJust as a man sick with poison longs for an antidote so too this meditator sick with the poison of defilement longs for Nibbāna the deathless medicine that destroys the poison of defilementThat is why it was said above When he knows and sees thus his heart retreats retracts and recoils from the three kinds of becoming the four kinds of generation the five kinds of destiny the seven stations of consciousness and the nine abodes of beings his heart no longer goes out to themJust as water drops retreat retract and recoil on a lotus leaf that slopes a little   all of which should be given in the way already statedBut at this point he is called one who walks aloof with reference to whom it is saidWhen a bhikkhu keeps apartAnd cultivates seclusion of the mindIt will befit him as they sayTo show himself no more in this becoming This knowledge of equanimity about formations governs the fact that the meditator keeps apart It furthermore governs the difference in the number of the noble paths enlightenment factors path factors and jhāna factors the mode of progress and the kind of liberationFor while some elders say that it is the jhāna used as the basis for insight leading to emergence that governs the difference in the number of enlightenment factors path factors and jhāna factorsTo deal with these three theories in order According to governance by insight the path arisen in a bareinsight worker and the path arisen in one who possesses a jhāna attainment but who has not made the jhāna the basis for insight and the path made to arise by comprehending unrelated formations after using the first jhāna as the basis for insight are paths of the first jhāna onlyIn each case there are seven enlightenment factors eight path factors and five jhāna factorsFor while their preliminary insight can be accompanied by joy and it can be accompanied by equanimity when their insight reaches the state of equanimity about formations at the time of emergence it is accompanied by joyWhen paths are made to arise by using the second third and fourth jhānas in the fivefold reckoning as the basis for insight then the jhāna in those paths has respectively four three and two factorsIn each case however the path factors number sevenThis difference is due both to governance by the basic jhāna and to governance by insightFor again while their preliminary insight can be accompanied by joy and it can be accompanied by equanimitytheir insight leading to emergence is accompanied by joy onlyHowever when the path is produced by making the fifth jhāna the basis for insight then the jhāna factors number two that is equanimity and unification of the mind and there are six enlightenment factors and seven path factorsThis difference too is due to both kinds of governanceFor in this case the preliminary insight is either accompanied by joy or accompanied by equanimityThe same method applies in the case of the path made to arise by making the immaterial jhānas the basis for insightAlso when after emerging from jhāna made the basis for insight the path has been produced by comprehending no matter what formations unrelated to that jhāna then it is the attainment emerged from at the point nearest to the path that makes it like itself as the colour of the soil does an monitor lizards colourBut in the case of the second elders theory the path is like the attainment whatever it may be which was instrumental in producing the path through the comprehension of any of its states after emergence from itAnd here governance by insight should be understood in the same way as beforeIn the case of the third elders theory the path is like that jhāna whichever it may be that suits the personal bent which jhāna was instrumental in producing the path through the comprehension of any of its states in using it as the basis for insightBut this is not accomplished by mere bent alone unless the jhāna has been made the basis for insight or unless the jhāna has been comprehendedAnd here too governance by insight should be understood in the same way as beforeThis firstly is how it should be understood that equanimity about formations governs the numbers of enlightenment factors path factors and jhāna factorsProgress But if insight has from the start only been able to suppress defilements with difficulty with effort and with prompting then it is called of difficult progressFor one bhikkhu this progress is different in the four paths while for another it is the sameFor Buddhas however the four paths are of easy progress and swift directknowledgeLikewise in the case of the General of the Dhamma the Elder SāriputtaBut in the Elder Mahā Moggallānas case the first path was of easy progress and swift directknowledgePredominance And as with the kinds of progress so also with the kinds of predominance which are different in the four paths for one bhikkhuand the same for anotherSo it is equanimity about formations that governs the difference in the progressLiberation But it has already been told how it governs the difference in the liberation fFurthermore the path gets its names for five reasons that is to say owing to its own nature or owing to what it opposes or owing to its own special quality or owing to its object or owing to the way of arrivalIf equanimity about formations induces emergence by comprehending formations as impermanent liberation takes place with the signless liberationIf it induces emergence by comprehending them as painful liberation takes place with the desireless liberationIf it induces emergence by comprehending them as notself liberation takes place with the void liberationThis is its name according to its own natureWhen this path is arrived at with the abandoning of the signs of permanence lastingness and eternalness by effecting the resolution of the compact in formations by means of the contemplation of impermanence it is then called signlessWhen it is arrived at with the drying up of desire and longing by abandoning perception of pleasure by means of the contemplation of pain it is then called desirelessWhen formations are seen as void by abandoning perception of self of a living being of a person by means of the contemplation of notself it is then called void This is its name according to what it opposesIt is void because void of greed and so on It is signless owing either to absence of the sign of materiality etc or to absence only of the sign of greed and so on It is desireless because of absence of desire as greed and so on This is its name according to its own special qualityIt is called void signless and desireless too because it makes the void signless desireless Nibbāna its objectThis is its name according to its objectThe way of arrival is twofoldNow contemplation of notself is called void and the path arrived at by void insight is called void Again contemplation of impermanence is called signless and the path arrived at by signless insight is called signlessBut while this name is inadmissible by the Abhidhamma method it is admissible by the Suttanta methodHence the path is called signlessAnd its fruition can be called signless too according to the paths way of arrivalLastly contemplation of pain is called desireless because it arrives at the path by drying up desire for formations The path arrived at by desireless insight is called desireless The fruition of the desireless path is called desirelessIn this way insight gives its own name to the path and the path hands it on to its fruition This is its name according to the way of arrivalThis is how equanimity about formations governs the difference in the liberationsEquanimity about formations is endedHowSo he sees no self anywhere of his own nor does he see it as deducible in the fact of anothers owning nor does he see anothers self nor does he see that as deducible in the fact of his own owningthe meaning is that he does not see in any instance anothers self deducible owing to this fact of his owning a brother in the case of a brother a friend in the case of a friend chattel in the case of a chattel Now bringing in the word my  we have is there  my owning in anyone  he does not see thus Anothers self exists owing to some state of my owning of it As regards the phrase nor  anywhere my  leaving aside the word my here for the moment the words nor anywhere means that he does not see anothers self anywherethe meaning is that he does not see a self of his own deducible by conceiving a brother to own it in the case of a brother a friend to own it in the case of a friend or a chattel to own it in the case of a chattel Thinking am  anyones owning  he does not see a self of his own to be inferred in anothers owningeyeconsciousness  mindconsciousness mindcontact   Nidd II   cfS IV  and this should be continued as far as ageingand death that is to say Materiality has no core is coreless without core as far as concerns any core of permanence or core of lastingness or core of pleasure or core of self or as far as concerns what is permanent or what is lasting or what is eternal or what is not subject to changenot I not mine not anothers not anyonesbut later when he had found out the womans faults and wanting to get free had divorced her he would no more take her as mineNow after discerning formations in the various modes as though carding cotton from which the seeds have been picked out and after abandoning terror and delight and after becoming neutral in the investigation of formations he still persists in the triple contemplationaccording as it is saidfor contemplation of impermanence limits them thus Formations do not exist previous to their rise and in seeking their destiny sees them as circumscribed thus They do not go beyond fall they vanish thereTo the stirring up of the mind by giving consciousness a sense of urgencyfor with the contemplation of pain consciousness acquires a sense of urgency with respect to formationsFor that path is signless owing to the signless element having arisenand it is a liberation owing to deliverance from defilementsknowledge of contemplation of notself is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting them as self  It is expressed firstly as the void liberation by its liberating from misinterpreting formations knowledge of contemplation of pain is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign of formations as pleasant knowledge of contemplation of notself is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign of formations as self  Then it is expressed as the signless liberation by liberating from signs knowledge of contemplation of pain is the desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire for them as pleasantknowledge of contemplation of notself is the desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire for them as self  Lastly as the desireless liberation by its liberating from desireit is expressed in the next six instances he becomes one attained to vision and in the case of the highest fruition he becomes one liberated by understandingWhen he brings formations to mind as impermanent the faith faculty is in excess in himhe has realized Nibbāna by experiencing thus he is a body witnesshe has attained Nibbāna by vision thus he is one attained to visionAt the moments of the three remaining paths he is liberated by faith  thus he is one liberated by faithit is known seen recognized realized and experienced with understanding that formations are painful and cessation is bliss thus he is one attained to vision This knowledge of equanimity about formations is the same in meaning as the two kinds that precede it with despair is knowledge of equanimity about formations Understanding of desire for deliverance of reflection and of composure occupied with occurrence  the sign  for this is said Desire for deliverance and contemplation of reflection and equanimity about formations these things are one in meaning and only the letter is different If his insight joins with the path at the time when he is comprehending the external it is said of him that after interpreting the internal it emerges from the externalso he sees as the immaterial mentality the feeling perception formations and consciousness that have arisen by making that materiality their objectSimilarly in the case of after interpreting the immaterial it emerges from the immaterial and from the materialSimilarly in the cases of emergence after interpreting  as painful and  as notselfthen all three persons acquire the faculty of faith since they have great resolution they are liberated by the signless liberation and so they become faith devotees at the moment of the first path and in the remaining seven stages they are liberated by faithand the fifth but saw nothingand some say that it is the aggregates made the object of insight that govern itand some say that it is the personal bent that governs ityet it is only this preliminary insight and insight leading to emergence that should be understood to govern it in their doctrineand in the fourth case there are six enlightenment factorsbut that leading to emergence is accompanied by equanimity onlyand this meaning should be illustrated by the Nandakovāda Sutta The opposite kind is called of easy progressAnd when the manifestation of the path the goal of insight is slowly effected after defilements have been suppressed then it is called of sluggish direct knowledgeThe opposite kind is called of swift directknowledgeSo this equanimity about formations stands at the arrival point and gives its own name to the path in each caseand so the path has four names according to the kind of progress but the others were of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledgenamely insights way of arrival applies to the path and the paths way of arrival applies to fruitionfor they say by that method changeof lineage takes the name signless by making the signless Nibbāna its object and while itself remaining at the arrival point it gives its name to the pathNāhaṃ kvacini he sees the nonexistence of a self of his ownSo this mere conglomeration of formations is seen by discerning it with the voidness of the quadruple logical relation as voidness of self or property of a self in both internal and external aggregatesHe sees of another that that other is not the property of his own self thus My owning of that others self does not existHe sees the nonexistence of anothers self thus There is no others self anywhereIf it were there would be fortythree waysAlthough it has already been described as a danger in order to show it as such the word is used again in order to show that it is opposed to enjoyment When insight reaches its culmination it settles down in one of the three contemplations impermanence pain or notself and at this stage of the development the seven contemplations and the eighteen contemplations are all included by the threeContemplation of impermanence sees formations as limited by rise in the beginning and by fall in the endInto the void into the unformed element which is given the name void because of voidness of selfInto the desireless into the unformed element which is given the name desireless owing to the nonexistence of desire due to greed and so onTo the entering of consciousness to the higher consciousnesss completely going into by means of the state of conformity knowledge after delimitingInto the signless element into the unformed element which is given the name signless because it is the opposite of the sign of formationsand it sees that it is because they have a beginning and an end that they are impermanentOne who is pursuing insight by discerning formations according to their sign by means of the contemplation of impermanence and resolves according to the signless aspect thus Where this sign of formations is entirely nonexistent that is the signless Nibbāna joins insight leading to emergence with the pathOne who resolves upon the desireless by keeping desire away by means of the contemplation of pain and one who resolves upon the void by keeping the belief in self away by means of the contemplation of notself should both be construed in the same wayThe signless aspect of Nibbāna is not created by the path or by insight on the contrary it is the establishment of the individual essence of NibbānaThen the path realizes Nibbāna for him as signlessand the path is called signless because it has that as its objectOf course signless insight is mentioned in the suttas thus Develop the signless and get rid of the inherent tendency to conceit  Nevertheless though it eliminates the signs of permanence of lastingness and of self it still possesses a sign itself and is occupied with states that possess a signAgain the Abhidhamma is the teaching in the ultimate sense and in the ultimate sense the cause of a signless path is wantingFor the signless liberation is stated in accordance with the contemplation of impermanence and in that the faith faculty predominatesBut the faith faculty is not represented by any one of the factors of the path And so it cannot give its name to the path since it forms no part of itWhy is signless insight unable to give its own name to the path when it has come to the point of arrival at the pathIn the case of the other two the desireless liberation is due to the contemplation of pain and the void liberation is due to the contemplation of notselfNow the concentration faculty predominates in the desireless liberation and the understanding faculty in the void liberation So since these are factors of the path as well they can give their own names to the path but there is no signless path because the factor is wanting So some sayBut there are others who say that there is a signless path and that although it does not get its name from the way insight arrives at it still it gets its name from a special quality of its own and from its object In their opinion the desireless and void paths should also get their names from special qualities of their own and from their objects tooThat is wrongWhyBecause the path gets its names for two reasons that is because of its own nature and because of what it opposesthe meaning is because of its individual essence and because of what it is contrary toFor the desireless path is free from desire due to greed etc and the void path is free from greed too so they both get their names from their individual essenceSimilarly the desireless path is the contrary of desire and the void path is the contrary of misinterpretation as self so they get their names from what they oppose On the other hand the signless path gets its name only from its own nature owing to the nonexistence in it of the signs of greed etc or of the signs of permanence etc but not owing to what it opposesFor it does not oppose the contemplation of impermanence which has as its object the sign of formations as formed but remains in agreement with it So a signless path is altogether inadmissible by the Abhidhamma methodThis is why it is said This refers to the way in which insight arrives at the path and is expressed in the literal sense However by the Suttanta method a signless path is admissibleFor according to that in whatever way insight leading to emergence effects its comprehending it still leads on to emergence of the path and when it is at the point of arrival it gives its own name to the path accordinglywhen emerging owing to comprehension as impermanent the path is signless when emerging owing to comprehension as painful it is desireless and when emerging owing to comprehension as notself it is void Taking this as a sutta commentary therefore three liberations are differentiated hereBut in the Paṭisambhidā the deliverance from misinterpreting from the sign and from desire are taken respectively as the arrival of the three kinds of comprehension at that deliverance and what is described is a corresponding state of void liberation etc respectively in the paths that follow upon that deliverance There is no question of treating that literally which is why he said However in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge and so onFrom the object interpreted as the sign from the pentad of aggregates as the object of insightfor that pentad of aggregates is called the object interpreted on account of the interpreting in other words on account of being made the domain of insightAnd although it is included in ones own continuity it is nevertheless called external because it is seen as alien to itit is that too which in other contexts is spoken of as externally from all signs Internally from occurrence from the occurrence of wrong view etc in ones own continuity and from the defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon themFor it is stated in this way because there is occurrence of defilement in ones own continuity and because there is occurrence of clungto aggregates produced by that defilement when there is no path developmentAnd emergence consists both in making these the object and in producing their nonliability to future arisingEmerges from the internal is said figuratively owing to the fact that in this case the insight leading to emergence has an internal state as its object In the literal sense however the path emerges from bothSaid in the Discourse on Purification The first some refers to the Elder Tipiṭaka CūḷaNāgaThe second some refers to the Elder Mahā Datta dweller at MoravāpiThe third some refers to the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷa AbhayaIf this is so then is the path that follows on the contemplation of impermanence not included in the AbhidhammaThat is not so for it is included in the method of simple progress As he repeats develops and cultivates that equanimity about formations his faith becomes more resolute his energy better exerted his mindfulness better established his mind better concentrated while his equanimity about formations grows more refinedHe thinks Now the path will arise Equanimity about formations after comprehending formations as impermanent or as painful or as notself sinks into the lifecontinuumNext to the lifecontinuum minddoor adverting arises making formations its object as impermanent or as painful or as notself according to the way taken by equanimity about formationsThen next to the functional adverting consciousness that arose displacing the lifecontinuum the first impulsion consciousness arises making formations its object in the same way maintaining the continuity of consciousness This is called the preliminary workNext to that a third impulsion consciousness also arises making formations its object in the same way This is called conformityThese are their individual namesBut it is admissible to call all three impulsions repetition or preliminarywork or access or conformity indiscriminatelyConformity to whatTo what precedes and to what followsFor it conforms to the functions of truth both in the eight preceding kinds of insight knowledge and in the thirtyseven states partaking of enlightenment that followSince its occurrence is contingent upon formations through compre hending the characteristics of impermanence etc it so to speak says Knowledge of rise and fall indeed saw the rise and fall of precisely those states that possess rise and fall and Contemplation of dissolution indeed saw the dissolution of precisely those states that possess dissolution and It was indeed precisely what was terrible that appeared as terror to knowledge of appearance as terror and Contemplation of danger indeed saw danger in precisely what was dangerous and Knowledge of dispassion indeed became dispassionate towards precisely that which should be regarded with dispassion and Knowledge of desire for deliverance indeed produced desire for deliverance from precisely what there should be deliverance from and What was reflected upon by knowledge of reflection was indeed precisely what should be reflected upon and What was looked on at with equanimity by equanimity about formations was indeed precisely what should be looked on at with equanimity So it conforms to the functions of truth both in these eight kinds of knowledge and in the thirtyseven states partaking of enlightenment which follow because they are to be reached by entering upon itJust as a righteous king who sits in the place of judgement hearing the pronouncements of the judges while excluding bias and remaining impartial conforms both to their pronouncements and to the ancient royal custom by saying So be it so it is here tooConformity is like the king The eight kinds of knowledge are like eight judges The thirtyseven states partaking of enlightenment are like the ancient royal customHerein just as the king conforms by saying So be it both to the judges pronouncements and to the royal custom so this conformity which arises contingent upon formations through comprehending impermanence etc conforms to the function of truth both in the eight kinds of knowledge and in the thirtyseven states partaking of enlightenment that followHence it is called knowledge in conformity with truthKnowledge of conformity is endedNext to that a second impulsion consciousness arises making formations its object in the same way This is called the accessFor when the lifecontinuum which is mindconsciousness element is displaced by the functional mind element of five door adverting  the occurrence of the functional consciousness makes an interruption an interval between the occurrence of the resultant consciousness ie the lifecontinuum and the consciousness that follows But this is not so with mind door adverting which is mindconsciousness elementMaintaining the continuity of consciousness by absence of interruption in other words of occurrence of dissimilar consciousnessstill changeoflineage knowledge is the last of all the kinds of insight leading to emergenceFor this insight leading to emergence is called aloofness  in the Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga Sutta thus Bhikkhus by depending and relying on aloofness abandon surmount equanimity that is unified based on unity In the Alagadda Sutta it is called dispassion thus Being dispassionate his greed fades away With the fading away of greed he is liberated In the Susīma Sutta it is called knowledge of the relationship of states thus Previously Susīma there is knowledge of relationship of states subsequently there is knowledge of Nibbāna In the Poṭṭhapāda Sutta it is called the culmination of perception thus First Poṭṭhapāda the culmination of perception arises and afterwards knowledge In the Dasuttara Sutta it is called the principal factor of purity thus Purification by knowledge and vision of the way is the principal factor of purity In the Paṭisambhidāmagga it is called by the three names thus Desire for deliverance and contemplation of reflection and equanimity about formations these things are one in meaning and only the letter is different In the Paṭṭhāna it is called by two names thus conformity to changeoflineage and conformity to cleansing In the Rathavinīta Sutta it is called purification by knowledge and vision of the way thus But how friend is it for the purpose of the purification by knowledge and vision of the way that the life of purity is lived under the Blessed One  The Greatest Sage did thus proclaim With many a neatly chosen nameThis insight stilled and purified That to emergence leads besideThe round of rebirths slough of pain Is vast and terrible If he would this emergence gaina man Wisely should strive as best he canin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of UnderstandingNow the following sutta references should be understood in order not to be confused about insight leading to emergenceThough this conformity knowledge is the end of the insight leading to emergence that has formations as its objectcalled The Description of Purification by Knowledge and Vision of the WayThe twentyfirst chapterconsiders thus I have gone forth from an aristocratic family but these other bhikkhus have not gone forth from aristocratic familiesconsiders thus I have gone forth from an influential family but these other bhikkhus have not gone forth from influential familiesconsiders thus I am well known and famous but these other bhikkhus are unknown and of no accountconsiders thus I gain robes almsfood resting places and requisites of medicine but these other bhikkhus do not gain these thingsChangeoflineage knowledge comes next Its position is to advert to the path and so it belongs neither to purification by knowledge and vision of the way nor to purification by knowledge and vision but being intermediate it is unassignableStill it is reckoned as insight because it falls in line with insightPurification by knowledge and vision properly consists in knowledge of the four paths that is to say the path of streamentry the path of oncereturn the path of nonreturn and the path of ArahantshipHerein nothing further needs to be done by one who wants to achieve firstly the knowledge of the first pathFor what he needs to do has already been done by arousing the insight that ends in conformity knowledgeAs soon as conformity knowledge has arisen in him in this way and the thick murk that hides the truths has been dispelled by the respective force peculiar to each of the three kinds of conformity  then his consciousness no longer enters into or settles down on or resolves upon any field of formations at all or clings cleaves or clutches on to itThen while every sign and occurrence appears to him as an impediment when conformity knowledges repetition has ended changeoflineage knowledge arises in him which takes as its object the signless non occurrence nonformation cessation Nibbānawhich knowledge passes out of the lineage the category the plane of the ordinary man and enters the lineage the category the plane of the Noble Oneswhich being the first adverting the first concern the first reaction to Nibbāna as object fulfils the state of a condition for the path in six ways as proximity contiguity repetition decisivesupport absence and disappearance conditionswhich is the culminating peak of insightwhich is irrevocableHow is it that understanding of emergence and turning away from the external is changeoflineage knowledgeIt overcomes arising thus it is changeoflineageIt overcomes occurrence  the sign  accumulation  rebirthlinking  destiny  generation  re arising  birth  ageing  sickness  death  sorrow  lamentation   It overcomes despair thus it is changeoflineageIt overcomes the sign of formations externally thus it is changeoflineageIt enters into nonarising thus it is changeoflineageIt enters into non occurrence thus it is changeoflineage   It enters into nondespair thus it is changeoflineage It enters into cessation Nibbāna thus it is change oflineageHaving overcome arising it enters into nonarising thus it is changeof lineage  and so on all of which should be quotedHere is a simile that illustrates how conformity and changeoflineage occur with different objects though occurring in a single cognitive series with a single adverting Suppose a man wanted to leap across a broad stream and establish himself on the opposite bank he would run fast and seizing a rope fastened to the branch of a tree on the streams near bank and hanging down or a pole he would leap with his body tending inclining and leaning towards the opposite bank and when he had arrived above the opposite bank he would let go fall on to the opposite bank staggering first and then steady himself there so too this meditator who wants to establish himself on Nibbāna the bank opposite to the kinds of becoming generation destiny station and abode runs fast by means of the contemplation of rise and fall etc and seizing with conformitys adverting to impermanence pain or notself the rope of materiality fastened to the branch of his selfhood and hanging down or one among the poles beginning with feeling he leaps with the first conformity consciousness without letting go and with the second he tends inclines and leans towards Nibbāna like the body that was tending inclining and leaning towards the opposite bank then being with the third next to Nibbāna which is now attainable like the others arriving above the opposite bank he lets go that information as object with the ceasing of that consciousness and with the changeoflineage consciousness he falls on to the unformed Nibbāna the bank oppositebut staggering as the man did for lack of previous repetition he is not yet properly steady on the single object After that he is steadied by path knowledgeHerein conformity is able to dispel the murk of defilements that conceals the truths but is unable to make Nibbāna its objectChangeoflineage is only able to make Nibbāna its object but it is unable to dispel the murk that conceals the truthsHere is a simile A man with eyes went out at night it seems to find out the conjunction of the stars and he looked up to see the moon It was invisible because it was concealed by cloudsThen a wind sprang up and blew away the thick cloudsanother blew away the medium clouds and another blew away the fine clouds as wellThen the man saw the moon in the sky free from clouds and he found out the conjunction of the starsHerein the thick medium and fine kinds of darkness that conceal the truths are like the three kinds of cloud The three kinds of conformity consciousness are like the three winds Changeoflineage knowledge is like the man with eyes Nibbāna is like the moon The dispelling of the murk that conceals the truths by each kind of conformity consciousness is like the successive blowing away of the clouds by each wind Changeoflineage knowledges seeing the clear Nibbāna when the murk that concealed the truths has disappeared is like the mans seeing the clear moon in the sky free from cloudJust as the three winds are able only to blow away the clouds that conceal the moon but cannot see the moon so the three kinds of conformity are able only to dispel the murk that conceals the truths but cannot see NibbānaJust as the man can only see the moon but cannot blow away the clouds so changeof lineage knowledge can only see Nibbāna but cannot dispel the defilementsHence it is called adverting to the pathFor although it is not adverting it occupies the position of adverting and then after as it were giving a sign to the path to come into being it ceasesAnd without pausing after the sign given by that the changeoflineage knowledge the path follows upon it in uninterrupted continuity and as it comes into being it pierces and explodes the mass of greed the mass of hate and the mass of delusion never pierced and exploded before Here is a simile for this An archer it seems had a target set up at a distance of eight usabhas  and wrapping his face in a cloth and arming himself with an arrow he stood on a wheel contrivance Another man turned the wheel contrivance and when the target was opposite the archer he gave him a sign with a stickWithout pausing after the sign the archer shot the arrow and hit the targetHerein changeoflineage knowledge is like the sign with the stick Path knowledge is like the archerPath knowledges making Nibbāna its object without pausing after the sign given by changeoflineage and its piercing and exploding the mass of greed hate and delusion never pierced and exploded before is like the archers hitting the target without pausing after the signAnd not only does it cause the piercing of this mass of greed etc but it also dries up the ocean of suffering of the round in the beginningless round of rebirths It closes all doors to the states of loss It provides actual experience of the seven noble treasures It abandons the eightfold wrong path It allays all enmity and fear It leads to the state of the Fully Enlightened Ones breastborn son  And it leads to the acquisition of many hundred other blessings So it is the knowledge associated with the path of streamentry the provider of many hundred blessings that is called knowledge of the path of streamentryThe first kind of knowledge is endedand every sign as object every occurrence as object appears as an impedimentbut retreats retracts and recoils as water does from a lotus leafof which it is saidOf emerging and turning away from the external it is the understanding of turning away that is being effected which turning away is emergence from the field of formations it is termed external because the unformed elements existence is externala phalakasata is one made of the heart of the asana treeThe five kinds of enmity beginning with killing living things and the twentyfive great terrors are what constitute all enmity and fearImmediately next to that knowledge however there arise either two or three fruition consciousnesses which are its resultFor it is owing to this very fact that supramundane profitable consciousness results immediately that it is said And which he called the concentration with immediate result  and Sluggishly he reaches what has immediate result for the destruction of the cankers  and so onSome however say that there are one two three four or five fruition consciousnesses That is inadmissibleFor changeoflineage knowledge arises at the end of conformitys repetitionAnd a single series of impulsions has a maximum of seven impulsion consciousnessesConsequently that series which has two conformities and changeoflineage as a third and path consciousness as fourth has three fruition consciousnessesThat which has three conformities and changeoflineage as fourth and path consciousness as fifth has two fruition consciousnessesThat is why it was said above There arise either two or three fruition consciousnessesThen some say that which has four conformities and changeoflineage as fifth and path consciousness as sixth has one fruition consciousness But that is refuted because it is the fourth or fifth impulsion that reaches the path not those after that owing to their nearness to the lifecontinuum So that cannot be accepted as correctAnd at this point this streamenterer is called the second noble personHowever negligent he may be he is bound to make an end of suffering when he has travelled and traversed the round of rebirths among deities and human beings for the seventh timeAt the end of the fruition his consciousness enters the lifecontinuum After that it arises as minddoor adverting interrupting the lifecontinuum for the purpose of reviewing the path When that has ceased seven impulsions of path reviewing ariseAfter reentry into the lifecontinuum adverting etc arise again in the same way for the purpose of reviewing fruition and so onWith the arising of these he reviews the path he reviews the fruition he reviews the defilements abandoned he reviews the defilements still remaining and he reviews NibbānaHe reviews the path in this way So this is the path I have come by Next he reviews the fruition after that in this way This is the blessing I have obtainedAnd as in the case of the streamenterer so also in the cases of the once returner and nonreturnerBut the Arahant has no reviewing of remaining defilementsSo all the kinds of reviewing total nineteenThis is the maximum numberTrainers may or may not have the reviewing of the defilements abandoned and those still remainingIn fact it was owing to the absence of such reviewing that Mahānāma asked the Blessed One What state is there still unabandoned by me internally owing to which at times states of greed invade my mind and remain  all of which should be quotedso at the minimum there must be two conformity consciousnesses since one alone does not act as repetition conditionNext he reviews the defilements that have been abandoned These are the defilements abandoned in meNext he reviews the defilements still to be eliminated by the three higher paths These are the defilements still remaining in meAnd lastly he reviews the deathless Nibbāna in this way This is the state that has been penetrated by me as objectSo the noble disciple who is a streamenterer has five kinds of reviewingHowever after reviewing in this way either while sitting in the same session or on another occasion the noble disciple who is a streamenterer makes it his task to reach the second plane by attenuating both greed for sense desires and illwillHe brings to bear the faculties the powers and the enlightenment factors and he works over and turns up that same field of formations classed as materiality feeling perception formations and consciousness with the knowledge that they are impermanent painful notself and he embarks upon the progressive series of insightsWhen he has done so and when at the end of equanimity about formations conformity and changeoflineage knowledge have arisen in a single adverting in the way already described then the path of oncereturn arises next to changeoflineageThe knowledge associated with that is knowledge of the path of oncereturnThe second kind of knowledge is endedHere changeoflineage means like changeoflineagefor the knowledge that ushers in the first path is called that in the literal sense because it overcomes the ordinary mans lineage and develops the Noble Ones lineage But this is called changeoflineage figuratively because of its similarity to the otherIt is also called cleansing because it purifies from certain defilements and because it makes absolute purification its objectHence it is said in the Paṭṭhāna Conformity is a condition as proximity condition for cleansing But next to changeoflineage is said here because it is said in the Paṭisambhidāmagga that for the purpose of overcoming arising etc eight states of changeoflineage arise through concentration and ten states of changeoflineage arise through concentration and ten states of changeoflineage arise through insight  and it is given in the same way in this pageNow after reviewing in this way either while sitting in the same session or on another occasion this noble disciple who is a oncereturner makes it his task to reach the third plane by abandoning without remainder both greed for the sense desires and illwill He brings to bear the faculties the powers and the enlightenment factors and he works over and turns up that same field of formations with the knowledge that they are impermanent painful notself and he embarks upon the progressive series of insightsWhen he has done so and when at the end of equanimity about formations conformity and changeoflineage have arisen in a single adverting in the way already described then the path of nonreturn arises next to changeoflineage The knowledge associated with that is knowledge of the path of nonreturnThe third kind of knowledge is endedThe fruition consciousness should be understood to follow immediately upon this knowledge in the same way as beforeAnd at this point this once returner is called the fourth noble person He is bound to make an end of suffering after returning once to this worldNext there comes reviewing in the way already describedThe fruition consciousnesses should be understood to follow immediately upon this knowledge in the same way as beforeAnd at this point this non returner is called the sixth noble person After death he reappears apparitionally elsewhere and attains complete extinction there without ever returning without ever coming to this world again through rebirthlinkingNext there comes reviewing in the way already describedNow after reviewing in this way either while sitting in the same session or on another occasion this noble disciple who is a nonreturner makes it his task to reach the fourth plane by abandoning without remainder greed for the fine material and immaterial conceit  agitation and ignorance He brings to bear the faculties the powers and the enlightenment factors and he works over and turns up that same field of formations with the knowledge that they are impermanent painful notself and he embarks upon the progressive series of insightsWhen he has done so and when at the end of equanimity about formations conformity and changeoflineage have arisen in a single adverting then the path of Arahantship arises next to changeoflineage The knowledge associated with that is knowledge of the path of ArahantshipThe fourth kind of knowledge is endedThe fruition consciousness should be understood to follow immediately upon this knowledge in the same way as beforeAnd at this point this Arahant is called the eighth noble person He is one of the Great Ones with cankers destroyed he bears this last body he has laid down the burden reached his goal and destroyed the fetter of becoming he is rightly liberated with final knowledge and worthy of the highest offering of the world with its deitiesSo when it was said above However purification by knowledge and vision properly consists in knowledge of the four paths that is to say the path of streamentry the path of oncereturn the path of nonreturn and the path of Arahantship  that referred to these four kinds of knowledge to be reached in this orderNow in order to appreciate the value of this same purification by knowledge and vision with its four kinds of knowledgefulfilment of states sharing in enlightenment Emergence and the coupling of the powersThe kinds of states that ought to be abandoned Also the act of their abandoningFunctions of fullunderstanding and the rest As stated when truths are penetrated toEach one of which ought to be recognized According to its individual essenceHerein the fulfilment of states sharing in enlightenment is the fulfilledness of those states partaking in enlightenmentFor they are the following thirty seven states the four foundations of mindfulness  the four right endeavours  the four roads to power  the five faculties  the five powers  the seven enlightenment factors  and the Noble Eightfold Path  And they are called partaking of enlightenment because they take the part of the Noble Eightfold Path which is called enlightenment in the sense of enlighteningand they take the part of that because they are helpfulIt is of four kinds because it occurs with respect to the body feeling consciousness and mental objects  taking them as foul painful impermanent and nonself and because it accomplishes the function of abandoning perception of beauty pleasure permanence and selfThat is why four foundations of mindfulness is saidBy it they endeavour  thus it is endeavour Or alternatively by its means people endeavour rightly  thus it is right endeavour Or alternatively it is good because of abandoning the unseemliness of defilement and it is endeavour because of bringing about improvement and giving precedence in the sense of producing wellbeing and bliss thus it is right endeavourIt is a name for energyIt accomplishes the functions of abandoning arisen unprofitable things preventing the arising of those not yet arisen arousing unarisen profitable things and maintaining those already arisen thus it is fourfold That is why four right endeavours is saidPower is in the sense of success as already described It is the road to that power in the sense of being the precursor of that success which is associated with it and in the sense of being the prior cause of that success which is its fruit thus it is a road to power It is fourfold as zeal  and so on That is why four roads to power are spoken ofaccording as it is said Four roads to power the road to power consisting in zeal the road to power consisting in energy the road to power consisting in natural purity of consciousness the road to power consisting in inquiry These are supramundane onlyBut they are also mundane If a bhikkhu obtains concentration obtains mental unification by making zeal predominantFaculty is in the sense of predominance in other words of overcoming because these states as faculties respectively overcome faithlessness idleness negligence distraction and confusionPower is in the sense of unwaveringness because these states as powers are incapable of being overcome respectively by faithlessness and so onBoth are fivefold as consisting in faith energy mindfulness concentration and understanding That is why five faculties and five powers is saidMindfulness investigationofstates energy happiness tranquillity concentration and equanimity as factors in a being who is becoming enlightened are the seven enlightenment factorsHence seven enlightenment factors and the Noble Eightfold Path is saidSo there are these thirtyseven states partaking of enlightenment Now in the prior stage when mundane insight is occurring they are found in a plurality of consciousnesses as follows the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body is found in one discerning the body in the fourteen ways the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of feeling in one discerning feeling in the nine ways the foundation of mindfulness consisting in the contemplation of mind in one discerning the manner of consciousness in sixteen ways the foundation of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of mental objects in one discerning mental objects in the five waysAnd at the time when on seeing an unprofitable state arisen in someone else which has not yet arisen in his own person he strives for its nonarising thus I shall not behave as he has done in whom this is now arisen and so this will not arise in me then he has the first right endeavourAnd at the time of arousing a profitable state with zeal as the motive force there is the road to power consisting in zeal and so on with the remaining three roads to powerAnd at the time of abstaining from wrong speech there is right speech and so on with abstaining from wrong action and wrong livelihoodAt the time of arising of any one of the four kinds of path knowledge all these states are found in a single consciousnessIn the moment of fruition the thirtythree excepting the four right endeavours are foundWhen these are found in a single consciousness in this way it is the one kind of mindfulness whose object is Nibbāna that is called the four foundations of mindfulness because it accomplishes the function of abandoning the four perceptions of beauty etc in the four things beginning with the bodyAnd also the one kind of energy is called four right endeavours because it accomplishes the four functions beginning with preventing the arising of the unarisen unprofitableBut there is no decrease or increase with the restFurthermore it is said of themNine in one way one in two ways Then in four ways and in five waysIn eight ways and in nine ways too So in six ways they come to be Nine in one way these nine are zeal consciousness happiness tranquillity equanimity thinking speech action and livelihood and they are found in one way as road to power consisting in zeal etc since they do not belong to any other group One in two ways faith is found in two ways as a faculty and as a power Then in four ways and in five ways the meaning is that another one is found in four ways and another in fiveHerein concentration is the one in four ways since it is a faculty a power an enlightenment factor and a path factor In eight ways and in nine ways too the meaning is that another one is found in eight ways and another in nine waysMindfulness is one in eight ways since it is the four foundations of mindfulness a faculty a power an enlightenment factor and a path factorSoStates sharing in enlightenment Are fourteen undistributedThey total thirtyseven states Among the groups distributedWhile each performs the proper task That to its special lot falls dueThey all come into being when The Noble Eightfold Path comes trueThis is how firstly the fulfilment of states partaking in enlightenment should be understood hereFoundation is because of establishment by going down into by descending upon such and such objectsMindfulness itself as foundation is foundation of mindfulnessa good endeavour is a right endeavourthis is called concentration through zeal  etc because of the words as states acquired by predominance of zeal etc respectivelyAnd right view right thinking right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration are the eight path factors in the sense of being an outletwhen seeing something unprofitable in his own behaviour he strives to abandon it then he has the secondwhen he strives to arouse jhāna or insight so far unarisen in this person he has the thirdand when he arouses again and again what has already arisen so that it shall not diminish he has the fourthunderstanding is the one in five ways since it is these four and also a road to powerenergy is the one in nine ways since it is four right endeavours a road to power a faculty a power an enlightenment factor and a path factorOnly the road to power consisting in zeal and right speech are actually included herebut when these are mentioned the remaining roads to power and remaining two abstinences are implied in the meaning too The meaning of this sentence should be understood according to the category of characteristics When one thing has been stated then those things That are in characteristic one with itAre stated toothis is the formulation Of the category of characteristicsEmergence and  coupling of the powers the resolution of the compound vuṭṭhānabalasamāyoga is vuṭṭhānañ ceva balasamāyogo ca Emergence mundane insight induces no emergence either from occurrence of defilement internally because it does not cut off originating which is the act of causing occurrence or from the sign of formations externally because it has the sign as objectAt the moment of the streamentry path right view in the sense of seeing emerges from wrong view and it emerges from defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that wrong view and externally it emerges from all signsRight thinking in the sense of directing emerges from wrong thinking  Right speech in the sense of embracing emerges from wrong speech At the moment of the oncereturn path right view in the sense of seeing  Right concentration in the sense of nondistraction emerges from the gross fetter of greed for sense desires from the gross fetter of resentment from the gross inherent tendency to greed for sense desires and from the gross inherent tendency to resentment and it emerges from defilements and from the aggregates consequent upon that and externally it emerges from all signs hence it was said Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge of the pathAt the moment of the nonreturn path right view in the sense of seeing  Right concentration in the sense of nondistraction emerges from the residual fetter of greed for sense desires from the residual fetter of resentment from the residual inherent tendency to greed for sense desires from the residual inherent tendency to resentment and it emerges from defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that and externally it emerges from all signs hence it was said Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge of the pathAt the moment of the Arahant path right view in the sense of seeing  Right concentration in the sense of nondistraction emerges from greed for the finematerial existence from greed for immaterial existence from conceit  from agitation from ignorance from the inherent tendency to conceit  from the inherent tendency to greed for becoming from the inherent tendency to ignorance and it emerges from defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that and externally it emerges from all signs Coupling of the powers At the time of developing the eight mundane attainments the serenity power is in excessBut at the noble path moment they occur coupled together in the sense that neither one exceeds the otherSo there is coupling of the powers in the case of each one of these four kinds of knowledgeWhen he emerges from the defilements associated with agitation and from the aggregates his mental unification nondistraction concentration has cessation as its domain When he emerges from the defilements associated with ignorance and from the aggregates his insight in the sense of contemplation has cessation as its domainSo serenity and insight have a single nature in the sense of emergence they are coupled together and neither exceeds the otherHence it was said He develops serenity and insight coupled together in the sense of emergence Emergence and coupling of the powers should be understood here in this wayHow is it that understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge of the pathHence it is saidThese four kinds of path knowledge emerge from the sign because they have the signless as their object and also from occurrence because they cut off origination So they emerge from bothHence it is said Understanding of emergence and turning away from the external is knowledge of changeoflineage Likewise the whole passage Having turned away from arising it enters into nonarising thus it is changeoflineage Having turned away from occurrence   Having turned away from the sign of formations externally it enters into cessation Nibbāna thus it is changeoflineage  should be understood hereChangeoflineage knowledge does not induce emergence from occurrence internally because it does not cut off originatingbut it does induce emergence from the sign externally because it has Nibbāna as its object so there is emergence from onehence it was said Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge of the pathRight action in the sense of originating emerges from wrong action Right livelihood in the sense of cleansing emerges from wrong livelihood Right effort in the sense of exerting emerges from wrong effort Right mindfulness in the sense of establishment emerges from wrong mindfulness Right concentration in the sense of nondistraction emerges from wrong concentration and it emerges from defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that wrong concentration and externally it emerges from all signshence it was said Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge of the pathhence it was said Understanding of emergence and turning away from both is knowledge of the path while at the time of developing the contemplations of impermanence etc the insight power is in excessaccording as it is saidEmergence from the sign consists in relinquishing the sign of formations and making Nibbāna the objectEmergence from occurrence consists in entering upon the state of nonliability to the occurrence of kammaresult in the future by causing the cessation of causeIt emerges from the defilements of uncertainty etc that occur consequent upon that view which is wrong since it leads to states of lossFunctions of fullunderstanding and the rest As stated when truths are penetrated toEach one of which ought to be recognized According to its individual essence Now at the times of penetrating to the truths each one of the four path knowledges is said to exercise four functions in a single moment These are full understanding abandoning realizing and developing and each one of them ought to be recognized according to its individual essenceFor this is said by the AncientsJust as a lamp performs the four functions simultaneously in a single momentit burns the wick dispels darkness makes light appear and uses up the oil so too path knowledge penetrates to the four truths simultaneously in a single momentit penetrates to suffering by penetrating to it with fullunderstanding penetrates to origination by penetrating to it with abandoning penetrates to the path by penetrating to it with developing and penetrates cessation by penetrating to it with realizing What is meantBy making cessation its object it reaches sees and pierces the four truthsFor this is said Bhikkhus he who sees suffering sees also the origin of suffering sees also the cessation of suffering sees also the way leading to the cessation of suffering  etc and so it should be understood for all the other three truthsAnd further it is said The knowledge of one who possesses the path is knowledge of suffering and it is knowledge of the origin of suffering and it is knowledge of the cessation of suffering and it is knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering As the lamp burns the wick so his path knowledge fully understands sufferingand as the lamp uses up the oil so the knowledge realizes cessation which brings defilements to an end This is how the application of the simile should be understoodAnother method as the sun when it rises performs four functions simultaneously with its appearanceit illuminates visible objects dispels darkness causes light to be seen and allays cold so too path knowledge  penetrates to cessation by penetrating to it with realizingas the sun dispels darkness so path knowledge abandons originas the sun allays cold so path knowledge realizes the cessation which is the tranquilizing of defilements This is how the application of the simile should be understoodAnother method as a boat performs four functions simultaneously in a single momentit leaves the hither shore it cleaves the stream it carries its cargo and it approaches the further shore so too path knowledge  penetrates to cessation by penetrating to it with realizingAnd here as the boat leaves the hither shore so path knowledge fully understands sufferingas the boat approaches the further shore so path knowledge realizes cessation which is the further shore This is how the application of the simile should be understoodSo when his knowledge occurs with the four functions in a single moment at the time of penetrating the four truths then the four truths have a single penetration in the sense of trueness in sixteen waysThere is single penetration of the four truths in the sense of trueness in sixteen aspectsThe four truths in these sixteen ways are included as oneWhat is included as one is unityUnity is penetrated by a single knowledge Thus the four truths have a single penetration Here it may be asked Since there are other meanings of suffering etc too such as a disease a tumour  etc why then are only four mentioned for eachWe answer that in this context it is better because of what is evident through seeing the other three truths in each caseFirstly in the passage beginning Herein what is knowledge of sufferingIt is the understanding the act of understanding  that arises contingent upon suffering  knowledge of the truths is presented as having a single truth as its object individuallyBut in the passage beginning Bhikkhus he who sees suffering also sees its origin  it is presented as accomplishing its function with respect to the other three truths simultaneously with its making one of them its objectAs regards these two contexts when firstly knowledge makes each truth its object singly then when suffering is made the object suffering has the characteristic of oppressing as its individual essence but its sense of being formed becomes evident through seeing origin because that suffering is accumulated formed agglomerated by the origin which has the characteristic of accumulatingThen the cooling path removes the burning of the defilements and so sufferings sense of burning becomes evident through seeing the path as the beautys ugliness did to the venerable Nanda through seeing the celestial nymphs But its sense of changing becomes evident through seeing cessation as not subject to change which needs no explainingLikewise when origin is made the object origin has the characteristic of accumulating as its individual essence but its sense of source becomes evident through seeing suffering just as the fact that unsuitable food is the source of a sickness becomes evident through seeing how a sickness arises owing to such foodIts sense of bondage becomes evident through seeing cessation which has no bondsAnd its sense of impediment becomes evident through seeing the path which is the outletLikewise when cessation is made the object cessation has the characteristic of an escape But its sense of seclusion becomes evident through seeing origin as unsecludedIts sense of being not formed becomes evident through seeing the path for the path has never been seen by him before in the beginningless round of rebirths and yet even that is formed since it has conditions and so the unformedness of the conditionless becomes quite clearBut its sense of being deathless becomes evident through seeing suffering for suffering is poison and Nibbāna is deathlessLikewise when the path is made the object the path has the characteristic of the outlet But its sense of cause becomes evident through seeing origin thus That is not the cause but on the contrary this is the cause for the attaining of NibbānaIts sense of seeing becomes evident through seeing cessation as the eyes clearness becomes evident to one who sees very subtle visible objects and thinks How clear my eye isIts sense of dominance becomes evident through seeing suffering just as the superiority of lordly people becomes evident through seeing wretched people afflicted with many diseases  So in that first context four senses are stated for each truth because in the case of each truth individually one sense becomes evident as the specific characteristic while the other three become evident through seeing the remaining three truthsAt the path moment however all these senses are penetrated simultaneously by a single knowledge that has four functions with respect to suffering and the restBut about those who would have it that the different truths are penetrated to separately more is said in the Abhidhamma in the Kathāvatthu as the lamp dispels the darkness so the knowledge abandons originas the lamp makes the light appear so the knowledge as right view develops the path in other words the states consisting in right thinking etc by acting as conascence etc for themAnd here also as the sun illuminates visible objects so path knowledge fully understands sufferingas the sun causes light to be seen so path knowledge as right view develops the other path factors by acting as their conascence condition etcas the boat cleaves the stream so path knowledge abandons originas the boat carries its cargo so path knowledge develops the other path factors by acting as their conascence condition etcas it is saidHow is there single penetration of the four truths in the sense of truenessthe path has the meaning of outlet meaning of cause meaning of seeing meaning of dominance as its meaning of truenesscessation has the meaning of escape meaning of seclusion meaning of being not formed meaning of deathlessness as its meaning of truenessorigin has the meaning of accumulation meaning of source meaning of bondage meaning of impediment as its meaning of truenesssuffering has the meaning of oppressing meaning of being formed meaning of burning  meaning of change as its meaning of truenessNow as to those four functions beginning with fullunderstanding which were mentioned above  Fullunderstanding is threefold So too abandoning and realizingAnd two developings are reckoned Thus should be known the exposition Fullunderstanding is threefold that is full understanding as the known fullunderstanding as investigating  and full understanding as abandoning  Herein  Understanding that is directknowledge is knowledge in the sense of the known  It is briefly stated thus Whatever states are directly known are known  It is given in detail in the way beginning Bhikkhus all is to be directly knownAnd what is all that is to be directly knownEye is to be directly known   fullunderstanding as the known is summarized thus Its particular plane is the direct knowing of mentalitymateriality with its conditions is summarized thus Understanding that is fullunderstanding is knowledge in the sense of investigation   It is briefly stated thus Whatever states are fully understood are investigated   Bhikkhus all is to be fully understoodAnd what is all that is to be fully understoodThe eye is to be fully understood  Fullunderstanding as investigating  It is given in detail in the way beginning Its particular plane starts with comprehension by groups and occurring as investigation of impermanence suffering and notself it extends as far as conformity  Fullunderstanding as abandoning is summarized thus Understanding that is abandoning is knowledge in the sense of giving up  It is stated in detail thus Whatever states are abandoned are given up  It occurs in the way beginning Through the contemplation of impermanence he abandons the perception of permanence  Its plane extends from the contemplation of dissolution up to path knowledge This is what is intended hereOr alternatively fullunderstanding as the known and fullunderstanding as investigating have that third kind as their aim too and whatever states a man abandons are certainly known and investigated and so all three kinds of fullunderstanding can be understood in this way as the function of path knowledge So too abandoning abandoning is threefold too like fullunderstanding that is abandoning by suppressing abandoning by substitution of opposites and abandoning by cutting off Herein when any of the mundane kinds of concentration suppresses opposing states such as the hindrances that act of suppressing which is like the pressing down of waterweed by placing a porous pot on weedfilled water is called abandoning by suppressingBut the suppression of only the hindrances is given in the text thus And there is abandoning of the hindrances by suppression in one who develops the first jhāna  However that should be understood as so stated because of the obviousness of the suppression thenFor even before and after the jhāna as well hindrances do not invade consciousness suddenly but applied thought etc are suppressed only at the moment of actual absorption in the second jhāna etc But what is called abandoning by substitution of opposites is the abandoning of any given state that ought to be abandoned through the means of a particular factor of knowledge which as a constituent of insight is opposed to it like the abandoning of darkness at night through the means of a lightthe abandoning of apprehension contrary to truth through the means of conformitythe abandoning by substitution of opposites is Herein  the way in which the abandoning of the perception of permanence etc takes place through the means of the seven contemplations beginning with that of impermanence has already been explained under the contemplation of dissolution Contemplation of destruction however is the knowledge in one who effects the resolution of the compact and so sees destruction as impermanent in the sense of destructionThrough the means of that knowledge there comes to be the abandoning of the perception of compactnessContemplation of fall is stated thusDefining both to be alike By inference from that same objectIntentness on cessationthese Are insight in the mark of fall It is intentness on cessation in other words on that same dissolution after seeing dissolution of both seen and unseen formations by personal experience and by inference respectively Through the means of that contemplation there comes to be the abandoning of accumulationWhen a man sees with insight that The things for the sake of which I might accumulate kamma are thus subject to fall his consciousness no longer inclines to accumulationContemplation of change is the act of seeing according to the material septad etc how momentary occurrences in continuity take place differently by gradually diverging from any definitionContemplation of the signless is the same as the contemplation of impermanence Through its means the sign of permanence is abandonedContemplation of the desireless is the same as the contemplation of pain Through its means desire for pleasure and hope for pleasure are abandonedContemplation of voidness is the same as the contemplation of notself Through its means the misinterpreting that a self exists is abandonedInsight into states that is higher understanding is stated thusHaving reflected on the object Dissolution he contemplatesAppearance then as emptythis Is insight of higher understanding Insight so described occurs after knowing materiality etc as object by seeing the dissolution both of that object and of the consciousness whose object it was and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution in this way Only formations break up It is the death of formations There is nothing elseTaking that insight as higher understanding and as insight with respect to states it is called insight into states that is higher understanding Through its means misinterpreting due to grasping at a core is abandoned because it has been clearly seen that there is no core of permanence and no core of selfCorrect knowledge and vision is the discernment of mentalitymateriality with its conditions Through its means misinterpreting due to confusion that occurs in this way Was I in the past   and in this way The world was created by an Overlord are abandonedContemplation of danger is knowledge seeing danger in all kinds of becoming etc which as arisen owing to appearance as terror Through its means misinterpreting due to reliance is abandoned since he does not see any formation to be relied on for shelterContemplation of reflection is the reflection that effects the means to liberation Through its means nonreflection is abandonedContemplation of turning away is equanimity about formations and conformityFor at that point his mind is said to retreat retract and recoil from the whole field of formations as a water drop does on a lotus leaf that slopes a littleThat is why through its means misinterpreting due to bondage is abandoned The meaning is abandoning of the occurrence of defilement that consists in misinterpreting defiled by the bondage of sense desires and so onAbandoning by substitution of the opposites should be understood in detail in this wayBut in the texts it is stated in brief thus Abandoning of views by substitution of opposites comes about in one who develops concentration partaking of penetration  The abandoning of the states beginning with the fetters by the noble path knowledge in such a way that they never occur again like a tree struck by a thunderbolt is called abandoning by cutting offWith reference to this it is said Abandoning by cutting off comes about in one who develops the supramundane path that leads to the destruction of defilements So of these three kinds of abandoning it is only abandoning by cutting off that is intended hereBut since that meditators previous abandoning by suppression and by substitution by opposites have that third kind as their aim too all three kinds of abandoning can therefore be understood in this way as the function of path knowledgeFor when a man has gained an empire by killing off the opposing kings what was done by him previous to that is also called done by the king Realizing is divided into two as mundane realizing and supramundane realizing And it is threefold too with the subdivision of the supramundane into two as seeing and developing Herein the touch of the first jhāna etc as given in the way beginning I am an obtainer a master of the first jhāna the first jhāna has been realized by me  is called mundane realizingTouch is the touching with the contact of knowledge by personal experience on arriving thus This has been arrived at by meWith reference to this meaning realization is summarized thus Understanding that is realization is knowledge in the sense of touch  after which it is described thus Whatever states are realized are touched Also those states which are not aroused in ones own continuity and are known through knowledge that depends on another are realizedAnd what is all that should be realizedThe eye should be realized  and so onAnd it is further said One who sees materiality realizes itOne who sees feeling  perception  formations  consciousness realizes itOne who sees the eye   ageing and death realizes it One who sees suffering    One who sees Nibbāna which merges in the deathless in the sense of the end realizes itWhatever states are realized are touched  The seeing of Nibbāna at the moment of the first path is realizing as seeingAt the other path moments it is realizing as developingAnd it is intended as twofold hereSo realizing of Nibbāna as seeing and as developing should be understood as a function of this knowledge And two developings are reckoned but developing is also reckoned as twofold namely as mundane developing and as supramundane developing Herein the arousing of mundane virtue concentration and understanding and the influencing of the continuity by their means is mundane developingAnd the arousing of supramundane virtue concentration and understanding and the influencing of the continuity by them is supramundane developingOf these it is the supramundane that is intended hereFor this fourfold knowledge arouses supramundane virtue etcsince it is their conascence condition and it influences the continuity by their means So it is only supramundane developing that is a function of itTherefore these are theFunctions of fullunderstanding and the rest As stated when truths are penetrated toEach one of which ought to be recognized According to its individual essenceNow with reference to the stanzaWhen a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understanding it was said above After he has perfected the two purifications that are the roots then he can develop the five purifications that are the trunk And at this point the detailed exposition of the system for developing understanding in the proper way as it has been handed down is completedSo the question How should it be developed  is now answeredin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Understandingand so the suppression of the hindrances then is obviousIt is in fact the abandoning firstly of the false view of individuality through the means of delimitation of mentalitymaterialitythe abandoning of not looking on equably through the means of equanimitythe abandoning of nonreflection through the means of reflectionthe abandoning of lack of desire for deliverance through the means of desire for deliverancethe abandoning of the perception of delight through the means of the contemplation of dispassion the abandoning of the perception of enjoyment through the means of seeing dangerthe abandoning of the perception of nonterror in what is terror through the means of appearance as terrorthe abandoning of the eternity view through the means of seeing fallthe abandoning of the annihilation view through the means of seeing risethe abandoning of perception of the path in what is not the path through the means of the definition of what is the path and what is not the paththe abandoning of apprehension of a conglomeration as I and mine through the means of comprehension by groupsthe abandoning of both the nocause view and the fictitiouscause view and also of the stain of doubt through the means of discerning conditionsAnd also in the case of the eighteen principal insights the abandoning of the perception of the perception of permanence through the means of the contemplation of impermanenceof the perception of pleasure through the means of the contemplation of painof the perception of self through the means of the contemplation of notselfof delight through the means of the contemplation of dispassion of greed through the means of the contemplation of fading awayof originating through the means of the contemplation of cessationof grasping through the means of the contemplation of relinquishmentof the perception of compactness through the means of the contemplation of destructionof accumulation through the means of the contemplation of fallof the perception of lastingness through the means of the contemplation of changeof the sign through the means of the contemplation of the signlessof desire through the means of the contemplation of the desirelessof misinterpreting  through the means of the contemplation of voidnessof misinterpreting due to grasping at a core through the means of insight into states that is higher understandingof misinterpreting due to confusion through the means of correct knowledge and visionof misinterpreting due to reliance on formations through the means of the contemplation of danger in themof nonreflection through the means of the contemplation of reflectionof misinterpreting due to bondage through means of contemplation of turning away or it is the act of seeing change in the two aspects of the ageing and the death of what is arisen Through the means of that contemplation the perception of lastingness is abandonedfor it is said referring to that Bhikkhus all should be realizedcalled The Description of Purification by Knowledge and VisionThe twentysecond chapterThe words By personal experience exclude taking it as an object by inference For what is intended here as the contact of knowledge is knowing by personal experience through reviewing thus This is like thisWith the contact of knowledge by personal experience means by personal experience of it as object which is what the contact of knowledge is calledWHAT ARE THE BENEFITS IN DEVELOPING UNDERSTANDING To that question which was asked abovewe reply that this development of understanding has many hundred benefitsBut it would be impossible to explain its benefits in detail however long a time were taken over itBriefly though its benefits should be understood as these removal of the various defilements experience of the taste of the noble fruit ability to attain the attainment of cessation and achievement of worthiness to receive gifts and so onHerein it should be understood that one of the benefits of the mundane development of understanding is the removal of the various defilements beginning with mistaken view of individuality This starts with the delimitation of mentalitymaterialityThen one of the benefits of the supramundane development of understanding is the removal at the path moment of the various defilements beginning with the fettersWith dreadful thump the thunderbolt Annihilates the rockThe fire whipped by the driving wind Annihilates the woodThe radiant orb of solar flame Annihilates the darkDeveloped understanding too Annihilates inveterateDefilements netted overgrowth The source of every woeThis blessing in this very life A man himself may knowNot only the removal of the various defilements but also the experience of the taste of the noble fruit is a benefit of the development of understandingFor it is the fruitions of streamentry etcthe fruits of asceticismthat are called the noble fruitIts taste is experienced in two waysOf these only its occurrence in the cognitive series of the path has been shown Furthermore when people say that the fruit is the mere abandoning of fetters and nothing more than that the following sutta can be cited in order to convince them that they are wrong How is it that understanding of the tranquilizing of effort is knowledge of fruitAt the moment of the streamentry path right view in the sense of seeing emerges from wrong view and it emerges from the defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that wrong view and externally it emerges from all signs Right view arises because of the tranquilizing of that effortThis is the fruit of the path  and this should be given in detailAlso such passages as The four paths and the four fruitsthese states have a measureless object However in order to show how it occurs in the attainment of fruition there is the following set of questions What is fruition attainment Who attains it Who do not attain it Why do they attain it How does its attainment come about How is it made to last How does the emergence from it come about What is next to fruition What is fruition next toHerein What is fruition attainment It is absorption in the cessation in which the noble fruition consists Who attains it Who do not attain it No ordinary men attain itWhyBecause it is beyond their reachBut all Noble Ones attain itWhyBecause it is within their reachBut those who have reached a higher path do not attain a lower fruition because the state of each successive person is more tranquilized than the one belowAnd those who have only reached a lower path do not attain a higher fruition because it is beyond their reachBut each one attains his appropriate fruition This is what has been agreed hereBut there are some who say that the streamenterer and oncereturner do not attain itThe reason they give is that only these two show achievement in concentrationBut that is no reason since even the ordinary man attains such mundane concentration as is within his reachBut why argue here over what is and what is not a reasonIs it not said in the texts as follows Which ten states of changeoflineage arise through insightFor the purpose of obtaining the streamentry path it overcomes arising occurrence   despair and externally the sign of formations thus it is changeoflineageFor the purpose of attaining the streamentry fruition  For the purpose of attaining the oncereturn path  For the purpose of attaining the oncereturn fruition  For the purpose of attaining the nonreturn path  For the purpose of attaining the nonreturn fruition  For the purpose of attaining the Arahant path  For the purpose of attaining the Arahant fruition  For the purpose of attaining the void abiding  For the purpose of attaining the signless abiding it overcomes arising occurrence   despair and externally the sign of formations thus it is changeoflineage From that it must be concluded that all Noble Ones attain each their own fruit Why do they attain it For the purpose of abiding in bliss here and nowFor just as a king experiences royal bliss and a deity experiences divine bliss so too the Noble Ones think We shall experience the noble supramundane bliss and after deciding on the duration they attain the attainment of fruition whenever they choose How does its attainment come about How is it made to last How does the emergence from it come about In the first place its attainment comes about for two reasons with not bringing to mind any object other than Nibbāna and with bringing Nibbāna to mindaccording as it is said Friend there are two conditions for the attainment of the signless minddeliverance they are the nonbringing to mind of all signs and the bringing to mind of the signless element Now the process of attaining it is as followsA noble disciple who seeks the attainment of fruition should go into solitary retreat He should see formations with insight according to rise and fall and so onWhen that insight has progressed as far as conformity then comes changeoflineage knowledge with formations as its object And immediately next to it consciousness becomes absorbed in cessation with the attainment of fruitionAnd here it is only fruition not path that arises even in a trainer because his tendency is to fruition attainmentBut there are those who say that when a streamenterer embarks on insight thinking I shall attain fruition attainment he becomes a oncereturnerand a oncereturner a nonreturner They should be told In that case a nonreturner becomes an Arahant and an Arahant a Paccekabuddha and a Paccekabuddha a BuddhaFor that reason and because it is contradicted as well by the text quoted above none of that should be acceptedOnly this should be accepted fruition itself not path arises also in the trainerAnd if the path he has arrived at had the first jhānahis fruition will have the first jhāna too when it arisesIf the path has the second so will the fruition And so with the other jhānasThis firstly is how attaining comes about It is made to last in three ways because of the words Friend there are three conditions for the persistence of the signless minddeliverance they are the nonbringing to mind of all signs the bringing to mind of the signless element and the prior volition Herein the prior volition is the predetermining of the time before attainingThis is how it is made to last Emergence from it comes about in two ways because of the words Friend there are two conditions for the emergence from the signless mind deliverance they are the bringing to mind of all signs and the nonbringing to mind of the signless element Herein of all signs means the sign of materiality sign of feeling perception formations and consciousnessOf course a man does not bring all those to mind at once but this is said in order to include allSo the emergence from the attainment of fruition comes about in him when he brings to mind whatever is the object of the lifecontinuum What is next to fruition What is fruition next to In the first case either fruition itself is next to fruition or the lifecontinuum is next to itBut there is fruition that is next to the path there is that next to fruition there is that next to changeoflineage and there is that next to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperceptionHerein it is next to the path in the cognitive series of the path Each one that is subsequent to a previous one is next to fruition Each first one in the attainments of fruition is next to changeoflineageAnd conformity should be understood here as changeoflineageIn trainers conformity is a condition as proximity condition for fruition attainment  The fruition by means of which there is emergence from the attainment of cessation is next to the base consisting of neither perception nonperceptionHerein all except the fruition that arises in the cognitive series of the path occur as fruition attainmentSo whether it arises in the cognitive series of the path or in fruition attainmentWhich tranquilizes all distressIts beauty from the Deathless drawsAsceticisms fruit sublime Its calm from lack of worldlinessOf a sweet purifying bliss It is the fountainhead besidesWhose honeysweet ambrosia A deathless sustenance providesThis peerless bliss which is the taste The noble fruit provides and soNow if a wise man cultivates His understanding he shall knowOf flavour of the noble fruit A blessing of fulfilled insightThis is the reason why they call Experience here and now arightthat is to say in its occurrence in the cognitive series of the path and in its occurrence in the attainment of fruitionand An exalted state is a condition as proximity condition for a measureless state  establish the meaning hereand that only the two above them attain itfor it is by determining it thus I shall emerge at such a time that it lasts until that time comesfor this is said in the Paṭṭhāna In the Arahant conformity is a condition as proximity condition for fruition attainmentwho maintain thisfor they take the sutta wrongly which says Arahantship is said friend Sāriputta what is ArahantshipThe destruction of greed the destruction of hate the destruction of delusion that is what is called Arahantship  taking it literally and asserting that nothing exists called Arahantship and that it is only the abandoning of defilements that is so called by common usage And they deny that there are any other fruitionsIt is the Andhakas etcAlthough they are resultant states nevertheless the states of fruition attainment occur in the noble person only when he chooses since they do not arise without the preliminary work and do so only when they are given predominanceWhy does changeoflineage not have Nibbāna as its object here as it does when it precedes the pathBecause states belonging to fruition are not associated with an outletas in the case of the pathFor this is said What states are an outletThe four unincluded paths Those of the Abhayagiri Monastery in AnurādhapuraThe volition is attaining after deciding the time limit in this way When the moon or the sun has gone so far I shall emerge which is an act of volitionIt is because he is called emerged from attainment as soon as the lifecontinuum consciousness has arisen that he brings to mind that which is the object of the lifecontinuum is saidKamma etc are called the object of the lifecontinuum And not only the experience of the taste of the noble fruit but also the ability to attain the attainment of cessation should be understood as a benefit of the development of understandingNow in order to explain the attainment of cessation there is this set of questions What is the attainment of cessation Who attains it Who do not attain it Where do they attain it Why do they attain it How does its attainment come about How is it made to last How does the emergence from it come about Towards what does the mind of one who has emerged tend What is the difference between one who has attained it and one who is dead Is the attainment of cessation formed or unformed mundane or supramundane produced or unproducedHerein What is the attainment of cessation It is the nonoccurrence of consciousness and its concomitants owing to their progressive cessation Who attains it Who do not attain it No ordinary men no stream enterers or oncereturners and no nonreturners and Arahants who are bare insight workers attain itBut both nonreturners and those with cankers destroyed who are obtainers of the eight attainments attain itFor it is said Understanding that is mastery owing to possession of two powers to the tranquilization of three formations to sixteen kinds of exercise of knowledge and to nine kinds of exercise of concentration is knowledge of the attainment of cessation And these qualifications are not to be found together in any persons other than nonreturners and those whose cankers are destroyed who are obtainers of the eight attainmentsThat is why only they and no others attain itBut which are the two powers And the three formations  and masteryHere there is no need for us to say anythingOf the two powers of the two powers the serenity power and the insight powerWhat is serenity as a powerThe unification of the mind and nondistraction due to renunciation are serenity as a powerThe unification of the mind and nondistraction due to nonill will are serenity as a power The unification of the mind and nondistraction due to perception of light  to nondistraction  to defining of states  to knowledge  to gladness  to the eight attainments the ten kasiṇas the ten recollections the nine charnelground contemplations and the thirtytwo modes of mindfulness of breathing  the unification of the mind and nondistraction due to breathing out in one who is contemplating relinquishment is serenity as a powerIn what sense is serenity a powerOwing to the first jhāna it does not waver on account of the hindrances thus serenity is a powerOwing to the second jhāna it does not waver on account of applied and sustained thought thus serenity is a power   Owing to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception it does not waver on account of the perception of the base consisting of nothingness thus serenity is a powerIt does not waver and vacillate and hesitate on account of agitation and on account of the defilements and the aggregates that accompany agitation thus serenity is a powerThis is the serenity powerWhat is insight as a powerContemplation of impermanence is insight as a powerContemplation of pain  Contemplation of notself  Contemplation of dispassion  Contemplation of fading away  Contemplation of cessation  Contemplation of relinquishment is insight as a powerContemplation of impermanence in materiality   Contemplation of relinquishment in materiality is insight as a powerContemplation of impermanence in feeling  in perception  in formations  in consciousness is insight as a power  Contemplation of relinquishment in consciousness is insight as a power Contemplation of impermanence in the eye   Contemplation of impermanence in ageinganddeath  Contemplation of relinquishment in ageinganddeath is insight as a powerIn what sense is insight a powerOwing to the contemplation of impermanence it does not waver on account of perception of permanence thus insight is a powerOwing to the contemplation of pain it does not waver on account of perception of pleasure  Owing to the contemplation of notself it does not waver on account of the perception of self  Owing to the contemplation of dispassion it does not waver on account of delight  Owing to the contemplation of fading away it does not waver on account of greed  Owing to the contemplation of cessation it does not waver on account of arising  Owing to the contemplation of relinquishment it does not waver on account of grasping thus insight is a powerIt does not waver and vacillate and hesitate on account of ignorance and on account of the defilements and the aggregates that accompany ignoranceOwing to the tranquilization of three formations owing to the tranquilization of what three formationsIn one who has attained the second jhāna the verbal formations consisting in applied and sustained thought are quite tranquilizedIn one who has attained the fourth jhāna the bodily formations consisting in inbreaths and out breaths are quite tranquilizedIn one who has attained cessation of perception and feeling the mental formations consisting in feeling and perception are quite tranquilizedIt is owing to the tranquilization of these three formationsOwing to sixteen kinds of exercise of knowledge owing to what sixteen kinds of exercise of knowledgeContemplation of impermanence is a kind of exercise of knowledgeContemplation of pain  Contemplation of notself  Contemplation of dispassion  Contemplation of fading away  Contemplation of cessation  Contemplation of relinquishment  Contemplation of turning away is a kind of exercise of knowledgeThe streamentry path is a kind of exercise of knowledgeThe attainment of the fruition of streamentry It is owing to these sixteen kinds of exercise of knowledgeOwing to nine kinds of exercise of concentration owing to what nine kinds of exercise of concentrationThe first jhāna is a kind of exercise of concentrationThe second jhāna  The third jhāna  The fourth jhāna  Th e attainment of the base consisting of boundless space  The attainment of the base consisting of boundless consciousness  The attainment of the base consisting of nothingness   The attainment of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is a kind of exercise of concentrationAnd the applied thought and sustained thought and happiness and bliss and unification of mind that have the purpose of attaining the first jhāna   And the applied thought and sustained thought and happiness and bliss and unification of mind that have the purpose of attaining the attainment of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperceptionIt is owing to these nine kinds of exercise of concentrationMastery there are five kinds of mastery There is mastery in adverting in attaining in resolving in emerging in reviewingHe adverts to the first jhāna where when and for as long as he wishes he has no difficulty in adverting thus it is mastery in advertingHe attains the first jhāna where when and for as long as he wishes he has no difficulty in attaining thus it is mastery in attaining He resolves upon the duration of the first jhāna where  thus it is mastery in resolving He emerges from the first jhāna  thus it is mastery in emerging He reviews the first jhāna where when and for as long as he wishes he has no difficulty in reviewing thus it is mastery in reviewingHe adverts to the second jhāna   He reviews the attainment of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception where when and for as long as he wishesThese are the five kinds of mastery And here the words Owing to sixteen kinds of exercise of knowledge state the maximumBut in a nonreturner the mastery is owing to fourteen kinds of exercise of knowledgeIf that is so then does it not come about also in the oncereturner owing to twelve And in the streamenterer owing to tenIt does not Because the greed based on the cords of sense desire which is an obstacle to concentration is unabandoned in themthat the serenity power is not perfected Since it is not perfected they are not owing to want of power able to attain the attainment of cessation which has to be attained by the two powersBut it is abandoned in the nonreturner and so his power is perfectedSince his power is perfected he is able to attain itHence the Blessed One said Profitable consciousness of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception in one emerging from cessation is a condition as proximity condition for the attainment of fruition For this is said in the Great Book of the Paṭṭhāna with reference only to non returners emerging from cessation Where do they attain it In the fiveconstituent becomingWhyBecause of the necessity for the succession of all the attainments But in the fourconstituent becoming there is no arising of the first jhāna etcBut some say that is because of the lack of a physical basis for the mind there Why do they attain it Being wearied by the occurrence and dissolution of formations they attain it thinking Let us dwell in bliss by being without consciousness here and now and reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna How does its attainment come about It comes about in one who performs the preparatory tasks by striving with serenity and insight and causes the cessation of consciousness belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperceptionOne who strives with serenity alone reaches the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception and remains thereBut it is one who strives with both and after performing the preparatory tasks causes the cessation of consciousness belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception who attains it This is in briefBut the detail is this When a bhikkhu who desires to attain cessation has finished all that has to do with his meal and has washed his hands and feet well he sits down on a wellprepared seat in a secluded place Having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect established mindfulness in front of him he attains the first jhāna and on emerging he sees the formations in it with insight as impermanent painful notselfThis insight is threefold as insight that discerns formations insight for the attainment of fruition and insight for the attainment of cessationHerein insight that discerns formations whether sluggish or keen is the proximate cause only for a pathInsight for the attainment of fruition which is only valid when keen is similar to that for the development of a pathInsight for the attainment of cessation is only valid when it is not oversluggish and not overkeenTherefore he sees those formations with insight that is not oversluggish and not overkeenAfter that he attains the second jhāna and on emerging he sees formations with insight in like mannerAfter that he attains the third jhāna   After that he attains the base consisting of boundless consciousness and on emerging he sees the formations in it in like mannerLikewise he attains the base consisting of nothingness On emerging from that he does the fourfold preparatory task that is to say about nondamage to others property the Communitys waiting the Masters summons and the limit of the duration Herein nondamage to others property refers to what the bhikkhu has about him that is not his personal property a robe and bowl or a bed and chair or a living room or any other kind of requisite kept by him but the property of various others It should be resolved that such property will not be damaged will not be destroyed by fire water wind thieves rats and so onHere is the form of the resolve During these seven days let this and this not be burnt by fire let it not be swept off by water let it not be spoilt by wind let it not be stolen by thieves let it not be devoured by rats and so onIf he does not resolve in this way they may be destroyed by fire etc as in the case of the Elder Mahā NāgaThe elder it seems went for alms into the village where his mother a lay follower livedShe gave him rice gruel and seated him in the sitting hallThe elder sat down and attained cessationWhile he was sitting there the hall caught fire The other bhikkhus each picked up their seats and fledThe villagers gathered together and seeing the elder they said What a lazy monk What a lazy monkThe fire burned the grass thatch the bamboos and timbers and it encircled the elderPeople brought water and put it out They removed the ashes did repairs scattered flowers and then stood respectfully waitingThe elder emerged at the time he had determined Seeing them he said I am discovered  and he rose up into the air and went to Piyaṅgu IslandThis is nondamage to others propertyThere is no special resolving to be done for what is his own personal property such as the inner and outer robes or the seat he is sitting onHe protects all that by means of the attainment itself like those of the venerable SañjīvaAnd this is said There was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sañjīva There was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sāriputta  The Communitys waiting is the Communitys expectingThe meaning is till this bhikkhu comes there is no carrying out of acts of the CommunityAnd here it is not the actual Communitys waiting that is the preparatory task but the adverting to the waitingSo it should be adverted to in this way While I am sitting for seven days in the attainment of cessation if the Community wants to enact a resolution etc I shall emerge before any bhikkhu comes to summon meBut if he does not do so then perhaps the Community assembles and not seeing him it is asked Where is the bhikkhu so and so They reply He has attained cessation The Community dispatches a bhikkhu telling him Go and summon him in the name of the CommunityThen as soon as the bhikkhu stands within his hearing and merely says The Community is waiting for you friend he emergesSuch is the importance of the Communitys orderSo he should attain in suchwise that by adverting to it beforehand he emerges by himself The Masters summons here too it is the adverting to the Masters summons that is the preparatory taskSo that also should be adverted to in this way While I am sitting for seven days in the attainment of cessation if the Master after examining a case makes known a course of training or teaches the Dhamma the origin of which discourse is some need that has arisen I shall emerge before anyone comes to summon meBut if he does not do so when the Community assembles the Master not seeing him asks Where is the bhikkhu so and so They reply He has attained cessation Then he dispatches a bhikkhu telling him Go and summon him in my nameAs soon as the bhikkhu stands within his hearing and merely says The Master calls the venerable one he emergesSuch is the importance of the Masters summons So he should attain in such wise that by adverting to it beforehand he emerges himself The limit of duration is the limit of lifes durationFor this bhikkhu should be very careful to determine what the limit of his lifes duration isHe should attain only after adverting in this way Will my own vital formations go on occurring for seven days or will they notFor if he attains it without adverting when the vital formations are due to cease within seven days then since the attainment of cessation cannot ward off his deathSo he should attain only after adverting to thatFor while it may be permissible to omit adverting to othersNow when he has thus attained the base consisting of nothingness and emerged and done this preparatory task he then attains the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperceptionThen after one or two turns of consciousness have passed he becomes without consciousness he achieves cessationBut why do consciousnesses not go on occurring in him after the two consciousnessesBecause the effort is directed to cessationFor this bhikkhus mounting through the eight attainments coupling together the states of serenity and insight is directed to successive cessation not to attaining the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception So it is because the effort is directed to cessation that no more than the two consciousnesses occurBut if a bhikkhu emerges from the base consisting of nothingness without having done this preparatory task and then attains the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception he is unable then to become without consciousness he returns to the base consisting of nothingness and settles down thereAnd here the simile of the man and the road not previously travelled may be toldA man who had not previously travelled a certain road came to a ravine cut by water or after crossing a deep morass he came to a rock heated by a fierce sun Then without arranging his inner and outer garments he descended into the ravine but came up again for fear of wetting his belongings and remained on the bankor he walked up on to the rock but on burning his feet he returned to the near side and waited thereHerein just as the man as soon as he had descended into the ravine or walked up on to the hot rock turned back and remained on the near side because he had not seen to the arrangement of his inner and outer garments so too as soon as the meditator has attained the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception he turns back and remains in the base consisting of nothingness because the preparatory task has not been doneJust as when a man who has travelled that road before comes to that place he puts his inner garment on securely and taking the other in his hand crosses over the ravine or so acts as to tread only lightly on the hot rock and accordingly gets to the other side so too when the bhikkhu does the preparatory task and then attains the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception then he achieves cessation which is the other side by becoming without consciousness How is it made to last It lasts as long as the time predetermined for its duration unless interrupted meanwhile by the exhaustion of the life span by the waiting of the Community or by the Masters summons How does the emergence from it come about The emergence comes about in two ways thus by means of the fruition of nonreturn in the case of the non returner or by means of the fruition of Arahantship in the case of the Arahant Towards what does the mind of one who has emerged tend It tends towards NibbānaFor this is said When a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling friend Visākha his consciousness inclines to seclusion leans to seclusion tends to seclusion  What is the difference between one who has attained and one who is deadThis is also given in a sutta according as it is said When a bhikkhu is dead friend has completed his term his bodily formations have ceased and are quite still his verbal formations have ceased and are quite still his mental formations have ceased and are quite still his life is exhausted his heat has subsided and his faculties are broken upWhen a bhikkhu has entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling his bodily formations have ceased and are quite still his verbal formations have ceased and are quite still his mental formations have ceased and are quite still his life is unexhausted his heat has not subsided his faculties are quite whole  As to the question is the attainment of cessation formed or unformed etc It is not classifiable as formed or unformed mundane or supramundaneWhyBecause it has no individual essenceBut since it comes to be attained by one who attains it it is therefore permissible to say that it is produced not unproducedThis too is an attainment which A Noble One may cultivateThe peace it gives is reckoned as Nibbāna here and nowA wise man by developing The noble understanding canWith it himself endow So this ability is calledA boon of understanding too The noble paths allowfor it has all been said in the description of the summary quoted aboveaccording as it is saidthus insight is a powerThe oncereturn path  The attainment of the fruition of oncereturn  The non return path  The attainment of the fruition of nonreturn  The Arahant path  The attainment of the fruition of Arahantship is a kind of exercise of knowledgehe has no difficulty in reviewing thus it is mastery in reviewingIt is because that is not abandoned in themand so it is not possible to attain it therewhile one who strives with insight alone reaches the attainment of fruition and remains thereWhen he has resolved in this way they are not in danger during the seven daysOne who attains it after doing this emerges at exactly that timeFor when he has seated himself after doing so he emerges at exactly that timebecause there is no dying during cessation he consequently emerges from the attainment meanwhileit is said that this must be adverted toThe word profitable used in this Paṭṭhāna passage shows that it appies only to nonreturners otherwise functional would have been saidThey say so because of absence of heartbasis but the meaning is because of absence of basis called physical bodyFor if anyone were to attain cessation in the immaterial worlds he would become indefinable owing to the non existence of any consciousness or consciousness concomitant at all and he would be as though attained to final Nibbāna without remainder of results of past clingingfor what remainder of results of past clinging could be predicated of him when he had entered into cessationSo it is because of the lack of the necessary factors that there is no attaining of the attainment of cessation in the immaterial worldsReaching the cessation that is Nibbāna as though reaching Nibbāna without remainder of result of past clingingIn bliss means without sufferingIt should be resolved the thought should be arousedFor here the resolve consists in arousing the thoughtIn the nonarising of consciousnessoriginated materiality etc and in the absence of support by a postnascence condition etc the physical body continues the same only for seven days after that it suffers wastage So he limits the duration to seven days when he attains cessation they sayHe should attain only after adverting thus Let sudden death not occurThere is no death during cessation because dying takes place by means of the final lifecontinuum consciousnessFor in the case of sudden death he would not be able to declare final knowledge advise the bhikkhus and testify to the Dispensations power And there would be no reaching the highest path in the case of a nonreturnerthough some say that they are the life span heat and consciousness These are the object only of his normal consciousnessVital formations are the same as life spanThe five aggregates are positivelyproduced always not unpositivelyproduced  they are always formed not unformed Besides they are produced as wellFor among the dhammas that are individual essences it is only Nibbāna that is unpositivelyproduced and unproduced What is the difference between the positivelyproduced and the producedA dhamma that is an individual essence with a beginning and an end in time produced by conditions and marked by the three characteristics is positively produced But besides this what is produced but not positively produced is a dhamma with no individual essence when it is produced by the taking of a name or by attaining the attainment of cessationAnd not only the ability to attain the attainment of cessation but also achievement of worthiness to receive gifts should be understood as a benefit of this supramundane development of understandingFor generally speaking it is because understanding has been developed in these four ways that a person who has developed it is fit for the gifts of the world with its deities fit for its hospitality fit for its offerings and fit for its reverential salutation and an incomparable field of merit for the worldBut in particular firstly one who arrives at development of understanding of the first path with sluggish insight and limp faculties is called one who will be reborn seven times at most he traverses the round of rebirths seven times in the happy destiniesOne who arrives with medium insight and medium faculties is called one who goes from noble family to noble family with two or three rebirths in noble families he makes an end of sufferingOne who arrives with keen insight and keen faculties is called one who germinates only once with one rebirth in the human world he makes an end of suffering By developing understanding of the second path he is called a oncereturner He returns once to this world and makes an end of sufferingBy developing understanding of the third path he is called a nonreturnerAccording to the difference in his faculties he in one of five ways  he becomes one who attains Nibbāna early in his next existence or one who attains Nibbāna more than half way through his next existence or one who attains Nibbāna without prompting or one who attains Nibbāna with prompting or one who is going upstream bound for the Highest Gods Herein one who attains Nibbāna early in his next existence attains Nibbāna after reappearing anywhere in the Pure Abodes without reaching the middle of his life span thereOne who attains Nibbāna more than half way through his next existence attains Nibbāna after the middle of his life span thereOne who attains Nibbāna without prompting generates the highest path without prompting with little effortOne who attains Nibbāna with prompting generates the highest path with prompting with effortOne who is going upstream bound for the Highest Gods passes on upwards from wherever he is reborn in the Pure Abodes to the Highest Gods becoming and attains Nibbāna thereBy developing understanding of the fourth path one becomes liberated by faith another liberated by understanding another bothways liberated another one with the triple clear vision another one with the six kinds of directknowledge another one of the great ones whose cankers are destroyed who has reached the categories of discriminationThe noble understanding when Developed will these blessings winAccordingly discerning men Rejoice exceedingly thereinAnd at this pointthe development of understanding with its benefits which is shown in the Path of Purification with its headings of virtue concentration and understanding in the stanza has been fully illustratedcompletes his course after he has left this worldIt was about one who has developed the fourth path that it was said But it is at the moment of the path that he is said to be disentangling that tangleat the moment of fruition he has disentangled the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings in the world with its deities When a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understandingThen as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplecalled The Description of the Benefits of UnderstandingThe twentythird chapterWhen a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understandingThen as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle After we quoted this stanza we then saidOf this same verse composed by the Great SageMy task is now to set

in the distance a cauldron for boiling rice and perceiving it as a boar he fled in fear and terror Again a man who was afraid of pisāca goblins saw a decapitated palm stump at night in a place that was unfamiliar to him and perceiving it as a pisāca goblin he fell down in his fear horror and confusionA formed dhamma with an individual essence is delimited by rise and fall because it is produced after having not been and because after having been it vanishesBut space is called boundless since it has neither rise nor fall because it is a dhamma without individual essenceHe should not give attention to it only as Boundless boundless instead of developing it thus he should give attention to it as Boundless consciousness boundless consciousness or as Consciousness consciousnessSome is said with reference to the Elder UpatissaFor it is put in this way by him in the VimuttimaggaThe word apparently indicates dissent from what followsin the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of Taking a Meditation SubjectThe third chapterSineru is not only  leagues in heightbut measures the same in width and breadthFor this is saidBhikkhus Sineru king of mountains is eightyfour thousand leagues in width and it is eightyfour thousand leagues in breadth Each of the seven surrounding mountains is half as high as that last mentioned that is Yugandhara is half as high as Sineru and so onTheir widths correspond respectively to the heights of Sineru and the restBetween Sineru and Yugandhara and so on the oceans are called bottomless The great ocean gradually slopes from the foot of the worldsphere mountains down as far as the foot of Sineru where it measures in depth as much as Sinerus height And Yugandhara which is half that height rests on the earth as sadhara and the rest dofor it is said Bhikkhus the great ocean gradually slopes gradually tends gradually inclines The mountains stand all round Sineru enclosing it as it wereYugandhara surrounds Sineru then sadhara surrounds Yugandharaand likewise with the othersThe word Blessed is a term of respectMoreover he has abolished greed thus he is blessed  he has abolished hate  delusion

foulness thus he is blessed Or he is a partaker of the ten powers of Perfect Ones  of the four kinds of perfect confidence  of the four discriminations of the six kinds of direct knowledge of the six Enlightened Ones states not shared by disciples  thus he is blessed Blessed One  this is not a name made by a mother  This name Blessed One is a designation based on realizationMoreover with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite an untrue man enters upon and abides in the base of infinite spaceMoreover by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite an untrue man enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousnessMoreover by completely surmounting the base of nothingness an untrue man enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionHe considers thus I have gained the attainment of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception but these other bhikkhus have not gamed the attainment of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionAnd his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdomIt counterstrikes  thus it is a counterstroke  What strikes out  removes what is counter to it is therefore called counterstriking since what is counterstriking strikes out anything counter to itself Paṭihāriya is the same as pāṭihāriya Death is the basis of such pain And this suffices to explain Why death the name of pain should gainAll those whose vitals death attacks With grip that shall no more relaxThen bodily pain severs sinews Joints and so on and continuesAlso when good men cannot bear To part from all that they hold dearWithout distinction as they die Pain grips their minds impartiallyTorture unbearable which racksvarious ordures such as bile phlegm pus blood excrement gorge and so onWhether the mother is twenty thirty or forty years old it is as exceptionally loathsome as an excrement bucket that has not been washed for a like number of yearsfor its scope precisely because of the existence of its use as a mere metaphorlike the word lion It is clungto by the kinds of clinging  thus it is resultof pastclinging  this is the pentad of aggregates as objects of clingingTaking Nibbāna which is the escape from that as its stilling its quieting since there is remainder of it up till the last consciousness of the Arahant after which there is no remainder of it the Nibbāna element is thus conventionally spoken of in two ways as with result of past clinging left and without result of past clinging left First it has to be seen by inference according to the textsAfterwards it gradually comes to be seen by personal experience when the knowledge of development gets strongerWhen the contemplation of impermanence is established then the contemplations of cessation destruction fall and change are partly established When the contemplation of pain is established then the contemplations of dispassion and danger are partly established And when the contemplation of notself is established then the rest are partly establishedTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one

victorious and settles at the head of the battlefieldThere is bhikkhus such a person hereThis is the fifth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhusThese are the five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhusBut he disentangles himself frees himself and goes off wherever he wantsNow it was said  Then next there should Be told the proper way of knowing  Buddha  Goer  and  Refugegoing  Herein the word Buddha is a term for distinguishing creatures either involving a description derived upon a five categorycontinuity fortified by attainment of the supreme liberation that is the sign for unobstructed knowledge of all ideas or else involving a description derived upon the attainment to the four Truths that is the footing for omniscient knowledge according as it is said  Buddha  he is that Blessed One who selfbecome without teacher in ideas not heard before himself discovered the Truths and reached omniscience therein and mastery of the powers  This firstly is the explanation of the word  Buddha  as to meaningNow as to the phrasing it should be understood in the way beginning  He is the discoverer  thus he is enlightened  he is the enlightener  thus he is enlightenedHe is the discoverer of the Truths thus he is enlightened  He is the enlightener of the generation thus he is enlightened He is enlightened by omniscience enlightened by seeing all enlightened without being led by others enlightened because of burgeoning  having exhausted the taints he is termed enlightened having immunity from defilement  he is termed enlightened he is quite without lust thus he is enlightened he is quite without hate thus he is enlightened he is quite without delusion thus he is enlightened he is quite without defilement thus he is enlightened he has travelled by the path that goes in only one way  thus he is enlightened he alone discovered the peerless complete enlightenment thus he is enlightened he is enlightened because he has abolished nondiscovery and obtained discovery Buddha this is not a name made by a mother made by a father made by a brother made by a sister made by friends and companions made by relatives and kin made by monks and divines  made by deities this name  Buddha  which signifies final liberation is a realistic  description of enlightened Ones Blessed Ones together with their obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of an enlightenment tree  And as to this quotation the active and middlevoice usage  he is the discoverer of the Truths thus he is enlightened  is stated in the same way as in the world outside the Dispensation a  descender into  is called a  descended one  He is enlightened by omniscience what is meant is that he is enlightened by discovery capable of discovering all ideas Enlightened by seeing all  what is meant is that he is enlightened by discovery capable of causing discovery of all ideas Enlightened without being led by others  what is meant is that he is enlightened because of his being enlightened by himself alone without having been caused to be enlightened by another Enlightened because of burgeoning   what is meant is that he is enlightened because of displaying  diverse special qualities in the sense of opening like a lotus flower Enlightened since he is reckoned to have exhausted the taints  etc what is meant is that he is enlightened owing to his being awakened by the exhaustion of all the sleep consisting in defilements like a man awakened by the exhaustion of sleep because of his abandoning the reasons for the cramping of cognizanceHe has travelled by the path that goes in only one way  this is said in order to show that he is called  enlightened  because he has travelled  gata by the path that goes in only one way that is to the goal since verbal roots with meanings of  travelling  have by metaphorical use also meanings of  discovering   just as a man is called i travelled  when he has travelled a path He alone discovered the peerless complete enlightenment  what is meant is that he is enlightened not because of his being enlightened by others but is on the contrary enlightened because he himself alone discovered the peerless complete enlightenment He is enlightened because he has abolished nondiscovery and obtained discovery  the middlevoice term  discovery  and the causativevoice term  causingdiscovery  are metaphorical expressions for this is said in order to have it known that  enlightened  is said of him because of his association with the quality of discovery  just as  blue cloth  or  red cloth  is said because of the cloths association with the respective quality of blue or redAfter that the passage beginning  Buddha this is not a name is stated in order to cause discovery of the fact that this foregoing description conforms with the meaning and it can be understood that the meaning of the word  Buddha  is capable of being established in this manner in all the remaining clausesThis is the explanation of the word  Buddha  as to the phrasingand this is said Buddha in what sense buddhaand in the causativevoice usage  he is the enlightener of the generation thus he is enlightened  is stated in the same way as in the world outside the Dispensation a  leafdrying wind  is called  leafdried  And its beginning I go for refuge to the Enlightened One I go for refuge to the True Idea I go for refuge to the Community For the second timeFor the third timeHere is a schedule of the method of commenting on itWherefore Here stated thus initially Though other words were said beforeNow having in this way made good Their Source herein then next there shouldThe breach or none the fruit they spell  What must be gone besides we tellAnd for the other two as well The way prescribed is parallelThe reason must be shown why these Display the order that they doLastly the Triple Refuge too Must be explained by similesHerein as to the first stanza to begin with there are these five questions namely By whom were these three Refuges pronounced Where were they pronounced When were they pronounced Why were they pronounced And why although they were not the words pronounced by the Blessed One in the beginning  are they stated at the beginning hereThe answers are as follows  By whom pronounced They were pronounced by the Blessed One not by disciples nor by the Seers nor by deitiesWhere At Benares in the Deer Park at IsipatanaWhen When the sixty  one Arahants were engaged in teaching the True Idea in the world for the benefit of the many after the venerable Yasa together with his companions had attained Arahantship Why For the purpose of giving the Going Forth into Homelessness and for the purpose of giving the Full Admissionaccording as it is said And bhikkhus he is to be given the Going Forth and given the Full Admission thusfirst having had his hair and beard shaved off he should be clothed in the yellow clothes and then after having him arrange his upper robe on one shoulder he should be made to pay homage at the bhikkhus feet and then after seating him on his heels with hands extended palms together he should be told  Say thus I go for refuge to the Enlightened One I go for refuge to the True Idea I go for refuge to the Community   Wherefore here stated thus initially It can be understood as follows since this is the pathway by which gods and men enter the Dispensation whether they become layfollowers or those gone forth consequently it being the pathway of entry into the Dispensation it was stated here initially in the Minor Readings by the Former Teachers when during their inclusion of the Masters ninefactored Dispensation  in three Pitakas they were composing a pathway for the serial order of the recitationThe source has now been made good By whom pronounced where when and why Were these three RefugesBe told the proper way of knowing  Buddha   Goer and  Refugegoing Now as to the  going etc it combats thus it is a refuge  the meaning is that when people have gone for refuge then by that very going for refuge it combats dispels carries off and stops their fear anguish suffering risk of unhappy destination on rebirth and defilementOr alternatively he combats creatures fear by promoting their good and preventing their harm thus he is the Enlightened One  the True Idea does so by providing the crossing of the Desert of Being and by giving consolation the Community does so by causing the obtainment of great fruitfulness from small actionsThe going for refuge is the arising of cognizance with confidence therein and giving preponderance thereto  from which defilement is eliminated and eradicated and which occurs in the mode of taking that as the highest value whether or not someone else is a condition for so doingA creature possessing that kind of cognizance goes for refuge to that object the meaning is that by means of the kind of cognizancearising just mentioned he approaches that thus This is my refuge this is my highest value And when approaching it he does so either by an undertaking as in the case of Tapassu and Bhalluka etc thus  Venerable sir we go for refuge to the Blessed One and to the True Idea let the Blessed One remember us as followers   or by assuming the status of a pupil as in the case of Maha Kassapa etc thus  Venerable sir the Blessed One is my teacher I am his disciple   or by inclination thereto as in the case of Brahmayu etc thus  When this was said Brahmayu the divine rose from his seat and arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he raised his hands palms together towards where the Blessed One was and he uttered this exclamation three times Honour to that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Honour to that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedHonour to that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened    or by selfdedication to the teacher like a meditator devoting himself to a meditation subject  or by severing his imperfections by going as a Noble Person for refuge  Thus he approaches variously both as to objective field and as to functionThis is the explanation of the  Refugegoing  and of the  Goer so in this way the refuge is also that threefold JewelNow there is the explanation of the breach etc stated thus  The breach or none the fruit they spell  What must be gone  besides we tell   When a person has gone for refuge thus his breach of the refugegoing is of two kinds reprehensible and blamelessThe blameless kind of breach consists in dying the reprehensible kind of breach consists in adopting procedure of the kind just described with respect to another teacher and in adopting the opposite kind of procedure with respect to that refugeBoth kinds occur only in ordinary menIn them the refuge is defiled both by the occurrence of unknowing doubt and wrong knowledge about the Buddhas special qualities and by occurrence of irreverence etcbut in Noble Persons the refuge always remains unbroken and undefiledOrdinary men remain with their refuge unbroken as long as they do not arrive at a breach of the refugesWhen the breach of their refuge is reprehensible and defiled it gives unwanted fruitaccording as it is said Those who take refuge in the Buddha  Go to no state of deprivation And when they leave the human frame  A godly body they fulfil  Herein those who by becoming Noble Persons have gone for refuge by severing imperfections in their refugegoing will nevermore go to any state of deprivationThis firstly is the explanation of the breach nonbreach and fruitaccording as it is said  Bhikkhus it is impossible it cannot happen that a person perfected in his view should seek another teacher when it is blameless it gives no fruit because it then has no ripening  Nonbreach however as to fruit always gives wanted fruitbut the others who are still ordinary men may still go there in spite of their having gone to them this is how the purport of the stanza should be understoodI purified my mind from doubtBhikkhus there are these five kinds of warriors found in the worldWhat fiveHere some warrior takes up a sword and shield arms himself with a bow

What fiveHere some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or townIn the morning he dresses takes his robe and bowl and enters that village or town for alms with body speech  and mind unguarded  without having established mindfulness his sense faculties unrestrainedThere he sees women with their dress in disarray and loosely attiredWhen he sees them lust invades his mindWith his mind invaded by lust he has sexual intercourse without having disclosed his weakness and given up the trainingThis person I say  is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield arms himself with a bow and quiver and enters the fray of battle and whose foes slay him and finish him off while he is striving and exerting himself in battleThere is bhikkhus such a person hereThis is the first kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhusAgain some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or townIn the morning he dresses takes his robe and bowl and enters that

oppressed by lust I cannot maintain the spiritual life Having disclosed my weakness in the training will give up the training and revert to the lower lifeWhile he is returning to the monastery even before he arrives he discloses his weakness in the training gives up the training and reverts to the lower life along the wayjust like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield arms himself with a bow and quiver enters the fray of battle is wounded by his foes while he strives and exerts himself in the battle and is then carried off and brought to his relativesThere is bhikkhus such a person hereThis is the second kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhusAgain some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or townIn the morning he dresses takes his robe and

monastery and informs the bhikkhus Friends I am obsessed by lust oppressed by lust I cannot maintain the spiritual life Having disclosed my weakness in the training I will give up the training and revert to the lower lifeHis fellow monks then exhort and instruct him  Friend the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and anguish and that the danger in them is moreWith the simile of the skeleton the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and anguish and that the danger in them is moreWith the simile of the piece of meatWith the simile of the grass torch Enjoy the spiritual life Do not think you are unable to follow the training give it up and revert to the lower lifeWhile he is being exhorted and instructed by his fellow monks in this way he protests Friends although the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and anguish and that the danger in them is more still I am unable to maintain the spiritual life Having disclosed my weakness in the training I will give up the training and revert to the lower lifeHaving disclosed his weakness in the training he gives up the training and reverts to the lower lifeJust like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield arms himself with a bow and quiver enters the fray of battle is wounded by his foes while he strives and exerts himself in the battle and is then carried off and brought to his relatives who nurse him and look after himThere is bhikkhus such a person hereThis is

quiver and enters the fray of battle who is wounded by his foes while he strives and exerts himself in the battle and is then carried off and brought to his relatives who nurse him and look after himThis is the fourth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhusAgain some bhikkhu dwells in dependence upon a certain village or townIn the morning he dresses takes his robe and bowl and enters that village or town for alms with body speech and mind guarded mindfulness established and sense faculties restrainedHaving seen a form with the eye he does not grasp its marks and featuresSince if he left the eye faculty unrestrained bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him he practices restraint over it he guards the eye faculty he undertakes the restraint of the eye facultyHaving heard a sound with the ear Having smelled an odor with the nose  Having tasted a taste with the tongue   Having felt a tactile object with the body  Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind he does not grasp its m arks and featuresSince if he left the mind faculty unrestrained bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him he practices restraint over it he guards the mind faculty he undertakes the restraint of the mind facultyAfter his meal on returning from his alms round he resorts to a secluded lodging the forest the foot of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle highland the open air a heap of strawGone to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut he sits down folding his legs crosswise straightening his body and establishing mindfulness in front of himHaving abandoned longing for the world  as in     he purifies his mind from doubt Having abandoned these five hindrances defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters and dwells in the first jhana  the second jhana  the third jhana  the fourth jhana neither painful nor pleasant which has purification of mindfulness by equanimityWhen his mind is thus concentrated purified cleansed unblemished rid of defilement malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taintsHe understands as it really is This is suffering   Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of beingThis person I say is just like the warrior who takes up a sword and shield arms himself with a bow and quiver enters the fray of battle and having triumphed in that battle emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefieldThere is bhikkhus such a person hereThis is the fifth kind of person similar to a warrior found among the bhikkhusThese are the five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhusbut his foes slay him and finish him offbut his foes wound him His comrades carry him off and bring him to his relativesbut while they are doing so he dies from that injuryand as a result he recovers from that injurySo too there are these five kinds of persons similar to warriors found among the bhikkhusand lust invades his mindbut dies along the way even before he arrives This person I say is just like and lust invades his mindwith the simile of the snakes head the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification much suffering and anguish and that the danger in them is morewith the simile of the sword stake with the simile of the butchers knife and block with the simile of fruits on a tree with the simile of the borrowed goods with the simile of the dream with the simile of the charcoal pit lust invades his mindWith the simile of the skeleton There is bhikkhus such a person hereWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought I entered upon and abided in the second jhana With the fading away as well of rapture I entered upon and abided in the third jhanaWith the abandoning of pleasure and painI entered upon and abided in the fourth jhana which has neitherpain norpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityI directly knew as it actually is This is sufferingThis is the origin of sufferingThis is the cessation of sufferingThis is the way leading to the cessation of suffering I directly knew as it actually is These are the taints This is the origin of the taints This is the cessation of the taintsThis is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsAs regards the explanation of  what must be gone to  an objector said Now as to the phrase Buddham saranam gacchami the Buddha refuge  should one who goes to the Buddha refuge go to the Buddha or to the refuge  And in either case the mention of one of the two is meaninglessWhy soBecause the verb  to go  does not have two objects for the grammarians do not require two passive objects here as they do in such phrases as ajam gamam neti the village  and it has meaning only in such phrases as gacchateva puhbam disam gacchati pacchimam disam the east direction he goes the west direction SiThat is not so because identical causativity is not intended of the words  Buddha  and saranaFor if identical causativity were intended of them then even one who had lost his wits would on approaching the Buddha be gone to the Buddha refuge since he would have literally gone to the refuge itself merely nominally distinguished as  the BuddhaBut is there not identical causativity nevertheless because of the words  This is the refuge that is safe This is the ultimate refuge  No That state of identical causativity applies only in that instanceThat state of identical causativity is intended only there in those lines and is intended there in this way  The refuge is safe and ultimate because of absence of any exception  in the refugestate in other words in the abolition of fear in those who have gone for refuge to the three Jewels beginning with the Buddha but it is not intended anywhere else because even when there is connexion with something gone to that is inadequate to establish the the going was for refuge So that argument is unestablished But there is not identical causativity nevertheless since there is establishment that the going is for refuge when there is its connexion with something gone to in the passage  On coming to this refuge he from every suffering is freed  No because of that arguments falling still within the scope of the flaw mentioned earlierFor there it was shown that if there were identical causativity then even one who had lost his wits would on coming to this refuge consisting of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha be automatically freed from all suffering thus there would be here too the flaw already mentioned and owing to the flaw that does not help us So that argument too remains unestablishedJust as in the passage  On coming to me as the good friend Ananda creatures normally inseparable from the idea of birth are freed from birth  it is of creatures being freed by the might of the Blessed One as the Good Friend that it is said that On coming to the good friend  they  are freedso too there in the passage  on coming to this refugeit is of one being freed by the might of the refuge consisting of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha that it is said  On coming to this refuge he from every suffering is freed  That is how the intention should be understood thereSo then in any case it is illogical to predicate either of the Buddha that he  must be gone  or of the refuge or of both tamth at and accordingly the sense of the phrase must be gone  requires on the contrary that it is predicated of the goer demonstrated by the word gacchdmi  the logic of which still remains to be statedWhat  must be gone  here is always the Buddha But the mention of him as the refuge is for the purpose of showing the mode of going  I go the Buddha as refuge for me he is the highest value the eliminator of the abyss the provider of welfare and it is with this intention that I go to him frequent wait upon and reverence him or that is how I know how I have discovered In that case is not the nonaddition  of the word  as  contrary to the requirements of logic That is not soNow at this point it may be objected If the meaning there were thus then the word iti ought to be added as is done in such passages as  He understands impermanent form in accordance with how it actually is as  impermanent form    but it is not added therefore that argument is stated illogicallyNo It is logicalWhy soBecause the meaning of that too is essentially impliedfor the meaning of that is actually implied there also on which account it has to be understood in the same way as it was earlier as if it were added although it is notThis is the explanation of what  must be gone to As to that it may be stated as followsfor these linguistic roots  which have the meaning of  travelling  have also the meaning of  discovering  Otherwise  the argument would fall under the scope of the flaw already mentionedNow as to the lines in the Schedule And for the other two as well The way prescribed is parallel   it may be said as follows The way of commenting on the clause  I go for refuge to the Enlightened One should be understood to be the same as in the case of the two clauses I go for refuge to the True Idea  and  I go for refuge to the Community For here it is only the explanations of the words  True Idea  and  Community  that are dissimilar in the meaning and the phrasingConsequently there is only need to mention what is dissimilar here  Some say that   Dhamma  is the Path its Fruit and Extinction Our preference is that only the fading of lust which is the Path is the True Idea in this sense since it causes the upholding of those who have maintained the Path in being and have realized extinction by its not allowing their falling into states of deprivation and since it makes provision for their supreme consolation And this is established by Aggapasada Suttafor this is said Bhikkhus in so far as there are ideas that are determined the Noble Eightfold Path is accounted the foremost of them and so onThe mass composed of the persons that possess the fourfold Noble Path and consist of categorycontinuities fully imbued with  the fruit of the monks life is the Community because of its combining the concurrence of right view and virtueHow do you conceive this Ananda Those ideas that have been taught by me after directly knowing them that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness the four right endeavours the four bases for success  the five faculties the five powers the seven enlightenment factors and the Noble Eightfold Path do you see Ananda even two bhikkhus who have differing theories about these ideas  For it is this Community taken thus in the ultimate sense that must be gone to as refugeand which in the Suttas is called fit for gifts fit for hospitality fit for offerings and fit for reverential salutation as the incomparable field of merit for the world  Now when someone has gone for refuge to this Community regarded thus in the ultimate sense his refugegoing is neither broken nor defiled by the act of paying homage to some other subordinate kind for instance to a community of bhikkhus or to a community of bhikkhunis or to a community headed by the Enlightened One or to the conventional community classed as consisting of a chapter of four etc or even when consisting of a single person gone forth under the Blessed One  This is what is different hereWhat remains to be said about this and about the second refugegoing should be understood in the way already stated under directions for the breach and nonbreach and the restThis then is the commentary on the lines  And for the other two as well The way prescribed is parallelAnd this is said by the Blessed Onebut who dies from that injury This person I say is just like and who then recovers from that injury This person I say is just like He resorts to a secluded lodging the forest the foot of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle highland the open air a heap of strawI directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingIt is by knowing thus seeing thus friends that in regard to this body withits consciousness and all external signs Imaking minemaking and the underlying tendency to conceit have been eradicated in meHaving done so one should say to him It is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us friend that we see such a companion in the holy life as the venerable oneThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and

were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsBhikkhus there are these five kinds of persons found in the worldWhat fiveHere one person violates and then becomes remorseful and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind liberation by wisdom where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainderHere one person violates and does not become remorseful and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind liberation by wisdom where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainderHere one person does not violate and yet becomes remorseful and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind liberation by wisdom where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainderHere one person does not violate and does not become remorseful and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind liberation by wisdom where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainderHere one person does not violate and does not become remorseful and understands as it really is the liberation of mind liberation by wisdom where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainderBhikkhus the person among these who violates and then becomes remorseful and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind liberation by wisdom where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder should be told Taints born of violation are found in you and taints born of remorse increase Please abandon the taints born of violation and dispel the taints born of remorse then develop your mind and wisdom In this way you will be exactly the same as the fifth type of personThe person among these who violates and does not become remorseful and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind liberation by wisdom where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his cease without remainder should be told Taints born of violation are found in you but taints born of remorse do not increase Please abandon the taints born of violation and then develop your mind and wisdom In this way you will be exactly the same as the fifth type of person The person among these who does not violate and yet becomes remorseful and does not understand as it really is the liberation of mind liberation by wisdom where these arisen bad unwholesome states of his

increase Please develop your mind and wisdom In this way you will be exactly the same as the fifth type of personThus bhikkhus when persons of these four types are exhorted and instructed by the example of the fifth type of person they gradually attain the destruction of the taintsOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Saketa in the Tikandakl GroveThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus BhikkhusVenerable sir those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to dwell perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive It is good for a

toward things provocative of lust  for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsiveAnd for the sake of what benefit should a bhikkhu dwell perceiving the

way regarding things provocative of hatred May no delusion at all arise in me anywhere in any way regarding things that breed delusion  for the sake of this benefit a bhikkhu should dwell equanimous

Palace of Migaras MotherOn that occasion  on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth on the fullmoon night  the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhusThen a certain bhikkhu rose from his seat arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One said to him Sit on your own seat bhikkhu and ask what you likeSo the bhikkhu sat on his own seat and said to the Blessed One  Are these not venerable sir the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the material form aggregate affected by clinging the feeling aggregate affected by clinging the perception aggregate affected by clinging the formations aggregate affected by clinging and the consciousness aggregate affected by clingingThese bhikkhus are the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the material form aggregate affected by clingingand the consciousness aggregate affected by clingingSaying Good venerable sir the bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words Then he asked him a further question  But venerable sir in what are these five aggregates affected by clinging rootedThese five aggregates affected by clinging are rooted in desire bhikkhuVenerable sir is that clinging the same as these five aggregates affected by clinging or is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates affected by clingingBhikkhu that clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates affected by clinging nor is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates affected by clingingIt is the desire and lust in regard to the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the clinging thereBut venerable sir can there be diversity in the desire and lust regarding these five aggregates affected by clingingThere can be

formations be thus in the future may my consciousness be thus in the futureThus there is diversity in the desire and lust regarding these five aggregates affected by clingingBut venerable sir in what way does the term aggregates apply to the aggregatesBhikkhu any kind of material form whatever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  this is the material form aggregateAny kind of feeling whateverfar or near  this is the feeling aggregateAny kind of perception whateverfar or near  this is the perception aggregateAny kind of formations whatever far or near  this is the formations aggregateAny kind of consciousness whateverfar or near  this is the consciousness aggregateIt is in this Way bhikkhu that the term aggregate applies to the aggregatesWhat is the cause and condition venerable sir for the manifestation of the material form aggregateWhat is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregateThe four great elements bhikkhu are the cause and condition for the manifestation of the material form aggregateContact is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregateContact is the cause and the condition for the manifestation of the perception aggregateContact is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the formations aggregateMentalitymateriality is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregateVenerable sir how does personality view come to beHere bhikkhu an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards material form as self or self as possessed of material form or material form as in self or self as in material form He regards feeling as selfperception as selfformations as selfconsciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousnessThat is how personality view comes to beBut venerable sir how does personality view not come to beHere bhikkhu a welltaught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not regard material form as self or self as possessed of material form or material form as in self or self as in material form He does not regard feeling as selfperception as selfformations as selfconsciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousnessThat is how personality view does not come to beWhat venerable sir is the gratification what is the danger and what is the escape in the case of material formWhat is the gratification what is the danger and what is the escape in the case of feelingThe pleasure and joy bhikkhu that arise in dependence on material form  this is the gratification in the case of material formMaterial form is impermanent suffering and subject to change  this is the danger in the case of material formThe removal of desire and lust the abandonment of desire and lust for material form  this is the escape in the case of material formThe pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on feelingin dependence on perceptionin dependence on formationsin dependence on consciousness  this is the gratification in the case of consciousnessConsciousness is impermanent suffering and subject to change  this is the danger in the case of consciousnessThe removal of desire and lust the abandonment of desire and lust for consciousness  this is the escape in the case of consciousnessVenerable sir how does one know how does one see so that in regard to this body with its consciousness and all external signs there is no Imaking minemaking and underlying tendency to conceitBhikkhu any kind of material form whatever whether past or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  one sees all material form as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfAny kind of feeling whateverAny kind of perception whateverAny kind of formations whateverAny kind of consciousness whateverone sees all consciousness as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfIt is when one knows and sees thus that in regard to this body with its consciousness and all external signs there is no Imaking minemaking or underlying tendency to conceitThen in the mind of a certain bhikkhu this thought arose So it seems material form is not self feeling is not self perception is not self formations are not self consciousness is not self What self then will actions done by the notself affectThen the Blessed One knowing in his mind the thought in the mind of that bhikkhu addressed the bhikkhus thus It is possible bhikkhus that some misguided man here obtuse and ignorant with his mind dominated by craving might think that he can outstrip the Teachers Dispensation thus So it seems material form is not selfconsciousness is not self What self then will actions done by the notself affectNow bhikkhus you have been trained by me through interrogation on various occasions in regard to various thingsBhikkhus what do you think Is material form permanent or impermanent Impermanent venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness Suffering venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self No venerable sirBhikkhus what do you think Is feelingperceptionformations consciousness permanent or impermanent Impermanent venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness Suffering venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self No venerable sirTherefore bhikkhus any kind of material form whatever whether past future or presentall material form should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfAny kind of feeling whatever Any kind of perception whateverAny kind of formations whateverAny kind of consciousness whateverall consciousness should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfSeeing thus a welltaught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with material form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with formations disenchanted with consciousness  Being disenchanted he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is liberatedHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsNow while this discourse was being spoken through not clinging the minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the taintsThere the Venerable Sariputta  said thisHere friends a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior concentration and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is this possibilityBut if he does not reach final knowledge in this very life having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade deities that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food he might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is this possibilityWhen this was said the Venerable Udayi said to the Venerable Sariputta This is impossible friend Sariputta it cannot happen that a bhikkhu having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade deities that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is no such possibilityA second time A third time the Venerable Sariputta said Here friends it is possible that a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade deities A third time the Venerable Udayi said to the Venerable Sariputta This is impossible friend Sariputta it cannot happen that a bhikkhu having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade deities might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is no such possibilityThen it occurred to the Venerable Sariputta The Venerable Udayi has rejected me up to the third time and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with meLet me approach the Blessed OneThen the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideand addressed the bhikkhus Here friends a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior concentration and wisdom might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is this possibilityIf he does not reach final knowledge in this very life having been reborn among a certain group of mind made deities that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food he might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is this possibilityWhen this was said the Venerable Udayi said to the Venerable Sariputta This is impossible friend Sariputta it cannot happen that a bhikkhu having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade deities transcending the company of devas that subsist on edible food might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is no such possibilityA second time A third time the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus Here friends a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior  having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade deities might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feelingThere is this possibilityA third time the Venerable Udayl said to the Venerable Sariputta This is impossible friend Sariputta it cannot happen that a bhikkhu reborn among a certain group of mindmade deities  might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is no such possibilityThen it occurred to the Venerable Sariputta Even when I am in the presence of the Blessed One the Venerable Udayi rejects me up to the third time and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with meLet me just keep silentThen the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Udayi Udayi just what do you understand by a mindmade groupBhante it is those devas that are formless perception madeWhat are you saying Udayi you foolish and incompetent fellow Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda Ananda do you just look on passively as an elder bhikkhu is being harassedDont you have any compassion toward an elder bhikkhu when hes being harassedThen tine Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior concentration and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feelingIf he does not reach final knowledge in this very life then having been reborn among a certain group of mindmade deities that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food he might again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is this possibilityThis is what the Blessed One saidHaving said this the Fortunate One got up from his seat and entered his dwellingThen not long after the Blessed One had left the Venerable Ananda approached the Venerable Upavana and said to him Here friend Upavana they were harassing other elder bhikkhusIt would not be surprising if this evening when he emerges from seclusion the Blessed One makes a pronouncement about this matter and he might call upon the Venerable Upavana himself to give an accountThen in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hallHe sat down in the appointed seat and said to the Venerable UpavanaPossessing five qualities Bhante an elder bhikkhu is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by themWhat fiveHe is virtuous he dwells restrained by the Patimokkha  as in  he trains in them He has learned much as in  he has penetrated well by view He is a good speaker with a good delivery he is gifted With speech that is polished clear articulate expressive of the meaning He gains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life With the destruction of the taints he has realized for himself with direct knowledge in this very life the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom and having entered upon it he dwells in itPossessing these five qualities an elder is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by themGood good UpavanaPossessing those five qualities an elder is pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and is respected and esteemed by themBut if these five qualities are not found in an elder bhikkhu why should bis fellow monks honor respect esteem and venerate him On account of his broken teeth grey hair and wrinkled skinBut because these five qualities are found in an elder bhikkhu his fellow monks honor respect esteem and venerate himmight again enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling There is this possibilityThen the Venerable Sariputta fell silentYet you think you have to speak upbut we didnt question themJust now I feel timidUpavana how many qualities should an elder bhikkhu possess to be pleasing and agreeable to his fellow monks and to be respected and esteemed by themThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder SāriputtaFor one day thirty forestdwellers approached the Teacher paid obeisance to him and sat downThe Teacher seeing that they possessed the requisite faculties for attaining Arahatship addressed Elder Sāriputta as follows Sāriputta do you believe that the quality of faith when it has been developed and enlarged is connected with the Deathless and terminates in the Deathless In this manner the Teacher questioned the Elder with reference to the Five Moral QualitiesSaid the Elder Reverend Sir I do not go by the faith of the Exalted One in this matter that the quality of faith when it has been developed and enlarged is connected with the Deathless and terminates in the DeathlessBut of course Reverend Sir those who have not known the Deathless or seen or perceived or realized or grasped the Deathless by the power of reason such persons must of necessity go by the faith of others in this matternamely that the faculty of faith when it has been developed and enlarged is connected with the Deathless and terminates in the Deathless Thus did the Elder answer his questionWhen the monks heard this they began a discussion Elder Sāriputta has never really given up false views Even today he refused to believe even the Supremely Enlightened OneWhen the Teacher heard this he said Monks why do you say thisFor I asked Sāriputta the following question Sāriputta do you believe that without developing the Five Moral Qualities without developing Tranquillity and Spiritual Insight it is possible for a man to realize the Paths and the FruitsAnd he answered me as follows There is no one who can thus realize the Paths and the FruitsThen I asked him Do you not believe that there is such a thing as the ripening of the fruit of almsgiving and good works Do you not believe in the virtues of the Buddhas and the restBut as a matter of fact Sāriputta walks not by the faith of others for the reason that he has in and by himself attained states of mind to which the Paths and the Fruits lead by the power of Spiritual Insight induced by Ecstatic MeditationTherefore he is not open to censure So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following StanzaThat man who is free from credulity who knows the Uncreate who has brought rebirth to an endWho has put an end to every occasion of good and evil who has renounced all desires that man is the greatest of menOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggas at Sumsumaragira in the deer park at Bhesakala GroveNow on that occasion the householder Nakulapita was sick afflicted gravely illThen the housewife Nakulamata said this to himTo die full of concern is painful To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed OneIt may be householder that you think thus After Im gone Nakulamata wont be able to support our children and maintain the householdBut you should not look at the matter in this wayI am skilled at weaving

Nakulamata wont want to see the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhusBut you should not look at the matter in this wayAfter you are gone householder I will be even keener to see the Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhusTherefore householder do not die full of concernTo die full of concern is painful To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed OneIt may be householder that you

anyone has any doubt or uncertainty about this the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is dwelling among the Bhaggas at Sumsumaragira in the deer park at Bhesakala Grove They can go and ask himTherefore householder do not die full of concernTo die full of concern is painful To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed OneIt may be householder that you think thus

Nakulamata has not attained a foothold a firm stand assurance in this Dhamma and discipline she has not crossed over doubt gotten rid of bewilderment attained selfconfidence and become independent of others in the Teachers teachingBut you should not look at the matter in this wayI am one of the Blessed Ones whiterobed female lay disciples who have attained a foothold a firm stand assurance in this

householder do not die full of concernTo die full of concern is painful To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed OneThen while the householder Nakulapita was being exhorted in this way by the housewife Nakulamata his ailment subsided on the spotNakulapita recovered from that illness and that is how his illness was abandonedThen not long after he had recovered the householder Nakulapita leaning on a staff approached the Blessed One He paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one sideThe Blessed One then said to himNakulamata is one of my whiterobed female lay disciples who fulfill virtuous behaviorShe is one of my whiterobed female lay disciples who obtain internal serenity of mindShe is one of my whiterobed female lay disciples who have attained a foothold a firm stand assurance in this Dhamma and discipline who have crossed over doubt gotten rid of bewilderment attained selfconfidence and become independent of others in the Teachers teachingIt

good fortune and gain householderthat the housewife Nakulamata has compassion for you desires your good and exhorts and instructs youthat the housewife Nakulamata has compassion for you desires your good and exhorts and instructs youThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in the Eastern GatehouseThere the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Sariputta thus Sariputta do you have faith that the faculty of faith when developed and cultivated has the Deathless as its ground the Deathless as its destination the Deathless as its final goal  That the faculty of wisdom when developed and cultivated has the Deathless as its ground the Deathless as its destination the Deathless as its final goalVenerable sir I do not go by faith in the Blessed One about this

this has been known  they would be without perplexity or doubt about this that the faculty of faith  the faculty of wisdom when developed and cultivated has the Deathless as its ground the Deathless as its destination the Deathless as its final goalThere the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus   Friends a bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should first establish five things in himselfWhat fiveHe should consider I will speak at a proper time not at an improper time I will speak truthfully not falsely I will speak gently not harshly I will speak in a beneficial way not in a harmful way I will speak with a mind of lovingkindness not while harboring hatredA bhikkhu who wishes to reprove another should first establish these five things in himselfHere friends I see some p e rson being reproved at an improper time not disturbed at a proper time being reproved about what is false not disturbed about what is true being reproved harshly not disturbed gently being reproved in

beneficial way that is sufficient for you to be without remorse You were reproved by one harboring hatred not by one with a mind of lovingkindness that is sufficient for you to be without remorseWhen

established in two things in truth and nonangerIf I know There is such a quality in me I tell him It exists This quality is found in meIf I know There is no such quality in me I tell him It doesnt exist This quality isnt found in meThe Blessed One said Sariputta even when you are speaking to them in such a way some foolish men here do not respectfully accept what you sayThere are Bhante persons devoid of faith who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness not out of faith but intent on earning a living they are crafty hypocritical deceptive restless puffed up vain talkative

out of faith who are not crafty  who are wise intelligent Exhort your fellow monks SariputtaInstruct your fellow monks Sariputta thinking I will cause my fellow monks to emerge from what is contrary to the good Dhamma and will establish them in the good DhammaThus Sariputta should you train yourselfVenerable sir I would ask the Blessed One about a certain point if the Blessed One would grant me an answer to my questionOn one occasion the Venerable Ananda was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkThen the Venerable Bhaddaji approached the Venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings with himWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one sideThe Venerable Ananda then said to him Friend Bhaddaji what is the foremost of sights What is the foremost kind of hearing What is the foremost happiness What is the foremost perception What is the foremost among states of existence  There is friend Brahma the vanquisher the unvanquished the universal seer the wielder of power Getting to see Brahma is the foremost sightThere are the devas of streaming radiance who are suffused and inundated with happinessThey sometimes utter the inspired utterance Oh what happiness Oh what happinessGetting to hear that sound is the foremost kind of hearingThere are the devas of refulgent gloryBeing happy they experience very peaceful happiness this is the foremost happinessThere are the devas of the base of nothingness this is the foremost perceptionThere are the devas of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception this is the foremost state of existenceThen does the Venerable Bhaddaji agree with the multitude about this The Venerable Ananda is learnedThen listen friend Bhaddaji and attend closely I will speakYes friend the Venerable Bhaddaji repliedThe Venerable Ananda said this In whatever way friend one sees such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs  this is the foremost sightIn whatever way one hears such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs this is the foremost kind of hearingIn whatever way one is happy such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs this is the foremost happinessIn whatever way one perceives such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs this is the foremost perceptionIn whatever way one exists such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs this is the foremost state of existenceso let him clear this up himselfOn one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Sahgha of bhikkhusThen while traveling along the highway the Blessed One saw a large saltree grove in a certain place He left the highway entered the saltree grove and smiled when he reached a certain placeThen it occurred to che Venerable Ananda Why did the Blessed One smileTathagatas do not smile without a reasonThen the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One Wiry Bhante did the Blessed One smileTathagatas do not smile without a reasonIn the past Ananda in this place there was an affluent prosperous wellpopulated city one teeming with peopleNow the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa lived in dependence on that cityThe Blessed One Kassapa had a lay follower named Gavesi who had not fulfilled virtuous behaviorAnd Gavesi taught and guided five hundred lay followers who had not fulfilled virtuous behaviorThen Ananda it occurred to Gavesi I am the benefactor the leader and the guide of these five hundred lay followers yet neither I myself nor these five hundred lay followers have fulfilled virtuous behaviorThus we are on the same level and I am not the least bit better Let me surpass themThen Gavesi approached the five hundred lay followers and said to them From today on you should consider me to be one fulfilling virtuous behaviorThen it occurred to those five hundred lay followers Master Gavesi is our benefactor leader and guideNow Master Gavesi will fulfill virtuous behaviorWhy shouldnt we do so tooThen those five hundred lay followers approached Gavesi and said to him From today onward let Master Gavesi consider us to

the lay follower Gavesi I am the benefactor leader and guide of these five hundred lay followersNow I am fulfilling virtuous behaviorI am celibate living apart abstaining from sexual intercourse the common persons practiceThus we are on the same level and I am not the least bit better Let me surpass themThen Gavesi approached the five hundred lay followers and said to them From today on you should consider me to be once a day refraining from a night meal abstaining from eating outside the proper timeThen it occurred to those five hundred lay followers Master Gavesi is our benefactor leader and guideNow Master Gavesi eats once a day refraining from a night meal abstaining from eating outside the proper timeWhy shouldnt we do so tooThen those five hundred lay followers approached Gavesi and said to him From today onward let Master Gavesi consider us to be eating once a day refraining from a night meal abstaining from eating outside the proper timeThen Ananda it o ccurred to

the proper time and so too do these five hundred lay followersThus we are on the same level and I am not the least bit better Let me surpass themThen Gavesi approached the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One Kassapa and said to him Bhante may I obtain the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed OneThe lay follower Gavesi obtained the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One KassapaSoon after his full ordination dwelling alone withdrawn heedful ardent and resolute the bhikkhu Gavesi realized for himself with direct knowledge in this very life that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness and having entered upon it he dwelled in itHe directly knew Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived wha t had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of beingAnd the bhikkhu Gavesi became one of the arahantsThen Ananda it o ccurred to those five hundred lay followers Master Gavesi is our benefactor leader and guideNow Master Gavesi having shaved off his hair and beard and put on

Kassapa and said to him Bhante may we obtain the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed OneThen those five hundred lay followers obtained the going forth and full ordination under the

these five hundred bhikkhus could obtain at will without trouble or difficulty the unsurpassed bliss of liberation Then Ananda dwelling each alone withdrawn heedful ardent and resolute in no long time those five hundred bhikkhus realized for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake Of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness and having entered upon it they dwelled in itThey directly knew Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of beingThus Ananda those five hundred bhikkhus headed by Gavesi striving in successively higher and more sublime ways realized the unsurpassed bliss of liberationTherefore Ananda you should train yourselves thus Striving in successively higher and more sublime ways we will realize the unsurpassed bliss of liberationThus Ananda should you train yourselvesand so too are these five hundred lay followersand so too are these five hundred lay followersThen a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One and said to him Bhante by what is the world led By what is the world dragged around When what has arisen does the world go under its controlNow as to the lines  The reason must be shown why these Display the order that they do   The term  Enlightened One  is defined and explained first among these three refuge terms by taking the Enlightened One as  the foremost of all creatures    The True Idea  next because that was given its being by him and taught by him and The Community  last because that is the bearer and the server of the True IdeaOr alternatively  Enlightened One  is defined and explained first by taking him as  The promoter of all creatures welfare   The True Idea  next because that was given its being by him for the sake of all creatures welfare and  The Community  last by taking that as practising for the attainment of welfare by reaching the Path and attained to welfare by reaching its Fruit  That is how  The reason must be shown why these Display the order that they do Now it was said  Lastly the Triple Refuge too Must be explained by

how  Lastly the Triple Refuge too Must be explained by similesAnd at this point the Schedule of the method of commenting which was set out in the four stages beginning thus  By whom pronounced where when and why Were these three Refuges  has been explained as to its meaningin the Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning the Commentary on the Minor BooksThe explanation of the Refuges is endedGood good bhikkhuYour acumen is excellent Your discernment is excellent Your inquiry is a good oneFor you have asked thus Bhante by what is the world led By what is the world dragged around When what has arisen does the world go under its controlYes BhanteThe world bhikkhu is led by the mind it is dragged around by the mind when the mind has arisen the world goes under its controlSaying Good Bhante that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statementThen he asked the Blessed One a further question It is said Bhante a learned expert on the Dhamma a learned expert on the Dhamma In what way is one a learned expert on the DhammaGood good bhikkhuYour acumen is excellent Your discernment is excellent Your inquiry is a good oneFor you have asked thus It is said Bhante a learned expert on the Dhamma a learned expert on the DhammaIn what way is one a learned expert on the DhammaYes BhanteI have taught many teachings bhikkhu discourses mixed prose and verse expositions verses inspired utterances quotations birth stories amazing accounts and questionsandanswersIf after learning the meaning and Dhamma of even a fourline verse one practices in accordance with the Dhamma that is enough for one to be called a learned expert on the DhammaSaying Good Bhante that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement Then he asked the Blessed One a further question It is said Bhante learned of penetrative wisdom learned of penetrative wisdomIn what way is one learned of penetrative wisdomGood good bhikkhuYour acumen is excellent Your discernment is excellent Your inquiry is a good oneFor you have asked thus It is said Bhante learned of penetrative wisdom learned of penetrative wisdomIn what way is one learned of penetrative wisdomYes BhanteHere bhikkhu a bhikkhu has heardThis is suffering and he sees the meaning of this having pierced through it with wisdom He has heard This is the origin of suffering and he sees the meaning of this having pierced through it with wisdom He has heard This is the cessation of suffering and he sees the meaning of this having pierced through it with wisdom He has heard This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering and he sees the meaning of this having pierced through it with wisdomIt is in this way that one is learned of penetrative wisdomSaying Good Bhante that bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement Then he asked the Blessed One a further question It is said Bhante a wise person of great wisdom a wise person of great wisdomIn what way is one a wise person of great wisdomGood good bhikkhuYour acumen is excellent Your discernment is excellent Your inquiry is a good oneFor you have asked thus it is said Bhante a wise person of great wisdom a wise person of great wisdomIn what way is one a wise person of great wisdomYes BhanteHere bhikkhu a wise person of great wisdom does not intend for his own affliction or for the affliction of others or for the affliction of both Rather when he thinks he thinks only of his own welfare the welfare of others the welfare of both and the welfare of the whole worldIt is in this way that one is a wise person of great wisdomThe entry into the Dispensation having been shown by means of the refugegoing there follows here the Reading consisting of the Training Precepts which was placed here in order to show what training precepts should first be trained in by someone who has already entered the Dispensation thus Now here is a Schedule for the commentary theretoOf these it should be known by whom They were pronounced where when and whyDefining those shared equally Next and then that reserved to someStating what is looked on askance By nature what by ordinanceFor phrasing and for meaning too We make one common treatment doFor terms that all the precepts share We must duly become awareNext in the first five precepts there Of diverse meanings that they bearOnly the five that start  with killing Then to explain we must be willing By singleness and so on takingBy object and by undertaking By breach by blamabilityBy means factor origination By feeling root and action tooBy abstinence and by the fruitWhat thence in the last five must be Construed and special applicationThen why inferior we review And why superior to bootHerein these ten training precepts were pronounced by the Blessed One himself not by disciples and so onAnd they were pronounced by him at Savatthi in Jetas Wood Anathapindikas Park when he arrived at Savatthi from Kapilavatthu after giving the venerable Rahula the Going Forth the purpose being to give novices a definition of the training preceptsFor this is saidThere he lived in Jetas Wood Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion  it occurred to the novices  How many training precepts have weand they told this matter to the Blessed One who said  Bhikkhus I allow ten novices training precepts and training in them by novices They are abstinence from killing breathing things Abstinence from accepting gold and silver   These as stated thus firstly in the Vinaya should be understood to have been again a second time incorporated in the pathway  for the serial order of the Tipitaka s recitation according to the manner of the Suttas as follows  He undertakes the training precepts and trains in them   and again a third time according to the manner of the Readings in the way shown under the GoingforRefuge  thus  I undertake the training precept of abstinence from killing breathing thingsSo much for the lines  Of these it should be known by whom They were pronounced where when and why Then when the Blessed One had stayed at Kapilavatthu as long as he chose he set out to wander by stages to Savatthiand so doing he eventually arrived at SavatthiNow the first two and the fourth and fifth are shared equally between lay followers and novices as invariable virtuous practicesBut by combining the seventh and eighth into one and omitting the last one of all all save the last are only for lay followers as the virtuous practice on the occasion of the Uposatha observance and so all these are shared with novices That is Defining those shared equally Next and then that reserved to some  should be doneThen the first five are abstentions  from what is looked on askance by nature  since killing breathing things etc are always originated by unprofitable cognizance  but the rest are abstentions from what is looked on askance by ordinance  That is how it should be stated What is looked on askance By nature what by ordinance Now it was said  Next in the first five precepts there We duly must become aware Of diverse meanings that they bear Then to explain we must be willing By singleness and so on taking Only the five that start with killing By object and by undertaking By breach by blamability By means factor origination By feeling root and action too By abstinence and by the fruit herein it can be stated as followsAs to killing breathing things firstly a  breathing thing  is a categorycontinuity involving the fife faculty or it is a creature described derivatively upon that When in the case of such a breathing thing someone perceives it as a breathing thing then  killing breathing things  is his choice to kill occurring in either the body door or the speech door and originating the active process of severing the life facultyTaking what is not given   what is not given  is what has been taken possession of as a chattel by another when that other incurs no punishment by proceeding to do as he likes with it and remains blameless Now when someone in the case of some such thing already taken possession of by another perceives it as something already taken possession of by another then  taking what is not given  is his choice to steal occurring in either the body door or the speech door and originating the active process of taking thatUnchastity is what is not the highest kind of conduct it is the choice to transgress when there is opportunity for practice not in accordance with the True Ideal the choice occurring in the body door as the practice of sexual intercourse consisting in copulationSpeaking falsehood the  falsehood  is the verbal means or bodily means employed in concealing a meaning on the part of one who gives precedence to deception but the speaking of the falsehood is the wrong choice as intention to deceive occurring in either the body door or the speech door which originates the form of the body or speech that is the means to the deceiving of anotherAny opportunity for negligence due to liquor  wine and besotting drink here as to  liquor  there are five kinds of liquor flour liquor cake liquor rice liquor that containing yeast and that mixed with condimentsBoth these are  besotting  in the sense of causing intoxication  or alternatively whatever else there is that causes intoxication by drinking which one becomes mad and negligent is called  besottingThe  opportunity for negligence  is the choice by which one drinks swallows That is so called since it is the cause for the subsequent vanity and negligence  consequently what should be understood as the c opportunity for negligence  is the choice in swallowing the liquor wine or besotting drink as intent to swallow which occurs in the body door This firstly is the explanation of the five that start with killingAlso  wine  is of five kinds flower wine fruit wine sugar wine honey wine and that mixed with condiments Bhikkhus four facts about people can be known from four other factsWhat fourBy dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inatteintive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseBy dealing with them their integrity can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseIn misfortune their fortitude can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseBy conversation their wisdom can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseIt was said By dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseOn account of what was this saidHere bhikkhus by dwelling together with another person one comes to know him thus For a long time this venerable ones conduct has been broken flawed blemished and blotched and he does not consistently observe and follow virtuous behavior This venerable one is immoral not virtuousBut in another case by dwelling together with another person one comes to know him thus For a long time this venerable ones conduct has been unbroken flawless unblemished and unblotched and he consistently observes and follows virtuous behavior This venerable one is virtuous not immoralIt was on account of this that it was said By dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseFurther it was said By dealing with them their integrity can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseOn account of what was this saidHere bhikkhus when dealing with a person one comes to know him thus This venerable one deals with one person in one way in another way if he deals with two in still another way if he deals with three and in still another way if he deals with many His dealings in one case deviate from his dealings in another This venerable one is impure in his dealings with others not pure in such dealingsBut in another case when dealing with a person one comes to know him thus In the same way as he deals with one he deals with two three or manyHis dealings in one case do not deviate from his dealings in another This venerable one is pure in his dealings with others not impure in such dealingsIt was on account of this that it was said By dealing with them their integrity can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseFurther it was said In misfortune their fortitude can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseOn account of what was this saidHere bhikkhus someone is afflicted with the loss of relatives wealth or health but he does not reflect thus Human life in the world is of such a nature that the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions namely gain and loss disrepute and fame blame and praise and pleasure and painThus when afflicted with loss of relatives wealth or health he sorrows languishes and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes confusedBut in another case someone is afflicted with the loss of relatives wealth Or health but he does reflect thus Human life in the world is such that the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions namely gain and loss disrepute and fame blame and praise and pleasure and painThus when afflicted with the loss of relatives wealth or health he does not sorrow languish and lament he does not weep beating his breast and become confusedIt was on account of this that it was said In misfortune their fortitude can be known and this Only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseFurther it was said By conversation their wisdom can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseOn account of what was this saidHere bhikkhus when conversing with someone one comes to know Judging from the way this venerable one initiates formulates and poses a question he is unwise not wiseFor what reasonThis venerable one does not speak about matters that are deep peaceful sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible to the wiseWhen this venerable one speaks on the Dhamma he is not able to explain teach describe establish reveal analyze and explicate its meaning either briefly or in detailThis venerable one is unwise not wiseJust as if a man with good sight standing on the bank of a pond were to see a small fish emergingso too when conversing with a person one comes to know Judging from the way this venerable one initiates formulates and poses a question he is unwise not wiseBut in another case when conversing with someone one comes to know Judging from the way this venerable one initiates formulates and poses a question he is wise not unwiseFor what reasonThis venerable one speaks about matters that are deep peaceful sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible to the wiseWhen this venerable one speaks on the Dhamma he is able to explain teach describe establish reveal analyze and explicate its meaning both briefly and in detailThis venerable one is wise not unwiseJust as if a man with good sight standing on the bank of a pond were to see a big fish emergingso too when conversing with someone one comes to know Judging from the way this venerable one initiates formulates and poses a question he is wise not unwiseIt was on account of this that it was said By conversation their wisdom can be known and this only after a long time not casually by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive and by one who is wise not by one who is unwiseThese bhikkhus are the four facts about people that can be known from four other factshe would think Judging from the way this fish emerges from the ripples it makes and from its force this is a small fish not a big oneBy singleness and so on  here it may be asked But how then Is singularity in the case of killingbreathingthings decided by the singleness of the victim or the killer or the means or the choice etc And is its multiplicity decided by their multipleness and likewise in the cases of any of the rest beginning with taking what is not given Or is this not soBy which ought this to be decidedFor firstly if its singularity is decided by the singleness of any one of them then when many killers kill a single victim or when a single killer kills many victims or when many victims are killed by a single means among those beginning with ones own hand or when a single choice originates the means that severs the life faculty of many victims then there would have to be only a single killingofbreathingthingsthen when a single killer employs a single means for the purpose of killing a single victim and actually kills many victims or when many killers employing many means for the purpose of killing many victims called say Devadatta Yannadatta Somadatta etc actually kill only a single victim say Devadatta or Yannadatta or SomadattaIt can be stated as follows Herein firstly in the case of killing breathing things its singleness or multipleness is decided individually by the singleness or multipleness of the victim on the one hand and of the killer etc on the other But taking the victim in conjunction with the killer etc while its singleness is decided by singleness in both of these factors its multipleness is decided by multipleness in both or either of these two factorsThis method applies also in the cases of taking what is not given and the restThis is how the explanation should be understood here  as to singleness and so on By object among ideas of material form breathingthings has for its object the life facultySpeakingfalsehood has for its object a creature since it occurs contingent upon the creature to whom it is spokenAccording to some whatisnottheDivineLife has creatures for its objectThat is how the explanation should be known by object here By undertaking these training precepts of abstention from killing breathing things and the rest are undertaken by a novice only when undertaken in the presence of a bhikkhu But they are undertaken by a lay follower either when he undertakes them by himself or when he does so in anothers presenceand they are undertaken by him when undertaken together or undertaken separatelyNow when someone undertakes them together his abstinence is single and his choice is single though they are still described individually  according to their several functionsBut when someone undertakes them singly the abstinence is fivefold and so is the choice it should be understoodThat is how the explanation should be known by undertaking By breach  in the case of novices when one is broken all are brokenIn the case of householders when one is broken then only that one is broken and consequently the fivefoldness of their virtue becomes effective again as soon as that one alone is reundertakenSome others however have said that  When they have been undertaken separately then on one being broken only that one is broken However when they have been undertaken thus  I undertake the virtue possessed of the five factors  then when one is broken the rest are all broken tooWhyBecause of the unity of the undertaking but then responsibility for action  resides only in the one actually transgressed That is how the explanation should be known by breach By blamability  in the case of breathing things beginning with animals that are devoid of special qualities killing of breathing things is relatively less blamable in the case of a small one and more blamable in the case of one with a large physical frameWhyBecause of the greater magnitude of the means neededSo too with the restBut unlike killingbreathingthings etc whose blamability varies the opportunityfor negligenceduetoliquorwineandbesottingdrink is always greatly blamableWhyBecause it obstructs the Noble Ones True Idea by inducing even madness in a human beingThat is how the explanation should be known by blamabilityBy means  in the case of killingbreathingthings there are six kinds of means with ones own hand by command by missile by fixed contrivance by magical science and by supernormal powerHerein a blow given by the body or by what is connected to the body is with ones own hand  as means That is of two kinds as directed to an individual and not so directedHerein in the case of that directed to an individual one becomes responsible for the action of killing  only through the death of the one to whom the blow was directedIn the case of that not so directed and given thus  Let anyone at all die  one becomes responsible through anyones death that is conditioned by that blowAnd in both cases whether the breathing thing dies with the very blow or afterwards of a sickness due to it one becomes responsible for the action as from the moment of the blowin which case there is no killingofbreathingthings by the second blowThis method applies also when a blow is given by many to oneA command given after making a decision is a  command  as meansHerein too responsibility for the action should be followed out by the same method as that stated under  with ones own hand as meansAnd the definitive rule to be understood is sixfold as followsHerein the  object  is the breathing thing to be killedThe  time  is the time consisting in morning afternoon etc and the time consisting in youth full strength and so onThe  locality  is the village or town or wood or forest or crossroads and so onThe  weapon  is the sword arrow or spear and so onThe  posture  is the standing or sitting posture etc of the breathing thing to be killed and of the killerThe  kind of act  is the stabbing or the cutting or the breaking or the  polishedshell shave   and so onIf the object is mistaken and someone is killed other than the one whom it was commanded to kill then the giver of the command has no responsibility for the actionBut if the object is not mistaken and the death is caused then responsibility for the action lies with both the one giving the command and the one commanded with the former from the moment of his giving the command and with the latter from the moment of the deathLikewise in the case of time and the restA missile as means is when a blow is given for the purpose of killing by throwing something by the body or by what is connected to the bodyThat too is twofold being classed as directed to an individual and not so directed And responsibility for the action should be understood here in the way already statedA fixed contrivance as means  is as follows digging a pitfall fixing say a poisoned fchorn on what is leant on putting something lethal in someones vicinity administering unsuitable medicine poison a mechanical device etc the purpose of which is to killThat too is twofold being classed as directed to an individual or not so directed Consequently responsibility for the action should be understood in the way already stated hereinBut there is this difference When the pitfall or whatever it may be is given out to others by a lessor  for money or gratis then if the breathing thing dies with that as condition the responsibility for the action lies only with the lessorAlso even if the pitfall is obliterated either by him or by another and the ground made level there and then earthwashers  take away earth or rootdiggers digging up roots make a pit or mud appears after a fall of rain and anyone slipping in or getting bogged there dies then the responsibility for the action lies only with the lessorBut if either he who has thus obtained it from the lessor or someone else widens it and anyone dies with that as condition the responsibility for the action lies with bothIt is only according as roots interlock with roots in that place and it thus once more becomes firm ground that he is freed from potential responsibilitySimilarly with fixing say a poisoned thorn on what is leant on etc as long as they last so long should the responsibility for the action be understood to last according as applicable Magical science as means is the pronouncement of the incantations of magical science for the purpose of causing death Supernormal power as means  is the causing of alterations by the supernormal power that is the ripening of action such as the sharpening of the tusks etc of those that have tusks as weapons and so onIn the case of taking what is not given    the means are those beginning with  ones own hand  and  by command  occurring under the five heads of robbery by theft force hiding stratagem and teagrass  and the classification of these should also be understood in the way already statedIn the case of those beginning with whatisnottheDivineLife  only  ones own hand as means  is possible and not  by command  and the rest By factor  in the case of killingbreathingthings there are five factors that is to say there is a breathing thing the transgressor is percipient of that as a breathing thing the cognizance of killing is established he makes an effort the breathing thing dies by that effortIn the case of takingwhatisnotgiven the factors are also five that is to say there is what has been taken possession of by another the transgressor is percipient of that as having been taken possess sion of by another the cognizance of stealing is established he makes an effort what is takable is taken by himIn the case of whatisnottheDivineLife the factors are four that is to say there is an object for the infringe ment the cognizance of indulging is established the transgressor has the physical means ready as condition for indulgence and there is consent to the actSimilarly with the remaining two for in the case of speaking falsehood firstly the factors are four that is to say there is a falsehood there is established cognizance of deception regarding that object the appropriate effort is made the intimation occurs intimating what deceives anotherIn the case of the opportunityfornegligenceduetoliquor wineandbesottingdrink the factors are these four there is one or other of the tilings beginning with liquor cognizance of desire to drink an intoxicant is established one undertakes the appropriate effort when has been drunk it is absorbedThat is how the explanation should be known by factor By origination  killingbreathingthings takingwhatisnot given and speakingfalsehood have threefold origination namely by bodycumcognizance by speechcumcognizance and by body cumspeechcumcognizanceWhatisnottheDivineLife has only single origination namely by bodycumcognizanceThe opportunityfornegligenceduetoliquorwineandbe sottingdrink has twofold origination namely by body and by body cumcognizanceThis is how the explanation should be known by originationBy feeling killingbreathingthings is associated with only painful feelingTakingwhatisnotgiven is associated with any one of the three kinds of feeling Likewise speakingfalsehoodThe other two are associated only with pleasant or with neither painfulnorpleasant feelingThis is how the explanation should be known by feeling By root  killingbreathingthings has delusion and hate for its rootsTakingwhatisnotgiven and speakingfalsehood have greed and delusion for their roots or they have hate and delusion for their rootsThe other two have greed and delusion for their rootsThis is how the explanation should be known by root By action  killingbreathingthings takingwhatisnot given and whatisnottheDivineLife are always bodily action and to be such have always reached a completed course of action Speakingfalsehood is always verbal actionbut that which actually conceals a meaning is a completed course of action The opportunityfor negligenceduetofiquorwineandbesottingdrink is always bodily actionThis is how the explanation should be known by action By abstinence   here it may be asked When someone is abstaining from killing breathing things what does he abstain fromIt may be stated as follows Firstly when someone abstains by undertaking he abstains either from his own or others unprofitable action consisting in killing breathing things and the restContingent upon whatUpon only that from which he abstainsAnd secondly when someone abstains by custom he abstains from unprofitable action of the kind just stated tooUpon only the objects as already stated  of killingbreathingthings and the rest Some say however that  His abstaining from the opportunityfornegligence duetofiquorwineandbesottingdrink is contingent upon only determinations consisting of liquor wine and intoxicants that his abstaining from takingwhatisnotgiven and from speaking falsehood are contingent upon both determinations and creatures respectively to be stolen and to be deceived and that his abstaining from killingbreathingthings and from whatisnottheDivineLife are contingent only upon creaturesBut others holding the view that  If that is so then while cognizing one thing he would be doing another and so he would not know what it was that he was abandoning  did not agree and they said that  He abstains contingent only upon his own unprofitable action consisting in killingbreathingthings and the rest which is what he abandonsWhyBecause it takes no account either of presence or externalityfor in the Vibhanga reading of the training precepts after asking the question How many of the five training precepts are profitable How many are without conflict when the answer is given in the way beginning  They are profitable only They may be associated with pleasant feeling   they are then stated to  have a present object  and to  have an external object   thus their object is stated to be present and external  Consequently that does not apply to one  abstaining contingent upon his own unprofitable action consisting in killingbreathing things and so onNow as to the objection that  Cognizing one tiling he would be doing another and so he would not know what it was he was abandoning This is how the explanation should be known by abstinence By the fruit  all these actions beginning with killing breathingthings generate an unhappy destination as their fruit in rebirthlinking and in the course of existence in a happy destination they generate the unwishedfor the undesired and the disagreeable as their ripening this is in future existence In present existence they generate want of intrepidity etc as their fruitAlso this may be understood in the way beginning  Of killing breathing things the lightest ripening of all leads to short life in a human being   This is how the explanation should be known by the fruitIn addition the explanation of abstentions from killing breathingthings and the rest can be known by origination feeling root action and fruit also as followsHere is the layout All these abstentions originate from four originations namely from body from bodycumcognizance from speechcumcognizance and from bodycumspeechcumcognizanceAll as to feeling are either associated with pleasant feeling or associated with neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling All as to root have nongreed and nonhate for their roots or nongreed nonhate and nondelusion for their rootsAs to action four are bodily action while abstention from speaking falsehood is verbal action and at the moment of the path and when they are originated from cognizance they are all mental action as wellAs to fruit the fruits of abstention from killingbreathing things are such things as excellence of limbs excellence of height and girth excellence of speed surefootedness elegance malleability pureness courage great strength clarity of speech

distinguishing good from harm and so onThis is how the explanation of the abstentions from killingbreathingthings etc can also be known by origination feeling root action and fruithe would think Judging from the way this fish emerges from the ripples it makes and from its force this is a big fish not a small oneBut if its multiplicity is decided by the multiplicity of one of themThen if neither the singularity nor the multiplicity of these namely killing and the rest is decided by the singleness or multipleness of the victim etc but their singularity and multiplicity are decided otherwise  in fact then it should be stated how that is and as in the case of killing breathing things so also with the restBoth arguments are inappropriateor when a single victim is killed by many means beginning with ones own hand or when many choices originate the means for severing the fife faculty in only a single victim then there would have to be many killings of breathing thingsfor accordingly when there are many killers killing many victims by a single or by many means from among the arrow knife etc or from among those beginning with digging a pitfall then there are many killings of breathing thingsand when there is a single killer killing many victims either by a single means or by many means and by a single choice or by many choices originating the means to that then there are also many killings of breathing things and when there are many killers killing a single victim either by a single or by many means of the kind already stated then there are also many killings of breathing thingswhile taking whatisnotgiven whatisnottheDivineLife  and opportunityfornegligenceduetoliquorwineandbesottingdrink have for their objects other determinations that consist of one or other among the six external bases for contact beginning with visible form baseand also takingwhatisnotgiven has creatures for its object when a creature is to be stolenhowever these two latter are here contingent upon creatures only in virtue of the determinations upon which they are derivatively described not in virtue of the actual derivative description itself as is the case with speaking falsehoodfor they are to novices as the Defeats are to bhikkhus but responsibility for action  resides only in the one actually transgressedand when the means are equal it depends on the greater magnitude of the object namely the breathing thingBut in the case of human beings etc endowed with special qualities killingbreathing things is relatively less blamable in the case of one with small special qualitiesand when there is equality of special qualities and of the physical frame then the lesser blamableness should be understood to reside in the relative mildness of the defilements and of the active process adopted and the greater blamableness in their greater violenceand when after giving the blow with the intention to kill the breathing thing is not killed and then again a blow accompanied by another cognizance is given by him to that breathing thing not yet dead and later on if it dies of the first blow it is from then that he becomes responsible for the actionbut if it dies through both then he is responsible for the action as from the first blow If it does not die through either then there is no killingofbreathingthingsfor then the responsibility for the action lies with him by whose blow the breathing thing diedThe object time locality The weapon postureand the kind Of act these are the six that we Shall need to make  command  definedThat is how the explanation should be known by meanswhile any other is only action Contingent upon whatThat is incorrectit may be stated as follows when someone is causing an occurrence by accomplishing a function it is not said of him that  cognizing one thing he would be doing another  or that  he does not know what he is abandoningon the contraryContingently upon the Deathless State He is all evil things abandoningNow it was saidHere is a commentary on its meaning  Firstly what was construed in the commentary on the first five training precepts must be taken thence and construed in that on the last five training precepts tooHere is the construction   By object  just as in the first five training precepts as to object the opportunityfornegligenceduetoliquorwineandbesottingdrink had for its obiect determinations consisting of one or other among the bases beginning with the visible form base  so to untimely eatingAnd the classification by object should be understood in this way for all the restAnd by undertaking  these also are undertaken by whomsoever undertakes them whether novice or lay follower in the same way as the first five Also by factor again just as it was stated there in the classification of kilhngbreathingthings and so on  so here too there are four factors in the case of untimelyeating They are the untimeliness the permissibility only till noon of the particular object eaten the swallowing and the nonmadness of the eater The exposition of the factors should be understood in like manner for the rest By origination  and just as there by origination the opportunity for negligence  due  to  liquorwine  and  besotting drink had twofold origination namely by body and by bodycumcognizance  so too has untimelyeating hereThe origination of the rest can be understood in the same wayBy feeling and just as there by feeling takingwhatis notgiven was associated with any one of the three kinds of feeling  so too is untimelyeating hereAnd association with feeling can be understood in same way for all the restBy root and just as there whatisnottheDivineLife had greed and delusion for its roots  so too here has untimelyeating and it has also the alternative couple of rootsThe classification by root can be understood in this way for all the restBy action and just as there killingbreathingthings was bodily action  so too here are untimelyeating and the rest By abstinence  and just as there someone abstains either from his own or others unprofitable action consisting in killing breathingthings and the rest  so too here he abstains from any unprofitable action consisting in eating after noon and also from any such that is profitable as wellAnd just as the first five abstinences had fourfold origination namely by body by bodycumcognizance by speechcumcogni zance and by bodycumspeechcumcognizance and just as all were either associated with pleasant feeling or associated with neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling and had nongreed and nonhate for their roots or nongreed nonhate and nondelusion for their roots  and generated various kinds of wishedfor fruit  so too this is What thence in the last five must be Construed  here And special applicationThen why inferior we review And why superior to boot  Untimely eating is eating when noon has gone byfor this eating takes place when the permitted time has gone by  that is why it is called untimelyeating   From that untimely eatingDancing  singing  music  and contortionist show  here dancing is any kind of dancing singing is any kind of singing music is any kind of musiccontortionist show is a showing of contortions or a showing that is a contortion by its corrupting what partakes of the profitable because of its being a condition for the arising of defilement And while some worthy monks and divines after eating food given by the faithful abide devoted to such contortionist showsthat is to say dancing singing music stageshows  balladreciting manual playing cymbal playing drumming miming the game of outcastes the the game of bamboos bonewashing elephantfights horsefights buffalofights bullfights goat fights ramfights cockfights quailfights dogfights stickfights fistfights wrestling military exercises army parades martial reviews troop inspections or anything of the kind the monk Gotama abstains altogether from such contortionist show  Or an alternative interpretation dancing singing and music in the sense already stated are themselves contortions  thus it is  contortions consisting in dancing singing and music   and the seeing of them is  seeing of contortions consisting in dancing singing and music  Consequently in this latter interpretation while from seeing and from hearing  should actually be said nevertheless just as in such passages as  And he has wrong view and mistaken seeing   seeing  is said including also an objective field that does not occur in the eyedoor so too  hearing  is also implicitly stated here by the word  seeingTransgression takes place in one who sees after approaching out of desire to seeBut if it comes to the place where he is standing or sitting or lying down or comes within his horizon while walking and he sees it then while there may be defilement there is no transgression of the preceptAnd it should be understood that the adapting of the True Idea to song is not allowed but the adapting of song to the True Idea is allowedIn the case of opportunity for wearing of garlands  smartening with scents  and embellishment with unguents the three words beginning with  garlands  should be construed appropriately with the three beginning with  wearing  Herein garlands are any kind of flowerUnguents are any preparation made by pounding materials for the purpose of anointingNone of these is allowed for the purpose of smartening or embellishing  though they are allowed for medicinal purposes And when brought for the purpose of an offering they are in no way allowed for gratificationHigh couches  This is what all those that exceed the permitted heightmeasurements are calledLarge couches are couches and spreads disallowed in sizeNeither of these is allowed to be accepted  in any wayGold is the noble metal Silver is a kahapana  or it can also be a metal masaka or a wooden masaka or a clay masaka and so on of any kind as employed in commerce anywhere Both together are jataruparajata Accepting is the acceptance of that in any manner and that is not allowed in any sense This is how what is special to the last five should be statedAlso these ten training precepts are inferior when undertaken with inferior zeal or with inferior energy cognizance or inquiry they are medium with medium zeal etc and they are superior with superior zeal and so onOr alternatively they are inferior when defiled by craving wrong views and conceit they are medium when not so defiled they are superior when aided by understanding in any instanceThey are inferior when undertaken by profitable cognizance dissociated from knowledge they are medium when undertaken by profitable cognizance associated with knowledge and unprompted by determination That is how the inferior we review And why superior to bootAt this point the Schedule of the Commentary on the meaning which was set out in the six stanzas beginning  Of these it should be known by whom They were pronounced where when and why  has been explained as to meaningin the Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning the commentary on the Minor Books is ended What thence in the last five must be Construed and special applicationThen why inferior we review And why superior to boot except that acceptinggoldandsilver may be bodily action or verbal action or mental action but its occurrence in the bodydoor and speechdoor is simply as the manner of its presence  not as a completed course of actionAnd here in this interpretation  contortionist show  must be taken in the way stated in the Brahmajala Suttafor it is said thereand all the remaining kinds of scents such as talcum powder incense smoke etc are scents The explanation of the Training PreceptsNow the turn has come for the commentary on the Boys Questions that begin with the words One is whatWe shall give a commentary after telling the Need Arisen  for their utterance and the purpose for which they were placed here as the fourth item in the Minor ReadingsThe Need Arisen was this The Blessed One had a great disciple called SopakaThat venerable one developed final knowledge  at the age of only seven years from his birth The Blessed One wanted to allow his Full Admission to the Community by the method of getting him to answer questions and seeing  his ability to answer questions in the sense that he the questioner himself intended he put the questions beginning with  One is whatThe Boy answeredand satisfied the Blessed One with his answersAnd that was the venerable ones Full AdmissionThis was the need arisen for their utteranceNow maintenance of purified cognizance in other words Concentration in being by means of the Recollections of the Enlightened One the True Idea and the Community has been explained under the Going for Refuge  and maintenance of Virtue in being has been explained under the Training Precepts  and maintenance of MindfulnessoftheBody in being has been explained under the Thirtytwofold Aspect  and so now these answers to questions are placed here in the position they occupy in the Minor Readings in order to show the headings under which Understanding in its various aspects is maintained in beingOr alternatively Concentration has Virtue for its footing and Understanding has Concentration for its footing according as it is said  When a wise man established well in Virtue  Develops Cognizance and Understanding   and so it can be understood that after employing the Training Precepts to show Virtue and the Thirtytwofold Aspect to show the Concentration which has that as its resort these questions are placed here in order to show the classes of that Understanding which belongs among the several ideas that constitute the equipment of concentrated cognizanceThis is the purpose for which they were placed hereNow comes the commentary on them The Blessed One asked One is what He asked the question with reference to that one idea by becoming completely dispassionate towards which a bhikkhu might eventually make an end of suffering or that one idea by becoming dispassionate towards which this venerable one  had eventually made an end of sufferingThe Elder replied All creatures subsist by nutriment He did so employing the mode of teaching in terms of a personAnd what is right mindfulnessHence what should be here understood to be stated by the Elder when asked  One is what is either the nutriment in virtue of which all creatures are said to  subsist by nutriment  or else it is their subsistence by the nutrimentfor this is said by the Blessed OneWhat one ideaAll creatures subsist by nutrimentWhen a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards this one idea  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowSo it was with reference to this that it was said earlier one question one indication one answer And here as regards the expression  subsist by nutriment  Bhikkhus there is the sign of beautyThe cultivation of unreasoned attention to that is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen zeal for sensual desires   since a condition is called a  nutriment  in such passages as by taking the word  nutriment  accordingly to mean  condition  it is creatures maintained by conditions that are said to  subsist by nutriment However if  subsist by nutriment is taken as said with reference to the  four nutriments   then the word  all  would be out of place because of the passage  The gods that are nonpercipient creatures are rootcauseless  without nutriment without contact and without feeling  Here it might be said Even if it is stated thus nevertheless because of the passage  What ideas are accompanied by conditionsThe five categories namely the form category the feeling category the perception category the determinations category and the consciousness category  subsistence by conditions is appropriate only to the categories and this passage would be inappropriate to creaturesIt should not be regarded in that way Why not Because of the establishment in the case of creatures that they are only a metaphor  for the categoriesBecause they must be described derivatively upon the categoriesHowIn the same way as  village is a metaphor for housesJust as  when one or two or three of a villages houses have been burnt it is said that  the village has been burnt  because  village  is describable as such derivatively upon the houses and thus the metaphor of  village  is established with respect to a house so too this metaphor namely  creatures subsist by nutriment  is established with respect to the categories which subsist by nutriment in the sense of the conditions without which they cannot ariseAnd in the ultimate sense too it can be understood that the usage  creatures  is metaphorical with respect to categories which is shown to be established by the Blessed Ones saying  While the categories are born and age from moment to moment you bhikkhu are being born and ageing and dying  Consequently it can be understood that  one  means the condition styled  nutriment  by means of which all creatures subsist or that it means their subsistence by nutrimentNow whether it is nutriment or subsistence by nutriment it is a reason for dispassion because of the aspect of its impermanenceAnd then one who comes to dispassion by seeing impermanence in these determinations termed  all creatures  is one who eventually makes an end of suffering and reaches purity in the ultimate sense Impermanent are all determinations  And so when he sees thus with understandingfor they say  ki ha  when  kim  should be saidSome assert that  ha  is a particle and also that this too is the reading of those of the Elders Tradition However the meaning is the same in either caseand it can be read according to preferenceAnd again just as in such passages as  Sukhena phuttha atha va dukhena  and  dukkham domanassam patisamvedeti   in some instances  dukkham  is said and in others  dukham so too in some instances  eka  is said and in others  ekam and in fact here too there is the reading ekam namaHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body  And here in working out the construing of the answer it is such Suttas as that establish it for it is that which is intended here by the Blessed One with the word  one though it is not intended to signify that  neither in the Dispensation nor in the world of secular and sectarian teaching outside it does there exist any other one  Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards one idea when his lust for it completely fades away when he is completely liberated from it when he sees completely the ending of it then he is one who after attaining rightness  makes an end of suffering here and nowfor it is established in the case of creatures that this term  creatures  is a metaphor for the categoriesWhyaccording as it is saidHe then dispassion finds in suffering  This path it is that leads to purification  And here in the phrase  One is what  the reading is twofold as Kim and Ki ha Herein the Sinhalese reading is ki haSo the Teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Two is what in the same manner as beforeResponding to the number  two  the Elder replied Name and form  employing the mode of teaching in terms of ideasHerein because of the act of bending  towards an object and because of being the rootcause of the bent of cognizance all of what is formless is called  name  And in accordance with what is meant here when it is said that  There is the two that is to say name and form that is not because of the absence of other twos Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards two ideas  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowWhat twoName and formSo it was with reference to this that it was said earlier two questions two indications two answers And here he comes to dispassion only through the Gateway to Liberation consisting in Contemplation of Notself  abandoning the selfview through seeing merely nameandform And so he eventually makes an end of suffering and reaches purity in the ultimate senseaccording as it is said And then besides notself are all ideas  And so when he sees thus with understandingbut here only what is inseparable from the idea of being affected by taints and not what is supra mundane that is taintless is meant here since that is the rootcause of the dispassion  The four great entities and all kinds of form that occur derived upon them are collectively called  form  in the sense of their becoming deformed   And all that is meant hereaccording as it is saidwhen a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards these two ideas  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and now He then dispassion finds in suffering  This path it is that leads to purification  the perception aggregatethe formations aggregatethe consciousness aggregatein the case of perceptionThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jīvakas Mangogrove with reference to a question asked by JīvakaThe Story of Jīvaka is related in detail in the KhandhakaNow on a certain occasion Devadatta joined forces with Ajātasattu climbed Vulture Peak and out of the wickedness of his heart saying to himself I will kill the Teacher hurled down a rockTwo mountain crags caught the rock and splintered itThe Teacher suffered intense pains and was removed by the monks to MaddakucchiDesiring to go on to Jīvakas Mangogrove the Teacher said to the monks Carry me thitherWhen Jīvaka heard the news he immediately went to the Teacher and to heal the wound applied an astringent Then he bound up the wound and said to the Teacher Reverend Sir I have a patient in the city As soon as I have visited him I will return Let this dressing remain exactly as it is until I return So saying Jīvaka went and treated his patientBut the gate was closed when he returned and he was therefore unable to enterThereupon the following thought occurred to him I have committed a grievous fault I applied an astringent to the foot of the Tathāgata and bound up his wound just as I should have bound up the wound of any other man It is now time to remove the bandage For if the bandage remains unbound all night long the Exalted One will suffer intense painAt that moment the Teacher addressed the Elder nanda nanda Jīvaka returned late in the evening and was unable to enter the gate This was the thought in his mind Now it is time to remove the bandageTherefore remove the bandageThe Elder removed the bandage whereupon the scar disappeared like bark from a treeAt early dawn Jīvaka hastened to the Teachers side and asked Reverend Sir did you suffer intense painSaid the Teacher Jīvaka all suffering is extinguished for the Tathāgata even as when he sat on the Throne of Enlightenment And joining the connection and preaching the Law he pronounced the following Stanzabut one of the flying pieces struck the foot of the Exalted One and caused blood to flowSo the monks took the Teacher and carried him to Jīvakas MangogroveFor him who has completed his journey for him who is free from sorrow For him who has freed himself from the bonds which beset him on all sidesFor him who has shaken off all the fetters for such a one no suffering is possibleThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to the Elder Kassapa the GreatFor on a certain occasion after keeping residence during the season of the rains at Rājagaha the Teacher caused the following announcement to be made to the monks At the expiration of a fortnight the Teacher will go forth on a pilgrimage for alms We are told that this is a practice of the Buddhas when they desire to go forth on an almspilgrimage with the monksThe following consideration presents itself to their minds Under these circumstances the monks will scald their bowls and dye their robes and will make the pilgrimage pleasantly This then was the reason why the Teacher caused the announcement to be made to the monks At the expiration of a fortnight I will go forth on a pilgrimage for almsBut while the monks were scalding their bowls and dyeing their robes the Elder Kassapa the Great washed his robesThe monks were offended at this and said Why does the Elder wash his robes Within and without this city dwell a hundred and eighty million peopleSo many of these as are not the Elders kinsfolk are his supporters and so many as are not his supporters are his kinsfolkAll these people show honor and reverence to the Elder by providing him with the Four RequisitesIf he rejects all their good offices where will he goEven were he to go he would not go farther than Māpamāda Cave Likewise the Teacher thought as he set out on his pilgrimage Within and without this city dwell a hundred and eighty million people and on occasions of public festivals or disasters there the monks must goIt is therefore out of the question to leave the monastery empty But shall I direct all of them to returnThen the following thought occurred to him These people are either kinsfolk or retainers of Kassapa therefore it is Kassapa whom I should direct to returnThe monks were offended at this and said Did you observe brethren Did we not just say Why is Kassapa the Great washing his robes He will not accompany the TeacherEverything has happened just as we said it would When the Teacher heard the talk of the monks he turned around stood still and said Monks what is this you are sayingWe are talking about Elder Kassapa the Great Reverend Sir replied the monks and then repeated their conversation word for wordThe Teacher listened to what they had to say and then replied Monks you say Kassapa is attached to his households and his requisites As a matter of fact he turned back because it was his desire to obey my commandFor in a previous state of existence he made an Earnest Wish and became like the moon free from attachment He made the Earnest Wish May I be able to approach the households of supportersKassapa has no attachment for a household or a requisite Beginning with Kassapa I preached to all a Path like that of the moon the Path of the Stock of the ElectThe monks asked the Teacher Reverend Sir when did the Elder make his Earnest WishMonks do you wish to hearYes Reverend SirWhen the Teacher had related in detail this deed of the Elder in a previous state of existence he said Thus monks beginning with my son Kassapa I preached to all a Path like that of the moon the Path of the Stock of the Elect My son has no attachment for requisites or households or monasteries or cells My son has no attachment anywhere but is like a royal goose which goes down into a lake and swims therein and abides therein And joining the connection and preaching the Law he pronounced the following StanzaMāpamāda Cave by the way acquired its name in the following way Whenever the Teacher reached this cave he would say to the monks who were to returnNow you may return be not heedless mā pamajjittha Thus this cave came to be called Māpamāda CaveAccordingly he said to the Elder Kassapa it is out of the question to leave the monastery empty for there is need of monks on occasions of public festivals or disasters therefore take your own retinue with you and returnVery well Reverend Sir replied the Elder and taking his own retinue with him he returnedSaid the Teacher to them Monks a hundred thousand cycles of time in the past the Buddha Padumuttara appeared in the world Beginning with these words the Teacher related the whole story of the Elders deed in a previous state of existence beginning with his Earnest Wish in the dispensation of the Buddha PadumuttaraThey that are mindful exert themselves they take not pleasure in an abodeAs geese leave a lake so also do they leave house and homeThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Venerable BelaṭṭhisīsaThe story goes that this Venerable Elder finding it annoying to seek alms regularly made a round for alms through one street in a village and after eating his breakfast made another round through a second street taking boiled rice without sauce or curry carrying it to the monastery and storing it away After spending a few days in the bliss of Ecstatic Meditation he had need of the food and therefore ate itWhen the monks found out what he had done they were offended and reported the matter to the Exalted OneOn this occasion the Teacher promulgated the rule forbidding monks to store away food for future use But since the Elder committed the fault before the rule had been promulgated and because he was satisfied with but little the Teacher declared him to be free from guilt And joining the connection and preaching the Law he pronounced the following StanzaThey whose resort is the Void the Uncaused DeliveranceTheir going is hard to follow like the flight of birds through the airThey that possess not stores of food they that know their food arightThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to the Elder AnuruddhaFor one day the Elder whose robes were worn out was seeking fresh robes on refuseheaps and in other similar placesNow in the Elders third previous existence he had a wife who had been reborn in the World of the Thirtythree as the goddess JālinīWhen the goddess Jālinī saw the Elder seeking cloths for robes she resolved to aid him So taking three celestial cloths thirteen cubits long and four cubits wide and thinking to herself If I display these cloths in this manner the Elder will not take them she went to a certain refuseheap in front of the heap where the Elder was seeking cloths and laid them down in such a way that only the hems were visibleAs the Elder proceeded on his way seeking cloths he saw the hems of the celestial garments whereupon he took hold of them and pulled them out When he saw that they possessed the dimensions above described he said to himself This indeed is a most remarkable refuseheap  And taking them with him he went his wayOn the day he was to make his robes the Teacher accompanied by his retinue of five hundred monks went to the monastery and sat down likewise did the eighty Chief Elders sit down there also For the purpose of sewing the robes Elder Kassapa the Great sat at the foot Elder Sāriputta in the midst and Elder nanda at the head The company of monks spun out the thread the Teacher threaded the needle and Elder Moggallāna the Great went hither and thither supplying whatever else might be neededThe goddess entered the village and incited the inhabitants to give alms saying They are making robes for my noble Elder Anuruddha The Teacher surrounded by the eighty Chief Disciples and accompanied by his retinue of five hundred monks has gone to the monastery and sat down thereinTake riceporridge and other provisions and go to the monastery During the meal Elder Moggallāna the Great brought large pieces of roseapple but the five hundred monks were unable to eat itSakka drew a circle about the place where they were making the robes the earth was as if dyed with lac there was a great heap of food both soft and hard remaining over and above to the monks who had eatenThe monks were offended and said Why should such a quantity of food be provided for so few monksJudging by the quantity Anuruddhas kinsfolk and retainers must have been told Bring this quantity Elder Anuruddha doubtless wishes to show how many relatives and supporters he has The Teacher asked the monks what they were talking about When they told him he said But monks you do not think that this was brought by any orders of Anuruddha do youYes Reverend Sir we doThey that have rid themselves of the Depravities do not spend their time talking about Requisites nay these provisions were produced by the supernatural power of a goddess And joining the connection and preaching the Law he pronounced the following StanzaMonks my son Anuruddha does not talk thusHe who has rid himself of the Contaminations he who relies not upon foodHe whose resort is the Void the Uncaused DeliveranceHis going is hard to follow like the flight of birds through the airThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Pubbārāma with reference to Elder Kaccāyana the GreatFor once upon a time on the occasion of the terminal festival  the Exalted One sat on the ground floor of the mansion of the Mother of Migāra surrounded by a company of eminent lay disciplesAt this time Elder Kaccāyana the Great resided in the Avanti countryNow this Venerable Elder although obliged to come from a great distance regularly attended the preaching of the LawTherefore when the Chief Elders sat down they always left a seat for Elder Kaccāyana the GreatSakka king of gods drew near with his celestial retinue from the two Worlds of Gods and honored the Teacher with celestial perfumes and garlands Not seeing Elder Kaccāyana the Great he thought to himself Why is my noble Elder nowhere seenIt would be well if he were to draw nearAt that very moment the Elder drew near and showed himself sitting in his proper seatWhen Sakka saw the Elder he grasped him firmly by the ankles and said It is indeed well that my noble Elder has come that my noble Elder should come was the very thing I wished for So saying he rubbed the Elders feet with both hands honored him with perfumes and garlands and having paid obeisance to him stood respectfully on one sideThe monks were offended and saidSakka shows respect of persons in rendering honor Such honor as this he has not rendered to the rest of the Chief Disciples The moment he saw Kaccāyana the Great he grasped him by the ankles and said It is indeed well that my noble Elder has come that my noble Elder should come was the very thing I wished forSo saying he rubbed the Elders feet with both hands honored him with perfumes and garlands and having paid obeisance to him stood respectfully on one sideThe Teacher hearing their talk said Monks those monks who like my son Kaccāyana the Great keep the doors of their senses guarded are beloved both of gods and men So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following StanzaFor such a man the gods cherish deep affectionIf he has put away pride if he is free from the ContaminationsLike horses well broken in by a charioteerIf a mans senses have been brought to a state of tranquillityThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder SāriputtaFor once upon a time at the conclusion of the rains Elder Sāriputta desiring to go forth on an almspilgrimage took leave of the Teacher paid obeisance to him and departed with his own retinueMany other monks took leave of the ElderIn dismissing the monks the Elder mentioned the personal and family name of all of the monks who were known by personal and family namesA certain monk who was not known by a personal and family name said Oh that the Elder would greet me by a personal and family name in dismissing me But in the great throng of monks the Elder did not notice himThereupon the monk said to himself He does not greet me as he does the other monks and straightway conceived a grudge against the ElderBesides that the hem of the Elders garment brushed against the monk and this also served to intensify the hatred the monk felt towards the ElderSo soon as he knew that the Elder had passed beyond the entrance to the monastery he approached the Teacher and said to him Reverend Sir Venerable Sāriputta doubtless thinking to himself I am your Chief Disciple struck me a blow that almost broke the chain of my earHaving so done without so much as begging my pardon he set out on his almspilgrimageThe Teacher caused the Elder to be summonedThereupon Elder Moggallāna the Great and Elder nanda thought to themselves The Teacher does not know that our oldest brother did not really strike this monk the Elder will of course roar a lions roar Accordingly they decided to convoke an assemblyWith key in hand they opened the doors of the cells saying Approach Venerable Sirs Approach Venerable Sirs So soon as Venerable Sāriputta is face to face with the Exalted One he will roar the roar of a lion So saying they convoked a full assembly of the monksElder Sāriputta came with the rest saluted the Teacher and sat down respectfully on one sideWhen the Teacher questioned him about the incident the Elder instead of saying I did not strike that monk recited his own virtuesSaid he Reverend Sir in case any monk has not meditated on the body he should here find a companionmonk and forsaking him not go forth on pilgrimage Then he said Reverend Sir it is as when they cast on the earth what is clean and then cast on the earth what is unclean He compared his own tranquillity of mind to that of the earth to that of the severed horns of a bull to that of a Caṇḍāla youth to water fire wind removal of impurity he compared the oppression he suffered through his own body to the oppression of snakes and corpses he compared the maintenance of his own body to that of protuberances of fatAs the Elder described his own virtues in terms of these nine similes the great earth shook nine times in succession to its ocean boundaryAs he employed the similes of the removal of impurity the Caṇḍāla youth and the protuberances of fat those monks who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion were unable to restrain their tears while those who had attained Arahatship were filled with religious emotionAs the Elder recited his own virtues remorse pervaded the whole body of the monk who had unjustly slandered him And straightway he fell at the feet of the Exalted One admitted that he was guilty of slander and confessed his faultThe Teacher addressing the Elder said Sāriputta pardon this deluded man lest his head split into seven piecesThereupon the monks said Behold brethren the surpassing goodness of the Elder He cherishes neither anger nor hatred against this lying slanderous monkInstead he crouches before him extends his hands in an attitude of reverence and asks his pardonWhen the Teacher heard the talk of the monks he said Monks what are you talking about  When they told him he said Monks it is impossible for Sāriputta and his like to cherish anger or hatred Sāriputtas mind is like the great earth like a threshold like a pool of still water So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following StanzaThereupon the Elder crouched before the monk and extending his clasped hands in an attitude of reverence said to him Reverend Sir I freely pardon this Venerable monkLet this Venerable monk also pardon me if I have in any way offended against himThe rounds of existence do not exist for such a manHe is like a pool of water free from mudlike a threshold such is the virtuousLike the earth he is not troubledThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a novice of the Elder TissaThe story goes that a certain youth of station residing at Kosambi retired from the world and became a monk in the Religion of the Teacher After making his full profession he was known as Elder Kosambivāsī TissaAfter he had kept residence during the season of the rains at Kosambi his supporter brought a set of three robes and offerings of ghee and jagghery and laid them at his feetSaid the Elder to him What are these lay discipleReverend Sir have you not kept residence with me during the season of the rainsThose who keep residence in our monastery always receive these offerings pray accept them Reverend SirNever mind lay disciple I have no need of themI have no novice to perform the usual offices for me brotherThe lay disciple brought his own son but seven years old to the Elder and committed him into the Elders hands saying Pray receive him into the Order Reverend SirThe instant the razor touched his hair he attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural FacultiesThe Elder having received the youth into the Order remained there for a fortnight Then deciding to visit the Teacher he directed the novice to take the requisites and set out on his journey On the way he entered a certain monasteryThe novice obtained lodging for the Elder and looked after it for himWhile he was thus engaged it grew dark and he was therefore unable to provide a lodging for himselfWhen the time came for the novice to wait upon the Elder the novice approached the Elder and sat down The Elder asked the novice Novice have you not neglected to provide yourself with lodgingReverend Sir I have had no opportunity to look after a lodging for myselfWell then remain with me It will inconvenience you to lodge outside in the place reserved for visitors So saying the Elder taking him with him entered his own lodgingNow the Elder had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion and as soon as he lay down fell asleepThereupon the novice thought to himself Today is the third day during which I have occupied the same lodging with my preceptor If I lie down to sleep the Elder will commit the offense of sleeping in common Therefore I will spend the night sitting up So assuming a crosslegged posture near the bed of his preceptor he spent the night sitting upThe Elder rose at dawn and said to himself I must cause the novice to go out So he took a fan which was placed at the side of the bed struck the mat of the novice with the tip of the palmleaf and then tossing the fan into the air said Novice go out The handle of the fan struck the novice in the eye and straightway put out his eyeWhat did you say Reverend Sir  said the novice Rise and go out was the replyThe novice instead of saying Reverend Sir my eye has been put out covered his eye with one hand and went outMoreover when it was time for him to perform his duties as novice he did not say My eye has been put out nor did he remain seated but covering his eye with one hand and taking a handbroom in the other hand he swept out the privy and the washroom after which setting out water for washing the face he swept out the Elders cellWhen he advanced to present the toothstick to the Elder he presented it to him with only one handHis preceptor said to him This novice is not properly trained Is it proper for a novice to present a toothstick to teachers and preceptors with one handReverend Sir I know perfectly well what is the proper form but one of my hands is not disengagedThen the novice told him the whole story beginning at the beginningWhen the Elder heard his story he was deeply moved and said to himself Oh what a grievous thing I have done  Then he said to the novice Pardon me most excellent youth I did not know this Be my refuge And extending his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation he crouched on the ground before the feet of a sevenyearold noviceThen said the novice to him It was not for this purpose Reverend Sir that I spoke I said this for the purpose of sparing your feelings You are not to blame in this matter and neither am IThe round of existences alone is to blame for this It was because I wished to spare you remorse that I did not tell you the real factsThe novice tried to comfort the Elder but he would not be comforted Overcome with remorse he took the novices requisites and proceeded to the TeacherAs the Teacher sat he observed him approachingThe Elder went to the Teacher saluted him and exchanged friendly greetings with him The Teacher asked him Monk is everything well with you I trust that you have suffered no excessive discomfort The Elder replied All is well with me Reverend Sir I have suffered no excessive discomfortBut here is a young novice whose good qualities surpass anything I have ever seenWhy what has he done monkThereupon the Elder told him the whole story beginning at the beginning and concluding as follows Reverend Sir when I asked him to pardon me he said this to me You are not to blame in this matter and neither am IThe round of existences alone is to blame for this Be not disturbed Thus he tried to comfort me appearing to cherish neither anger nor hatred towards meHis good qualities surpass anything I have ever seenSaid the Teacher to the Elder Monk those who have rid themselves of the Depravities cherish neither anger nor hatred towards anyone On the contrary their senses are in a state of calm and their thoughts are in a state of calm So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following StanzaWhy is that Reverend SirReverend Sir if it be true that you have no novice to minister to your needs my son will become your noviceThe Elder graciously accepted the offerThe Elder moistened the boys hair taught him the Formula of Meditation on the first five of the Constituent Parts of the Body and received him into the OrderWhat is the matter noviceHis thoughts are calm his speech is calm his deeds are calmSuch is the calm of one who has obtained Deliverance by Right KnowledgeThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Khadiravaniya RevataWhen the Venerable Sāriputta renounced eightyseven crores of treasure and became a monk three sisters of his Cālā Upacālā and Sīsūpacālā and two brothers Canda and Upasena entered the Religious Life and the youth Revata alone remained at homeHis mother thought to herself My son Upatissa has renounced all this wealth and become a monk three sisters of his and two brothers of his have entered the Religious Life Revata alone remains at homeShould he make a monk of Revata also all this wealth will be lost and the family stock will be uprooted I will get him married while he is yet a mere boyOn his return the Elder Sāriputta addressed the monks as follows Brethren should Revata come here desiring to become a monk you are to make a monk of him the moment he arrives my mother and father hold false views why should their permission be asked I myself am Revatas mother and fatherWhen the boy Revata was only seven years old his mother made preparations for his marriage She selected a girl of good family appointed a day for the wedding adorned the boy with handsome garments and costly ornaments and accompanied by a large retinue accompanied him to the house of the girls parentsThe kinsfolk of both parties were present at the festivities and placing their hands in a bowl of water pronounced blessings and wished them prosperity saying to the bride May you behold the Truth your grandmother beheld may you live long even as your grandmotherThe youth Revata thought to himself What do they mean by the Truth her grandmother beheld  And he asked them Which woman is her grandmotherThey said to him Sir do you not see that woman a hundred and twenty years old with broken teeth and gray hair full of wrinkles her body marked with moles crooked as a shaped rafterThat is her grandmotherBut will my wife look like that some daySir she will if she livesKinsmen assisted the youth and his bride to enter a carriage and they started out all togetherWhen they had gone a little way Revata informed them that he wished to relieve himself and said Just stop the carriage and I will step out and return immediately He stepped out of the carriage went into a certain thicket remained there a little while and then returnedA second and a third time he made the same excuse stepped down from the carriage and climbed back againHis kinsmen made up their minds Doubtless these calls of nature are habitual with him and therefore did not keep close watch of himWhen they had gone a little way farther he made the same excuse stepped down out of the carriage and saying You drive on ahead I will follow after you slowly disappeared in the direction of a thicketWhen his kinsmen heard him say I will follow after you they drove on aheadNow in this region lived thirty monks and when Revata had made good his escape he went to them paid obeisance to them and said Reverend Sirs receive me into the OrderDont you recognize me Reverend SirsWe do not brotherIt is just as I say Reverend Sirs the reverend monks call my brother Sāriputta and therefore do not know who is meant when the name Upatissa is mentionedYes Reverend SirWhen the Elder received the message he said to the Exalted One Reverend Sir since the forestmonks have sent me word Revata has been received into the Order I should like to go and see him and then returnThe novice said to himself If I continue to reside here my kinsmen will follow me and summon me to return home Therefore he obtained from the monks a Formula of Meditation as far as Arahatship took bowl and robe and set out on his almspilgrimage After journeying a distance of thirty leagues he came to an acacia forest and there he took up his residence for the season of the rains Before the three months of the rainy season had passed he attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural FacultiesAfter the terminal festival the Elder Sāriputta again requested the Teacher to permit him to go to his brotherThe Teacher said  We too will go Sāriputta and set out with five hundred monksWhen they had gone a little way the Elder nanda standing at a fork in the road said to the Teacher Reverend Sir there are two roads to the place where Revata resides one is protected and is sixty leagues long and men live thereon the other is a direct route thirty leagues long infested by evil spirits which one shall we takeWell nanda did Sīvali accompany usYes Reverend SirAs soon as the Teacher set foot on that road the forestdeities thinking to themselves We will do honor to the noble Elder Sīvali erected resthouses a league apart all along the route and permitting the monks to go no farther than a league they rose early in the morning and taking heavenly broth rice and other provisions they went about asking Where is the noble Elder Sīvali seatedThe Elder presented to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha the alms they brought himThus the Teacher together with his retinue went a long and difficult journey of thirty leagues enjoying the fruit of the merit acquired by one Elder SīvaliAs soon as the Elder Revata learned that the Teacher was approaching he created by magic a Perfumed Chamber for the Exalted One and likewise for the monks five hundred pinnacled residences five hundred covered walks and five hundred nightquarters and dayquartersThe Teacher spent an entire month there as his guestBut there were two old monks living there who when the Teacher entered the acacia forest said to themselves How will this monk be able to perform his meditations while engaged in all this new work The Teacher shows favoritism to one who is the youngest brother of Sāriputta in coming to live with the builder of all this new workAs the Teacher surveyed the world on the morning of that day he saw those two monks and became aware of their disposition of mindSo when he had resided there for a month and the day came for him to depart he resolved that those monks should forget to take with them their measure of oil and their watervessel and their sandals Accordingly when he came to depart withdrawing just beyond the entrance to the monastery he sent forth his magical powerStraightway those monks exclaimed I have forgotten this and that I have forgotten it too and both turned to retrace their steps But they were unable to find the place where they had left their belongings and as they wandered about the thorns of the acaciatrees pierced their feet Finally they saw their belongings hanging on the branch of an acaciatree and taking them with them departedThe Teacher with the Congregation of Monks remained for yet another month enjoying the fruit of the merit of the Elder Sīvali and then went into residence at PubbārāmaThose two old monks bathed their faces early in the morning and said Let us go to the house of Visākhā the giver of alms to pilgrims and drink broth So they went there and sat down drinking broth and eating hard foodVisākhā asked them Reverend Sirs did you accompany the Teacher to the place where the Elder Sīvali residesYes lay disciple A charming place Reverend Sirs where the Elder residesWhere does its charm come in Its a jungle of acaciatrees full of white thorns lay disciple fit only for ascetics to live inShortly afterwards two young monks came to the doorThe lay disciple provided them with broth and hard food and asked them the same questionThey replied Lay disciple it is impossible to describe in words the Elders place of residence it is like the heavenly palace Sudhammā formed by magical powerThe lay disciple thought to herself The visiting monks who came first said one thing and these monks say quite another It must be that when the Teacher sent forth his magical power the visiting monks who came first forgot something and had to go back again on the other hand these monks must have gone there at the time when it was fashioned and perfected by magical power Knowing the true explanation by her own wisdom she waited saying I will ask the Teacher when he comesAt that very moment the Teacher surrounded by the Congregation of Monks came to the house of Visākhā and sat down in the seats prepared for themVisākhā reverently ministered to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and at the end of the meal paid obeisance to the Teacher and asked him the following question Reverend Sir some of the monks who accompanied you say The place where the Elder Revata resides is a forest a jungle of acacias others say that it is a charming place what is the explanation of thisThe Teacher replied Lay disciple whether it be in a village or in a forest or in what place soever Arahats reside that place is full of delight And joining the connection he preached the Law by pronouncing the following StanzaIn a village it may be or in a forest on the sea or on dry landNo matter where the Arahats reside that spot is full of delightAt another time the monks began a discussion Brethren why was it that the Elder Sīvali remained for seven days and seven months and seven years in his mothers womb Why was it that he was tormented in Hell How did he come to reach the pinnacle of gain and honorThe Teacher heard the discussion asked them what it was about and when they told him related the story of the Venerable Elders deed in a former existenceMonks ninetyone cycles of time ago the Exalted Vipassī appeared in the world and on a certain occasion making an almspilgrimage in the country returned to the city of his fatherThe king prepared hospitable offerings for the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and sent word to the citizens Come and share in my offeringsThe king came and seeing their offerings invited the Teacher for the following day saying to himself I will give offerings yet more abundant than these But the king could not outdo the citizens nor the citizens the kingTherefore they sent men out of the four gates of the city to seek fresh honey providing each man with a thousand pieces of moneyNow it happened that a certain countryman going to see the village headman caught sight of a honeycomb on the branch of a tree by the side of the road Driving the flies away he cut off the branch and taking honeycomb branch and stick he entered the city intending to give it to the village headmanOne of the men who had been sent out to seek fresh honey saw him and asked him Sir is that honey for saleNo master it is not for saleThe countryman thought to himself This honeycomb is not worth even a farthing but this man offers me a penny for itThen he said to the man Are you crazy or have you no way of spending your money This honey isnt worth a farthing but you offer me a thousand pieces of money for it what is the explanation of thisThat is perfectly true sir but I have some use for this honey and I will tell you what it isWe have prepared bounteous offerings for the Buddha Vipassī and his retinue of sixtyeight thousand monks but we have no fresh honey that is why I want itIf that is the case I will not sell it for a price if I may receive the merit of the offering I will give it to youThe same man also brought a pot of curds as a present poured the curds also into the vessel mixed them with the honey and offered the food to the Buddha and to the Congregation of Monks over which he presidedAll took as much as they required and there was more than enough for allWe must not ask ourselves the question How was it that so little food sufficed for so manyFor this was brought about by the supernatural power of the BuddhaHe who ponders the Four Inconceivables will go madHaving wrought a good work so slight the countryman was reborn when the term of life allotted to him had come to an end in the World of the Gods After passing through the round of existence for a very long period of time he passed at length from the World of the Gods and was reborn as the Prince Royal of Benāres On the death of the king his father he succeeded to the throneStraightway resolving I will take a certain city he invested the city and sent word to the citizens Give me battle or the kingdomThe king guarded the four principal gates and besieged the city for seven months and seven yearsNow his mother asked what her son was doing and on learning the facts said My son is a simpletonGo tell him to close the lesser gates and blockade the city completelyWhen the king received his mothers message he did as she told him toThe citizens were unable any longer to leave the city and on the seventh day killed their own king and gave the kingdom to the hostile kingBecause he committed this act he was reborn at the end of his life in the Hell of Avīci After suffering torment in this Hell until this great earth was elevated a league because he closed the four lesser gates he passed from that existence was conceived in the womb of his mother and remained in her womb for seven months and seven years lying across the mouth of the womb for seven daysThus monks through the demerit acquired by Sīvali in besieging the city at that time he was tormented in Hell for so long a period and because he closed the lesser gates when he was conceived in the womb of his mother he remained in her womb for so long a timeAgain another day the monks began a discussion How great was the novices gain How great was the merit through which one man was able to erect for five hundred monks five hundred pinnacled residencesThe Teacher came in and asked them Monks what is it that you are sitting here now talking about When they told him he said to them Monks my son is attached neither to good nor to evil he has renounced both So saying he pronounced the following Stanza in the Brāhmaṇa VaggaRevata thought to himself Can it be that even so beautiful a body as that of my wife will so change for the worse through old age This must be what my brother Upatissa saw This very day it behooves me to run away and become a monkBrother you are adorned with all the adornments we know not whether you are a kings son or a courtiers son how can we receive you into the OrderI am the youngest brother of UpatissaWho is this UpatissaWhy are you the youngest brother of SāriputtaWell then come This is the very thing your brother enjoined upon us So they removed his jewels received him into the Order and sent word to the ElderThe Teacher withheld his permission saying to him Remain here for the present SāriputtaBut after a few days the Elder made the same request and the Teacher withheld his permission as beforesaying Remain here for the present Sāriputta we will go there together laterIf Sīvali is with us take the direct route by all meansWe are told that the Teacher did not say I will see to it that you are provided with broth and rice take the short route because he knew within himself This is the place where each of these monks will receive gifts that are the fruit of a work of merit therefore he said If Sīvali is with us take the direct routeenjoying during his stay the fruit of the merit of a single Elder SīvaliHaving done so they made up their minds We will give offerings yet more abundant than those given by the king So they invited the Teacher prepared offerings on the following day and sent an invitation to the kingthe sixth time the citizens resolved Tomorrow we will give such offerings that it will be impossible for the king to say that this or that is lacking in our offerings So on the following day they prepared offerings and looking to see what might be lackingNever mind take this penny and give me the honeythey observed that there was plenty of honey in cooked form but no fresh honeyI suppose he has a great many pennies I had best raise the priceSo he replied I will not give it to you for that Well then take twopenceI will not give it to you for so little as twopenceThe countryman continued to raise the price until finally the man offered him a thousand pieces of money whereupon he let him have the honeyWhat is it masterWhen the man returned and related the incident to the citizens the citizens impressed with the firm faith of the giver assented saying Good goodlet him receive the merit of the offering So the citizens provided seats for the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha gave them broth and hard food and then had a great silver vessel brought and strained the honeycomband the power of a Buddha is inconceivableThey replied We will give neither battle nor the kingdom So saying they went forth from the lesser gates procured firewood water and so forth and did all that was necessary to maintain a defensebecause he gave the fresh honey in alms he reached the pinnacle of gainWhosoever in this world has escaped from the bonds of good and of evilWhosoever is free from sorrow free from defilement free from impurity him I call a BrahmanThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain womanWe are told that a certain monk who lived by his almsbowl got a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher and retired to a dilapidated pleasure garden for the purpose of meditationNow a certain courtezan made an assignation with a man saying I will go to such and such a place and you meet me there The woman kept the assignation but the man did notFor some time she watched in vain the path by which she expected him to come Finally disappointed at his failure to keep his assignation she strolled hither and thither and went into the pleasure garden There she saw the monk sitting crosslegged Looking this way and that and seeing no one else about she said to herself Here is a man I will throw his thoughts into confusion So standing in front of the monk she took down her undergarment several times and put it on again unloosened her hair and bound it up again and clapped her hands and laughedThe Elder became excited his whole body in fact was suffused with excitementWhat does this mean  thought heThe Teacher considered within himself A monk obtained a Subject of Meditation from me and went forth to perform his meditations How is he getting on  Seeing that woman and observing her evil conduct and perceiving that her evil conduct was upsetting the Elder still remaining seated in his Perfumed Chamber he spoke as follows Monks there is no delight where those abide who seek after their lustsBut where those abide who are free from passion that place is full of delightSo saying he sent forth a radiant image of himself and instructing the Elder in the Law pronounced the following StanzaDelightful are the woods where the man of the world finds no delightThere they that are free from passion find delight not they that seek after their lustsAt the conclusion of the Stanza that Elder seated as he was attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Facultiesin the case of formationsin the case of consciousnessTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in the Eastern Park in the Palace of Migaras MotherThen Sakka ruler of gods went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to himHere ruler of gods a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth adhering toWhen a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth adhering tohe directly knows everything having directly known everything he fully understands everything having fully understood everything whatever feeling he feels whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfuinorpleasant he abides contemplating impermanence in those feelings contemplating fading away contemplating cessation contemplating relinquishmentContemplating thus he does not cling to anything in the world When he does not cling he is not agitatedWhen he is not agitated he personally attains Nibbana He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingBriefly it is in this way ruler of gods that a bhikkhu is liberated by the destruction of craving one who has reached the ultimate end the ultimate security from bondage the ultimate holy life the ultimate goal one who is foremost among gods and humansThen Sakka ruler of gods delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed Ones words paid homage to the Blessed One and keeping him on his right he vanished at onceNow on that occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana was sitting not far from the Blessed OneThen he considered Did that spirit penetrate to the meaning of the Blessed Ones words when he rejoiced or did he not Suppose I found out whether he did or notThen just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm the venerable Maha Moggallana vanished from the Palace of Migaras Mother in the Eastern Park and appeared among the gods of the ThirtythreeNow on that occasion Sakka ruler of gods was furnished and endowed a hundredfold with the five kinds of heavenly music and he was enjoying it in the Pleasure Park of the Single Lotushe dismissed the music went to the venerable Maha Moggallana and said to him Come good sir Moggallana Welcome good sir MoggallanaIt is long good sir Moggallana since you found an opportunity to come hereSit down good sir Moggallana this seat is readyThe venerable Maha Moggallana sat down on the seat made readyThe venerable Maha Moggallana then asked him  Kosiya how did the Blessed One state to you in brief deliverance through the destruction of cravingIt would be good if we might also get to hear that statementGood sir Moggallana we are so busy we have so much to do not only with our own business but also with the business of the gods of the ThirtythreeBesides good sir Moggallana what is well heard well learned well attended to well remembered does not vanish all of a suddenGood sir Moggallana it once happened that war broke out between the gods and the titansIn that war the gods won and the titans were defeatedWhen I had won that war and returned from it as a conqueror I had the Vejayanta Palace builtGood sir Moggallana the Vejayanta Palace has a hundred towersWould you like to see the loveliness of the Vejayanta Palace good sir MoggallanaThe venerable Maha Moggallana consented in silenceThen Sakka ruler of gods and the divine King Vessavana went to the Vejayanta Palace giving precedence to the venerable Maha MoggallanaWhen the maids of Sakka saw the venerable Maha Moggallana coming in the distance they were embarrassed and ashamed and they went each into their own roomsThen Sakka ruler of gods and the divine King Vessavana had the venerable Maha Moggallana walk all over and explore the Vejayanta Palace See good sir Moggallana this loveliness of the Vejayanta Palace See good sir Moggallana this loveliness of the Vejayanta PalaceIt does the venerable Kosiya credit as one who has formerly made meritIt does the venerable Kosiya credit as one who has formerly made meritThen the venerable Maha Moggallana considered thus This spirit is living much too negligentlyWhat if I stirred up a sense of urgency in himThen the venerable Maha Moggallana performed such a feat of supernormal power that with the point of his toe he made the Vejayanta Palace shake and quake and trembleSakka and the divine King Vessavana and the gods of the Thirtythree were filled with wonder and amazement and they said Sirs it is wonderful it is marvellous what power and might the recluse has that with the point of his toe he makes the heavenly region shake and quake and trembleWhen the venerable Maha Moggallana knew that Sakka ruler of the gods was stirred to a sense of urgency with his hair standing on end he asked him Kosiya how did the Blessed One state to you in brief deliverance through the destruction of cravingIt would be good if we might also get to hear that statementGood sir Moggallana I went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him I stood at one side and said Venerable siras in of gods and humansThat is how the Blessed One stated to me in brief deliverance through the destruction of craving good sir MoggallanaThen the venerable Maha Moggallana delighted and rejoiced in the words of Sakka ruler of gods Then just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm he vanished from among the gods of the Thirtythree and appeared in the Eastern Park in the Palace of Migaras MotherThen soon after the venerable Maha Moggallana had gone the attendants of Sakka ruler of gods asked him Good sir was that your teacher the Blessed One No good sirs that was not my teacher the Blessed OneThat was one of my companions in the holy life the venerable Maha MoggallanaGood sir it is a gain for you that your companion in the holy life has such power and mightOh how much more so that the Blessed One is your teacherand asked him Venerable sir does the Blessed One recall stating in brief  to a certain one of the renowned spirits with a great following  deliverance through the destruction of cravingI do recall doing so Moggallana Here Sakka ruler of gods came to me and after paying homage to me he stood at one sideand asked Venerable sir how in brief is a bhikkhu liberated by the destruction of craving one who has reached the ultimate end the ultimate security from bondage the ultimate holy life the ultimate goal one who is foremost among gods and humansWhen this was said I told him Here ruler of gods a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth adhering toWhen a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth adhering to he directly knows everythinghaving directly known everything he fully understands everything having fully understood everything whatever feeling he feels whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainful norpleasantBriefly it is in this way ruler of gods that a bhikkhu is liberated by the destruction of cravingone who is foremost among gods and humansThat is how I recall stating in brief to Sakka ruler of gods deliverance through the destruction of cravingThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Maha Moggallana was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordshe stood at one side and asked Venerable sir how in brief is a bhikkhu liberated by the destruction of craving one who has reached fee ultimate end the ultimate security from bondage the ultimate holy life the ultimate goal one who is foremost among gods and humansNow the teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Three is what in the same manner as beforeResponding to the number  three  stated as the neuter  tini  the Elder replied Three kinds of feeling showing the numeral  in the feminine gender appropriate to the meaning to be given in the answerOr alternatively it can be understood here in the sense that he spoke thus showing that  I apply to the word  three  the meaning expressed by the Blessed One with the words  Three kinds of feeling  for the way of teaching has numerous facets in the case of those who have reached expertness in teaching by means of the classes of discriminationsSome however have said that tini is a supernumerary wordAnd the phrase  three kinds of feeling  is stated here in the way already explained  not because of the absence of other threesaccording as it is said Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards three ideas he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowSo it was with reference to this that it was said earlier three questions three indications three answers  And here And he does so through following the way indicated in the passage  Whatever is felt all comes under suffering   Whoever pleasure saw as pain  Saw pain as though it were a dartor by following the way of the three fold classification of intrinsic suffering suffering suffering in determinations  as stated in the following passage  he comes to dispassion only through the Gateway to Liberation consisting in Contemplation of Suffering  abandoning perception of pleasure through seeing all these kinds of feelings as a state of suffering And so he eventually makes an end of suffering and reaches purity in the ultimate senseWhat threeThe three kinds of feelingwhen a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards these three ideas he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowand Sakka took a low seat and sat down at one sideWhen he saw the venerable Maha Moggallana coming in the distanceand each tower has seven hundred upper chambersand each upper chamber has seven nymphsand each nymph has seven maidsJust as a daughterinlaw is embarrassed and ashamed on seeing her fatherinlaw so too when the maids of Sakka saw the venerable Maha Moggallana coming they were embarrassed and ashamed and they went each into their own roomsHe then dispassion finds in suffering  This path it is that leads to purification   And painful too are all determinations  And so when he sees thus with understanding according as it is said Saw peaceful neitherpainnorpleasure  Ever to be impermanent  So the teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Four is what in the same manner as beforeNow in the matter of answering this question in some instances the four nutriments are meant in the way already stated  Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards four ideas he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowWhat fourThe four nutrimentsSo it was with reference to this that it was said earlier four questions four indications four answers  but in other instances the four foundations of mindfulness are meant which when a man maintains them in being in his cognizance he makes an end of suffering Friends when a bhikkhu completely maintains four ideas in being in his cognizance sees completely the ending of them then he is one who after attaining rightness makes an end of suffering here and nowWhat fourThe four foundations of mindfulness So it was with reference to this that it was said by the Blessed One Four questions four indications four answers However in responding to the number  four  the Elder replied Noble Truths  either because what was meant here was these four Noble TruthsHerein four is the delimitation by numberNoble Truths ariyasaccaniariyani saccani  the meaning is that they are not unreal not deceptiveaccording as it is said Bhikkhus these four Noble Truths are real not unreal not otherwise than they seem that is why they are called Noble Truths  Or alternatively since Buddhas Pacceka Buddhas and Buddhas disciples are reckoned as the Noble Ones  and it is they that penetrate them for that they should be honoured  by the world with its godstreated as reliable  is what is meant or since they cause posturing in the way regarded as the field for effort or since they cause nonposturing in what is not the way  or since they cause devotion to the thirty seven noble ideas that are on the side of enlightenment they are thus called  Noble Truths  according as it is said Bhikkhus there are these four Noble Truths the Noble Truth of suffering the Noble Truth of the origin of suffering the Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering and the Noble Truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering There are these four Noble Truths Noble Ones penetrate them that is why they are called  Noble Truths   And furthermore they are Noble Truths since they are the Blessed Ones truths Bhikkhus in the world with its godsthe Perfect One is the Noble One That is why they are called  Noble Truths   Or alternatively they are Noble Truths also owing to the establishment of nobleness by the discovery of themThis is their wordmeaningNow it is with the discovery and penetration of these Noble Truths that the severance of craving for being comes about Bhikkhus when this Noble Truth of suffering is discovered and penetrated when this Noble Truth of the arising when this Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering When this Noble Truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering is discovered and penetrated then craving for being is severed what leads to being is exhausted now there is no more renewal of being  according as it is saidwhen a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards these four ideas  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowaccording as the bhikkhuni Kajangala saidwhen a bhikkhu completely maintains these four ideas in being in his cognizance  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowwith whose discovery and penetration there comes to be severance of craving for being  or else because it is only completely answered  when answered in this wayand whenever human beings see anything lovely they say Sirs it does credit to the gods of the Thirtythreeaccording as it is saidaccording as it is said Bhikkhus it is owing to the discovery of four Noble Truths as they actually are that a Perfect One is called Accomplished and fully enlightened  according as it is said When this was said good sir Moggallana the Blessed One told me Here ruler of gods  as in So the teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Five is what in the same manner as beforeResponding to the number  five  the Elder replied Five categories of what is affected by clingingHerein five is the delimitation by numberCategories of what is affected by clinging are categories begotten by clinging or categories that are begetters of clingingThis is a term for what is described as follows  Any kind of form  feeling perception determinations consciousness what ever that is affected by taints and productive of clinging  And five categories of what is affected by clinging  is stated here in the way already given  not because of the absence of other fivesaccording as it is said Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards five ideas  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowSo it was with reference to this that it was said earlier Five questions five indications five answers  And here one who comprehends  the five categories by way of their rise and subsidence eventually realizes the Deathless by extinction owing to his obtainment of the Deathless by insightwhen a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards these five ideas  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowThe five categories of what is affected by clingingWhat fiveaccording as it is said He comprehends the categories  Rise and then their subsidence There finding happiness and gladness  Because he knows that to be deathless So the teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Six is what in the same manner as beforeResponding to the number  six  the Elder replied Six bases in oneselfHerein six is the delimitation by number They are connected in what has to do with oneself and occur in subordination to self  thus they are inoneself They are bases because of actuating  because of being the range of the origin  and because of leading on the actuated suffering of the round of rebirths This is a designation for eye ear nose tongue body and mindAnd  six bases in oneself  is stated here in the way already given  not because of the absence of other sixesaccording as it is saidWhat sixThe six bases in oneselfSo it was with reference to this that it w as said earlier six questions six indications six answers  And one who comes to dispassion by seeing them as void because of the words   Void village  bhikkhus is a designation for the six bases in oneself  and by seeing them as empty and deceptive because of their being as unlasting as bubbles mirages etc eventually makes an end of suffering and passes beyond the vision of King Mortality Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards six ideas  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowwhen a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards these six ideas  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowaccording as it is said And he that looks upon the world  Regarding it as but a bubble Regarding it as but a mirage  Is out of sight of Death the King  Then the venerable Maha Moggallana went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideSo the teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Seven is whatNow although the seven Standpoints of Consciousness  are stated in the Principal Discourse on the Questions and Answers  nevertheless the Elder replied Seven Enlightenment factors showing those ideas in virtue of which a bhikkhu makes an and of suffering by maintaining them in being in his cognizanceAnd this meaning was confirmed by the Blessed One too The bhikkhuni Kajangala is wise householders the bhikkhuni Kajangala has great understanding Had you asked me the meaning of this I should have given you the same answer as thr bhikkhuni Kajangala has done it having been answered here by her as followsWhat sevenThe seven enlightenment factorsSo it was with reference to this what it was said by the Blessed One Seven questions seven indications seven answers That is how this meaning should be understood to have been confirmed by the Blessed OneHerein seven is the delimitation by number denying either less or moreEnlightenment factors is a designation for the ideas beginning with mindfulnessHere is the wordmeaning Either it can be taken thus By means of the harmony of the seven ideas known as mindfulness investigationofideas energy happiness tranquillity concentration and onlookingequammity which are opposed to the several pitfalls consisting in indolence agitation stagnation and struggle  devotion to sensual pleasures and to selfmortification insistence on annihilationism and etemalism and arise at the moment of the mundane and supramundane path  a Noble Disciple is enlightened  thus it is enlightenment what is meant is that he emerges from the sleep of the continuity of defilement or that he penetrates the four Noble Truths or that he realizes extinctionaccording as it is said  He has discovered the supreme complete enlightenment by maintaining the seven enlightenment factors in being  Or else it can be taken thus By means of the harmony of ideas of the kind already stated he is enlightened  thus the Noble Disciple is enlightenment alsoSo they are enlightenment factors because they are factors of that harmony of ideas known as  enlightenment   being in that way analogous to the jhana factors and path factors or else they are enlightenment factors also because they are factors of a Noble Disciple who is given the term of common usage  enlightenment being in that way analogous to army factors chariot factors and so onFurthermore Enlightenment factors in what sense enlightenment factorsThey conduce to enlightenment thus they are enlightenment factors they are kept enlightened they are left enlightened thus they are enlightenment factors  the enlightenmentfactor meaning of  enlightenment factor  can be understood in the way stated in the Patisambhidamagga So by maintaining these seven enlightenment factors in being and developing them he soon obtains the special quality of entire dispassion in virtue of which he is called  one who makes an end of suffering here and now And this is said by the Blessed Oneaccording as it is saidFriends when a bhikkhu completely maintains seven ideas in being in his cognizance he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowwhen a bhikkhu completely maintains these seven ideas in being in his cognizance he is one who makes an end of suffering here and how Bhikkhus these seven enlightenment factors maintained in being and developed conduce to entire dispassion to fading of lust to peace to directknowledge to full enlightenment to extinction So the teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Eight is whatNow although the eight worldly ideas namely gain fame censure pleasure and their opposites are stated in the Principal Discourse on the Questions and Answers  nevertheless the Elder replied The Noble Eightfold Path  showing those ideas in virtue of which a bhikkhu makes an end of suffering by maintaining them in being in his cognizance But since there is no path apart from the eight factors the mere eight factors being themselves the path consequently with expertness in teaching he established that meaning when he answered as he did instead of saying  the eight noble pathfactors And this meaning and this method of teaching has been confirmed by the Blessed One The bhikkhuni Kajangala is wise householders Had you asked me the meaning of this I should have given you the same answer as the bhikkhuni Kajangala has done  it having been answered by her as followsSo it was with reference to this that it was said by the Blessed One Eight questions eight indications eight answers  That is how this meaning should be understood to have been confirmed by the Blessed OneHerein noble  means  to be relied on  by those seeking extinction   Furthermore  noble  can be understood as c occurrence remote from defilements   as  reason for nobleness  and as  obtainment of the noble fruitionsIt has eight factors thus it is  eightfold  Extinction is traced by it or it itself is traced or it goes killing defilements thus it is the path A bhikkhu who maintains in being this eightfactored path classed thus as eightfold lances ignorance produces true knowledge and realizes extinction and hence he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowAnd this is saidBecause the awn was rightly disposed so too bhikkhus with rightly disposed view with rightly disposed maintenance of the path in being it is possible that a bhikkhu will lance ignorance produce true knowledge and realize extinction  according as it is said Friends when a bhikkhu completely maintains eight ideas in being in his cognizance  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and now What eight The Noble Eightfold Path when a bhikkhu completely maintains these eight ideas in being in his cognizance he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowhe abides contemplating impermanence in those feelings contemplating fading away contemplating cessation contemplating relinquishmentContemplating thus he does not cling to anything in the worldWhen he does not cling he is not agitatedWhen he is not agitated he personally attains Nibbana He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingand it must be understood as simply the factors themselves because it has no individual essence  apprehend able by any attempt at analysing it out apart from its factors as is likewise the case with the  fourfactored army  or the  five factored music Bhikkhus just as if a rightly disposed riceawn or wheatawn is pressed upon by the hand or the foot it is possible that the hand or foot will be lanced and blood will be producedWhy is thatSo the teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Nine is whatResponding to the number  nine  the Eider replied Nine abodes of creaturesHerein nine is the delimitation by numberCreatures  this means either the breathing things described derivatively upon categories bound up with the lifefaculty or else the descriptionCreatures abide in these thus they are abodes Abodes of creatures sattdvdsdsattanam avasa That is the usual line of the teaching But in meaning this is also a designation of the nine sorts of creaturesaccording as it is saidThere are creatures with difference in body and unity in perception namely the gods of The High Divinity Body who are first to be reborn as such  this is the second abode of creaturesThere are creatures with unity in body and difference in perception namely the Abhassara Gods this is the third abode of creaturesThere are creatures without perception experiencing no feeling namely the Gods who are Nonpercipient Creatures this is the fifth abode of creaturesThere are creatures who with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistence with not giving attention to perceptions of difference aware that  Space is infinite  have passed on to rebirth in the base consisting of infiniteness of space this is the sixth abode of creaturesThere are creatures who by completely surmounting the base consisting of infiniteness of space aware that  consciousness is infinite  have passed on to rebirth in the base consisting of infiniteness of consciousness this is the seventh abode of creaturesThere are creatures who by completely surmounting the base consisting of infiniteness of consciousness aware that  There is nothing at all  have passed on to rebirth in the base consisting of nothingness this is the eighth abode of creaturesThere are creatures who by completely surmounting the base consisting of nothingness have passed on to rebirth in the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception this is the ninth abode of creatures  And the phrase  nine abodes of creatures  is stated here in the way already given  not because of the absence of other ninesWhat nineThe nine abodes of creaturesSo it was with reference to this that it was said earlier nine questions nine indications nine answers  Now because of the words  Nine ideas are to be fully knownWhat nineThe nine abodes of creatures   he comes to dispassion towards the nine abodes of creatures by seeing them only as a bare compound of determinations abandoning seeing  in them any everlasting pleasant beautiful or selfstate through the means firstly of FullKnowledge as What is Known  Then he causes his lust to fade out by contemplating impermanence in them becomes liberated by contemplating suffering in them and sees completely to the end of them by contemplating notself in them doing all three secondly through the means of Full Knowledge as Judgment Then he makes an end of suffering here and now by attaining rightness  doing so lastly through the means of FullKnowledge as Abandoning of wrongnessThat is why it was saidWhat nineThe nine abodes of creatures   Friends there are creatures with difference in body and difference in perception namely human beings some gods and some denizens of the states of deprivation this is the first abode of creaturesThere are creatures with unity of body and unity of perception namely the Subhakinna Gods this is the fourth abode of creaturesaccording as it is said Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards nine ideas he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowwhen a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards these nine ideas he is one who makes an end of suffering here and now Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards nine ideas  he is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowSo the teacher being satisfied with the answer to his question asked the further question Ten is whatIn the Answers to Questions other than this the Ten Unprofitable Courses of Action  are givenaccording as it is saidWhat tenThe ten unprofitable courses of actionSo it was with reference to this that it was said earlier ten questions ten indications ten answers  But although that is so nevertheless here the venerable one using the teaching in terms of a person replied He who is endowed with ten factors is declared an Arahant showing the attainment of those ten factors in virtue of possessing which an Arahant is so called He did so either because he wanted to declare final knowledge without citing himself or else because the question is well answered when answered in this way too Adept adept  is said venerable sir How does a bhikkhu come to be called an adept Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu is endowed with the adepts right view the adepts right intention the adepts right speech the adepts right action the adepts right livelihood the adepts right effort the adepts right mindfulness the adepts right concentration the adepts right knowledge and the adepts right deliverancethat is how a bhikkhu comes to be called an adept  should be understood according as they are stated in such discourses as that which follows in the Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning the Commentary on the Minor Books Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards ten ideashe is one who makes an end of suffering here and nowwhen a bhikkhu becomes completely dispassionate towards these ten ideas he makes an end of suffering here and nowNow these ten The explanation of the Boys Questions is endedTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named Sati son of a fisherman thus As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths not anotherThen those bhikkhus desiring to detach him from that pernicious view pressed and questioned and crossquestioned him thus Friend Sati do not say so Do not misrepresent the Blessed One it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One The Blessed One would not speak thusFor in many discourses the Blessed One has stated consciousness to be dependency arisen since without a condition there is no origination of consciousnessYet although pressed and questioned and crossquestioned by those bhikkhus in this way the bhikkhu Sati son of a fisherman still obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist upon itSince the bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious view they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one sideThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus Come bhikkhu tell the bhikkhu Sati son of a fisherman in my name that the Teacher calls him Yes venerable sir he replied and he went to the bhikkhu Sati and told him The Teacher calls you friend SatiYes friend he replied and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one sideThe Blessed One then asked him Sati is it true that the following pernicious view has arisen in you As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths not anotherExactly so venerable sir As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths not anotherWhat is that consciousness SatiVenerable sir it is that which speaks and feels and experiences here and there the result of good and bad actionsMisguided man to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that wayMisguided man in many discourses have I not stated consciousness to be dependency arisen since without a condition there is no origination of consciousnessBut you misguided man have misrepresented us by your wrong grasp and injured yourselfand stored up much demeritThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus what do you think Has this bhikkhu Sati son of a fisherman kindled even a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and DisciplineHow could he venerable sirNo venerable sirWhen this was said the bhikkhu Sati son of a fisherman sat silent dismayed with shoulders drooping and head down glum and without responseThen knowing this the Blessed One told him Misguided man you will be recognised by your own pernicious viewI shall question the bhikkhus on this matterThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this bhikkhu Sati son of a fisherman does when he misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demeritNo venerable sirFor in many discourses the Blessed One has stated consciousness to be dependently arisen since without a condition there is no origination of consciousnessGood bhikkhusIt is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me thusFor in many discourses I have stated consciousness to be dependently arisen since without a condition there is no origination of consciousnessBut this bhikkhu Sati son of a fisherman misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit  Bhikkhus consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon which it arisesWhen consciousness arises dependent on the eye and forms it is reckoned as eyeconsciousness when consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds it is reckoned as earconsciousness when consciousness arises dependent on the nose and odours it is reckoned as noseconsciousness when consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and flavours it is reckoned as tongueconsciousness when consciousness arises dependent on the body and tangibles it is reckoned as bodyconsciousness when consciousness arises dependent on the mind and mindobjects it is reckoned as mindconsciousnessJust as fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it burns Bhikkhus do you see This has come to be Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus do you see Its origination occurs with that as nutriment Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus do you see With the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is subject to cessation Yes venerable sirBhikkhus does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus Has this come to be or not Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus Does its origination occur with that as nutriment or not Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus With the cessation of that nutriment is what has come to be subject to cessation or not Yes venerable sirBhikkhus is doubt abandoned in one who sees as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This has come to be Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus is doubt abandoned in one who sees as it actually is with proper wisdom thus Its origination occurs with that as nutriment Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus is doubt abandoned in one who sees as it actually is with proper wisdom thus With the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is subject to cessation Yes venerable sirBhikkhus are you free from doubt here This has come to be Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus are you free from doubt here Its origination occurs with that as nutriment Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus are you free from doubt here With the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is subject to cessation Yes venerable sirBhikkhus has it been seen well by you as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This has come to be Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus has it been seen well by you as it actually is with proper wisdom thus Its origination occurs with that as nutriment Yes venerable sir Bhikkhus has it been seen well by you as it actually is with proper wisdom thus With the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is subject to cessation Yes venerable sirBhikkhus purified and bright as this view is if you adhere to it cherish it treasure it and treat it as a possession would you then understand the Dhamma that has been taught as similar to a raft being for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of grasping No venerable sir Bhikkhus purified and bright as this view is if you do not adhere to it cherish it treasure it and treat it as a possession would you then understand the Dhamma that has been taught as similar to a raft being for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of grasping Yes venerable sir  Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that already have come to be and for the support of those seeking a new existenceWhat fourThey are physical food as nutriment gross or subtle contact as the second mental volition as the third and consciousness as the fourthThese four kinds of nutriment have craving as their source craving as their origin they are born and produced from cravingAnd this craving has what as its sourceCraving has feeling as its sourceFeeling has contact as its sourceContact has the sixfold base as its sourceThe sixfold base has mentalitymateriality as its sourceMentalitymateriality has consciousness as its sourceConsciousness has formations as its sourceFormations have ignorance as their source ignorance as their origin they are born and produced from ignorance  So bhikkhus with ignorance as condition formations come to be with formations as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality with mentalitymateriality as condition the sixfold base with the sixfold base as condition contact with contact as condition feeling with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition being with being as condition birth with birth as condition ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to be  With birth as condition ageing and death so it was said Now bhikkhus do ageing and death have birth as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseAgeing and death have birth as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With birth as condition ageing and deathWith being as condition birth so it was said Now bhikkhus does birth have being as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseBirth has being as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With being as condition birthWith clinging as condition being so it was said Now bhikkhus does being have clinging as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseBeing has clinging as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With clinging as condition beingWith craving as condition clinging so it was said Now bhikkhus does clinging have craving as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseClinging has craving as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With craving as condition clingingWith feeling as condition craving so it was said Now bhikkhus does craving have feeling as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseCraving has feeling as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With feeling as condition cravingWith contact as condition feeling so it was said Now bhikkhus does feeling have contact as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseFeeling has contact as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With contact as condition feelingWith the sixfold base as condition contact so it was said Now bhikkhus does contact have the sixfold base as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseContact has the sixfold base as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With the sixfold base as condition contactWith mentalitymateriality as condition the sixfold base so it was said Now bhikkhus does the sixfold base have mentality materiality as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseThe sixfold base has mentalitymateriality as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With mentalitymateriality as condition the sixfold baseWith consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality so it was said Now bhikkhus does mentalitymateriality have consciousness as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseMentalitymateriality has consciousness as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With consciousness as condition mentalitymaterialityWith formations as condition consciousness so it was said Now bhikkhus does consciousness have formations as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseConsciousness has formations as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With formations as condition consciousnessWith ignorance as condition formations so it was said Now bhikkhus do formations have ignorance as condition or not or how do you take it in this caseFormations have ignorance as condition venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With formations as condition ignorance  Good bhikkhusSo you say thus and I also say thus When this exists that comes to be with the arising of this that arises That is with ignorance as condition formations come to be with formations as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality with mentalitymateriality as condition the sixfold base with the sixfold base as condition contact with contact as condition feeling with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clingingwith clinging as condition being with being as condition birth with birth as condition ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to beSuch is the origin of this whole mass of suffering  But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of formations with the cessation of formations cessation of consciousness with the cessation of consciousness cessation of mentalitymateriality with the cessation of mentalitymateriality cessation of the sixfold base with the cessation of the sixfold base cessation of contact with the cessation of contact cessation of feeling with the cessation of feeling cessation of craving with the cessation of craving cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of being with the cessation of being cessation of birth with the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering  With the cessation of birth cessation of ageing and death so it was said Now bhikkhus do ageing and death cease with the cessation of birth or not or how do you take it in this caseAgeing and death cease with the cessation of birth venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With the cessation of birth cessation of ageing and deathWith the cessation of being cessation of birthFormations cease with the cessation of ignorance venerable sir Thus we take it in this case With the cessation of ignorance cessation of formations  Good bhikkhusSo you say thus and I also say thus When this does not exist that does not come to be with the cessation of this that ceases That is with the cessation of ignorance comes cessation of formations with the cessation of formations cessation of consciousness with the cessation of consciousness cessation of mentalitymateriality with the cessation of mentalitymateriality cessation of the sixfold base with the cessation of the sixfold base cessation of contact with the cessation of contact cessation of feeling with the cessation of feeling cessation of craving with the cessation of craving cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of being with the cessation of being cessation of birth with the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering  Bhikkhus knowing and seeing in this way would you run back to the past thus Were we in the past Were we not in the past What were we in the past How were we in the past Having been what what did we become in the past No venerable sir Knowing and seeing in this way would you run forward to the future thus Shall we be in the future Shall we not be in the future What shall we be in the future How shall we be in the future Having been what what shall we become in the future No venerable sir Knowing and seeing in this way would you now be inwardly perplexed about the present thus Am I Am I not What am I How am I Where has this being come from Where will it goNo venerable sirBhikkhus knowing and seeing in this way would you speak thus The Teacher is respected by us We speak as we do out of respect for the Teacher No venerable sirKnowing and seeing in this way would you speak thus The Recluse says this and so do other recluses but we do not speak thus No venerable sir Knowing and seeing in this way would you acknowledge another teacher No venerable sir Knowing and seeing in this way would you return to the observances tumultuous debates and auspicious signs of ordinary recluses and brahmins taking them as the core of the holy life No venerable sir Do you speak only of what you have known seen and understood for yourselves Yes venerable sirGood bhikkhus So you have been guided by me with this Dhamma which is visible here and now immediately effective inviting inspection onward leading to be experienced by the wise for themselvesFor it was with reference to this that it has been said Bhikkhus this Dhamma is visible here and now immediately effective inviting inspection onward leading to be experienced by the wise for themselves  Bhikkhus the conception of an embryo in a womb takes place through the union of three thingsHere there is the union of the mother and father and it is the mothers season but the being to be reborn is not present  in this case too there is no conception of an embryo in a wombBut when there is the union of the mother and father and it is the mothers season and the being to be reborn is present through the union of these three things the conception of an embryo in a womb takes placeThe mother then carries the embryo in her womb for nine or ten months with much anxiety as a heavy burdenThen at the end of nine or ten months the mother gives birth with much anxiety as a heavy burdenThen when the child is born she nourishes it with her own bloodWhen he grows up and his faculties mature the child plays at such games as toy ploughs tipcat somersaults toy windmills toy measures toy cars and a toy bow and arrowWhen he grows up and his faculties mature still further the youth enjoys himself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure with forms cognizable by the eye sounds cognizable by the earodours cognizable by the nose flavours cognizable by the tonguetangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust  On seeing a form with the eye he lusts after it if it is pleasing he dislikes it if it is unpleasingHe abides with mindfulness of the body unestablished with a limited mind and he does not understand as it actually is the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainderEngaged as he is in favouring and opposing whatever feeling he feels  whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnor pleasant  he delights in that feeling welcomes it and remains holding to itAs he does so delight arises in him Now delight in feelings is clingingWith his clinging as condition being comes to be with being as condition birth with birth as condition ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to beSuch is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingOn hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongueOn touching a tangible with the bodyOn cognizing a mindobject with the mind he lusts after it if it is pleasing he dislikes it if it is unpleasingNow delight in feelings is clinging With his clinging as condition being comes to be with being as condition birth with birth as condition ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to beSuch is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingwent to the bhikkhu Sati and asked him Friend Sati is it true that such a pernicious view has arisen in youExactly so friends As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths not anotherWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberatedTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the venerable Ananda was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary not long after the Blessed One had attained to final NibbanaSuppose I went to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana at his workplaceSo the venerable Ananda went to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana at his workplaceThe brahmin Gopaka Moggallana saw the venerable Ananda coming in the distanceand said to him Let Master Ananda comeIt is long since Master Ananda found an opportunity to come hereLet Master Ananda be seated this seat is readyThe venerable Ananda sat down on the seat made readyThe brahmin Gopaka Moggallana took a low seat sat down at one sideThere is no single bhikkhu brahmin who possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were possessed by the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedFor the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path the producer of the unproduced path the declarer of the undeclared path he was the knower of the path the finder of the path the one skilled in the path But his disciples now abide following that path and become possessed of it afterwardsBut this discussion between the venerable Ananda and the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana was interruptedfor then the brahmin Vassakara the minister of Magadha while supervising the work at Rajagaha went to the venerable Ananda at the workplace of the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana He exchanged greetings with the venerable Anandaand asked the venerable Ananda For what discussion are you sitting together here now Master Ananda And what was your discussion that was interruptedBrahmin the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana asked me Master Ananda is there any single bhikkhu who possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were possessed by Master Gotama accomplished and fully enlightenedI replied to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana There is no single bhikkhu brahmin who possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were possessed by the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedFor the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path But his disciples now abide following that path and become possessed of it afterwardsThis was our discussion that was interruptedIs there Master Ananda any single bhikkhu who was appointed by Master Gotama thus He will be your refuge when I am gone and whom you now have recourse toThere is no single bhikkhu brahmin who was appointed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened thus He will be your refuge when I am gone and whom we now have recourse toBut is there Master Ananda any single bhikkhu who has been chosen by the Sangha and appointed by a number of elder bhikkhus thus He will be our refuge after the Blessed One has gone and whom you now have recourse toThere is no single bhikkhu brahmin who has been chosen by the Sangha and appointed by a number of elder bhikkhus thus He will be our refuge after the Blessed One has gone and whom we now have recourse toBut if you have no refuge Master Ananda what is the cause for your concordWe are not without a refuge brahmin We have a refuge we have the Dhamma as our refugeBut when you were asked Is there Master Ananda any single bhikkhu who was appointed by Master Gotama thus He will be your refuge when I am gone and whom you now have recourse to  you answered There is no such single bhikkhu whom we now have recourse to When you were asked Is there Master Ananda any single bhikkhu who has been chosen by the Sangha and appointed by a number of elder bhikkhus thus He will be our refuge after the Blessed One has gone and whom you now have recourse to  you answered There is no such single bhikkhu whom we now have recourse to When you were asked But if you have no refuge Master Ananda what is the cause for your concord  you answered We are not without a refuge brahmin We have a refuge we have the Dhamma as our refugeNow how should the meaning of these statements be regarded Master AnandaBrahmin the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened has prescribed the course of training for bhikkhus and he has laid down the PatimokkhaOn the Uposatha day as many of us as live in dependence upon a single village district meet together in unison and when we meet we ask one who knows the Patimokkha to recite itIf a bhikkhu remembers an offence or a transgression while the Patimokkha is being recited we deal with him according to the Dhamma in the way we have been instructedIt is not the worthy ones who deal with us it is the Dhamma that deals with usIs there Master Ananda any single bhikkhu whom you now honour respect revere and venerate and on whom you live in dependence honouring and respecting himThere is a single bhikkhu brahmin whom we now honour respect revere and venerate and on whom we live in dependence honouring and respecting himBut when you were asked Is there Master Ananda any single bhikkhu who was appointed by Master Gotama  you answered There is no such single bhikkhu When you were asked Is there Master Ananda any single bhikkhu who has been chosen by the Sangha  you answered There is no such single bhikkhu When you were asked Is there Master Ananda any single bhikkhu whom you honour respect revere and venerate and on whom you live in dependence honouring and respecting him  you answered There is such a single bhikkhu whom we now honourand on whom we live in dependence honouring and respecting himNow how should the meaning of these statements be regarded Master AnandaThere are brahmin ten qualities inspiring confidence that have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedWhen these qualities are found in anyone among us we honour respect revere and venerate him and live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himWhat are the tenHere brahmin a bhikkhu is virtuous he dwells restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha he is perfect in conduct and resort and seeing fear in the slightest faults he trains himself by undertaking the framing preceptsHe has learned much remembers what he has learned and consolidates what he has learnedSuch teachings as are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and which affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure  such teachings as these he has learned much of remembered mastered verbally investigated with the mind and penetrated well by viewHe is content with his robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisitesHe obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and nowHe wields the various kinds of supernormal power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears and vanishes he goes unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged he travels in space like a bird with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty he wields bodily mastery even as far as the BrahmaworldWith the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human he hears both kinds of sounds the divine and the human those that are far as well as nearHe understands the minds of other beings of other persons having encompassed them with his own mindHe understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberatedHe recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsWith the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actionsBy realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsThese brahmin are the ten qualities inspiring confidence that have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedWhen these qualities are found in anyone among us we honour respect revere and venerate him and live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himWhen this was said the brahmin Vassakara the minister of Magadha said to General Upananda What do you think general When these worthy ones honour one who should be honoured respect one who should be respected revere one who should be revered and venerate one who should be veneratedFor if these worthy ones did not honour respect revere and venerate such a person then whom could they honour respect revere and venerate and on whom could they live in dependence honouring and respectingThen the brahmin Vassakara the minister of Magadha said to the venerable Ananda Where is Master Ananda living nowNow I am living in the Bamboo Grove brahminI hope Master Ananda that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant quiet and undisturbed by voices with an atmosphere of seclusion remote from people favourable for retreatIndeed brahmin that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant favourable for retreat is because of such guardian protectors as yourselfIndeed Master Ananda that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant favour able for retreat is because of the worthy ones who are meditators and cultivate meditationThe worthy ones are meditators and cultivate meditationOn one occasion Master Ananda Master Gotama was living at Vesali in the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great WoodThen I went there and approached Master GotamaMaster Gotama was a meditator and cultivated meditationThe Blessed One brahmin did not praise every type of meditation nor did he condemn every type of meditationWhat kind of meditation did the Blessed One not praiseHere brahmin someone abides with his mind obsessed by sensual lust a prey to sensual lust and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from arisen sensual lustWhile he harbours sensual lust within he meditates premeditates outmeditates and mismeditates He abides with his mind obsessed by ill will a prey to ill willWhile he harbours doubt within he meditates premeditates outmeditates and mismeditatesThe Blessed One did not praise that kind of meditationAnd what kind of meditation did the Blessed One praiseHere brahmin quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhanaIt seems Master Ananda that Master Gotama censured that kind of meditation that should be censured and praised that kind of meditation that should be praisedAnd now Master Ananda we depart We are busy and have much to doNow is the time brahmin to do as you think fitThen the brahmin Vassakara the minister of Magadha having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Anandas words rose from his seat and departedThen soon after he had left the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana said to the venerable Ananda Master Ananda has not yet answered what we asked himDid we not tell you brahmin There is no single bhikkhu brahmin who possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were possessed by the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedFor the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path the producer of the unproduced path the declarer of the undeclared path he was the knower of the path the finder of the path the one skilled in the pathBut his disciples now abide following that path and become possessed of it afterwardsNow on that occasion King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha being suspicious of King Pajjota was having Rajagaha fortifiedThen when it was morning the venerable Ananda dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Rajagaha for almsThen the venerable Ananda thought It is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagahaadding Venerable sir since we could not detach the bhikkhu Sati son of a fisherman from this pernicious view we have reported this matter to the Blessed Oneand told him all that had occurredfor this will lead to your harm and suffering for a long timefor this will lead to the harm and suffering of this misguided man for a long timewhen fire burns dependent on logs it is reckoned as a log fire when fire burns dependent on faggots it is reckoned as a faggot fire when fire bums dependent on grass it is reckoned as a grass fire when fire burns dependent on cowdung it is reckoned as a cowdung fire when fire burns dependent on chaff it is reckoned as a chaff fire when fire burns dependent on rubbish it is reckoned as a rubbish fire so too consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it arisesWhen consciousness arises dependent on the eye and forms it is reckoned as eyeconsciousnesswhen consciousness arises dependent on the mind and mindobjects it is reckoned as mindconsciousnessNow bhikkhus these four kinds of nutriment have what as their source what as their origin from what are they born and producedAnd this feeling has what as its sourceAnd this contact has what as its sourceAnd this sixfold base has what as its sourceAnd this mentalitymateriality has what as its sourceAnd this consciousness has what as its sourceAnd these formations have what as their source what as their origin from what are they born and producedSuch is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingWith the cessation of clinging cessation of beingWith the cessation of craving cessation of cimgingWith the cessation of feeling cessation of cravingWith the cessation of contact cessation of feeling With the cessation of the sixfold base cessation of contactWith the cessation of mentalitymateriality cessation of the sixfold baseWith the cessation of consciousness cessation of mentalitymaterialityWith the cessation of formations cessation of consciousnessWith the cessation of ignorance cessation of formations so it was said Now bhikkhus do formations cease with the cessation of ignorance or not or how do you take it in this caseHere there is the union of the mother and father but it is not the mothers season and the being to be reborn is not present  in this case there is no conception of an embryo in a wombfor the mothers breastmilk is called blood in the Noble Ones Discipline  Here bhikkhus a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightened Having thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhanaWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhanaWith the fading away as well of rapturehe enters upon and abides in the third jhanaWith the abandoning of pleasure and painhe enters upon and abides in the fourth jhanawhich has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity  On seeing a form with the eye he does not lust after it if it is pleasing he does not dislike it if it is unpleasing He abides with mindfulness of the body established with an immeasurable mindand he understands as it actually is the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainderHaving thus abandoned favouring and opposing whatever feeling he feels whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant he does not delight in that feeling welcome it or remain holding to itWith the cessation of his delight comes cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of being with the cessation of being cessation of birth with the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingBhikkhus remember this deliverance through the destruction of craving as taught in brief by me But the bhikkhu Sati son of a fisherman is caught up in a vast net of craving in the trammel of cravingThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAs he does not do so delight in feelings ceases in himOn hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odour with the nose On tasting a flavour with the tongue On touching a tangible with the body On cognizing a mindobject with the mindSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingWith the cessation of his delight comes cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of being with the cessation of being cessation of birth with the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceasehe does not lust after it if it is pleasing he does not dislike it if it is unpleasingTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedHe declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledgeHe teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pureNow it is good to see such arahantsThen the brahmin householders of Veranja went to the Blessed One Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side some kept silent and sat down at one sideWhen they were seated they said to the Blessed One Master Gotama what is the cause and condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellAnd what is the cause and condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world Householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellIt is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldWe do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas utterance which he has spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaningIt would be good if Master Gotama would teach us the Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of his utteranceThen householders listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisHouseholders there are three ways in which one does not observe bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conduct four ways in which one does not observe verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conduct three ways in which one does not observe mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conductAnd how householders in three ways one does not observe bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conductHere someone kills living beingshe is murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence merciless to living beingsHe takes what is not givenhe takes by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the village or forestHe misconducts himself in sensual pleasureshe has intercourse with women who are protected by their mother father mother and father brother sister or relatives who have a husband who are protected by law and even with those who are garlanded in token of betrothalThat is how in three ways one does not observe bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conductAnd how householders in four ways one does not observe verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conductHere someone speaks falsehoodwhen summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives presence or to his guild or to the royal familys presence and questioned as a witness thus So good man tell what you know not knowing he says I know or knowing he says I do not know not seeing he says I see or seeing he says I do not seein full awareness he speaks falsehood for his own ends or for anothers ends or for some trifling worldly endHe speaks maliciouslyhe repeats elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide those people from these or he repeats to these people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these people from thosethus he is one who divides those who are united a creator of divisions who enjoys discord rejoices in discord delights in discord a speaker of words that create discordHe speaks harshlyhe utters such words as are rough hard hurtful to others offensive to others bordering on anger unconducive to concentrationHe is a gossiphe speaks at the wrong time speaks what is not fact speaks what is useless speaks contrary to the Dhamma and the Disciplineat the wrong time he speaks such words as are worthless unreasonable immoderate and unbeneficialThat is how in four ways one does not observe verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conductAnd how householders in three ways one does not observe mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conductHere someone is covetous he covets the wealth and property of others thus Oh may what belongs to another be mine Or he has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus May these beings be slain and slaughtered may they be cut off perish or be annihilatedOr he has wrong view distorted vision thus There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit or result of good and bad actions no this world no other world no mother no father no beings who are reborn spontaneously no good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other worldThat is how in three ways one does not observe mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of unrighteous conductSo householders it is by reason of such conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of such unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellHouseholders there are three ways in which one observes bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conduct four ways in which one observes verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conduct three ways in which one observes mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conductAnd how householders in three ways one observes bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conductHere someone abandoning the killing of living beings abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenhe does not take by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the village or in the forestAbandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures he abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasureshe does not have intercourse with women who are protected by their mother father mother and father brother sister or relatives who have a husband who are protected by law or with those who are garlanded in token of betrothalThat is how in three ways one observes bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conductAnd how householders in four ways one observes verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conductHere someone abandoning false speech abstains from false speechwhen summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives presence or to his guild or to the royal familys presence and questioned as a witness thus So good man tell what you know not knowing he says I do not know or knowing he says I know not seeing he says I do not see or seeing he says I seehe does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his own ends or for anothers ends or for some trifling worldly endAbandoning malicious speech he abstains from malicious speechhe does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide those people from these nor does he repeat to these people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these people from those thus he is one who reunites those who are divided a promoter of friendships who enjoys concord rejoices in concord delights in concord a speaker of words that promote concordAbandoning harsh speech he abstains from harsh speech he speaks such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear and loveable as go to the heart are courteous desired by many and agreeable to manyAbandoning gossip fie abstains from gossiphe speaks at the right time speaks what is fact speaks on what is good speaks on the Dhamma and the Discipline at the right time he speaks such words as are worth recording reasonable moderate and beneficialThat is how in four ways one observes verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conductAnd how householders in three ways one observes mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conductHere someone is not covetoushe does not covet the wealth and property of others thus Oh may what belongs to another be mine His mind is without ill will and he has intentions free from hate thus May these beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety May they live happily He has right view undistorted vision thus There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed there is fruit and result of good and bad actions there is this world and the other world there is mother and father there are beings who are reborn spontaneously there are good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other worldThat is how in three ways one observes mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma one of righteous conductSo householders it is by reason of such conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of such righteous conduct that

GotamaMaster Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see formsWe go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusFrom today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge for lifeWelcome to Master Anandaand asked the venerable Ananda  Master Ananda is there any single bhikkhu who possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were possessed by Master Gotama accomplished and fully enlightenedand when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sidewhen you arrivedThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livessurely they honour one who should be honouredand venerate one who should be veneratedSeveral bhikkhus having heard about thishe purifies his mind from doubtyou should train thus of gods and humansand in many ways he gave a talk about meditationand he praised every type of meditationNow on that occasion some brahmin householders of Veranja were on a visit to Savatthi for some business or otherWhoso cut of etcThis story the Master while dwelling at Jetavana told about a wrathful BrotherThe incident that gave rise to the story has been already describedThe Master asked that Brother saying Why after taking orders under the dispensation of the Buddha who knows not what wrath is do you show anger Wise men in bygone days though they suffered a thousand stripes and had their hands and feet and ears and nose cut off showed no anger against another And he then told a story of the olden timeOnce upon a time a king of Kāsi named Kalābu reigned at BenaresAt that time the Bodhisatta came to life in a brahmin family endowed with eighty crores of treasure in the form of a youth named Kuṇḍakakumāra And when he was of age he acquired a knowledge of all the sciences at Takkasilā and afterwards settled down as a householder On the death of his parents looking at his pile of treasure he thought My kinsmen who amassed this treasure are all gone without taking it with them now it is for me to own it and in my turn to depart Then he carefully selected persons who by virtue of their almsgiving deserved it and gave all his wealth to them and entering the Himālaya country he adopted the ascetic life There he dwelt a long time living on wild fruits And descending to the inhabited parts for the sake of procuring salt and vinegar he gradually made his way to Benares where he took up his abode in the royal park Next day he went his rounds in the city for alms till he came to the door of the commanderinchiefAnd he being pleased with the ascetic for the propriety of his deportment brought him into the house and fed him with the food prepared for himself And having gained his consent he got him to take up his abode in the royal parkNow one day king Kalābu being inflamed with strong drink came into the park in great pomp surrounded by a company of dancers Then he had a couch spread on the royal seat of stone and lay with his head on the lap of a favourite of the haremwhile the nautch girls who were skilful in vocal and instrumental music and in dancing provided a musical entertainmentSo great was his magnificence like to that of Sakka Lord of heavenAnd the king fell asleepThen the women said He for whose sake we are providing music is gone to sleep What need is there for us to sing  Then they cast aside their lutes and other musical instruments hither and thither and set out for the garden where tempted on by the flowers and fruitbearing shrubs they were soon disporting themselvesAt this moment the Bodhisatta was seated in this garden like a royal elephant in the pride of his vigour at the foot of a flowering Sāl tree enjoying the bliss of retirement from the worldSo these women in wandering about came upon him and said Come hither ladies and let us sit down and hear somewhat from the priest who is resting at the foot of this tree until the king awakes Then they went and saluted him and sitting in a circle round about him they said Tell us something worth hearingSo the Bodhisatta preached the doctrine to themMeanwhile the royal favourite with a movement of her body woke up the kingAnd the king on waking up and not seeing the women asked Where are those wretches goneYour Highness she said they are gone away and are sitting in attendance on a certain asceticThe king in a rage seized his sword and went off in haste saying I will give this false ascetic a lessonThen those of the women that were most in favour when they saw the king coming in a rage went and took the sword from the kings hand and pacified himThen he came and stood by the Bodhisatta and asked What doctrine are you preaching MonkThe doctrine of patience Your Majesty he repliedWhat is this patience  said the kingThe not being angry when men abuse you and strike you and revile youSaid the king I will see now the reality of your patience and he summoned his executionerAnd he in the way of his office took an axe and a scourge of thorns and clad in a yellow robe and wearing a red garland came and saluted the king and said What is your pleasure SireTake and drag off this vile rogue of an ascetic said the king and throwing him on the ground with your lash of thorns scourge him before and behind and on both sides and give him two thousand stripesThis was doneThe king again asked What doctrine do you preach MonkThe doctrine of patience Your Highness he repliedYou fancy that my patience is only skin deep It is not skin deep but is fixed deep within my heart where it cannot be seen by youSireAgain the executioner asked What is your pleasure SireThe king said Cut off both the hands of this false asceticSo he took his axe and placing the victim within the fatal circle he cut off both his handsThen the king said Off with his feet and his feet were chopped offAnd the blood flowed from the extremities of his hands and feet like lac juice from a leaking jarAgain the king asked what doctrine he preachedThe doctrine of patience Your Highness he repliedYou imagine Sire that my patience dwells in the extremities of my hands and feet It is not there but it is deep seated somewhere elseThe king said Cut off his nose and earsThe executioner did so His whole body was now covered with bloodAgain the king asked of his doctrineAnd the asetic said Think not that my patience is seated in the tips of my nose and ears my patience is deep seated within my heartThe king said Lie down false Monk and thence exalt your patience And so saying he struck the Bodhisatta above the heart with his foot and betook himself offWhen he was gone the commanderinchief wiped off the blood from the body of the Bodhisatta putting bandages on the extremities of his hands feet ears and nose and then having gently placed him on a seat he saluted him and sitting on one side he said If Reverend Sir you would be angry with one who has sinned against you be angry with the king but with no one else And making this request he repeated the first stanzaWhoso cut off thy nose and ear and lopped off foot and handWith him be wroth heroic soul but spare we pray this landLong live the king whose cruel hand my body thus has marredPure souls like mine such deeds as these with anger neer regardAnd just as the king was leaving the garden and at the very moment when be passed out of the range of the Bodhisattas vision the mighty earth that is two hundred and forty thousand leagues in thickness split in two like unto a strong stout cloth garment and a flame issuing forth from Avīci seized upon the king wrapping him up as it were with a royal robe of scarlet woolThus did the king sink into the earth just by the garden gate and was firmly fixed in the great Hell of AvīciAnd the Bodhisatta died on that same dayAnd the kings servants and the citizens came with perfumes and wreaths and incense in their hands and performed the Bodhisattas obsequiesAnd some said that the Bodhisatta had gone straight back to the Himālayas But in this they said the thing that was notand inner skins were cut through to the flesh and the blood flowedThe Bodhisatta on hearing this uttered the second stanzaA saint of old as men have told  Great courage did displayThat saint so strong to suffer wrong  The Kāsi king did slayAlas the debt of vain regret  That king will have to payWhen doomed to dwell in lowest Hell  Long will he rue the dayThese two stanzas were inspired by Perfect WisdomThe Master his lesson ended revealed the Truths and identified the BirthAt the conclusion of the Truths the choleric Brother attained fruition of the Second Path while many others attained fruition of the First PathAt that time Devadatta was Kalābu king of Kāsi Sāriputta was the CommanderinChief and I myself was the Ascetic the Preacher of PatienceNow  begins the meditationsubject consisting of the Thirtytwofold Aspect of the body which is a treatise on maintaining concentration in being etc by means of the bodily parts under Mindfulness Occupied With The Body  When a clansman is already established in virtue and has purified his means by the Training Precepts in the way stated this meditation subject has for its purpose the purification of his ends and it has for its aim his maintaining profitable cognizance in being It is never promulgated except after an Enlightened Ones arising and is outside the province of any sectarians It has been commended by the Blessed One in various ways in different Suttas thus Bhikkhus when one idea is maintained in being and developed it leads to a great sense of urgencyWhat is that one ideaIt is mindfulness occupied with the body  And thus  Bhikkhus they do not savour the deathless who do not savour mindfulness occupied with the bodyThey have not savoured the deathless who have not savoured mindfulness occupied with the body they have savoured They have neglected They have not neglected They have missed They have found the deathless who have found mindfulness occupied with the body  to realization of the fruit of trueknowledge and deliveranceto a pleasant abiding here and nowto obtainment of knowledge and seeingto great mindfulness and full awarenessto great safety from bondageto great benefitthey savour the deathless who savour mindfulness occupied with the body And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu maintain mindfulness occupied with the body in being Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained within the skin as full of many kinds of impurity thus in this body there are headhairs bodyhairs nails

been taught thusand matthake matthalungam   brain in the head   including  brain  under bonemarrow in numerous contexts in which this description appears So here is the commentary on the meaning of that meditation subjectfor it is the physical frame that is called  body  because it is a conglomeration of impurity since such vile things as the headhairs etc have it as their origin Body  the physical frameIn this  in this which is expressed thus up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained within the skin as full of many kinds of impurityHerein There are means that they are factually knownHeadhairs     brain  these things beginning with headhairs are thirtytwo aspects of it The construction here should be understood in this way In this body there are head hairs in this body there are bodyhairsIt is that no one who searches earnestly throughout the whole of this fathomlong carcase starting from the soles of the feet upwards starting from the top of the hair downwards and starting from the skin all round ever sees even the minutest atom of pureness in it such as a pearl or a crystal or a beryl or aloes or sandalwood or saffron or camphor or talcumpowder etc on the contrary he sees nothing but various very malodorous offensive drablooking sorts of impurity consisting of the headhairs bodyhairs and the restWhat is expressed by thatThis is the commentary on the wordconstruction here in the first placeNow for the sake of facility in acquaintanceship with the commentary on this same thirtytwofold aspect the following general method should be understoodThen the Venerable Punna approached the Blessed One  and said to him Venerable sir it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resoluteAnd the Bodhisattas outerPunna there are forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable lovely agreeable pleasing sensually enticing tantalizingIf a bhikkhu seeks delight in them welcomes themWith the arising of delight Punna there is the arising of suffering I say There are Punna sounds cognizable by the ear  mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable lovely agreeable pleasing sensually enticing tantalizingIf a bhikkhu seeks delight in them welcomes themWith the arising of delight Punna there is the arising of suffering I sayPunna here are forms cognizable by the eye mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable lovely agreeable pleasing sensually enticing tantalizingNow that you have received this brief exhortation from me Punna in which country will you dwellThere is venerable sir a country named Sunaparanta I will dwell therePunna the people of Sunaparanta are wild and roughIf they abuse and revile you what will you think about thatVenerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta abuse and revile me then I will think These people of Sunaparanta are excellent truly excellent in that they do not give me a blow with the fistThen I will think thus Blessed One then I will think thus Fortunate OneBut Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with the fist what will you think about thatVenerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta give me a blow with the fist then I will think These people of Sunaparanta are excellent truly excellent in that they do not give me a blow with a clodThen I will think thus Blessed One then I will think thus Fortunate OneBut Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a clod what will you think about that Venerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta give me a blow with a clod then I will think These people of Sunaparanta are excellent truly excellent in that they do not give me a blow with a rodThen I will think thus Blessed One then I will think thus Fortunate OneBut Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a rod what will you think about thatVenerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta give me a blow with a rod then I will think These people of Sunaparanta are excellent truly excellent in that they do not stab me with a knifeThen I will think thus Blessed One then I will think thus Fortunate OneBut Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do stab you with a knife what will you think about thatVenerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta stab me with a knife then I will think These people of Sunaparanta are excellent truly excellent in that they do not take my life with a sharp knifeThen I will think thus Blessed One then I will think thus Fortunate OneBut Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do take your life with a sharp knife what will you think about thatVenerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta take my life with a sharp knife then I will think There have been disciples of the Blessed One who being repelled humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life sought for an assailant But I have come upon this assailant even without a searchThen I will think thus Blessed One then I will think thus Fortunate OneGood good PunnaEndowed with such selfcontrol and peacefulness you will be able to dwell in the Sunaparanta countryNow Punna  you may go at your own convenienceThen having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement the Venerable Punna raise from his seat paid homage to the Blessed One and departed keeping him on his right He then set his lodging in order took his bowl and outer robe and set out to wander towards the Sunaparanta countryWandering by stages he eventually arrived in the Sunaparanta countryThen during that rains the Venerable Punna established five hundred male lay followersAnd during that same rains he attained final NibbanaThen a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One  and said to him Venerable sir the clansman named Punna who was given a brief exhortation by the Blessed One has diedWhat is his destination What is his future bournBhikkhus the clansman Punna was wise He practiced in accordance with the Dhamma and did not trouble me on account of the DhammaThe clansman Punna has attained final Nibbanaand remains holding to them delight arises in himand remains holding to them delight arises in himIf a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them does not welcome them and does not remain holding to them delight ceases in himWith the cessation of delight Punna there is the cessation of suffering I sayand five hundred female lay followers in the practiceand he himself during that same rains realized the three true knowledgeswhere he dweltBy sign characteristic elementsBy voidness categories and the rest We put this Thirtytwofold Aspects Exposition to the testHerein  by sign there are one hundred and sixty signs in this thirtytwofold aspect by means of which the meditator discerns the thirtytwofold aspect by parts By characteristic  there are a hundred and twentyeight specific characteristics in this thirtytwofold aspect by means of which the meditator gives attention to the thirtytwofold aspect by specific characteristicBy elements with the elements mentioned in the passage  Bhikkhu this man consists of four elements  there are in the case of the thirtytwofold aspect a hundred and twentyeight instances of the elements by means of which a meditator discerns the thirtytwofold aspect by elementsthat is to say the stiffenedness in the headhairs is the earth element the cohesion in them is the water element the maturing in them is the fire element and the distension in them is the air element which make four elements By voidness  there are a hundred and twentyeight kinds of voidness in the thirtytwofold aspect by means of which a meditator has insight by voidness into the thirtytwofold aspect By categories and the rest in the thirtytwofold aspect when headhairs etc are included under categories etc the exposition should be known in the way beginning How many of the five categories of form feeling perception determinations and consciousness are represented in headhairs How many of the twelve inoneselfexternal bases beginning with the pair eyecumforms How many of the eighteen elements How many of the four Truths How many of the four Foundations of MindfulnessWhen he knows thus the body seems to him comparable to a mass of grass and sticksaccording as it is saidas it is called thus He comprehends the categories  Rise and then their subsidenceThe explanation of the Thirtytwofold Aspect in the Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning the Commentary on the Minor Books is endedThis was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heardWhy is thatBy associating with monks of this sort sharing with them attending on them the asyetunculminated aggregate of virtue goes to the culmination of its development the asyetunculminated aggregate of concentration goes to the culmination of its development the asyetunculminated aggregate of discernment goes to the culmination of its development the asyetunculminated aggregate of release goes to the culmination of its development the asyetunculminated aggregate of knowledge  vision of release goes to the culmination of its developmentMonks of this sort are said to be teachers leaders abandoners of harm dispellers of darkness makers of light makers of radiance makers of brightness makers of brilliance bringers of illumination noble ones endowed with eyes that seeThose monks who are consummate in virtue consummate in concentration consummate in discernment consummate in release consummate in the knowledge  vision of release who exhort demonstrate instruct urge rouse  encourage who are competent rightly to point out the true Dhamma seeing them I tell you accomplishes a great deal listening to them approaching them attending to them recollecting them following them in going forth accomplishes a great dealThis is a condition creating joy for those who knowliving the Dhamma of the noble ones composedwho brighten the true Dhamma illumine it shining brilliantlythat is to say the headhairs coloursign shapesign directionsign locationsign and delimitationsignso too in the case of bodyhairs and the restwho are makers of light enlightened abandoners of harm who have eyes that seethat is to say the headhairs characteristic of stiffenedness characteristic of cohesion characteristic of heat and characteristic of motion make four specific characteristicsand so too with the bodyhairs and the restHaving heard their message with right gnosis the wisedirectly knowing the ending of birth come to no further becomingand so too with bodyhairs and the restthat is to say in the case of headhairs firstly the earth element is void of the water element and the rest likewise the water element is void of the earth element and the rest and in this way there are four kinds of voidnessand so too with bodyhairs and the rest There is no creature human male  No person can be apprehended This body as it is is void  As any mass of grass and sticks   One such as this  with quieted mind  Retires to an empty place And his true insight in the Ideal  Gives him superhuman delight  Then he is not far from the superhuman delight then it will not be long before be realizes the deathlessness that is extinction  which has no ageing or death and is frequented by Noble PeopleAnd so soon thereafter as his existence becomes coessential with the happiness and gladness stated to pertain to insight thus  There finding happiness and gladness  Because he knows that to be deathless  THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus there are four ways of undertaking thingsWhat are the fourThere is a way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain There is a way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as pain There is a way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as pleasure There is a way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasureWhat bhikkhus is the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as painBhikkhus there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this There is no harm in sensual pleasuresThey take to gulping down sensual pleasuresThey say thus What future fear do these good recluses and brahmins see in sensual pleasures when they speak of abandoning sensual pleasures and describe the full understanding of sensual pleasuresPleasant is the touch of this woman wanderers tender soft downy arm Thus they take to gulping down sensual pleasuresand having done so on the dissolution of the body after death they reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellThere they feel painful racking piercing feelingsThey say thus This is the future fear those good recluses and brahmins saw in sensual pleasures when they spoke of abandoning sensual pleasures and described the full understanding of sensual pleasures For it is by reason of sensual pleasures owing to sensual pleasures that we are now feeling painful racking piercing feelingsBhikkhus suppose that in the last month of the hot season a maluvacreeper pod burst openThen a deity living in that tree became fearful perturbed and frightenedBut no peacock swallowed that seed no wild animal ate it no forest fire bumed it no woodsmen carried it off no white ants devoured it and it was in fact fertile Then being moistened by rain from a rainbearing cloud the seed in due course sproutedand the maluva creepers tender soft downy tendril wound itself around that sala treeThen the deity living in the sala tree thought What future fear did my friends and companions kinsmen and relatives  see in that maluvacreeper seed when they gathered together and reassured me as they did Pleasant is the touch of this maluva creepers tender soft downy tendril So too bhikkhus there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this There is no harm in sensual pleasures They say thus This is the future fear those good recluses and brahmins saw in sensual pleasuresAnd what bhikkhus is the way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as painHere bhikkhus someone goes naked rejecting conventions licking his hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked Thus in such a variety ways he dwells pursuing the practice of tormenting and martyring the bodyOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination perdition even in hellThis is called the way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as painAnd what bhikkhus is the way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as pleasureHere bhikkhus someone by nature has strong lust and he constantly experiences pain and grief born of lust by nature he has strong hate and he constantly experiences pain and grief born of hate by nature he has strong delusion and he constantly experiences pain and grief born of delusionYet in pain and grief weeping with tearful face he leads the perfect and pure holy lifeOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldThis is called the way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as pleasureAnd what bhikkhus is the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasureHere bhikkhus someone by nature does not have strong lust and he does not constantly experience pain and grief born of lust by nature he does not have strong hate and he does not constantly experience pain and grief born of hate by nature he does not have strong delusion and he does not constantly experience pain and grief born of delusionQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters Upon and abides in the first jhanaThis is called the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasureThese bhikkhus are the four ways of undertaking thingsThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsand divert themselves with women wanderers who wear their hair bound in a topknotand a maluvacreeper seed fell at the foot of a sala treebut the deitys friends and companions kinsmen and relatives  garden deities park deities tree deities and deities inhabiting medicinal herbs grass and forestmonarch trees  gathered together and reassured that deity thus Have no fear sir have no fear Perhaps a peacock will swallow the maluvacreeper seed or a wild animal will eat it or a forest fire will burn it or woodsmen will carry it off or white ants will devour it or it may not even be fertileThen the creeper enfolded the sala treemade a canopy over itdraped a curtain all around itBecause of that maluvacreeper seed I am now feeling painful backing piercing feelingsThe deity who lived in the tree then realised This is the future fear they saw in that maluvacreeper seedThis is called the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as painHe dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the eveningWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhana With the fading away as well of rapturehe enters upon and abides in the third jhana With the abandoning of pleasure and painhe enters upon and abides in the fourth jhanaOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldthat we are now

be persuaded by othersThen a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideYes friend they replied and they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one sideThe Blessed One then asked them Bhikkhus is it true that you have taken to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal daggers that you can neither convince each other nor be convinced by others that you can neither persuade each other nor be persuaded by othersYes venerable sirBhikkhus what do you think When you take to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal daggers do you on that occasion maintain acts of lovingkindness by body speech and mind in public and in private towards your companions in the holy lifeSo bhikkhus when you take to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal daggers on that occasion you do not maintain acts of lovingkindness by body speech and mind in public and in private towards your companions in the holy lifeMisguided men what can you possibly know what can you see that you take to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal daggers That you can neither convince each other nor be convinced by others that you can neither persuade each other nor be persuaded

well sought the character for realisation of the fruit of streamentryWhen a noble disciple is thus possessed of seven factors he possesses the fruit of streamentryThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus Come bhikkhu tell those bhikkhus in my name that the Teacher calls them Yes venerable sir he replied and he went to those bhikkhus and told them The Teacher calls the venerable onesand informed him of what was happeningNo venerable sirAnd how does this view that is noble and emancipating lead the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of sufferingHe understands thus I possess the character of a person who possesses right viewTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana was living in the Bhagga country at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove the Deer ParkNow on that occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana was walking up and down in the openAnd on that occasion Mara the Evil One went into the venerable Maha Moggallanas belly and entered his bowelsThen the venerable Maha Moggallana considered thus Why is my belly so heavyOne would think it full of beansThus he left the walk and went into his dwelling where he sat down on a seat made readyWhen he had sat down he gave thorough attention to himselfWhen he saw this he said Come out Evil One Come out Evil OneDo not harass the Tathagata do not harass the Tathagatas disciple Then Mara the Evil One thought This recluse does not know me he does not see me when he says thatThen the venerable Maha Moggallana said Even thus I know you Evil One Do not think He does not know meYou are Mara Evil OneYou were thinking thus Evil One This recluse does not know me he does not see me when he says thatThen Mara the Evil One thought The recluse knew me he saw me when he said thatThe venerable Maha Moggallana saw him standing there and said I see you there too Evil One Do not think He does not see meYou are standing against the door bar Evil OneIt happened once Evil One that I was a Mara named Dusi and I had a sister named KaliYou were her sonNow on that occasion the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightened had appeared in the worldThe Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightened had an auspicious pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and SanjivaAmong all the disciples of the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightenedThat was how the venerable Vidhura came to have the designation VidhuraBut the venerable Sanjiva gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut entered without difficulty upon the cessation of perception and feelingIt happened once Evil One that the venerable Sanjiva had seated himself at the root of a certain tree and entered upon the cessation of perception and feelingSome cowherds shepherds and ploughmen passing by saw the venerable Sanjiva sitting at the root of the tree having entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling and they thought It is wonderful sirs it is marvellousThere is this recluse sitting here deadLet us cremate himThen the cowherds shepherds and ploughmen collected grass wood and cow dung and having piled it up against the venerable Sanjivas body they set fire to it and went on their wayNow Evil One when the night had ended the venerable Sanjiva emerged from the attainmentHe shook his robe and then it being morning he dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went into the village for almsThe cowherds shepherds and ploughmen passing by saw the venerable Sanjiva wandering for alms and they thought It is wonderful sirs it is marvellousThis recluse who was sitting there dead has come back to lifeThat was how the venerable Sanjiva came to have the designation SanjivaThen Evil One the Mara Dusi considered thus There are these virtuous bhikkhus of good character but I do not know their coming or their goingLet me now take possession of the brahmin householders telling them Come now abuse revile scold and harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good characterThen Evil One the Mara Dusi took possession of those brahmin householders telling them Come now abuse revile scold and harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good characterThen when the Mara Dusi had taken possession of the brahmin householders they abused reviled scolded and harassed the virtuous bhikkhus of good character thus These baldpated recluses these swarthy menial offspring of the Kinsmans feet claim We are meditators we are meditators  and with shoulders drooping heads down and all limp they meditate premeditate outmeditate and mismeditateJust as an owl on a branch waiting for a mouse meditates premeditates outmeditates and mismeditatesor just as a jackal on a riverbank waiting for fish meditates premeditates outmeditates and mismeditatesNow Evil One on that occasion most of those human beings when they died reappeared on the dissolution of the body after death in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellThen the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightened addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus the Mara Dusi has taken possession of the brahmin householders telling them Come now abuse revile scold and harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good character then perhaps when they are abused reviled scolded and harassed by you some change will come about in their mind whereby the Mara Dusi may find an opportunityCome bhikkhus abide pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourthAbide pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassionwith a mind imbued with appreciative joywith a mind imbued with equanimity abundantSo Evil One when those bhikkhus had been thus advised and instructed by the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightened then gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut they abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindnessThen Evil One the Mara Dusi considered thus Though I do as I am doing still I do not know the coming or the going of these virtuous bhikkhus of good character Let me now take possession of the brahmin householders telling them Come now honour respect revere and venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character then perhaps when they are honoured respected revered and venerated by you some change will come about in their minds whereby the Mara Dusi may find an opportunityThen Evil One the Mara Dusi took possession of those brahmin householders telling them Come now honour respect revere and venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character then perhaps when they are honoured respected revered and venerated by you some change will come about in their minds whereby the Mara Dusi may find an opportunityThen when the Mara Dusi had taken possession of the brahmin householders they honoured respected revered and venerated the virtuous bhikkhus of good characterNow Evil One on that occasion most of those human beings when they died reappeared on the dissolution of the body after death in a happy destination even the heavenly worldThen Evil One the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightened addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus the Mara Dusi has taken possession of those brahmin householders telling them Come now honour respect revere and venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character then perhaps when they are honoured respected revered and venerated by you some change will come about in their minds whereby the Mara Dusi may find an opportunityCome bhikkhus abide contemplating foulness in the body perceiving repulsiveness in nutriment perceiving disenchantment with all the world contemplating impermanence in all formationsSo Evil One when those bhikkhus had been thus addressed and instructed by the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightened then gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut they abided contemplating foulness in the body perceiving repulsiveness in nutriment perceiving disenchantment with all the world contemplating impermanence in all formationsThen when it was morning the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightened dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went into the village for alms with the venerable Vidhura as his attendantThen the Mara Dusi took possession of a certain boy and picking up a stone he struck the venerable Vidhura on the head with it and cut his headWith blood running from his cut head the venerable Vidhura followed close behind the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightenedThen the Blessed One Kakusandha accomplished and fully enlightened turned around and looked at him with the elephant look This Mara Dusi knows no boundsAnd with that look Evil One the Mara Dusi fell from that place and reappeared in the Great HellNow Evil One there are three names for the Great Hell the hell of the six bases for contact the hell of the impalement with stakes and the hell to be felt for oneselfThen Evil One the wardens of hell came up to me and said Good sir when stake meets stake in your heartthen you will know I have been roasting in hell for a thousand yearsMy body had the same form as a human body Evil Oneand he saw that Mara the Evil One had gone into his belly and had entered his bowelsor it will lead to your harm and suffering for a long timeEven his teacher would not know me so soon so how can this disciple know meEven his teacher would not know me so soon so how can this disciple know mewhereupon he came up from the venerable Maha Moggallanas mouth and stood against the door barso you were my nephewthere was none equal to the venerable Vidhura in teaching the Dhammathen perhaps when they are abused reviled scolded and harassed by you some change will come about in their minds whereby the

Sangha of bhikkhusThen Pessa the elephant drivers son and Kandaraka the wanderer went to the Blessed One Pessa after paying homage to the Blessed One sat down at one sideStanding there he surveyed the Sangha of bhikkhus sitting in complete silence and then he said to the Blessed One  It is wonderful Master Gotama it is marvellous how the Sangha of bhikkhus has been led to practise the right way by Master GotamaThose who were Blessed Ones accomplished and fully enlightened in the past at most only led the Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the right way as is done by Master Gotama nowAnd those who will be Blessed Ones accomplished and fully enlightened in the future at most will only lead the Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the right way as is done by Master Gotama nowSo it is Kandaraka so it isThose who were Blessed Ones accomplished and fully enlightened in the past at most only led the Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the right way as is done by me nowAnd those who will be Blessed Ones accomplished and fully enlightened in the future at most will only lead the Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the right way as is done by me nowKandaraka in this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and who are completely liberated through final knowledgeIn this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus in higher training of constant virtue living a life of constant virtue sagacious living a life of constant sagacity They abide with their minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulnessWhat fourHere Kandaraka a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating feelings as feelings ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mind as mind ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the worldWhen this was said Pessa the elephant drivers son said It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellousFrom time to time venerable sir we whiteclothed lay people also abide with our minds well established in these four foundations of mindfulnessHere venerable sir we abide contemplating the body as a bodyfeelings as feelingsmind as mindmindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the worldIt is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellousFor humankind is a tangle but the animal is open enoughVenerable sir I can drive an elephant to be tamedBut those who are called our slaves messengers and servants behave in one way with the body in another way by speech while their minds work in still another wayIt is wonderful venerable sir it is marvelloushow amid mans tangle corruption and deceptions the Blessed One knows the welfare and harm of beings For humankind is a tangle but the animal is open enoughHumankind is a tangle but the animal is open enoughPessa there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in the worldWhat fourHere a certain kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself Here a certain kind of person torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others Here a certain kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself and he also torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others Here a certain kind of person does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and he does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing othersSince he torments neither himself nor others he is here and now hungerless extinguished and cooled and he abides experiencing bliss having himself become holyWhich of these four kinds of persons satisfies your mind PessaThe first three do not satisfy my mind venerable sirBut Pessa why dont the first three kinds of persons satisfy your mindVenerable sir the kind of person who torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself torments and tortures himself though he desires pleasure and recoils from pain that is why this kind of person does not satisfy my mindAnd the kind of person who torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others torments and tortures others who desire pleasure and recoil from pain that is why this kind of person does not satisfy my mindAnd the kind of person who torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself and who also torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others torments and tortures himself and others both of whom desire pleasure and recoil from pain that is why this kind of person does not satisfy my mindBut the kind of person who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others who since he torments neither himself nor others is here and now hungerless extinguished and cooled and abides experiencing bliss having himself become holy  he does not torment and torture either himself or others both of whom desire pleasure and recoil from pain That is why this kind of person satisfies my mindAnd now venerable sir we depart We are busy and have much to doNow is the time Pessa to do as you think fitThen Pessa the elephant drivers son having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departedSoon after he had left the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Pessa the elephant drivers son is wise he has great wisdomIf he had sat a while longer until I had expounded for him in detail these four kinds of persons he would have greatly benefitedStill he has already greatly benefited even as it isThis is the time Blessed One this is the time Sublime One for the Blessed One to expound in detail these four kinds of personsHaving heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember itThen bhikkhus listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisHere a certain person goes naked rejecting

life that is utterly perfect and pureA householder or householders son or one born in some other clan hears that DhammaOn hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the TathagataPossessing that faith he considers thus Household life is crowded and dusty life gone forth is wide openIt is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shellSuppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessOn a later occasion abandoning a small or a large fortune abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives he shaves off his hair and beard puts on the yellow robe and goes forth from the home life into homelessnessHaving thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus training and way of life

urinating who acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silentPossessing this aggregate of noble virtue and this noble restraint of the faculties and possessing this noble mindfulness and full awareness he resorts to a secluded resting place the forest the root of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle

with the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration  Again with the fading away as well of rapture he abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful  Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of

births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansion There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere and there too I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared hereThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of

Tiuman he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate He understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus These worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell but these worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect

mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taintsHe understands as it actually is This is sufferingWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberatedHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingThis bhikkhus is called the kind of person who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing othersThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordswhile Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Blessed Onehow well the four foundations of mindfulness have been made known by the Blessed One for the purification of beings for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realisation of Nibbanahow amid mans tangle corruption and deceptions the Blessed One knows the welfare and harm of beingsand in the time it takes to make a trip back and forth in Campa that elephant will show every kind of deception duplicity crookedness and fraud he is capable ofbut the last one satisfies my mindBhikkhus what kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himselfand wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with himand wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with himhe understands as it actually is This is the origin of sufferinghe understands as it actually is This is the cessation of sufferinghe understands as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingHe understands as it actually is These are the taintshe understands as it actually is This is the origin of the taintshe understands as it actually is This is the cessation of the taintshe understands as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsWhen he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance the one who since he torments neither himself nor others is here and now hungerless extinguished and cooled and abides experiencing bliss having himself become holyTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Venerable Ananda was living at Beluvagamaka near VesaliNow on that occasion the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara had arrived at Pataliputta for some business or otherThen he went to a certain bhikkhu in Kukkutas Park and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideand asked him Where does the venerable Ananda live now venerable sirThe venerable Ananda is living at Beluvagamaka near Vesall householderWhen the householder Dasama had completed his business at Pataliputta he went to the venerable Ananda at Beluvagamaka near VesallAfter paying homage to him he sat down at one side and asked him Venerable Ananda has any one thing been proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent ardent and resolute his unliberated mind comes to be liberated his undestroyed taints come to be destroyed and he attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not attained beforeYes householder one such thing has been proclaimed by the Blessed OneWhat is that one thing venerable AnandaHe considers this and understands it thus This first jhana is conditioned and volitionally producedBut whatever is conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent subject to cessationStanding upon that he attains the destruction of the taintsThis is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished

to a hidden treasure came all at once upon eleven entrances to a hidden treasure so too while I was seeking one door to the Deathless I have come all at once to hear of eleven doors to the DeathlessJust as if a man had a house with eleven doors and when that house caught on fire he could flee to safety by any one of these eleven doors so I can flee to safety by any one of these eleven doors to the DeathlessVenerable sir these sectarians will even seek a teachers fee for their teachers why shouldnt I make an offering to the venerable AnandaThen the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara assembled the Sangha of bhikkhus from Pataliputta and Vesali and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with various kinds of good food He presented a pair of cloths to each bhikkhu and he presented a triple robe to the venerable Ananda and he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for the venerable AnandaI wish to see the venerable AnandaHere householder quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionBut if he does not attain the destruction of the taints then because of that desire for the Dhamma that delight in the phamma with the destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that worldWhen a clansman as a beginner who has already purified his means by his becoming thus established in this virtue divided into the TrainingPrecepts of abstinence from killing breathing things and the rest wants to devote himself to the practice of maintaining in being the meditation subject consisting of the Thirtytwofold Aspect in order to arrive at purity of ends then firstly he may find that he has the impediment consisting of abode clan gain class of pupils supervision of building work a prospective journey relatives books or sickness which together with either the impediment of supernormal power or the impediment of reputation come to ten impediments Now these ten impediments should be severed by abandoning preoccupation with abodes clan gain class of pupils relatives and reputation by uninterest in building work journeys and books and by curing any sickness Then when he has severed his impediments without severing his eagerness for renunciation while never abandoning the behaviour prescribed by the Vinaya in respect of the lesser and minor Rules  by his embracing a mode of life governed by effacement  brought to its acme he should in a manner that accords with the instructions in the Vinaya  approach a teacher who will be the giver of his meditation subject and who possesses the particular distinctions of  scripture  and  scribing   or who possesses one or other of these two factors and he should acquaint him of his own intention to learn the meditation subject after he has propitiated him by undertaking the prescribed dutiesThe teacher will know by signs and by his inclinations temperament and resoluteness if this meditation subject is suitable for him If it is then the teacher can give it to him in brief  if he is willing to live in the same monastery as himselfor if he wants to five elsewhere the teacher can expound it to him in detail straight through showing by an exposition of what must be abandoned discerned etc its objective and showing by an exposition of what suits one of lustful temperament etc its classificationWhen he has learnt the text of the meditation subject with its objective and its classification then after asking permission from the teacher he can go to live elsewhere A large abode a new abode One tumbling down one near a roadWhen he does so he should avoid theHere bhikkhus a restingplace is not too far and not too near in respect of the alms resort and has a path for going and coming It is little frequented by day with little sound and few voices by night There is little contact with gadflies flies wind burning by the sun and creeping thingsOne who lives in that resting place easily obtains robes alms food restingplace and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sickIn that restingplace there are older bhikkhus living who are learned versed in the Scriptures observers of the True Idea observers of the Discipline observers of the Codes  and when from time to time one asks them questions thus  How is this venerable sirs What is the meaning of this then those venerable ones reveal the unrevealed explain the unexplained and remove doubt about the many ideas that raise doubtsThis bhikkhus is how a resting place has five factors  such a restingplace as has the five factors described thus And he should approach   When he has done all his tasks connected with his meal etc he should review the danger in sensual desires and the blessings in renunciation and he should infuse his cognizance with confidence by recollecting how truly enlightened the Enlightened One is how truly ideal the True Idea is and how truly entered upon the good way the Community is It is in this and no other way that a beginner can maintain in being the Thirtytwofold Aspect in all aspectsHerein at the outset the Skin Pentad should firstly be taken even in the case of one who knows the whole Tipitaka and it should be recited forward in the way beginning  Headhairs bodyhairs  and when that is familiar backwards in the way beginning  Skin teeth  and when that too is familiar then in both ways forwards and backwards This recitation should be done verbally for the purpose of cutting off outwardstraying thoughts and gaining familiarity with the text and it should be done mentally for the purpose of discerning the individual essences of the parts and this should be kept up for the space of half a monthfor the verbal maintenance of it in being by its cutting off outwardstraying thoughts is a condition for the mental maintenance of it in being through familiarity with the text while the mental maintenance of it in being is a condition for discerning the parts by way of either their loathesomeness or their colour or their characteristics  Next the Kidney Pentad should be treated in the same way for half a month after which both pentads for half a month After that the Lights Pentad for half a month and then the three pentads for half a month Next after including  brain  immediately after dungsince although mentioned at the end in the Patisa mbhidamagga it nevertheless belongs for the purpose of maintaining the meditation subject in being together with the rest of the aspects of the earthelement here the Brain Pentad should be similarly treated for half a month after which the four pentads for half a month Next the Fat Septad for half a month after which the five pentads together with the Fat Septad for half a month Next the Urine Septad for half a month after which the whole Thirtytwofold Aspect for half a month  The maintenance of the meditation subject in being for six months as stated in this way along with definition by colour shape direction location and delimitationis designed for a person of medium understandingIt should be maintained in being by one of dull understanding for as long as life lasts But the maintenance of it in being soon brings success in the case of one of keen understandingHere it will be asked But how does he define this Thirtytwofold Aspect by colour and so onWhen he is maintaining in being this meditation subject consisting of the Thirtytwofold Aspect with its divisions beginning with the Skin Pentad in the way begin ning There are in this body headhairsthen her defines it as follows  He defines headhairs firstly by colour as black or coloured according as they are seen by himHe defines them by direction in this way feince what is above the navel is called the upper direction in this body and what is below it is called the lower direction consequently they are found un this bodys upper directionHe defines them by location in this way They are found in in the moist unner skin of the head delimited by the edge if the forehead the roots of the ears and the nape of the neckAnd herein just as kuntagrasses on the top of an anthill do not know  We are found on the top of an ant hi nor does the top of the anthill know  kuntagrasses are found on me so too the headhairs do not know We are found in the moist inner skin of a head nor does the moist inner skin of the head know Headhairs are found in meBy delimitation  there is twofold delimitation namely by the similar and by the dissimilarHerein he defines them according to delimitation by the similar thus  Headhairs are each delimited by the surface of the moist inner skin in which they are fixed and by their own roots fixed in that moist inner skin by entering to the extent of a rice grain they are each delimited above by space and all round by each other this is the delimitation by the similar  Headhairs are not the remaining thirtyone aspectsThis firstly is how he defines headhairs by colour and the restHe defines bodyhairs among the remainder by colour as  mostly black  or according as they are seen by himAnd herein just as grasses found on the site of an old village do not know  We are found on the site of an old village  nor does the site of the old village know  Dabba grasses are found on me  so too the bodyhairs do not know  We are found in the moist inner skin of a physical frame  nor does the moist inner skin of the physical frame know  Bodyhairs are found in meHe defines them by delimitation thus  They are each delimited below by the surface of the moist inner skin in which they are fixed and by their own roots fixed in that by their entering to the amount of a likkha by space and all round by each otherwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of headhairs This is how he defines bodyhairs by colour and the restNext he defines nails which number twenty in one who has them completeHe defines them by shape as  each the shape of the location where it is fixed or mostly the shape of ynadhuka fruit kernels or the shape offish scalesAnd herein just as madhuka fruit kernels fixed on the ends of sticks by village children do not know  We are fixed on sticks  nor do the sticks know  Madhuka fruit kernels are fixed on us  so too the nails do not know  We are found on tips of fingers and toes  nor do the fingers and toes know  Nails are found on usHe defines them by delimitation as delimited each below and at the root by the flesh of the fingers and toes above and at the tip by space on both sides by the skin of the fingers and toes on each side of themwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on  This is how he defines nails by colour and the restNext to that he defines teeth  which number thirtytwo in one who has them completeTaking them two by two below and above from the ends of both rows of teeth there are eight teeth which are fourpointed four rooted and benchshaped on the near side of these there are set in the same order eight teeth which are threepointed threerooted and tripodshapedNext taking the four below and four above in the middle of both rows of teeth there are eight teeth which are onepointed onerooted and pumpkinpipshapedand by location thus  the upper ones are set in the upper jawbone points down wards while the lower ones are set in the lower jawbone points upwardsAnd herein just as posts fixed by a builder in a lower layer of stones and inserted in an upper layer do not know  We are fixed in a lower layer of stones and inserted in an upper layer  nor does the lower layer of stones know  Posts are fixed in me  nor does the upper layer of stones know  Posts are inserted in me  so too the teeth do not know  We are fixed in a lower jawbone and inserted in an upper jawbone  nor does the lower jawbone know  Teeth are fixed in me  nor does the upper jawbone know  Teeth are inserted in me for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern by and reviewing they arenot a personHe defines them by delimitation as  delimited below by their sockets in the jawbones and by the surface of their own roots fixed into the jawbones above by space and all round by each otherwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines teeth by colour and the restNext to that he defines skin which covers up the conglomeration of different kinds of ordure  inside the physical frame by colour as  whiteHe defines it by shape briefly as the shape of a mailcoat but in detail as  variously shapedThe meditator who is discerning skin should work his cognizance between the flesh and the skin and beginning with the upper lip should first define the inner skin of the face next the skin of the head then the skin of the back of the neck  next the skin of the right arm forwards and backwards then the skin of the left arm in the same way next the skin of the back then the skin of the buttocks next the skin of the right leg forwards and backwardsthen the skin of the left leg in the same way next the skin of the private parts the paunch the bosom and the front of the neck  and then the skin of the lower jawboneAnd herein just as when a box is covered with moist hide the moist hide does not know  A box is covered by me  nor does the box know I am covered by moist hide  so too the skin does not know This physical frame consisting of the four great entities of hardness cohesion temperature and motion is enveloped by me nor does this physical frame consisting of the four great entities know I am enveloped by skin  for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personbut only A tumour where nine holes abide  Wrapped in a coat of clammy hide And trickling filth on every side  Polluting the air with stenches far and wide   He defines it by delimitation as  delimited below by the flesh or by its surface fixed thereto and above by the cuticlewhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on  This is how he defines skin by colour and the restNext to that he defines flesh which is classed as the nine hundred pieces of meat in the physical frame by colour as  red with the hue of palibaddhaka flowersHe defines it by shape as  variously shapedthe flesh of the thighs is the shape of a rollingpin for crushing lime the flesh of the buttocks is the shape of the end of an oven the

skin removedsome say it is the shape of a meat sausage  the flesh of the cheeks  is the shape of a karanja seed put in a part of the cheek  He defines it by direction as  found in the two directions And herein just as when a wall is plastered with thick clay the thick clay does not know  A wall is plastered with me  nor does the wall know  I am plastered with thick clay  so too the flesh consisting of the nine hundred pieces does not know  Three hundred bones are plastered over by me nor do the three hundred bones know We are plastered over with nine hundred pieces of fleshfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personHe defines it by delimitation as  each piece delimited below by the framework of bones or by the surface placed thereon above by the skin and all round by each other which is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so onThis is how he defines flesh by colour and the restNext to that he defines sinews which are those classed as the nine hundred in the physical frame by colour as  white some say  honeycoloured for herein the biggest sinews are the shape of yam shoots the next smaller are the shape of the ropes in nets for catching boars those still smaller are the shape of a stinkingcreeper Those still smaller are the shape of the large strings

sinews extending over the several limbs in this physical frame are the shape of a net of mail closefitted to the physical frame He defines them by direction as  found in the two directions and also as follows c Among these there are five large sinews called  tendons  that start out from the base of the right ear and go in front and behind binding the left side and there are five that start out from the base of the left ear and go in front and behind binding the right side then there are five that start out from the right base of the neck and go in front and behind on the left side and there are five that start out from the left base of the neck and go in front and behind binding the right side then there are ten large sinews likewise called  tendons that go down to bind the right hand five in front and five behindHe defines them by location as  found in the whole physical frame in between the bones and the skin and in between the bones and the flesh binding the bonesAnd herein just as when wallwattles are bound by creeperthongs the creeper thongs do not know  Wallwattles are bound together by us  nor do the wallwattles know We are bound together by creeper thongs  so too the sinews do not know  Three hundred bones are bound together by us  nor do the three hundred bones know We are bound together by sinewsbut onlyHe defines them by delimitation as  delimited below by the three hundred bones or by their surface fixed thereto above by skin and flesh and all round by each otherwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines sinews by colour and the restNext to that he defines bones Now leaving aside the  toothbones already dealt with separately  there are in the physical frame  handbones  footbones  soft bones dependent on the flesh and  heelbones then in each leg  ankle bones  shinbones  kneebone  thighbone then  hipbones  spinebones  ribbones  breastbones  heartbone

is the shape of a lopsided coconut with a hole cut in the end The headbones together are the shape of a wornout gourdvessel held together with stitches He defines them by direction as  found in both directions and by location indiscriminately as  lying throughout the whole physical frame  but in particular thus  the headbones rest on the neckbones the neckbones on the spinebones the spinebones on the hipbones the hipbones on the thighbones the thighbones on the kneebones the kneebones on the shinbones the shinbones on the anklebones the anklebones on the bones of the backs of the feet and the bones of the backs of the feet hold up the anklebones the anklebones the neckbones hold up the headbones and the remaining bones can be understood accordinglyAnd herein just as in the case of a structure of bricks and rafters etc the bricks etc above do not know  We rest on those below us  nor do those below know  We stand holding up those above us  so too the headbones do not know We rest on neckbones  nor do the anklebones know  We rest on the bones of the backs of feet  nor do the bones of the backs of the feet know We stand holding up anklebonesfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personIn fact this is only some three hundred and odd bones bound together by nine hundred sinews plastered over with nine hundred pieces of flesh wrapped in a single coat  of hide moistened with the moisture that traverses the seven hundred stimulantchannels the whole oozing sweatdrops that well from the  bodyhair pores and housing the eighty clans of worms and these are reckoned as a  body  wherein a meditator seek as he will for an individual essence finds nothing at all worth grasping but only a bony skeleton bound together with sinews and mixed up with various kinds of ordureSeeing this as it actually is he acquires the status of a son of Him with the Ten PowersOrdure in ordure generated filth in pollutionStench in a stench Something that to fall is fatedHe defines them by delimitation as  each delimited inside by the bonemarrow above by the flesh and at the ends and the roots by each otherNext to that he defines bonemarrow  which is in the physical frame inside the bones classed in the way already stated by colour as  whiteAnd herein just as curd and treacle inside bamboo tubes etc do not know  We are inside bamboo tubes etc  and the bamboo tubes etc do not know  Curd and treacle are inside us  so too the bonemarrow does not know  I am inside bones  nor do the bones know  Bonemarrow is inside usfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a person He defines them by delimitation as  delimited by the insides of the bones and by what is similar to bonemarrowNext to that he defines kidney  which is

sinew know   Kidney is fastened by me for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personHe defines it by delimitation as  kidney delimited by what is similar to kidney which is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines kidney by colour and the restNext to that he

little expanded in those with weak understanding it is still only a budExcept for the material form in it dependent on which the mindelement and the mindconsciousnesselement occur  the rest of it consists of what is counted as the piece of flesh inside which half a pasatameasure of blood is kept which in one of lustful temperament is red in one of hating temperament is black in one of deluded temperament is like water that meat has been washed in in one of speculative thinking temperament is the colour of lentil soup in one of faithful temperament is the colour of yellow kanikdra flowers and in one of understanding temperament is limpid clear as unturbid as polished crystal and seems to shineAnd herein just as the mullion  between two window shutters does not know  I stand between two

that he defines lights which are in the interior of the physical frame and classed as two or three bits of flesh  by colour as  red the colour of not very ripe udumbara figs He defines them by shape as  the shape of an unevenly cut thick slice of cakesome say it is the shape of a heap of bits of rooftilesHe defines them by direction as  found in the upper direction And herein just as a birds nest hanging on the inside of an old barn does not know  I am hanging on the inside of an old bam  nor does the inside of the old barn know  A birds nest is hanging on me  so too the fights do not know  I am hanging on the interior of a physical frame in a part inside from the two breasts  nor does the part inside from the two breasts in the interior of the physical frame know  Lights are hanging on me for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a person He defines them by delimitation as  delimited by what is similar to lightsNext to that he defines the bowel  Which is inside the physical frame and is thirtytwo hands long in a man and twentyeight hands long in a woman and looped in twentyone places by colour as  white the colour of sand with lime by direction as  found in the two directions And herein just as the decapitated carcase of a ratsnake put into a trough of blood does not know  I am in a trough of blood  nor does the trough of blood know  A decapitated ratsnakes carcase is in me  so too the bowel does not know  I am inside a physical frame  nor does the inside of the physical frame know  A bowel is in me for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a person He defines it by delimitation as  delimited by what is similar to bowelwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the head hairs and so on  This is how he defines bowel by colour and the restNext to that he defines entrail which is inside the physical frame between the bowel coils by colour as  the colour of white edible waterlily roots  And herein just as the strings that sew together the roperings of a footwiper do not know We sew together roperings of a foot wiper  nor does the

by colour as  the colour of swallowed foodAnd what is called  stomach  is one part of the bowel membrane which resembles the swelling of air produced in the middle of a length of cloth when it is being twisted and wrung out from the two ends It is smooth outside while inside it is like a balloon of cloth  soiled by wrapping up meat refusesome say it is like the inside of a rotten jack fruitIt is this place where worms dwell seething in tangles the thirtytwo families of worms such as round worms swellingproducing worms  palmfibre  worms  needle mouth  worms tapeworms threadworms and the rest  When there is no food and drink etc present they leap up screeching and pounce upon the hearts flesh and when food and drink etc are swallowed they wait with mouths uplifted and scramble to snatch the first two or three mouthfuls swallowedIt is these worms maternityhome privy hospital and charnelground Just as when it has rained heavily in a time of drought and what has been carried by the water into the cesspit at the gate of an outcaste villagethe various kinds of ordure such as urine excrement bits of hide and bones and sinews as well as spittle snot blood etc   gets mixed up with the mud and water already collected there and after two or three days the families of worms appear and it ferments warmed by the energy of the suns heat frothing and bubbling on the top quite black in colour and so utterly stinking and loathe some that one can scarcely go near it or look at much less smell it or taste it so too the stomach is the place where the assortment of food and drink etc falls after being pounded up by the pestle of the teeth and turned over by the hand of the tongue and stuck together with spittle losing at that moment its special qualities of colour smell taste etc and taking on the appearance of koleyya paste  and dogs vomit then to get soused in the bile and phlegm and wind that have collected there where it ferments with the energy of the stomachfires heat seethes with the families of worms frothing and bubbling on the top till it turns into utterly stinking nauseating muckeven to hear about  which takes away any appetite for food drink etc let alone to see it with the eye of understandingAnd when the food and drink etc fall into it they get divided into five parts the worms devour one part the stomach fire burns up another part another part becomes urine another part becomes excrement and one part is turned into nourishment and sustains the blood flesh and so onAnd herein just as dogs vomit lying in an utterly disgusting dogs trough does not know  I am lying in a dogs trough  nor does the dogs trough know  Dogs vomit is lying in me for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a

defines dung which is inside the physical frame by colour as  usually the colour of swallowed food Now the receptacle for digested food is the place in the lowest part at the end of the bowel between the navel and the root of the spine which measures eight fingerbreadths in height and resembles the inside of a bamboo tube and just as rain water that falls on a higher level runs down to fill a lower level and stays there so too any food drink etc after falling into the receptacle for undigested food and being continuously cooked and simmered by the stomachfire till they have got as soft as flour in a pulverizer run on down through the cavity of the bowel to be pressed down till they remain impacted there like brown clay crammed into a bamboo tubeAnd herein just as brown clay crammed into a bamboo tube and pressed down does not know  I am in a bamboo tube  nor does the bamboo tube know  Brown clay is in me  so too the dung does not know  I am in a receptacle for digested food  nor

interior of the physical frame and measures a bowlful by colour as white the colour of a kacchaka fig trees leafjuice And just as duckweed and green scum on the surface of water divide when a stick or a potsherd is dropped into the water and then spread together again so too at the time of eating and drinking etc when the food and drink etc fall into the stomach the phlegm divides and then spreads together again and if it gets weak the stomach becomes utterly disgusting with a smell of ordure like a ripe boil or a rotten hens eggAnd herein just as the surface of froth on a cesspit does not know lam on a cesspit  nor does the cesspit know  A surface of froth is on me  so too the phlegm does not know I am on a stomachs surface  nor does the stomachs surface know  Phlegm is in mefor these are

thickened lac solution while mobile blood is the colour of clear lac solution and by location as  except for the fleshfree parts of the headhairs bodyhairs teeth nails and the hard dry skin mobile blood extends over the whole clungto  physical frame by following the network of veinsAnd herein just as the water in a wornout pot that wets clods of earth etc below it does not know  I am in a wornout pot wetting clods of earth etc  nor does the wornout pot know  Water is in me  nor do the clods of earth etc below know  It is wetting us  so too the blood does not know  I am in the lower

similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on  This is how he defines fat by colour and the restNext to that he defines tears  which are in the physical frame by colour as  the colour of clear sesamum oil But they are not stored in the eyesockets all the while as the bile is in the gallbladder However when creatures feel joy and laugh uproariously or feel grief and weep and lament or eat particular kinds of abnormal food or when their eyes are affected by smoke dust dirt etc then being originated by the joy grief abnormal food etc tears fill up the eyesockets or overflow from themAnd the Former Teachers comment that  a meditator who is discerning tears should give attention to tears only as present in virtue of their filling the eyesockets And herein just as water in the sockets of young palmyra nuts with the ends cut off does not know  I am in sockets of young palmyra nuts with the ends cut off  nor do the sockets of the young palmyra nuts with the ends cut off know  Water is in us  so too tears do not know  We are in eye sockets  nor do the eyesockets know  Tears are in usfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines tears by colour and the restNext to that he defines the melted unguent in the physical frame called grease by colour as  the colour of oil sprinkled on gruel And it is not always found in the melted state in these locations but when these parts get hot with the heat of a fire the suns heat upset of temperature or upset of elements then it melts and runs there like a film  on waterbaths of clear waterAnd herein just as a film that has spread over waterbaths does not know  I am spread over waterbaths  nor do the waterbaths know  A film has spread over us  so too the grease does not know  I am spread over the palms of the hands etc nor do the palms of the hands etc know  Grease is spread over us for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personHe defines it by delimitation

always found stored there but when creatures see particular kinds of food or remember it or put something hot or bitter or pungent or salt or sour into their mouthsIt is thin at the tip of the tongue and thick at the root of the tongue It is capable of wetting unhusked rice or husked rice or anything else chewable that is put into the mouth like water in a pit scooped out in a river sandbankAnd herein just as the water collected on the surface of a pit scooped out in a river sandbank does not know  I am on the surface of a pit  nor does the surface of the pit know  Water is on me  so too spittle does not know  I am collected on the surface of a tongue after descending from cheeks on both sides   nor does the tongues surface know  Spittle has collected on me after descending from cheeks on both sidesfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they are not a personHe defines it by delimitation as  spittle delimited by what is similar to spittlewhich is delimitation by the similar But the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on how he defines spittle by colour and the restNext to that he defines snot  which is in the physical frame by colour as  white the colour of a young palmyra kernelAnd it is not always found stored there but just as though a man tied up curd in a lotus leaf which he then pricked underneath with a thorn and bits of curd oozed out and dripped so too when creatures weep or suffer disturbance of elements produced by wrong food of temperature then the brain inside the head turns into stale phlegm and it ooozes out and comes down by the opening in the palate and fills the nostril cavities and stays thereAnd herein just as rotten curd put in a bag does not know I am in a bag no does the bag know Rotten curd is in me  so too snot does not know  I am in nostril cavities  nor do the nostril cavities know  Snot is in us He defines it by delimitation as c snot delimited by what is similar to snotwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines snot by colour and the restIf it is weak when a man gets up or sits down moves forward or moves backward bends or stretches then his bones creak and he goes about making a noise like the snapping of fingers and when he has walked only one or two leagues distance his airelement gets upset and his limbs pain him but if a man has plenty of it his bones do not creak when he gets up sits down etc and even when he has walked a long distance his airelement does not get upset and his limbs do not pain himAnd herein just as lubricating oil does not know  I lubricate an axle  nor does the axle know  Oil lubricates me  so too the oilofthejoints does not know  I lubricate a hundred and eighty joints  nor do the hundred and eighty joints know  Oilof thejoints lubricates usfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a person He defines it by delimitation as  oilofthejoints delimited by what is similar to oil ofthejointswhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines oilofthejoints by colour and the restNext to that he defines urine which is inside the physical frame by colour as the colour of beanbrinefor the bladdersack is what is called  bladder  And just as when a porous pot  is put upsidedown in a cesspool and then the solution from the cesspool enters it though no way of entry is evident so too the urine from the physical frame enters the bladder though no way of entry is evident But the way of exit is evident and when the bladder is full of urine creatures set about making waterAnd herein just as the solution from a cesspool in a porous pot placed upsidedown in a cesspool does not know  I am in a porous pot which is upsidedown  nor does the porous pot know  Solution from a cesspool is in me  so too the urine does not know  I am in a bladder  nor does the bladder know  Urine is in meHe defines it by delimitation as  delimited by what is inside the bladder and by what is similar to urinewhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on  This is how he defines urine by colour and the restThis is how he defines this thirtytwofold aspect by colour and the restAs he does so then owing to his devotion to the maintenance of this meditation subject in being in the various instances the headhairs and the rest become familiar to him and establish their appearance  as partsFrom then on just as when a man with good sight is observing a garland of flowers of thirtytwo colours knotted on a single thread and all the flowers become evident to him as it were simultaneously so too when the meditator observes this body thus  There are in this body headhairs  then all these ideas become evident to him simultaneouslyWhen headhairs are adverted to mindfulness proceeds as far as urine as if tying them together with stringFrom then on human beings animals etc as they go about seem to him divested of their aspect of creatures and establish their appearance as just assemblages of parts And when drink food etc is being swallowed by them this appears as though it were being put in among the assemblage of partsNow it may be asked What more should be done by him It can be answered as follows That same sign should be cultivated maintained in being developed and made thoroughly defined by himHe  cultivates  that sign in the headhairs etc of established appearance as parts which means that with mindfulness he sticks to it frequents it approaches it implants it in the womb of mindfulnessHe  develops  it means that he has it struck at again and again by thought and explorationHe  makes it thoroughly well defined means that he defines it upholds it anchors it with mindfulness so that once well defined it does not vanish any moreOr else following the Tenfold Skill in Attention mentioned above as by following the order not too quickly not too slowly by warding off distraction  by surmounting the description by successive letting go by characteristic etc  and the three SuttantasHerein it can be understood that one who gives attention by following the order  cultivates  it who does so not too quickly or not too slowly  maintains it in being who does so by warding off distraction   develops  it and who does so by surmounting the description  makes it thoroughly well definedHere it may be asked But how does he give attention to these ideas by following the order and so onIt may be replied After giving attention to headhairs he next gives attention to body hairs not to nailsWhyBecause just as when a man with no skill climbs a thirtytworung ladder using the rungs out of their order  he tires his body and falls from the ladder without completing the climb so too if he gives them attention out of their order he tires his cognizance through failure to arrive at the gratification to be arrived at by completing the maintenance of the meditation subject in being and so he falls from the maintenence of the thirtytwofold aspect in being without completing itAlso when he gives attention following the order he should give attention thus  headhairs bodyhairs  not too quicklyAnd just as he should give attention not too quickly so also not too slowlyAnd one who gives attention not too slowly should also do so warding off  distractionAnd as to warding off distraction he gives attention in such a way that cognizance is not distracted among other things such as buildingwork and so onfor one whose cognizance is distracted outwardly with his cognizance and thoughts not concentrated on headhairs etc instead of bringing his maintenance of the meditation subj ect in being to completion comes to ruin and disaster like the Bodhisattas companions in the journey to Taxila but one whose cognizance is undistracted with his cognizance and thoughts concentrated only on headhairs etc brings the maintenance of his meditation subject in being to completion like the Bodhisatta completing his journey to TaxilaWhen he gives attention in this way by warding off  distraction then according to his practice done in previous lives his temperament and his resolve  those ideas establish their appearance for him either as loathesome or as a colour or as voidThen he should give attention by surmounting the descriptionThis means that after surmounting rejecting such verbal usage as  headhairs   bodyhairs  he gives attention only to the loathesomeness or colour or voidness according as the appearance is establishedHowJust as when people go to live in a forest abode then since they are unacquainted with the area they make a sign by breaking branches etc for the purpose of perceiving a place where there is water and so they find water by following up that sign but once they are acquainted with the area then they approach the water place and find the water without bothering about the sign and giving it no further attention so too when these ideas to which he first gave attention by way of the various terms of verbal usage beginning with  headhairs  bodyhairs  have established their appearance in one of the three ways beginning with loathe someness then surmounting ignoring the term of verbal usage he gives attention to them as loathesome or whichever of the other two it may beAnd here it may be asked But how do these ideas establish their appearance for him as loathesome How as a colour How as void And how does he give attention to them as loathesome as a colour and as void Headhairs establish their appearance for him as loathesome in five ways as to colour shape odour habitat and location He gives attention to them in these five waysas follows Headhairs are so utterly repulsive and disgusting as to colourthat when people by night touch a headhairshaped fibre or thread that has fallen into their drink or food they throw away even appetising drink or food or are nauseated by them through perception of them as headhairsas well that sprouting and coming to growth increase and maturity as they do on the products of bile phlegm pus and blood they resemble herbs etc growing on the multifarious products of human impurities in a middenSo too with the bodyhairs and the restThat in the first place is how he gives attention to these ideas as loathesome when they have established their appearance as loathesome But if they establish their appearance for him as a colour then headhairs establish their appearance through the blue universal   and likewise bodyhairsTeeth do so through the white universalSo in each case he gives attention to them by way of the appropriate universalThat is how he gives attention to them as a colour when they have established their appearance as a colour But if they establish their appearance for him as void then headhairs establish their appearance through analysis of the apparently compact  into elements or through that of the apparent mass into the octad with nutritiveessence as eighthLikewise bodyhairs and the restHe gives attention to each according as its appearance is established for himAnd when he has given attention thus he also gives attention to these ideas  by successive letting go This means when he gives attention by letting go of headhairs that have established their appearance in one of the three ways beginning with loathe somenessJust as a leech  standing on the place grasped by its tail scans and then grasps another place with its mouth and when it has grasped that it lets go of the first place so too standing on the headhairs and scanning he gives attention to bodyhairs and when his attention is established on bodyhairs he lets go of the head hairsAnd so in each instanceNow when he has given attention with successive letting go in this way those ideas which are establishing their appearance for him in one of the three ways beginning with loathesomeness do so unreservedly and become more evident in the appearance already established In the case of one to whom these ideas appear as loathesome  then just as a monkey being pursued by a huntsman in a palmgrove of thirtytwo palms might run on without stopping in any one tree till being constantly turned back it became tired and then stopped beside a palmspike surrounded by dense palm leaves so too the cognizancemonkey being pursued by that same meditator thus in the thirtytwo parts of this body runs on without stopping in any one part till owing to lack of further inclination to run about among a variety of objects through its being constantly turned back it becomes tiredand then it stands still in access concentration beside that idea among those beginning with head hairs with which the meditator is most familiar or which best suit his temperament or on which he has had practice in previous livesthen by treating that sign again and again with thought of and about it he eventually comes to arouse th first jhana  Using that as the foundation for analysis he develops insight till he reaches the plane of the Noble Ones  In the case of one for whom these ideas establish their appearance as a colour  then just as a monkey  and then it stands still in access concentration beside that idea among those beginning with headhairs with which the meditator is most familiar or which best suit his temperament or on which he has had practice in previous livesThen by treating that sign again and again with thought of and about it he eventually comes to the five formsphere jhanas by way of the blue universal or yellow universal  Using any of these as the foundation for analysis he develops insight and reaches the plane of the Noble Ones In the case of one to whom these ideas appear as void  he gives attention to them by specific characteristics  and by doing so he reaches access jhana by way of the Definition of the Four Elements By developing this insight and practising it progressively he reaches the plane of the Noble OnesAt this point the question asked above namely  How does he give attention to these ideas by following the order has been answeredAnd the meaning of what was said as well namely  This commentary should be understood as follows according to the maintenance in being  has been explainedeighteen kinds of restingplace called  to be avoided  thus One with a pond or leaves or flowers Or fruits or one that people seekIn cities among timber fields Where people quarrel in a portIn outlands or on frontiers Unsuitableness and no Good FriendThese are the eighteen instances A wise man needs to recognizeAnd give them full as wide a berth As any footpadhaunted road   And how has a restingplace five factors bhikkhusBoth verbally and mentally By colour shape and by directionLocation and delimitationThe wise man learns in seven ways or from the sevenfold  Skill in Attention stated thus by following the order not too quickly not too slowly by warding off distraction by surmounting the description by successive letting go by absorption etc with the  three Suttantas Then he can begin work on the maintenance of the Thirtytwo fold Aspect in being without diverging either from the Sevenfold Skill in Learning stated thus and by shape as long and round like measuring rodsfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they are incognizant actionally undeclarable void disgusting and repulsive owing to their very malodorousness not a living creature not a personthe remaining thirtyone aspects are not headhairs He defines them according to delimitation by the dissimilar thus by shape as  the shape of downbent bows or as the shape of palm fibres crooked at the tops    by direction as  found in the two directions and by location as  except for the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet they are found in most of the rest of the moist inner skin of the physical framefor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they are incognizant actionally indeterminate void disgusting and repulsive owing to their very malodorousness not a living creature not a person colour as  all white in the location where free from flesh and coppercoloured where attached to fleshHe defines them by direction as  found in the two directions and by location as  fixed on the tips of the fingers and toesfor these are ideas destutute of mutual concern and reviewing they are  not a personby colour as  all white in colour seeming in one who has evenshaped ones like a shell plate cut into a sawblade and like an evenly knotted garland of white flower budsand seeming in one who has unevenshaped ones of different shapes like a row of chairs in an old waitingroom and by shape as and on the near side of these there are set in the same order four tuskteeth which are onepointed onerooted and jasminebudshapedTaking them now one by one below and above on the near side of the latter there are set in the same order four teeth which are twopointed tworooted and shaped like the socketpost of a waggonHe them by direction as  found in the upper direction for even if it is seen as though differing in colour say black or fair and so on owing to its being dyed by the dye of the outer cuticle still it is actually white in colour by its individual essencewhich whiteness becomes evident when the outer cuticle is destroyed by burns or the impact of a blow and so infor the skin of the toes is the shape of silkworms coloons the skin of the calf is the shape of a palmleaf bag for cooked rice the skin of the thighs is the shape of a long sack full of paddy the skin of the buttock is the shape of a cloth strainer full of water the skin of the back is the shape of hide stretched over a plank the skin of the belly is the shape of hide stretched over the body of a lute the skin of the chest is more or less square the skin of both arms is the shape of hide stretched over a quiver the skin of the backs of the hands is the shape of a razor box or the shape of a combbag the skin of the fingers is the shape of a keybox the skin of the neck is the shape of a throatcollar the skin of the face is the shape of a caterpillars nest full of holes the skin of the head is the shape of a bowlbagHe defines it by direction as  found in both directionsand by location as  enveloping the whole physical frametill he comes back again to the skin of the upper lipa prey to doubt and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from arisen doubtWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhanaWith the fading away as well of rapturehe enters upon and abides in the third jhanaWith the abandoning of pleasure and painhe enters upon and abides in the fourth jhanaThe Blessed One praised that kind of meditationso above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in the Eastern Park in the Palace of Migaras MotherThen the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him When this courteous and amiable talk was finishedAnd also among accountants like us who earn our living by accountancy there can be seen gradual trainingthat is in computationFor when we get an apprentice first we make him count one one two twos three threes four fours five fives six sixes seven sevens eight eights nine nines ten tens and we make him count a hundred tooNow is it also possible Master Gotama to describe gradual training gradual practice and gradual progress in this Dhamma and DisciplineIt is possible brahmin to describe gradual training gradual practice and gradual progress in this Dhamma and DisciplineJust as brahmin when a clever horsetrainer obtains a fine thoroughbred colt he first makes him get used to wearing the bit and afterwards trains him further so when the Tathagata obtains a person to be tamed he first disciplines him thus Come bhikkhu be virtuous restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha be perfect in conduct and resort and seeing fear in the slightest fault train by undertaking the training preceptsWhen brahmin the bhikkhu is virtuousand seeing fear in the slightest fault trains by undertaking the training precepts then the Tathagata disciplines him further Come bhikkhu guard the doors of your sense facultiesOn seeing a form with the eye do not grasp at its signs and features Since if you were to leave the eye faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade you practise the way of its restraint guard the eye faculty undertake the restraint of the eye facultyOn hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongueOn touching a tangible with the bodyOn cognizing a mindobject with the mind do not grasp at its signs and featuresSince if you were to leave the mind faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states might invade you practise the way of its restraint guard the mind faculty undertake the restraint of the mind facultyWhen brahmin the bhikkhu guards the doors of his sense faculties then the Tathagata disciplines him further Come bhikkhu be moderate in eatingReflecting wisely you should take food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness but only for the endurance and continuance of this body for ending discomfort and for assisting the holy life considering Thus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfortWhen brahmin the bhikkhu is moderate in eating then the Tathagata disciplines him further Come bhikkhu be devoted to wakefulness During the day while walking back and forth and sitting purify your mind of obstructive states In the first watch of the night while walking back and forth and sitting purify your mind of obstructive states In the middle watch of the night you should lie down on the right side in fhe lions pose with one foot overlapping the other mindful and fully aware after noting in your mind the time for rising After rising in the third watch of the night while walking back and forth and sitting purify your mind of obstructive statesWhen brahmin the bhikkhu is devoted to wakefulness then the Tathagata disciplines him further Come bhikkhu be possessed of mindfulness and full awareness Act in full awareness when going forward and returning act in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away act in full awareness when flexing and extending your limbs act in full awareness when wearing your robes and carrying your outer robe and bowl act in full awareness when eating drinking consuming food and tasting act in full awareness when defecating and urinating act in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silentWhen brahmin the bhikkhu possesses mindfulness and full awareness then the Tathagata disciplines him further Come bhikkhu resort to a secluded resting place the forest the root of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle thicket an open space a heap of strawHe resorts to a secluded resting place the foresta heap of strawOn returning from his almsround after his meal he sits down folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before himAbandoning covetousness for the world he abides with a mind free from covetousness he purifies his mind from covetousness Abandoning ill will and hatred he abides with a mind free from ill will compassionate for the welfare of all living beings he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred Abandoning sloth and torpor he abides free from sloth and torpor percipient of light mindful and fully aware he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor Abandoning restlessness and remorse he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse Abandoning doubt he abides having gone beyond doubt unperplexed about wholesome states he purifies his mind from doubtHaving thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentrationWith the fading away as well of rapture he abides w equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindfulWith the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThis is my instruction brahmin to those bhikkhus who are in the higher training whose minds have not yet attained the goal who abide aspiring to the supreme security from bondageBut these things conduce both to a pleasant abiding here and now and to mindfulness and full awareness for those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledgeWhen this was said the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana asked the Blessed One When Master Gotamas disciples are thus advised and instructed by him do they all attain Nibbana the ultimate goal or do some not attain itWhen brahmin they are thus advised and instructed by me some of my disciples attain Nibbana the ultimate goal and some do not attain itMaster Gotama since Nibbana exists and the path leading to Nibbana exists and Master Gotama is present as the guide what is the cause and reason why when Master Gotamas disciples are thus advised and instructed by him some of them attain Nibbana the ultimate goal and some do not attain itAs to that brahmin I will ask you a question in returnAnswer it as you chooseWhat do you think brahmin Are you familiar with the road leading to RajagahaYes Master Gotama I am familiar with the road leading to RajagahaWhat do you think brahmin Suppose a man came who wanted to go to Rajagahaand he approached you and said Venerable sir I want to go to Rajagaha Show me the road to RajagahaThen you told him Now good man this road goes to RajagahaFollow it for awhile and you will see a certain village go a little further and you will see a certain town go a little further and you will see Rajagaha with its lovely parks groves meadows and pondsThen having been thus advised and instructed by you he would take a wrong road and would go to the westThen a second man came who wanted to go to RajagahaThen you told him Now good man this road goes to RajagahaFollow it for a whileand you will see Rajagaha with its lovely parks groves meadows and pondsThen having been thus advised and instructed by you he would arrive safely in RajagahaNow brahmin since Rajagaha exists and the path leading to Rajagaha exists and you are present as the guide what is the cause and reason why when those men have been thus advised and instructed by you one man takes a wrong road and goes to the west and one arrives safely in RajagahaWhat can I do about that Master GotamaI am one who shows the waySo too brahmin Nibbana exists and the path leading to Nibbana exists and I am present as the guide Yet when my disciples have been thus advised and instructed by me some of them attain Nibbana the ultimate goal and some do not attain itWhat can I do about that brahminThe Tathagata is one who shows the wayWhen this was said the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana said to the Blessed One  There are persons who are faithless and have gone forth from the home life into homelessness not out of faith but seeking a livelihood who are fraudulent deceitful treacherous haughty hollow personally vain roughtongued loosespoken unguarded in their sense faculties immoderate in eating undevoted to wakefulness unconcerned with recluseship not greatly respectful of training luxurious careless leaders in backsliding neglectful of seclusion lazy wanting in energy unmindful not fully aware unconcentrated with straying minds devoid of wisdom drivellers Master Gotama does not dwell together with theseBut there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness who are not fraudulent deceitful treacherous haughty hollow personally vain roughtongued and loosespoken who are guarded in their sense faculties moderate in eating devoted to wakefulness concerned with recluseship greatly respectful of training not luxurious or careless who are keen to avoid backsliding leaders in seclusion energetic resolute established in mindfulness fully aware concentrated with unified minds possessing wisdom not drivellers Master Gotama dwells together with theseJust as black orris root is reckoned as the best of root perfumes and red sandalwood is reckoned as the best of wood perfumes and jasmine is reckoned as the best of flower perfumes so too Master Gotamas advice is supreme among the teachings of todayMaster Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overturned revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsLet Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifefor herein the flesh of the calves is the shape of cooked rice in a palmleaf bagsome say  the shape of an unopened ketaki bud  some say it is the shape of a nuhi  leaf the flesh of the nose is the shape of a bag made of a rolled leaf and put upsidedown the flesh of the eyesocket is the shape of a halffig the flesh of the head is the shape of a thin smearing of oil on the vessel of the bowl when it is being baked  And when the meditator is discerning flesh only these gross pieces of flesh need be defined by shapefor when he defines them thus the subtle pieces of flesh come within the horizon of his knowledge tooand by location as  plastered over the three hundred and odd bonesbut onlyA carcase daubed with bits of meat Nine times a hundred when complete Where swarming clans of worms compete To share the rotting midden for their seatand by shape as  variously shapedand similarly with the left hand and with the right and left feet so these sixty great sinews are the  physicalframe supporters frame guiders  for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personNine hundred sinews all around In this fathomlong carcase foundWhereby its bony frame is bound As creepers serve a building to compound THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodhas ParkNow on that occasion a new assembly hall had recently been built for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it had not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or human being at allThen the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went to the Blessed One After paying homage to him they sat down at one sideand said to him Venerable sir a new assembly hall has recently been built here for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it has not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or human being at allVenerable sir let the Blessed One be the first to use itWhen the Blessed One has used it first then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu will use it afterwardsThat will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long timeThe Blessed One consented in silenceThen when they saw that he had consented they got up from their seats and after paying homage to him keeping him on their right they went to the assembly hall They covered it completely with coverings and prepared seats and they put out a large water jug and hung up an oillampThen they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they stood at one sideand said Venerable sir the assembly hall has been covered completely with coverings and seats have been prepared a large water jug has been put out and an oillamp hung upNow is the time for the Blessed One to do as he thinks fitThen the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the assembly hall When he arrived he washed his feet and then entered the hall and sat down by the central pillar facing the eastAnd the bhikkhus washed their feet and then entered the hall and sat down by the western wall facing the east with the Blessed One before themAnd the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu washed their feet and entered the hall and sat down by the eastern wall facing the west with the Blessed One before themThen when the Blessed One had instructed urged roused and encouraged the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu with talk on the Dhamma for much of the night he said to the venerable Ananda Ananda speak to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training who has entered upon the wayMy back is uncomfortable I will rest itYes venerable sir the venerable Ananda repliedThen the Blessed One prepared his patchwork cloak folded in four and lay down on his right side in the lions pose with one foot overlapping the other mindful and fully aware after noting in his mind the time for risingThen the venerable Ananda addressed Mahanama the Sakyan thus Mahanama here a noble disciple is possessed of virtue guards the doors of his sense faculties is moderate in eating and devoted to wakefulness he possesses seven good qualities and he is one who obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and nowAnd how is a noble disciple possessed of virtueHere a noble disciple is virtuous he dwells restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha he is perfect in conduct and resort and seeing fear in the slightest fault he trains by undertaking the training preceptsThis is how a noble disciple is possessed of virtueAnd how does a noble disciple guard the doors of his sense facultiesOn seeing a form with the eye a noble disciple does not grasp at its signs and featuresSince if he left the eye faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he practises the way of its restraint he guards the eye faculty he undertakes the restraint of the eye facultyOn hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongueOn touching a tangible with the bodyon cognizing a mindobject with the mind a noble disciple does not grasp at its signs and featuresSince if he left the mind faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he practises the way of its restraint he guards the mind faculty he undertakes the restraint of the mind facultyThat is how a noble disciple guards the doors of his sense facultiesAnd how is a noble disciple moderate in eatingHere reflecting wisely a noble disciple takes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness but only for the endurance and continuance of this body for ending discomfort and for assisting the holy life consideringThus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfortAnd how is a noble disciple devoted to wakefulnessHere during the day while walking back and forth and sitting a noble disciple purifies his mind of obstructive states In the first watch of the night while walking back and forth and sitting he purifies his mind of obstructive states In the middle watch of the night he lies down on the right side in the lions pose with one foot overlapping the other mindful and fully aware after noting in his mind the time for rising After rising in the third watch of the night while walking back and forth and sitting he purifies his mind of obstructive statesThat is how a noble disciple is devoted to wakefulnessAnd how does a noble disciple possess seven good qualitiesHere a noble disciple has faith he places his faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment thus The Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedHe has shame he is ashamed of misconduct in body speech and mind ashamed of engaging in evil unwholesome deedsHe has fear of wrongdoing he is afraid of misconduct in body speech and mind afraid of engaging in evil unwholesome deedsSuch teachings as are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure  such teachings as these he has learned much of remembered recited verbally investigated with the mind and penetrated well by viewHe is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking wholesome states he is steadfast firm in striving not remiss in developing wholesome statesHe has mindfulness he possesses the highest mindfulness and skill he recalls and recollects what was done long ago and spoken long agoHe is wise he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of sufferingThat is how a noble disciple possesses seven good qualitiesAnd how is a noble disciple one who obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and nowHere quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a noble disciple enters upon and abides in the first jhana With the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhanaWith the fading away as well of rapturehe enters upon and abides in the third jhana With the abandoning of pleasure and pain he enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThat is how a noble disciple is one who obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and nowWhen a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of virtue who guards the doors of his sense faculties who is moderate in eating who is devoted to wakefulness who possesses seven good qualities who obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now he is called one in higher training who has entered upon the way His eggs are unspoiled he is capable of breaking out capable of enlightenment capable of attaining the supreme security from bondageSuppose there were a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs which she had covered incubated and nurtured properly Even though she did not wish Oh that my chicks might pierce their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatch out safely  yet the chicks are capable of piercing their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatching out safelySo too when a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of virtuehe is called one in higher training who has entered upon the way His eggs are unspoiled he is capable of breaking out capable of enlightenment capable of attaining the supreme security from bondageHaving arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity this noble disciple recollects his manifold past livesThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives This is his first breaking out like that of the hens chicks from their shellsHaving arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human this noble disciple sees beings passing away and reappearinghe understands how beings pass on according to their actions This is his second breaking out like that of the hens chicks from their shellsHaving arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is due to equanimity by realising for himself with direct knowledge this noble disciple here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints This is his third breaking out like that of the hens chicks from their shellsWhen a noble disciple is possessed of virtue that is his conduct When he guards the doors of his sense faculties that is his conduct When he is moderate in eating that is his conduct When he is devoted to wakefulness that is his conduct When he possesses seven good qualities that is his conductWhen he is one who obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now that is his conductWhen he recollects his manifold past liveswith their aspects and particulars that is his true knowledge When with the divine eyehe sees beings passing away and reappearing and understands how beings pass on according to their actions that is his true knowledgeWhen by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints that is his true knowledgeThis noble disciple is thus said to be perfect in true knowledge perfect in conduct perfect in true knowledge and conductAnd this stanza was uttered by the Brahma SanankumaraThe noble clan is held to be The best of people as to lineageThen the Blessed One rose and addressed the venerable Ananda thus Good good Ananda It is good that you have spoken to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training who has entered upon the wayThat is what the venerable Ananda saidThe Teacher approvedThe Sakyans of Kapilavatthu were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Anandas wordsThat is how a noble disciple is moderate in eatingHe has learned much remembers what he has learned and consolidates what he has learnedBut best of gods and humans is one Perfect in true knowledge and conductNow that stanza was well sung by the Brahma Sanankumara not illsung it was well spoken not illspoken it has a meaning and is not meaningless and it was approved by the Blessed Onehe sat down at one sideand said to the Blessed OneMaster Gotama in this Palace of Migaras Mother there can be seen gradual training gradual practice and gradual progress that is down to the last step of the staircase Among these brahmins too there can be seen gradual training gradual practice and gradual progress that is in study Among archers too there can be seen gradual

Bonebag in bonebag conceivedwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines bones by colour and the restthat is to say that found inside the biggest bones is the shape of large caneshoots boiled twisted together in bambootube segments   that found inside the lesser and minor bones is the shape of appropriatesized caneshoots boiled twisted together in lesser and minor bambootube segments He defines it by shape as  the shape of its own locationHe defines it by direction as  found in both directions and by location as  established inside the boneswhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines bonemarrow by colour and the restand by location as lying on either side of the heartflesh being fastened by a stout sinew that starts out with one root from the base of the neck and divides into two after going a short wayHe defines it by direction as  found in the upper direction and by location as  lying in the middle between the two breasts inside the physical framewhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines heart by colour and the restand by location as  lying near the right side inside from the two breastsby direction as  found in both directions and by location as  concealed midriff lying surrounding the heart and kidney and unconcealed midriff lying covering the flesh under the skin in the whole physical framenor do the heart and kidney and the flesh under the skin in the whole physical frame know We are wrapped in a midrifffor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personby direction as  found in the upper direction and by location as lying near the upper side of the bellylining on the left of the heart and when it comes out through a wound a creatures life is terminatedwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines spleen by colour and the restand it is insipid inside and lacks nutritiveessence like a lump of chewed straw because it is affected by the heat of the fire element born of past action which springs up when there is nothing eaten and drunkand by location as  lying inside the physical frame between the two breasts overhanging and covering the heart and fiverwhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines fights by colour and the restHe defines it by shape as  the shape of a ratsnake  with its head cut off and put coiled up in a trough of blood and by location as  fastened above to the gullet and below to the excrement passage  and so lying inside the physical frame between the limits of the gullet and the excrement passageby shape as  the shape of those roots some say they are gomutta  shaped by direction as  found in the two directions and by location as  lying inside the twentyone loops of the bowel like the strings that he inside the roperings of a footwiper sewing them together and fastening the bowelloops together so that they do not slip down in those working with hoes axes etc as the marionettestrings do the marionettes wooden limbs at the time of the marionettes being pulled alongwhich is the delimitation by the similiar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is the same as that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines entrail by colour and the restby shape as  the shape of rice loosely tied in a cloth strainer by direction as  found in the upper direction and by location as  lying in the stomachHe defines it by delimitation as  gorge delimited by what is similar to gorgeso too the gorge does not know  I am lying in this utterly stinking loathesome stomach  nor does the stomach know  Gorge lies in meby shape as  the shape of its location  by direction as  found in the lower direction  and by location as  lying in the receptacle for digested food for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personAnd herein just as a lump of doughor curdled milkings  put into an old gourd dish does not know  I am in an old gourd dish  nor does the old gourd dish know A lump of dough  or curdled milkings is in me  so too the brain does not know  I am inside a skull  nor does the skull know  A brain is inside meand by location as  what is classed as the four pieces of brain lying inside the skull like four lumps of dough put together to correspond with the skulks four seamsby direction as  lying in the upper direction by shape as  the shape of its location some say it is the colour of curdled milkings  He defines by location the free bile as  lying spread over the physical frame like a drop of oil on water except for the fleshfree parts of the headhairs bodyhairs teeth nails and the hard dry skin which kind of bile when upset yellows the eyes and makes them roll and makes the limbs shiver and itch and he defines the local bile as  situated near the livers flesh between the heart and fights and lying inside the bilecontainer  which resembles a red kosdtaki pip which kind of bile when disturbed maddens creatures and drives them crazy and makes them throw aside conscience and shame and do what ought not to be done say what ought not to be said and think what ought not to be thoughtand by direction as c found in both directionsby shape as  the shape of its location ome say the free bile is the colour of withered akuli  flowersand just as rainwater in a loofahgourd pip does not know  I am in a loofahgourd pip  nor does the loofahgourd pip know  Rainwater is in me  so too the local bile does not know  I am in a gallbladder  nor does the gallbladder know  Local bile is in me by shape as the shape of its receptacle by direction as found in the upper direction and by location as  lying on the stomachs surfaceand then the regurgitations and the mouth reek with such a rottingordurelike stench coming up from the stomach that the man has to be told Go away your breath stinks But when it is abundant it holds down the reek of ordure beneath the stomachs surface acting like the wooden lid of a privythe shape of its locationby direction as  found in both directionsand by location as  pus without fixed location lying wherever it may gatherwhere blood stagnates and goes bad in some part of the physical frame damaged by wounds made by stumps thorns burns with fire etc or where boils carbuncles etc appear there it liesHe defines it by shape as  the shape of its own locationby direction as  stored blood found in the upper direction and mobile blood in both directionswhile the stored blood fills the lower part of the livers site measuring a single bowlful and by its splashing little by little over the heart kidney and lights it keeps the kidney heart liver and lights moist since it is when it fails to moisten the kidney heart etc that creatures become thirstyby shape as  the shape of its locationby direction as  found in the two directions and by location as  sweat without fixed location where it could always he like bloodbut when the physical frame is heated by the heat of a fire by the suns heat by a change of temperature etc then it trickles from all the poreopenings of the headhairs and bodyhairs as water does from a bunch of unevenly cut lilyhud stems and lotus stalks just pulled up from the waterand so he defines it as  shaped in accordance with the poreopenings of the headhairs and bodyhairsand it is said by the Former Teachers that  The meditator who is discerning sweat should give attention to sweat only as present in virtue of its filling the poreopenings of the head hairs and bodyhairs for these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they are not a personand by shape as  the shape of its locationfor in the case of one who is happy and has a stout physical frame it extends over the interval between the skin and the flesh and is the shape of dukula rags dyed in turmeric while in the case of one with a lean physical frame it is the shape of scraps of dukula rags dyed in turmeric placed as wrapping on the shank flesh thigh flesh back flesh backbone and bellycovering flesh and by location as  extending over the whole physical frame in one with a stout physical frame and found on the shank flesh etc in one with a lean physical frame And even though it is described as  unguent  still it is neither used as oil for the head nor as oil to be taken by mouth  nor as lamp fuel because of its utter disgustingnessfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personHe defines them by delimitation as  tears delimited by what is similar to tearsby shape as  the shape of their locationby direction as  found in the upper direction and by location as  lying in the eyesocketsby shape as  the shape of its location by direction as  found in the two directions and by location as  lying on the palms of the hands backs of the hands soles of the feet backs of the feet tip of the nose forehead and points of the shoulderswhich is the delimitation by the similar but the delimitation by the dissimilar is like that of the headhairs and so on This is how he defines grease by colour and the restby shape as the shape of its locationsome say it is the shape of sea frothby direction as  found in the upper direction and by location as  lying on the tongue after it has descended from the cheeks on both sidesor when their hearts are faint or when nausea arises on some account then spittle appears and runs down from the cheeks on both sides to settle on the tongueby shape as  the shape of its locationsome say it is the shape of a boiled caneshoot inserted unbroken into the nostril cavityby direction as  found in the upper direction and by location as  lying filling the nostril cavitiesfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they arenot a personand by location as  lying inside the hundred and eighty joints serving the function of lubricating the bones jointsby direction as  found in both directions by shape as the shape of its locationby colour as the colour of kanikara gumNext to that he defines oilofthejoints which is the slimy ordure in the interior of the joints inside the physical frameby shape as the shape of water inside a waterpot placed upsidedownby direction as found in the lower directionand by location as lying inside the bladderfor these are ideas destitute of mutual concern and reviewing they are  not a personHow does he do thator else by increasing the mindfulness obtained in that sign he is said to  maintain it in beinghe next gives attention to nails not to teethand so in each instancefor just as when a man goes on a journey and travels very quickly he is unable to take note of such signs as even and uneven places trees hills valleys and roadforks and thereby remains unskilled in the path when his journey is ended so too when the meditator gives attention too quickly he is unable to take note of the signs of the meditation subject consisting in the colour shape etc and thereby remains unskilled in the thirtytwofold aspect when his meditation subject is endedfor just as while a man is travelling on a journey if he loiters on the way among trees rocks pools etc then instead of reaching the place he wants to reach he reaches ruin and disaster through lions tigers etc while still on the way so too when the meditator gives attention too slowly then instead of reaching completion of the maintenance of the thirtytwofold aspect in being he reaches ruin and disaster through thoughts of sensual desires etc which interrupt the maintenance of the meditation subject in beingthat when people see by day a fibre or a thread the colour of a headhair fallen into their drink or food they throw away even appetising drink or food or are nauseated by them through perception of them as headhairs They are so loathesome as to shape as well They are so loathesome as to odouras well that the odour of headhairs lacking anointing with oil and preparations of flowers scents and the like is quite nauseating and when creatures smell the odour of a headhair put in a flame they stop their noses and make a wry face They are so loathesome as to habitat They are so loathesome as to location as wellthat growing as they do on the utterly disgusting heap of the thirtyone remaining kinds of ordure beginning with the bodyhairs and in the moist inner skin that envelops human beings heads they resemble herbs etc on a middenwhich is the method of insight in his caseand then  he gives attention by way of the Three Suttas on the three general characteristics of impermanence suffering and notselfThe turn has now come for a comment on the Lovingkindness Sutta which is placed next to the TreasureStore SuttaSo after stating the purpose of placing it hereHerein excellence of merit consisting in giving virtue etc was what was stated in the TreasureStore Sutta and this Lovingkindness Sutta is placed here next to that in order to show how helpful lovingkindness is to that excellence of merit since when lovingkindness is practised towards creatures that excellence of merit becomes very fruitful and capable of bringing advancement right up to the plane of Enlightenment Or alternatively for those who have entered upon the Dispensation by means of the Refuges and have established themselves in virtue by means of the Training Precepts he has already shown a meditation subject with the Thirty two Aspects that is capable of causing the abandonment of lust and a meditation subject with the Boys Questions that is capable of causing the abandonment of delusion and then with the Good Omen Sutta selfprotection is shown as the goodomenness in the occurrence of that abandoning and with the Jewel Sutta protection of others that conforms with that goodomenness and then with the WithouttheWalls Sutta is shown failure in the occurrence of that abandoning of the kind already mentioned and that discourse points out certain kinds of beings among the beings already mentioned in the Jewel Sutta and then with the TreasureStore Sutta is shown the excellence that is the opposite of the failure already mentioned in the WithouttheWalls Sutta But so far no meditation subject has been shown that is capable of causing the abandonment of hate and so it was in order to show a meditation subject capable of causing abandonment of hate that this Lovingkindness Sutta was placed herefor in this way the Minor Readings are brought to full completion This is the purpose of placing it herewhich illustrates as well By whom twas spoken when where whynext I shall set out to clarify Its Source And then a comment I shall tellNow it was said in the Schedule aboveHerein this Lovingkindness Sutta was spoken by the Blessed One not by disciples etc and that was when bhikkhus who had been harassed by deities on the slopes of the Himalayas had gone to the Blessed Ones presence and it was uttered then at Savatthi as a meditation subject with the purpose of providing a Safeguard for those bhikkhus That it should be understood in brief to start with is how the clarification of the source illustrates those questionsBut in detail it should be understood as follows On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi when the time for the taking up of the Residence for the Rains  was near at hand Now on that occasion many bhikkhus from various countries who were desirous of taking up residence for the rains in various places after taking a meditation subject in the Blessed Ones presence had approached the Blessed Onewhich illustrates as well By whom twas spoken when where why I shall set out to clarify Its Source And then a comment I shall tellIt being placed here thus here is a schedule of the commentary on its meaningHow the Discourse was included in the Tipitaka   Herein firstly the halfstanza  By whom twas spoken when wherefore Are matters that should first be told  refers to the introductory paragraph Thus I heard On one occasion the Blessed One  he addressed him in  verses thusFor this is expressed in the manner of having been heard by someone but the Blessed One on the contrary was selfbecome without a teacher consequently that much is not the word of the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedThat is why it has to be asked By whom were these words spoken When and why were they spokenIt can be stated that they were spoken by the venerable Ananda and that that was at the time of the First Great Rehearsal Now to begin with the First Great Rehearsal as it is called has to be understood in order to gain skill in dealing with the Sources of all SuttasIt was in the early hours of the Visakha Fullmoon Day that the Blessed One  the Helper of the world attained final extinction with the element of extinction without residue of clinging left That event took place between the twin said trees in the Mallians said tree grove at the turn into Kusinara after he had been doing an Enlightened Ones work from the time beginning with his turning the Wheel of the True Idea down to his disciplining the Wanderer Subhadda   Now the venerable Maha Kassapa was the senior Elder of the community of  bhikkhus who had foregathered for the Blessed Ones final extinction He remembered how seven days after the Blessed Ones extinction the other Subhadda who had gone forth into homelessness in old age  had said  Enough friends do not sorrow do not lament we are well rid of that Great Monk We have been obstructed by his saying  This is allowed to you this is not allowed to you now however we shall do what we want and shall not do what we do not want    He therefore considered as follows It is possible that bad bhikkhus conceiving this to be a doctrine with a defunct teacher may create factions and soon make the True Object of Faith disappearBut as long as the True Idea and Discipline last this is no doctrine with a defunct teacherfor the Blessed One said Ananda the True Idea and Discipline that I have shown and described to you will be your teacher after I am gone  Now suppose I had the True Idea and Discipline rehearsed so that this Dispensation might become viable and longlastingfor I by the Blessed Onewas helped when he shared the use of robes with me and asked me  Kassapa will you wear my castoff hempen refuserag clothing  Bhikkhus whenever I wish then quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from unprofitable ideas I enter upon and abide in the first jhana which is accompanied by thinking and exploring with happiness and pleasure born of seclusion and Kassapa too whenever he wishes then quite secluded from sensual desires enters upon and abides in the first jhana pleasure born of seclusion  and when he placed me on the same level as himself in the matter of the morethanhumanideas consisting in the nine successive abidings and the six directknowledges  in the way beginning  How else indeed can that be recompensedAnd did not the Blessed One also help me with the help unshared by any other in giving this warning  This one will be my heritagefounder in the True Idea   just as a Wheelturning Monarch does by the bestowal of his own armour and sovereignty  So he got the bhikkhus to take interest in the rehearsal of the True Idea and Disciplineaccording as it is said Then the venerable Maha Kassapa addressed the bhikkhus thus  Friends on one occasion journeying on the road from Pava to Kusinara with a large community of bhikkhus with as many as five hundred bhikkhus  the whole of which account in the Subhadda Chapter should be cited in fullAfter that he said Friends let us rehearse the True Idea and Discipline before wrong ideas and wrong discipline are courted and right ideas and right discipline are flouted before upholders of wrong ideas and wrong discipline become strong and upholders of right ideas and right discipline become weak  The bhikkhus said  Then venerable sir let the Elder convoke an assembly of bhikkhus Passing over many hundred many thousand bhikkhus who were ordinary men Streamenterers Onceretumers Nonreturners and Bareinsightworker  Arahant bhikkhus with taints exhausted all of whom were bearers of the Scriptures consisting of the whole of the Teachers ninefactored  Dispensation the Elder summoned one less than five hundred bhikkhus with taints exhausted who were bearers of all the classes of Scripture in the Tipitaka who had reached the Discriminations who were very mighty being many of them included by the Blessed One in the Foremostinthis Discourse  and who were possessors of the three True Knowledges and so onBut why did the Elder make it one less than five hundredIn order to give an opportunity to the Elder AnandaNow the rehearsal could neither be held with nor without that venerable one for he was only an Initiate with a task still to be done and so it could not be held with himBut since there was nothing taught by Him of the Ten Powers among the Threads of Argument  Songs  etc that the venerable Ananda had not learned in that Blessed Ones presence it could therefore not be held without himIn order then to avoid others criticism to the effect that  If that is so then he should have been included by the Elder in the convocation because of his helpfulness to the rehearsal of the True Idea even if he is only an Initiate and so why was he not included in the convocation the Elder being in fact much exercised about the venerable Anandahad exhorted him with the  Boy Admonition  though there were white hairs growing on his head saying  And still this boy does not know his measureBut on the other hand the venerable Ananda had been born into a Sakyan clan as the son of the Perfect Ones uncle  and bhikkhus might have conceived his inclusion as a slight and criticised it thus  The Elder has passed over many bhikkhus who have attained the Adepts Discriminations and has included in the convocation Ananda who has only attained the Initiates Discriminations So in order to forestall such criticism by others he provisionally left him out of his convocation thinking  Though the rehearsal cannot be held without him I shall act only in accordance with the opinion of the bhikkhus Then the bhikkhus themselves asked the Elder on Anandas behalf according The bhikkhus said to the venerable Maha Kassapa  Venerable sir there is the venerable AnandaThough he is only an Initiate still he is incapable of going to an unhappy destination through desire anger delusion or fear He has mastered in the Blessed Ones presence much of the True Idea and Discipline of wide variety Let the Elder include the venerable Ananda in his convocation too So the venerable Maha Kassapa included the venerable Ananda in his convocation  When he had been included in the convocation thus in accordance with the bhikkhus opinion there were then five hundred Elders together with that venerable one Then the elder bhikkhus thought  Where shall we do the rehearsing of the True Idea and Discipline Then the elder bhikkhus thought  Rajagaha is a big resort with plenty of accommodation Suppose we spend the coming Rains in Rajagaha and rehearse the True Idea and Discipline there and suppose no other bhikkhus take up residence for these Rains in Rajagaha   But why did they think thusThey thought  This is our work of consolidation Some dissenting person might enter into the midst of the Community and create discord How the venerable Maha Kassapa then instituted proceedings for an act involving Enactment Second Upon the ResolutionWhen seven days had passed by in ceremonies after the Perfect Ones final extinction and seven more days in paying homage to the relics the Elder Maha Kassapa observed  Half a month has gone by It is now the last monthandahalf of the Hot Season and the Taking Up Residence for the Rains is approaching  and saying  Let us go to Rajagaha friends  he took one road with a part of the Community of Bhikkhuswhile the Elder Anuruddha took another road to Rajagaha with a part of the Community of Bhikkhus  The venerable Ananda wanted to take the Blessed Ones bowl and robes to Savatthi with a community of bhikkhus and then go on to RajagahaWherever the venerable Ananda went there was great lamentation  You have come venerable Ananda but where have you left the TeacherWhen the Elder eventually arrived at Savatthi there was as much lamenting as at the time of the Blessed Ones final extinctionThereupon the venerable Ananda instructed the multitude with discourse on the True Idea in relation to impermanence after which he entered Jetas Wood  He opened the door of the Scented Cell where He of the Ten Powers had lived Then he took out the bed and chair dusted them swept out the Scented Cell threw away the stale flowers and returned the bed and chair to their usual places in fact he performed all the duties that used to be done in the time of the Blessed Ones presenceNow with overmuch standing and sitting since the Blessed Ones final extinction the Elders body suffered a disturbance of the elements and in order to cure it he drank a milk purge on the following day and remained seated in the monasteryIt was on this account that he told the student sent by the student Subha  It is not the time student today I have drunk a medicine Perhaps we may come tomorrow  On the following day he went with the Elder Cetaka as his attendant monk and on being questioned by the student Subha he delivered the tenth Sutta in the Long Collection called the Subha SuttaThe Elder then had what was broken and dilapidated repaired in Jetas Wood after which he went to Rajagaha for the approaching Taking Up Residence for the RainsAnd the Elder Maha Kassapa and the Elder Anuruddha went likewise with all the Community of Bhikkhus to RajagahaAt that time there were eighteen principal monasteries in RajagahaWhen the elders arrived there they thought  Let us during the first month have what is broken and dilapidated repaired both in order to do honour to the Blessed Ones word and in order to escape the criticism of sectarians of other religions And this is saidThey went next day to wait at the kings portalsKing Ajatasattu came and paid homage to them and he invited them to tell their needs  What do I do venerable sirs What is necessaryThe Elders made it known that labour was needed for the repair of the eighteen principal monasteries Good venerable sirs  the king replied and he provided men for the labourDuring the first month the Elders had all the monasteries repairedThen they told the king  Great king the repair of the monasteries is finished Now we shall do the collating of the True Idea and Discipline   Good venerable sirs You do well Let mine be the Wheel of Commands and yours be the Wheel of the True IdeaCommand then venerable sirs what do I make Great king a meeting place for the bhikkhus who do the collating Where do I make it venerable sirs Great king it would be well to have it made at the door of the Sattapanni Cave on the slopes of the Vebhara Rock Good venerable sirs  king Ajatasattu replied and he had a great pavilion constructed such as might have been created by Vissakamma  with wellbuilt walls and pillars and stairs with many kinds of garlandwork and creeperwork decoration and having a vault ornamented with a profusion of pendent festoons of many sorts of flowers like a jewelled brocade bedecked with gems He had it adorned with a wellfinished pavementwork embellished with representations of many sorts of flowerofferings like that of a High Divinitys mansion and in the great pavilion itself he had five hundred priceless but allowable rugs prepared for the five hundred bhikkhus The Elders seat he had prepared against the south side facing north and as a seat for the announcing of the True Idea a seat worthy of the Enlightened One the Blessed One in the centre of the pavilion facing east and there he had an ivory inlaid fan placed Then he had it announced to the Community of Bhikkhus  Venerable sirs my work is finished The bhikkhus told Ananda  Friend the meeting is tomorrow but you are still only an Initiate with a task still to be done It is not well for you to go to the meeting thus Be diligent Then the venerable Ananda thought  The meeting is tomorrow It is not seemly for me to go to the meeting as an Initiate  He spent much of the night in contemplation of the body When the night was near dawn he came down from the walk and entered his dwelling thinking  I shall lie down  He adverted to the bodyAs he did so his two feet had left the ground but his head had not yet reached the pillow In that interval his cognizance was liberated from taints through not clingingIn fact when this venerable one found he was unable to produce any distinction by spending the time outside on the walk he thought Did not the Blessed One say  You have made much merit Ananda pursue your endeavour and you will soon be free from taints  And the Buddhas word is infallible Now my energy is overexerted and so my cognizance tends to agitation I shall therefore see to balancing my energy  So he came down from the walk and standing in the footwashing place he washed his feet Then he entered the dwelling and thinking  I shall sit on the bed and rest a little he extended his body on the bedIn his doing so his two feet had left the floor though his head had not yet reached the pillow In that interval his cognizance was liberated from taints through not clingingthe Elder attained Arahantship without any of the four posturesHence if it can be said that  In this Dispensation a bhikkhu has reached Arahantship while not lying down not sitting not standing and not walking  it is right to say it of the venerable AnandaNext day after the elder bhikkhus had finished their meal they put away their bowls and outer robes and they met together in the assemblyhall for the rehearsal of the True IdeaBut the Elder Ananda did not go with the bhikkhus because he wanted to make his attainment of Arahantship knownThe bhikkhus sat down each in his own seat by seniority and every seat except the Elder Anandas was occupiedWhen it was asked  Whose seat is that  the reply was  It is Anandas  And that was the occasion when the Elder thought  Now it is time for me to goWhen he was seated thus the Elder Maha Kassapa addressed the bhikkhus  Friends which shall we rehearse first the True Idea or the DisciplineThe bhikkhus replied  Venerable Kassapa the Discipline is called the life of the Enlightened Ones Dispensation As long as the Discipline lasts the Dispensation will last Therefore let us first rehearse the Discipline   Whose task shall it be made  The venerable UpalisHaving done that they took their seats in order of seniority on the seat for announcing the True IdeaThe Elder Maha Kassapa interrogated the Elder Upali on the whole Discipline making the first Defeat the beginning The Elder Upali answeredAll the five hundred bhikkhus made a group recitation together taking the first Defeat along with its SourceSo too with the rest All of this too should be taken as it is given in the Vinaya CommentaryWhen they had recited in this way the whole Vinaya Pitaka including the two Suttavibhangas the Khandhakas  and the Parivara  the Elder Upali put down the ivoryinlaid fan and descending from the seat for announcing the True Idea he paid homage to the senior bhikkhus and sat down in his own seatAfter the rehearsing of the Discipline was done the Elder Maha Kassapa wished to rehearse the True Idea and so he asked the bhikkhus  What person is given the task of rehearsing the True Idea by those who are to rehearse the True IdeaThe bhikkhus replied  The Elder Ananda should be given the task Then the Elder Maha Kassapa placed a resolution before the Community as follows Friends let the Community hear me if it seems proper to the Community I shall interrogate the venerable Ananda on the True IdeaThen the venerable Ananda rose from his seat and after arranging his robe on one shoulder and paying homage to the Elder bhikkhus he sat down on the seat for announcing the True Idea and took up the ivoryinlaid fanThe Elder Maha Kassapa interrogated the Elder Ananda on the True Idea the manner of which interrogation is given in the text too according as it is said  Then the venerable Maha Kassapa said to the venerable Ananda  Friend Ananda where was the Brahmajala Sutta deliveredOn whose account On account of the wanderer Suppiya and the sudent Brahmadatta   Then when the venerable Maha Kassapa had interrogated the venerable Ananda about the source of the Brahmajala and about the person by whom it was delivered he asked   With king Ajatasattu Vedehiputta venerable sirThen when the venerable Maha Kassapa had interrogated the venerable Ananda about the source of the Samannaphala and about the person by whom it was deliveredThis First Rehearsal  held as it was by five hundred Arahants is the one which in the world wasDuring the process of the First Rehearsal the venerable Maha Kassapa interrogated the venerable Ananda on the whole of the Long Collection  the Middlelength Collection  and the rest  Eventually during the interrogation on the Minor Collection  he came at the end of the interrogation beginning thus  Friend Ananda where was the GoodOmen Discourse delivered  to interrogate him about the source and about the person by whom it was delivered So after giving the details of the source when interrogated about it the venerable Ananda next desired to tell all about how it was delivered by whom heard when heard by whom delivered where delivered and to whom delivered And in order to show that it was delivered thus heard by me heard on an occasion delivered by the Blessed One delivered at Savatthi and delivered to a deity  he said  Thus I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Wood Anathapindikas Park A certain deity then in the nights last extreme  the extreme of whose brilliance set the whole of J etas Wood aglow approached the Blessed One and after showing respect to him stood at one side and that being done the deity addressed the Blessed One in verses thusThat is how it should be understood that this came to be  spoken by the venerable Ananda and that was at the time of the First Great Rehearsal  Now as to the question  Wherefore was it spoken  it can be said It was spoken because the venerable Ananda had been interrogated about the source by the Elder Maha KassapaOr else it was because when certain deities saw the venerable Ananda sitting in the seat for announcing the True Idea surrounded by a group of those who had attained mastery in it the thought arose in them  This venerable one the Videhan Seer is the Blessed Ones natural heir as a scion of the Sakyan clans and he was five times signalized in the Foremostinthis Discourse and possesses the Four Wonderful and Marvellous Ideas that make him dear and precious to the four kinds of assembly  so surely after inheriting the kingdom of the Blessed Ones True Idea he has become an Enlightened OneKnowing with his mind the thoughts in those deities minds he did not connive at such misattribution to him of nonexistent special qualities Consequently in order to show his own discipleship he said Thus I heard On one occasion the Blessed One addressed  in verses thusMeanwhile the five hundred Arahants and many thousand deities applauded the venerable Ananda saying  Good good  while there was a great earthtremor with a rain of various kinds of flowers falling from the sky and many other manifested marvels and in many deities a sense of urgency arose with the thought  What we heard in the Blessed Ones presence is now reproduced in his absence tooSo it can be understood that this was said for this reason as well by the venerable Ananda when he spoke at the First Great RehearsalAt this point the meaning of the halfstanza in the Schedule namely  By whom twas spoken when wherefore Are matters that should first be told has been explainedBy whom twas spoken when wherefore Are matters that should first be toldA varied comment then we unfold On the word  thus  and some words moreTo give their sense before we tell The Suttas origin as wellDefining the Omen as we go We show lastly how that is sowith reference to which fact it is said  Then the venerable Maha Kassapa convoked an assembly of one less than five hundred Arahants  as it is saidis told in the Rehearsal Chapter of the Cullavagga in the Vinaya Pitakawhich were all forsaken dilapidated and dirtyfor with the Blessed Ones final extinction all the bhikkhus had taken their bowls and outer robes and forsaken their monasteries and cells to go to Kusinarathat sectarians might say  The monk Gotamas disciples cared for the monasteries only while the Teacher was present but after his final extinction they forsook themfor what is meant by the words  They thought in order to escape the criticism  of those is in fact  Then the elder bhikkhus considered  The repair of what is broken and dilapidated was commended by the Blessed One So friends let us during the first month see to the repair of what is broken and dilapidated In the middle month let us meet together and rehearse the True Idea and Discipline     Where has Ananda goneand showing his might he dived into the earth and then showed himself sitting in his own seatThen the Elder Maha Kassapa obtained authority for himself to interrogate about the Disciplineand the Elder Upali obtained authority to answer the interrogationthen the venerable Ananda placed a resolution before the Community as follows Venerable sirs let the Community hear me if it seems proper to the Community I being interrogated on the True Idea by the venerable Maha Kassapa shall answer    Between Rajagaha and Nalanda venerable sir in the Kings RestHouse at AmbalatthikaFriend Ananda where was the Samannaphala SuttaAt Rajagaha venerable sir in Jlvakas Mango WoodWith whomhe proceeded in this way to interrogate him on the contents of the five Collections  and the venerable Ananda answered each time he was questionedThe  Council of Five Hundred  called Because five hundred had it doneAnd  Council of the Elders  called Because the Elders had it doneNow in order to explain the meaning included by that part of the Schedule beginning thus  A varied comment then we unfold On the word  thus  and some words more it may be said as follows  This word evam should be regarded as having the several meanings of simile giving directions praise reproof acceptance of a statement mode demonstration memorizing  and so onFor it is met with as a simile in such passages as Much profitable action can by one thus mortal born be done as giving directions in such passages as You should move forward thus and move backward thus as praise in such passages as  So it is Blessed One so it is Sublime One  as reproof in such passages as  This is the way that this miserable woman speaks praise of that shaveling monk at every opportunity  as acceptance of a statement in such passages as   Even so   venerable sir  the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One  as a mode in such passages as  Precisely thus  venerable sir do I understand the True Idea to be taught by the Blessed One as demonstration in such passages as  Come student go to the monk Ananda and ask in my name whether the monk Ananda is free from affliction free from ailment and is healthy strong and living in comfortThe student Subha Todeyyaputta asks whether the monk Ananda is living in comfort  And say thus   It would be good if Master Ananda came to the house of the student Subha Todeyyaputta out of compassion   in such passages as  How do you conceive this Kalamans are these ideas profitable or unprofitableUnprofitable venerable sirBlameworthy venerable sirCondemned by the wise venerable sir Venerable sir being undertaken and put into effect they lead to harm and suffering that is how it appears to us in this case    as memorizing Here it should be regarded as mode as demonstration and as memorizingHerein in the sense of mode he illustrates the meaning by the word thus as follows Who is there capable of cognizing in all its modes that Blessed Ones word which is that of one expert in many methods originated by the several sorts of inclination perfect in the meaning and the letter possessing the various marvels  profound in teaching and penetrating ideas and meanings suitable to all creatures each in his own speech as soon as it comes to their ears However thus I heardthere is one mode in which it was heard by meIn the sense of demonstration he points out by excluding himself the following meaning thus I am not selfbecome this has not been first realized by me and he also demonstrates the whole Sutta now to be related when he says Thus I heardby me it was heard thusIn the sense of memorizing he points out the following meaning By showing his own power of remembering such that it was commended by the Blessed One thus  Bhikkhus foremost among the bhikkhus my disciples who are well versed is Ananda  who are mindful who are well conducted  who are courageous who are attendants is Ananda  he stimulates creatures desire to hear in this way Thus I heard that should be regarded thus only and not otherwise neither less nor more as to the meaning and the letterNow the word me in the phrase evam me sutam   thus I heard  or  thus me heard  is met with in three sensesFor in such passages as  What has been earned by stanzas is uneatable by me  the meaning is in the instrumental case by me  in such passages as  It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the True Idea in brief  the meaning is in the dative case  to me  and in such passages as  Bhikkhus be my heirs in the True Idea  the meaning is in the genitive case  of me my  Here however the two meanings  by me heard  and  my heard experience  namely the instrumental and genitive are appropriateAs to the word sutam  this word suta with and without prefixes is classifiable under numerous meanings namely going celebrated overcome by lust  heaped up devotion to cognizable by the ear cognized in the eardoor and so onFor in such passages as  Proceeding with an army  the meaning is going In such passages as  Of one who sees the famous True Idea  the meaning is of the celebrated True IdeaIn such passages as  people  invaded by lust gave to the bhikkhus invaded by lust  the meaning is for one overcome by lust In such passages as  And how great merit can be stored away by you  the meaning is heaped up In such passages as  Those steadfast ones intent on jhana  the meaning is devoted to jhanaIn such passages as  Seen heard  sensed  the meaning is cognizable by the ear In such passages as  He remembers what he has heard  stores up what he has heard  the meaning is one who bears in mind what is cognized in the eardoor But here the meaning of sutam is properly  what has been recorded by a given series of consciousnesses  ushered in by earconsciousness  or it is the  act of recording Herein when the meaning of the word me is taken as the instrumental  by me  then the construction is Thus by me heard recorded by a series of consciousnesses ushered in by earconsciousnessWhen the meaning of the word me is taken as the genitive my then the construction is Thus is my heard experience act of recording by a series of consciousnesses ushered in by ear consciousnessSo as regards these words evam is the demonstration of consciousnesss function as earconsciousness etcSimilarly evam demonstrates that the kinds of cognizance beginning with hearing have actually occurred in the various ways with respect to an objectSimilarly evam demonstrates something about to be demonstratedsutam demonstrates consciousnesss functionSimilarly evam demonstrates a stateHerein the words evam and me are in the true sense and ultimate sense a description in terms of the non factual while sutam is an appositional description because it that is the heard is so called in apposition to the seen and the restHere too by the word evam he points out nonconfusion and by the word sutam nonforgetting of what was heardSimilarly by the word evam he points out reasoned attention because when someone gives unreasoned attention penetration of difference in kind is absent in himAnd by  reasoned attention  he establishes the pair of Blessings namely Right Selfdirection and Previouslyperformed Merit while by  nondistraction  he establishes the other pair of Blessings  namely Hearing the True Idea and Waiting on True Men  By this auspicious mode expressed by the term evam he shows his own excellence in the second pair of auspicious Blessings and by this occupation with hearing  expressed by the term sutam he shows his own excellence in the first pair of auspicious BlessingsSimilarly with the former there is established purity of ends also and with the latter purity of means And with the purity of the ends there is established particular distinction  in the  scribing and with the purity of the material particular distinction in the  scriptureAlso by the word evam  which shows penetration of difference in kind he shows his own excellence in the Discriminations of Meaning and PerspicuityAlso in uttering the word evam  which shows reasoned attention he makes it known that  These ideas have been looked over by the mind and properly penetrated by right view by me In uttering the word sutam  which shows his occupation with hearing he makes it known that  Many ideas have been heard remembered consolidated by word In showing by both words the completeness of the meaning and the letter he inspires reverence in hearingWith the whole phrase evam me sutam the venerable Ananda passes beyond the plane of those who are not true Men by his not usurping for his own the True Idea penetrated by the Perfect One and he alights upon the plane of True Men by acknowledging his discipleshipSimilarly he has his cognizance emerge from what is not the True Idea and establishes it upon the True Idea In showing that  All this is only heard by me but it is the word of the Blessed One himself    accomplished and fully enlightened  he effaces himself and bears witness to the Master he fixes  the Victors words and establishes the True Idea as the guideFurthermore when disclaiming with the whole phrase evam me sutam his own invention This was acquired by me in the very presence of that Blessed One possessor of the four kinds of Intrepid ity bearer of the Ten Powers occupier of the Herdleaders Place roarer of the Lions Roar  Highest of All Creatures Lord of the True Idea King of the True Idea Sovereign of the True Idea Island of the True Idea Refuge of the True Idea Wheelturner of the True Object of Faith Fully and completely Enlightenedso here there need be no hesitation or doubt about meanings or ideas or phrases or syllables and disclosing that he had previously heard it he annihilates all gods and human beings lack of faith in this Idea and instils excellence of faith in them in this way And here is an appropriate stanzaOn the remaining words in the Source  On one shows delimitation by numberOccasion shows what is so delimitedOn one occasion shows indefinitenessHerein the word samaya For in such passages as  Perhaps we may come tomorrow depending on the time and the occasion  the meaning is event In such passages as  Bhikkhus there is only one moment and occasion for living the Divine Life  it is moment In such an expression as  occasion of heat occasion of fever  it is time In such passages as  The great concourse on the mountain side  it is a mass In such passages as  Bhaddali you did not penetrate the circumstance that  The Blessed One is living at Savatthi and the Blessed One will come to know me thus  The bhikkhu called Bhaddali is one who does not carry out the training in the Teachers Dispensation   This circumstance was not penetrated by you  it is a cause In such passages as Now on that occasion the Wanderer Samanama ndikaputta was staying in Mallikas Singlehall Tindukatree plantation Park for Debating Opinions  it is a view In such passages as  There is welfare that is here and now And welfare in the lives to comeA man is reckoned wise if he Is skilful to attain welfare  it is obtainment In such passages as  With complete attainment of understanding of conceit  he has made an end of suffering  it is abandonment In such passages as  Sufferings meaning of oppression meaning of being determined meaning of torment meaning of change is its meaning of attainment abhisamaya  it is penetration Here however its meaning is timeHence with the words ekam samayam what is meant is one occasion among the occasions counted as year season month halfmonth nightandday morning noon evening first watch middle watch last watch hour and so onOr else what is meant is among the Blessed Ones several times specially evident to gods and men and counted as Occasions such as the Occasion of the Conception in the Womb Occasion of the Birth Occasion of the Sense of Urgency Occasion of the Renunciation Occasion of the Austerities Occasion of the Conquest of Mara Occasion of the Enlightenment Occasion of the Pleasant Abiding Here and Now Occasion of the Teaching Occasion of the Final ExtinctionHere it may be asked Then why is the accusative case ekam samayam one occasion  used here instead of the locative case as is done in the Abhidhamma namely  yasmim samaye kamavacaram  and in Sutta passages other than this namely  and instead of the instrumental case as is done in the Vinaya  namely  Tena samayena Budddho Bhagava  It may be said that the meaning implied here is different from what it is in those passagesFor there that is in the Abhidhamma passage and in the Sutta passages other than this firstly the locative conveys the meaning of container  and the meaning of characterization of one substantive by another substantiveNow the  container  is the time counted as occasion and the mass counted as occasion being the  container  of the ideas beginning with contact stated there in the first paragraph of the Dhammasangani  and also the substantive essence of those ideas is characterized by the substantive essence of the type of moment event and rootcause called their  occasion   So the locative case is used there in order to illustrate that meaningThen in the Vinaya the instrumental case implies the meaning of cause and the meaning of reason for an actFor it was difficult for Sariputta and the others to get to know the occasion of the announcement of a training precept and so when the Blessed One announced training precepts he did so on a particular that is convenient occasion that was thus the cause and the reason for his so acting and he stayed in such and such places having regard to that as the cause for the announcing of training precepts So the instrumental case is used there in order to illustrate that meaningHere however and in other such Sutta passages as this the meaning implied is that of direct governanceFor the Blessed One lived that occasion with an abiding of direct compassion when he preached this or any other SuttaSo it can be understood that the accusative case is used here in order to illustrate that meaningAnd here is an appropriate stanzaOccasion is expressed elsewhere But here Tis done by the accusativeaccording as it is saidNow names are of four kinds denoting a period of fife  denoting a particular mark denoting a particular sign and fortuitously arisenHerein a name  denoting a period of life  is one such as  yearlingcalf    steertobetrained    yoke ox   That  denoting a particular mark is one such as  staffbearer    parasolbearer    topknot wearer    handpossessor  That  denoting a particular sign  is one such as  possessorofthethree trueknowledges    possessorofthesixdirectknowledges   The  fortuitouslyarisen  is one such as Sirivaddhaka  or Dhanavaddhaka  for it has nothing to do with the meanings of the wordsThis name  Blessed  is one denoting a particular sign namely certain special qualities it is not made by Queen Mahamaya or by King Suddhodana or by the eighty thousand kinsmen or by such distinguished deities as Sakka Santusita and so onaccording as the Elder Sariputta said    Blessed this is not a name made by a motherThis name  Blessed   is a realistic description of the Enlightened Ones Enlightenment Tree  Now in order to explain also the special qualities of which this name is a particular sign they cite the following stanzaThe meaning of this should be understood in the way given in the Niddesa But there is this other wayHerein by using the Characteristic of Language namely  augmentation of syllables alteration and elision of syllables   or by using the Characteristic of Insertion according to the  Pisodara etc  grammatical method it may be known that he can be called  blessed  when he can be called  fortunate  owing to his having the fortunateness that has reached the further shore of the ocean of the Perfections of Giving Virtue etc  which generate mundane and supramundane pleasureSimilarly he can also be called  blessed  when he can be called  possessed of abolishment  owing to the following flaws having been abolished For he has abolished all the hundred thousand kinds of trouble fever and defilement classed as lust as hate as delusion and as mistaken attention as consciencelessness and shamelessness as anger and revenge as contempt and domineering as envy and avarice as deceit and fraud as obduracy and presumption as conceit and pride as vanity and negligence and as craving and ignorance as the three roots of the unprofitable kinds of misconduct defilements stains fictitious perceptions thoughts and diversifications as the four perversenesses taints ties floods bonds bad ways cravings and clingings as the five wildernesses in the heart shackles in the heart hindrances and kinds of relishing as the six roots of discord and bodies of craving as the seven underlying tendencies as the eight worldly ideas as the nine ideas rooted in craving as the ten courses of unprofitable action as the sixtytwo kinds of wrong views as the hundred and eight ways of behaviour of craving   or erroneous perceptions  those connected with lust hate and delusion   thoughts those of sensual desire ill will and cruelty  in brief the five Maras that is the Maras of defilement of the categories and of determinative acts Mara as Mortality and Mara as the son of a godAnd in this context it can be saidAnd by his possession of fortunateness is shown the excellence of his formbody which bears a hundred characteristics of merit and by his abolishment of defects is shown the excellence of his TrueIdeabodyLikewise by the former is shown the esteem of the worldly and by the latter that of those who resemble him And by the former it is shown how he is fit to be relied on  by laymen and by the latter how he is fit to be relied on by those gone forth into homelessnessand how when the former have thus relied on him they become strong in the removal of bodily and mental pain and how when the latter are helped with his gifts of material sustenance and of the True IdeaHe is also called  Blessed  since he is  associated with blessings   such as those of the following kinds in the sense that he  has these blessings   Now in the world outside the Dispensation the word  blessing  is used for six ideas namely sovereignty ideal fame splendour desire and vocation He has supreme sovereignty over his own cognizance either of the kind reckoned as mundane and consisting in minuteness lightness etc  or that complete in all aspects and likewise the supramundane Ideal And he has the exceedingly pure fame spread throughout the three worlds which he acquired through real special qualities And he has splendour of all limbs perfect in every aspect which is capable of inspiring confidence in the eyes and minds of people eager to see his formbody And he has his desire in other words the production of what is wanted since whatever is wanted and needed by him as beneficial to himself or to others is then and there produced for him And he has right effort called vocation which is the reason why he has gained the veneration of the whole worldHe can also be called  blessed  when he can be called a  possessor of what has been analysed   owing to his having analysed all ideas into the three classes of the profitable unprofitable and undeclared or the profitable etc ideas into such classes as the categories bases elements truths faculties dependent arising etc or the Noble Truth of Suffering into the four meanings of oppressing being determined tormenting and changing and that of its Origin into the four meanings of accumulating source bond and impediment and that of its Cessation into the four meanings of escape seclusion being undetermined and deathless and that of the Path into the four meanings of outlet rootcause seeing and predominant organization  Having analysed and revealed and shown them is what is meantHe can also be called  blessed  when he can be called one who  has frequented  owing to his having frequented  cultivated developed such mundane and supra mundane higherthanhuman ideas as the heavenly the divine and the noble abidings  as bodily seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion from the essentials of existence  as the void the desire less and the signless liberations and others as wellHe can also be called  blessed  when he can be called  one who has rejected going in the kinds of being  because the craving for called  going  to  the three kinds of being has been rejected by him And the syllables bha from the word bhava and ga from the word gamana and va from the vanta with the letter a lengthened make the word bhagava just as is done in the world of grammarians outside the Dispensation with the word mekhala since MEhanassa KHAssa mdLA can be saidUp to this point with the words  thus I heard  he has revealed for direct experience the Blessed Ones TrueIdeaBody by showing it according as he had heard it He thereby comforts people who are disappointed at not seeing the Blessed One and assures them  This is no doctrine with a defunct teacher this is your Teacher Then in showing with the phrase  one occasion the Blessed One  that the Blessed One was nevertheless on that occasion no longer factual he points out the final extinction of the FormBodyHence by evoking the thought  Even that Blessed One the Teacher of this Noble True Idea the Bearer of the Ten Powers whose body resembled a diamond cluster eventually attained final extinction so how can anyone else build hopes of lasting life on this formbody he instils a sense of urgency in people intoxicated with the vanity of life and he stirs them to enthusiasm for the True IdeaAnd by his saying  thus  he demonstrates the excellence of the teaching by his saying  I heard  the excellence of the dis cipleship by his saying  on one occasion  the excellence of the time and by his saying  the Blessed One  the excellence of the TeacherWas living at Savatthi  here Savatthi is the city  that had been the dwellingplace of the Seer Savattha and so  Savatthi  is said with change to the feminine gender just as with Kakandi and Makandi so the etymologists who go by letters have itBut the Teachers of the Commentary say  Whatever is of use and profit to man is all here  that is why it is called SavatthiAnd when caravans meet and it is asked  What goods are there there  then on account of the invariable reply  There is everything   it is called Savatthi Now every sort of merchandise They always trade at SavatthiGrown to fullness its people are Successful prosperous fair withalBut here it signifies occupation with one or other of the postures among those classed as standing walking sitting and lying down So it can be understood that the Blessed One was so abiding either when standing or walking or seated or lying downFor by terminating the discomfort of one posture by replacing it with one of the others he carried his selfhood on made it proceed onwards without letting it fallIn Jetas Wood  he vanquishes people who are his own enemies thus he is a Victor  Or alternatively when the people who were his own and the kings enemies were vanquished  he was born  thus he was Victor  Or alternatively he was so named out of desire that his name should be one to bring him good omens thus he was Victor It is what one would  thus it is a wood  it creates fondness in creatures for its own excellence the meaning is that it arouses affection in them towards itself Or alternatively it would  thus it is a wood  the meaning is that with cries of cuckoos and other airborne creatures intoxicated by the profusion of scents and fragrance of many sorts of flowers and with its canopy  of tree branches fruits and verdant foliage swaying in the gentle breeze it is as it were begging all creatures to  Come and enjoy me  Jeta Wood  is the wood of Jeta Anathapindikas Park  this householder was named Sudatta as to the name given to him by his parents But because all his desires had been granted and because he was devoid of avarice or stain and endowed with the special qualities of compassion and the rest he constantly gave food to the helpless  and so he came to be known as Anathapindika Here breathing things take delight take pleasure  or especially those gone forth into homelessness take delight take pleasure thus it is a  park   the meaning is that because of the beauty of its flowers fruits and foliage etc in the first case and because of its excellence in the five factors of the bhikkhus restingplace  being neither too far from the alms resort nor too near to it etc in the second case they come from wherever it might be and delight in it take delight in it and abide there undisappointedOr alternatively because of its excellence of the kind already stated it draws back again and delights within its confines those who had gone out to wherever it might be thus it is a  park  The householder Anathapindika had purchased it from the hands of Prince Jeta by spreading  kotis of gold pieces over it and had had restingplaces built in it for an outlay of a further  kotis of gold pieces and had had an inaugural ceremony prepared costing a further  kotis of gold pieces making thus a total outlay of  kotis of gold pieces after which he assigned it to the Community headed by the Enlightened One That is why it was called  Anathapindikas Park  In that Anathapindikas ParkThe words  in Jetas Wood  commemorate the former owner while the words  Anathapindikas Park  commemorate the latter ownerBut what is the purpose of commemorating themIt can be said that it is done as a service first as a definitive answer to the question  Where was it delivered  and second as an exhortation to others who desire to make merit similarly to give effect to right viewFor in the building of the gatehouse mansion the  kotis of gold pieces received from the sale of the land and also trees worth many kotis were Jetas outlay while Anathapindikas was  kotisConsequently by his commemorating these two the venerable Ananda showed how those who desired to make merit did so and thereby he exhorted others desirous of making merit similarly to give effect to right viewThat is how it should be understood that the purpose of the commemoration here was to exhort those who desire merit similarly to give effect to right viewIt may be objected If the Blessed One was living at Savatthi firstly then  in Jetas Wood Anathapindikas Park  cannot be saidFor the word  Savatthi  is mentioned in order to denote his alms resort town and the other words are mentioned in order to denote a suitable dwellingplace for one gone forth into homelessnessHerein by commemorating Savatthi the venerable Ananda points out the Blessed Ones compassion for the laity and by commemorating Jetas Wood his compassion for those gone forthLikewise by the first he points out the Blessed Ones avoidance of pursuit of selfmortification and his acceptance of the four requisite conditions for the bhikkhus fife namely robes alms food lodging and medicine and by the second he points out his avoidance of pursuit of indulgence in sensual pleasures in his abandoning of objective sensual desiresAnd by the first he points out the Blessed Ones occupation with preaching the True Idea and by the second his resoluteness upon seclusionThen is in the sense of noninterruption kho is a particle in the sense of indicating a new subject matterBy its means he points out that while the Blessed Ones living there Savatthi remained uninterrupted a new subjectmatter had arisenWhat is that A certain deity  and so onHerein a certain is an indefinite demonstrativeA Deity is a god  and the noun of feminine gender is common to both the male and female sexHere however this was a male being a gods son but he is called a  deity  because that word is common to both sexesIn the nights last extreme  now the word abhikkanta is met with as exhaustion lunar quarterday  good handsome agreement and so onHerein in such passages as  Venerable sir the night is nearing its last extreme  the first watch is ending the Community of bhikkhus has been sitting long Venerable sir let the Blessed One recite the Rule to the bhikkhus  it is exhaustion In such passages as  This is the most outstanding and superior of those four persons  it is good In such passages as  Who at my feet pays homage here Shining with renowned successSo that his loveliness extreme Lights up each quarter bright and clear it is handsome In such passages as  Magnificent  Master Gotama magnificent  Master Gotama it is agreement Here it is in the sense of exhaustionhence  in the nights last extreme  means c when the night was becoming exhaustedHerein in such passages as  Blessed One thou art goldcomplexioned  it is skin In such passages as  When did you concoct that hymn of praise to the monk Gotama householder it is eulogy In such passages as  There are these four castes  Master Gotama  it is a group of clans In such passages as  Then by what token can one tell A man to be a thief of scents it is a reason In such passages as  Having created the appearance of a huge royal elephant  it is shape In such passages as  The three sizes for a bowl  it is measure In such passages as  Colour  odour flavour nutritiveessence  it is the visibleform base Here it should be understood as skin Consequently  the extreme of whose brilliance  means the beauty of whose skin For in such passages as  A Divine Life as utterly perfect and pure  the meaning is remainderlessness In such passages as  The whole of Anga and Magadha will come bringing quantities of food  it is the most part In such passages as  There is an origin to this whole category of suffering  it is unmixedness In such passages as  Surely it is only by mere faith that this venerable one  it is with nothing extra In such passages as  This coresident of the venerable Anuruddhas named Bahika has taken his stand entirely for the schism in the Community  it is firmness In such passages as  One who has reached the absolute lived out the life is called the Supreme Man  it is dissociation Here however the meaning intended is remainderlessnessThen the word kappa has also many meanings such as exercise of faith lawfulness time description cutting interpretation fraction  surroundings and so onFor in such passages as  That must be believed as a statement of Master Gotamas since he is accomplished and fully enlightened  the meaning is exercise of faith In such passages as  Bhikkhus I allow fruits to be eaten in accordance with the five kinds of permissibility for the monk  it is lawfulness In such passages as  In which I constantly abide  it is time In such passages as  So the venerable Kappa  it is a description ie a proper nameIn such passages as  Adorned with hair and beard trimmed  it is cutting In such passages as  The twofingerbreadths allowance is permissible  it is interpretation In such passages as  There is a while for lying down  it is fraction In such passages as  Set the whole of the Bamboo Wood aglow  it is the surroundings Here however the meaning of surroundings is intendedConsequently the whole Jetas Wood should be regarded as meaning Jetas Wood together with its surroundings without remainderSetaglow  pervaded with radiace like the full moon and like the sun the meaning is  made all into one glow all into one illumination Approached the Blessed One  The instrumental case of the words yenatena  has the sense of the locative caseconsequently the meaning to be understood here is  Where the Blessed One was there he approached Also the meaning here can be regarded causatively as follows  For what reason the Blessed One may be approached by gods and men for that very reason he approached And for what reason may the Blessed One be approachedWith intent to find the distinction of many special qualities just as a great constantlyfruiting tree may be approached by avian flocks with intent to make use of the wholesome fruit Approached  means  gone to And   this indicates the termination of the approachingAfter showing respect to him  after paying homage to saluting venerating the Blessed OneAt one side  this is a neuter adverbial form what is meant is  one place one flank Or else it is accusative in the locative senseStood  this denies sitting and the rest the meaning is that he took his stand was standingBut in what way did he stand that he is said to have  stood at one side Not behind and not before Nor too near nor farBut why did he only stand and not sit downOut of desire to get away quicklyFor when deities come for any purpose to the human world they do so like a man of clean habits coming to a privyIn fact the human world is naturally repulsive to them even at a hundred leagues distance owing to its stench and they find no delight in it So this deity refrained from sitting down since he wanted to get away quickly as soon as he had done what he came to doAnd also deities have none of the fatigue latent in the postures of walking etc in order to dispel which human beings sit down so that too is why he did not sit downFurthermore he did not sit down out of reverence for the Blessed One himselfAnd so standing means that deity who was standing at one side for these reasons in this wayThe deity addressed the Blessed One in verses thus the meaning is that he addressed the Blessed One with speech governed by rules of prosody in its syllables and feetHowBy saying Gods and men there are full many Speculating on good omens Which they hope will bring them safety Tell then the supreme good omenTHUS HAVE I HEARDOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Mango Grove of Jivaka KomarabhaccaThen Jivaka Komarabhacca went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideVenerable sir do those who speak thus say what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from their assertionsJivaka those who speak thus do not say what has been said by me but misrepresent me with whatis untrue and contrary to factI say that there are three instances in which meat may be eatenwhen it is not seen not heard and not suspected that the living being has been slaughtered for the bhikkhu I say that meat may be eaten in these three instancesHere Jivaka some bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain village or townHe abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourthThen a householder or a householders son comes to him and invites him for the next days mealThe bhikkhu accepts if he likesWhen the night is ended in the morning he dresses and taking his bowl and outer robe goes to the house of that householder or householders son and sits down on a seat made readyThen the householder or householders son serves him with good almsfoodHe does not think How good that the householder or householders son serves me with good almsfoodIf only a householder or householders son might serve me with such good almsfood in the future  He does not think thusHe eats that almsfood without being tied to it infatuated with it and utterly committed to it seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape from itWhat do you think Jivaka Would that bhikkhu on such an occasion choose for his own affliction or for anothers affliction or for the affliction of both No venerable sir Does not that bhikkhu sustain himself with blameless food on that occasionYes venerable sirI have heard this venerable sir Brahma abides in lovingkindnessVenerable sir the Blessed One is my visible witness to that

grief on being led along with a neckhalter this is the second instance in which he lays up much demeritWhen he says Go and slaughter that living being this is the third instance in which he lays up

venerable sirFrom today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeAnyone who slaughters a living being for the Tathagata or his disciple lays up much demerit in these five instancesTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Nalanda in Pavarikas Mango GroveNow on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta was staying at Nalanda with a large assembly of NiganthasThen when the Nigantha named Digha Tapassi had wandered for alms in Nalanda and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to Pavarikas Mango Grove to see the Blessed OneHe exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he stood at one sideAs he stood there the Blessed One said to him There are seats Tapassi sit down if you likeWhen this was said Digha Tapassi took a low seat and sat down at one sideThen the Blessed One asked him Tapassi how many kinds of action does the Nigantha Nataputta describe for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil actionFriend Gotama the Nigantha Nataputta is not accustomed to use the description action action the Nigantha Nataputta is accustomed to use the description rod rodThen Tapassi how many kinds of rod does the Nigantha Nataputta describe for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil actionFriend Gotama the Nigantha Nataputta describes three kinds of rod for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action that is the bodily rod the verbal rod and the mental rodHow then Tapassi is the bodily rod one the verbal rod another and the mental rod still anotherThe bodily rod is one friend Gotama the verbal rod is another and the mental rod is still anotherOf these three kinds of rod Tapassi thus analysed and distinguished which kind of rod does the Nigantha Nataputta describe as the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action the bodily rod or the verbal rod or the mental rodOf these three kinds of rod friend Gotama thus analysed and distinguished the Nigantha Nataputta describes the bodily rod as the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rodDo you say the bodily rod TapassiI say the bodily rod friend GotamaDo you say the bodily rod TapassiI say the bodily rod friend GotamaDo you say the bodily rod TapassiI say the bodily rod friend GotamaThus the Blessed One made the Nigantha Digha Tapassi maintain his statement up to the third timeThen the Nigantha Digha Tapassi asked the Blessed One And you friend Gotama how many kinds of rod do you describe for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil actionTapassi the Tathagata is not accustomed to use the description rod rod the Tathagata is accustomed to use the descriptionaction actionBut friend Gotama how many kinds of action do you describe for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil actionTapassi I describe three kinds of action for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action that is bodily action verbal action and mental actionHow then friend Gotama is bodily action one verbal action another and mental action still anotherBodily action is one Tapassi verbal action is another and mental action is still anotherOf these three kinds of action friend Gotama thus analysed and distinguished which kind of action do you describe as the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action bodily action or verbal action or mental actionOf these three kinds of action Tapassi thus analysed and distinguished I describe mental action as the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action and not so much bodily action and verbal actionDo you say mental action friend GotamaI say mental action TapassiDo you say mental action friend GotamaI say mental action TapassiDo you say mental action friend GotamaI say mental action TapassiThus the Nigantha Digha Tapassi made the Blessed One maintain his statement up to the third time after which he rose from his seat and went to the Nigantha NataputtaNow on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta was seated together with a very large assembly of laymen from Balaka most prominent among them being UpaliThe Nigantha Nataputta saw the Nigantha Digha Tapassi coming in the distance and asked him Now where are you coming from in the middle of the day TapassiI am coming from the presence of the recluse Gotama venerable sirDid you have some conversation with the recluse Gotama TapassiI had some conversation with the recluse Gotama venerable sirWhat was your conversation with him like TapassiThen the Nigantha Digha Tapassi related to the Nigantha Nataputta his entire conversation with the Blessed OneWhen this was said the Nigantha Nataputta told him Good good TapassiThe Nigantha Digha Tapassi has answered the recluse Gotama like a welltaught disciple who understands his teachers dispensation rightlyWhat does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison with the gross bodily rodOn the contrary the bodily rod is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rodWhen this was said the householder Upali said to the Nigantha Nataputta Good good venerable sir on the part of Digha TapassiThe venerable Tapassi has answered the recluse Gotama like a welltaught disciple who understands his teachers dispensation rightlyWhat does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison with the gross bodily rodOn the contrary the bodily rod is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rodNow venerable sir I shall go and refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine on the basis of this statementIf the recluse Gotama maintains before me what the venerable Digha Tapassi made him maintain then just as a strong man might seize a longhaired ram by the hair and drag him to and drag him fro and drag him round about so in debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round aboutJust as a strong brewers workman might throw a big brewers sieve into a deep water tank and taking it by the corners might drag it to and drag it fro and drag it round about so in debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round aboutJust as a strong brewers mixer might take a strainer by the corners and shake it down and shake it up and thump it about so in debate I will shake the recluse Gotama down and shake him up and thump him aboutAnd just as a sixtyyearold elephant might plunge into a deep pond and enjoy playing the game of hempwashing so I shall enjoy playing the game of hempwashing with the recluse GotamaVenerable sir I shall go and refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine on the basis of this statementGo householder and refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine on the basis of this statementFor either I should refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you yourselfWhen this was said the Nigantha Digha Tapassi said to the Nigantha Nataputta Venerable sir I do not think that the householder Upali should try to refute the recluse Gotamas doctrineFor the recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he converts disciples of other sectariansIt is impossible Tapassi it cannot happen that the householder Upali should go over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaGo householder and refute the recluse Gotamas doctrineFor either I should refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you yourselfFor the second timeFor the third time the Nigantha Digha Tapassi said to the Nigantha Nataputta Venerable sir I do not think that the householder Upali should try to refute the recluse Gotamas doctrineFor the recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he converts disciples of other sectariansIt is impossible Tapassi it cannot happen that the householder Upali should go over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaGo householder and refute the recluse Gotamas doctrineFor either I should refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you yourselfYes venerable sir the householder Upali replied and he rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Nigantha Nataputta keeping him on his right he left to go to the Blessed One in Pavarikas Mango GroveThere after paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One Venerable sir did the Nigantha Digha Tapassi come hereThe Nigantha Digha Tapassi came here householderVenerable sir did you have some conversation with himI had some conversation with him householderWhat was your conversation with him like venerable sirThen the Blessed One related to the householder Upali his entire conversation with the Nigantha Digha TapassiWhen this was said the householder Upali said to the Blessed One Good good venerable sir on the part of TapassiThe Nigantha Digha Tapassi has answered the Blessed One like a welltaught disciple who understands his teachers dispensation rightlyWhat does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison with the gross bodily rodOn the contrary the bodily rod is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rodHouseholder if you will debate on the basis of truth we might have some conversation about thisI will debate on the basis of truth venerable sir so let us have some conversation about thisWhat do you think householder Here some Nigantha might be afflicted suffering and gravely ill with an needing treatment by cold water which his vows prohibit and he might refuse cold water though mentally longing for it and use only the permissible hot water thus keeping his vows bodily and verballyBecause he does not get cold water he might dieNow householder where would the Nigantha Nataputta describe his rebirth as taking placeVenerable sir there are gods called mindbound he would be reborn thereWhy is thatBecause when he died he was still bound by attachment in the mindHouseholder householder pay attention how you replyYet you made this statement I will debate on the basis of truth venerable sir so let us have some conversation about thisVenerable sir although the Blessed One has spoken thus yet the bodily rod is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action for the perpetration of evil action and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rodWhat do you think householder Here some Nigantha might be restrained with four checks  curbed by all curbs clamped by all curbs cleansed by all curbs and claimed by all curbs and yet when going forward and returning he brings about the destruction of many small living beingsWhat result does the Nigantha Nataputta describe for himVenerable sir the Nigantha Nataputta does not describe what is not willed as greatly reprehensibleBut if one wills it householderThen it is greatly reprehensible venerable sirBut under which of the three rods does the Nigantha Nataputta describe willing householderUnder the mental rod venerable sirHouseholder householder pay attention how you replyWhat you said before does not agree with what you said afterwards nor does what you said afterwards

householder Is this town of Nalanda successful and prosperous is it populous and crowded with peopleYes venerable sir it isWhat do you think householder Suppose a man came here brandishing a swordand spoke thus In one moment in one instant I will make all the living beings in this town of Nalanda into one mass of flesh into one heap of flesh What do you think householder would that man be able to do thatVenerable sir ten twenty thirty forty or even fifty men would not be able to make all the living beings in this town of Nalanda into one mass of flesh into one heap of flesh in one moment or instantWhat do you think householder Suppose some recluse or brahmin came here possessed of supernormal power and attained to mastery of mindand he spoke thus I will reduce this town of Nalanda to ashes with one mental act of hateWhat do you think householder would such a recluse or brahmin be able to do thatVenerable sir such a recluse or brahmin possessed of supernormal power and attained to mastery of mind would be able to reduce ten twenty thirty forty or even fifty Nalandas to ashes with one mental act of hateHouseholder householder pay attention how you replyWhat you said before does

have some conversation about thisVenerable sir I was satisfied and pleased by the Blessed Ones very first simileNevertheless I thought I would oppose the Blessed One thus since I desired to hear the Blessed Ones varied solutions to the problemMagnificent venerable sir Magnificent venerable sirThe Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsLet the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeInvestigate thoroughly householder It is good for such wellknown people like you to investigate thoroughlyVenerable sir I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for telling me thatBut on the contrary the Blessed One tells me Investigate thoroughly householder It is good for such wellknown people like you to investigate thoroughlySo for the second time venerable sir I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusLet the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeHouseholder your family has long supported the Niganthas and you should consider that alms should be given to them when they comeVenerable sir I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed

gifts should not be given to others disciples Only what is given to me is very fruitful not what is given to others Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful not what is given to others disciplesBut on the contrary the Blessed One encourages me to give gifts to the NiganthasAnyway we shall know the time for that venerable sirSo for the third time venerable sir I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusLet the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeThen the Blessed One gave the householder Upali progressive instruction that is talk on giving talk on virtue talk on the heavens he explained the danger degradation and defilement in sensual pleasures and the blessing of renunciationWhen he knew that the householder Upalis mind was ready receptive free from hindrances elated and confident he expounded to him the teaching special to the Buddhas suffering its origin its cessation and the pathJust as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly so too while the householder Upali sat there the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him All that is subject to arising is subject to cessationThen the householder Upali saw the Dhamma attained the Dhamma understood the Dhamma fathomed the Dhamma he crossed beyond doubt did away with perplexity gained intrepidity and became independent of others in the Teachers Dispensation Then he said to the Blessed One Now venerable sir we must go We are busy and have much to doNow is the time householder to do as you think fitThen the householder Upali having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he left to return to his own house There he addressed the doorkeeper thus Good doorkeeper from today on I close my door to the Niganthas and the Niganthis and I open my door to the Blessed Ones bhikkhus bhikkhunls men lay followers and women lay followersIf any Nigantha comes then tell him thus Wait venerable sir do not enterFrom today on the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaHe has closed his door to the Niganthas and Niganthis and he has opened it to the Blessed Ones bhikkhus bhikkhunls men lay followers and women lay followersVenerable sir if you need alms wait here they will bring it to you here Yes venerable sir the doorkeeper repliedThe Nigantha Digha Tapassi heard The householder Upali has gone over to discipleship tinder the recluse GotamaThen he went to the Nigantha Nataputta and told him Venerable sir I have heard thus The householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaIt is impossible Tapassi it cannot happen that the householder Upali should go over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaA second timeAnd a third time the Nigantha Digha Tapassi told the Nigantha Nataputta Venerable sir I have heard thus The householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaVenerable sir shall I go and find out whether or not the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama It is impossible Tapassi it cannot happenGo Tapassi and find out whether or not he has gone over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaThen the Nigantha Digha Tapassi went to the householder Upalis houseThe doorkeeper saw him coming in the distanceFrom today on the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaHe has closed his door to the Niganthas and Niganthis and he has ppened it to the Blessed Ones bhikkhus bhikkhunls men lay followers and women lay followersVenerable sir if you need alms wait here they will bring it to you hereI do not need alms friend he said and he turned back and went to the Nigantha Nataputta and told him Venerable sir it is only too true that the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaVenerable sir I did not get your consent when I told you Venerable sir I do not think that the householder Upali should try to refute the recluse Gotamas doctrineFor the recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he converts disciples of other sectariansAnd now venerable sir your householder Upali has been converted by the recluse Gotama with his converting magicIt is impossible Tapassi it cannot happen that the householder Upali should go over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaA second timeAnd a third time the Nigantha Digha Tapassi told the Nigantha Nataputta Venerable sir it is only too true that the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama  with his converting magic It is impossible Tapassi it cannot happenit can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder UpaliNow I shall go myself and find out whether or not he has gone over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaThen the Nigantha Nataputta went with a large assembly of Niganthas to the householder Upalis houseThe doorkeeper saw him coming in the distanceFrom today on the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse GotamaHe has closed his door to the Niganthas and Niganthis and he has opened his door to the Blessed Ones bhikkhus bhikkhunls men lay followers and women lay followersVenerable sir if you need alms wait here they will bring it to you hereGood doorkeeper go to the householder Upali and tell him Venerable sir the Nigantha Nataputta is standing at the outer gate with a large assembly of Niganthas he wishes to see youYes venerable sir he replied and he went to the householder Upali and told him Venerable sir the Nigantha Nataputta is standing at the outer gate with a large assembly of Niganthas he wishes to see youIn that case good doorkeeper make seats ready in the hall of the central doorYes venerable sir he replied and after he had made seats ready in the hall of the central door he returned to the householder Upali and told him Venerable sir the seats are made ready in the hall of the central doorNow it is time to do as you think fitThen the householder Upali went to the hall of the central door and sat down on the highest best chief most excellent seat there Then he told the doorkeeper Now good doorkeeper go to the Nigantha Nataputta and tell him Venerable sir the householder Upali says Enter venerable sir if you wish Yes venerable sir he replied and he went to the Nigantha Nataputta and told him Venerable sir the householder Upali says Enter venerable sir if you wishPreviously when the householder Upali saw the Nigantha Nataputta coming in the distance he used to go out to meet him dust off the highest best chief most excellent seat there with an upper robe and having arranged it all around have him seated on it But now while seated himself on the highest best chief most excellent seat he told Nigantha Nataputta Venerable sir there are seats sit down if you wishWhen this was said the Nigantha Nataputta said Householder you are mad you are an imbecileYou went saying Venerable sir I shall refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine and you have come back all caught up in a vast net of doctrineJust as if a man went to castrate someone and came back castrated on both sides just as if a man went to put out someones eyes and came back with both his eyes put out so you too householder went saying Venerable sir I shall refute the recluse Gotamas doctrine and you have come back all caught up in a vast net of doctrineHouseholder you have been converted by the recluse Gotama with his converting magicAuspicious is that converting magic venerable sir good is that converting magic Venerable sir if my beloved kinsmen and relatives were to be converted by this conversion it would lead to the welfare and happiness of my beloved kinsmen and relatives for a long time If all nobles were to be converted by this conversion it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the nobles for a long time If all brahmins all merchants all workers were to be converted by this conversion it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the workers for a long time If the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people were to be converted by this conversion it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long timeAs to this venerable sir I shall give you a simileThen she told him Go brahmin buy a young monkey in the market and bring it back to me as a playmate for my childHe replied Wait madam till you have borne the childIf you bear a boy then I will go to the market and buy a young male monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate for your little boyFor the second time she made the same request and received the same answer For the third time she made the same requestThen since his mind was bound to her with love he went to the market bought a young male monkey brought it back and told her I have bought this young male monkey in the market and brought it back to you as a playmate for your childThen she told him Go brahmin take this young male monkey to Rattapani the dyers son and tell him Good Rattapani I want this young male monkey dyed the colour called yellowunguent pounded and repounded and smoothened out on both sidesThen since his mind was bound to her with love he took the young male monkey to Rattapani the dyers son and told him Good Rattapani I want this young male monkey dyed the colour called yellowunguent pounded and repounded and smoothened out on both sidesRattapani the dyers son told him Venerable sir this young male monkey will take a dyeing but not a pounding or a smoothening outSo too venerable sir the doctrine of the foolish Niganthas will give delight to fools but not to the wise and it will not withstand testing or being smoothened outThen venerable sir on another occasion that brahmin took a pair of new garments to Rattapani the dyers son and told him Good Rattapani I want this pair of new garments dyed the colour called yellowunguent pounded and repounded and smoothened out on both sidesRattapani the dyers son told him Venerable sir this pair of new garments will take a dyeing and a pounding and a smoothening outSo too venerable sir the doctrine of that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened will give delight to the wise but not to fools and it will withstand testing and being smoothened outHouseholder the assembly and the king know you thus The householder Upali is a disciple of the Nigantha NataputtaWhose disciple should we consider you to beWhen this was said the householder Upali rose from his seat and arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he extended his hands in reverential salutation in the direction of the Blessed One and told the Nigantha Nataputta  In that case venerable sir hear whose disciple I ambut it is possible it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder Upalibut it is possible it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder UpaliWhat you said before does not agree with what you said afterwards nor does what you said afterwards agree with what you said beforeso what does a single trivial man count forso what does a single trivial Nalanda count forVenerable sir I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusFor the other sectarians on acquiring me as their disciple would carry a banner all over Nalanda announcing The householder Upali has come to discipleship under usbut it is possible it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder Upaliand told him Wait venerable sir do not enterbut it is possible it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder Upaliand told him Wait venerable sir do not enterThen the Nigantha Nataputta went with the large assembly of Niganthas to the hall of the central doorfor some wise men here understand the meaning of a statement by a simileVenerable sir there was once a brahmin who was old aged and burdened with years and he had as a wife a young brahmin girl who was pregnant and near her confinementbut if you bear a girl then I will go to the market and

then a clever garlandmaker or garlandmakers apprentice were to knot them into a multicoloured garland so too venerable sir the Blessed One has many praiseworthy qualities many hundred praiseworthy qualitiesWho venerable sir would not praise the praiseworthyThen since the Nigantha Nataputta was unable to bear this honour done to the Blessed One hot blood then and there gushed from his mouthand he approached you and said Venerable sir I want to go to RajagahaMagnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master GotamaI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Koliyan country at a town of the Koliyans named HaliddavasanaThen Punna son of the Koliyans an oxduty ascetic and also Seniya a naked dogduty ascetic went to the Blessed One Punna the oxduty ascetic paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one sidePunna the oxduty ascetic said to the Blessed One Venerable sir this Seniya is a naked dogduty ascetic who does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown to the groundHe has long taken up and practised that dogdutyWhat will be his destination What will be his future courseEnough Punna let that be Do not ask me thatA second timeAnd a third time Punna the oxduty ascetic said to the Blessed One Venerable sir this Seniya is a naked dogduty ascetic who does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown to the groundHe has long taken up and practised that dogdutyWhat will be his destination What will be his future courseWell Punna since I certainly cannot persuade you when I sayEnough Punna let that be Do not ask me that I shall therefore answer youHere Punna someone develops the dogduty fully and uninterruptedly he develops the doghabit fully and uninterruptedly he develops the dogmind fully and uninterruptedly he develops dogbehaviour fully and uninterruptedlyHaving done so on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of dogsBut if he has such a view as this By this virtue or observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a great god or some lesser god that is wrong view in his caseNow there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal realmSo Punna if his dogduty succeeds it will lead him to the company of dogs if it fails it will lead him to hellWhen this was said Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic cried out and burst into tearsThen the Blessed One told Punna son of the Koliyans the oxduty ascetic Punna I could not persuade you when I saidEnough Punna let that beDo not ask me thatThen Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic said Venerable sir I am not crying because the Blessed One has said this about me but because I have long taken up and practised this dogdutyVenerable sir this Punna son of the Koliyans is an oxduty asceticHe has long taken up and practised that oxdutyWhat will be his destination What will be his future courseEnough Seniya let that be Do not ask me thatA second timeAnd a third time Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this Punna son of the Koliyans is an oxduty asceticHe has long taken up and practised that oxdutyWhat will be his destination What will be his future courseWell Seniya since I certainly cannot persuade you when I sayEnough Seniya let that be Do not ask me that I shall therefore answer youHere Seniya someone develops the oxduty fully and uninterruptedly he develops the oxhabit fully and uninterruptedly he develops the oxmind fully and uninterruptedly he develops oxbehaviour fully and uninterruptedlyHaving done so on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of oxenBut if he has such a view as this By this virtue or observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a great god or some lesser god that is wrong view in his caseNow there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal realmSo Seniya if his oxduty succeeds it will lead him to the company of oxen if it fails it will lead him to hellWhen this was said Punna son of the Koliyans the oxduty ascetic cried out and burst into tearsThen the Blessed One told Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic Seniya I could not persuade you when I saidEnough Seniya let that beDo not ask me thatThen Punna the oxduty ascetic said Venerable sir I am not crying because the Blessed One has said this about me but because I have long taken up and practised this oxdutyVenerable sir I have confidence in the Blessed One thus The Blessed One is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can abandon this oxduty and that this Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic can abandon that dogdutyThen Punna listen and attend closely to what I shall say Yes venerable sir he repliedThe Blessed One said thisWhat are the fourThere is dark action with dark result there is bright action with bright result there is darkandbright action with darkandbright result and there is action that is neither dark nor bright with neitherdarknorbright result action that leads to the destruction of actionAnd what Punna is dark action with dark resultHere someone generates an afflictive bodily formation an afflictive verbal formation an afflictive mental formationHaving generated an afflictive bodily formation an afflictive verbal formation an afflictive mental formation he reappears in an afflictive worldWhen he has reappeared in an afflictive world afflictive contacts touch himBeing touched by afflictive contacts he feels afflictive feelings extremely painful as in the case of the beings in hellThus a beings reappearance is due to a being one reappears through the actions one has performed When one has reappeared contacts touch oneThus I say beings are the heirs of their actionsThis is called dark action with dark resultAnd what Punna is bright action with bright resultHere someone generates an unafflictive bodily formation an unafflictive verbal formation an unafflictive mental formationHaving generated an unafflictive bodily formation an unafflictive verbal formation an unafflictive mental formation he reappears in an unafflictive worldWhen he has reappeared in an unafflictive world unafflictive contacts touch himBeing touched by unafflictive contacts he feels unafflictive feelings extremely pleasant as in the case of the gods of Refulgent GloryThus a beings reappearance is due to a being one reappears through the actions one has performed When one has reappeared contacts touch oneThus I say beings are the heirs of their actionsThis is called bright action with bright resultAnd what Punna is darkandbright action with darkand bright resultHere someone generates a bodily formation that is both afflictive and unafflictive a verbal formation that is both afflictive and unafflictive a mental formation that is both afflictive and unafflictiveHaving generated a bodily formation a verbal formation a mental formation that is both afflictive and unafflictive he reappears in a world that is both afflictive and unafflictiveWhen he has reappeared in a world that is both afflictive and unafflictive both afflictive and unafflictive contacts touch himBeing touched by both afflictive and unafflictive contacts he feels both afflictive and unafflictive feelings mingled pleasure and pain as in the case of human beings and some gods and some beings in the lower worldsThus a beings reappearance is due to a being one reappears through the actions one has performedWhen one has reappeared contacts touch oneThus I say beings are the heirs to their actionsThis is called darkandbright action with darkandbright resultAnd what Punna is action that is neither dark nor bright with neitherdarknorbright result action that leads to the destruction of actionTherein the volition in abandoning the kind of action that is dark with dark result and the volition in abandoning the kind of action that is bright with bright result and the volition in abandoning the kind of action that is dark and bright with darkandbright result this is called action that is neither dark nor bright with neitherdarknorbright result action that leads to the destruction of actionThese are the four kinds of action proclaimed by me after realising them for myself with direct knowledgeWhen this was said Punna son of the Koliyans the oxduty ascetic said to the Blessed One Magnificent venerable sir Magnificent venerable sirThe Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many waysFrom today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeBut Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic said to the Blessed One Magnificent venerable sir Magnificent venerable sirThe Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsI would receive the going forth under the Blessed One I would receive the full admissionSeniya one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four monthsAt the end of four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they give him the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus stateBut I recognise individual differences in this matterVenerable sir if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and if at the end of the four months the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus state then I will live on probation for four yearsAt the end of the four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them give me the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus stateThen Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admissionAnd soon not long after his full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Seniya by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessHe directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingAnd the venerable Seniya became one of the arahantswhile Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic exchanged greetings with the Blessed Oneand when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he too sat down at one side curled up like a dogPunna there are four kinds of action proclaimed by me after realising them for myself with direct knowledgeI go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen Prince Abhaya went to the Nigantha Nataputta and after paying homage to him sat down at one sideThereupon the Nigantha Nataputta said to him  Come prince refute the recluse Gotamas doctrineand a good report of you will be spread to this effect Prince Abhaya has refuted the doctrine of the recluse Gotama who is so powerful and mightyCome prince go to the recluse Gotama and say Venerable sir would the Tathagata utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to othersIf the recluse Gotama on being asked thus answers The Tathagata prince would utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others then say to him Then venerable sir what is the difference between you and an ordinary personFor an ordinary person also would utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to othersBut if the recluse Gotama on being asked thus answers The Tathagata prince would not utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others then say to him Then venerable sir why have you declared of Devadatta Devadatta is destined for the states of deprivation Devadatta is destined for hell Devadatta will remain in hell for the aeon Devadatta is incorrigibleDevadatta was angry and dissatisfied with that speech of yoursWhen the recluse Gotama is posed this twohorned question by you he will not be able either to gulp it down or to throw it upIf an iron spike were stuck in a mans throat he would not be able either to gulp it down or to throw it up so too prince when the recluse Gotama is posed this twohorned question by you he will not be able either to gulp it down or to throw it upYes venerable sir Prince Abhaya replied Then he rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Nigantha Nataputta keeping him on his right he left and went to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side looked at the sun and thought It is too late today to refute the Blessed Ones doctrineI shall refute the Blessed Ones doctrine in my own house tomorrow Then he said to the Blessed One Venerable sir let the Blessed One with three others consent to accept tomorrows meal from meThe Blessed One consented in silenceThen knowing that the Blessed One had consented Prince Abhaya rose from his seat and after paying homage to him keeping him on his right he departedThen when the night had ended it being morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went to Prince Abhayas house and sat down on the seat made readyThen with his own hands Prince Abhaya served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of good foodWhen the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl Prince Abhaya took a low seat sat down at one sideThere is no onesided answer to that princeThen venerable sir the Niganthas have lost in thisWhy do you say this prince Then venerable sir the Niganthas have lost in thisPrince Abhaya then reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with the Nigantha NataputtaNow on that occasion a young tender infant was lying prone on Prince Abhayas lapThen the Blessed One said to Prince Abhaya What do you think prince If while you or your nurse were not attending to him this child were to put a stick or a pebble in his mouth what would you do to himVenerable sir I would take it outIf I could not take it out at once I would take his head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right hand I would take it out even if it meant drawing bloodWhy is thatBecause I have compassion for the childSo too prince such speech as the Tathagata knows to be untrue incorrect and unbeneficial and which is also unwelcome and disagreeable to others such speech the Tathagata does not utterSuch speech as the Tathagata knows to be true and correct but unbeneficial and which is also unwelcome and disagreeable to others such speech the Tathagata does not utterSuch speech as the Tathagata knows to be true correct and beneficial but which is unwelcome and disagreeable to others the Tathagata knows the time to use such speechSuch speech as the Tathagata knows to be untrue incorrect and unbeneficial but which is welcome and agreeable to others such speech the Tathagata does not utterSuch speech as the Tathagata knows to be true and correct but unbeneficial and which is welcome and agreeable to others such speech the Tathagata does not utterSuch speech as the Tathagata knows to be true correct and beneficial and which is welcome and agreeable to others the Tathagata knows the time to use such speechWhy is thatBecause the Tathagata has compassion for beingsVenerable sir when learned nobles learned brahmins learned householders and learned recluses after formulating a question then go to the Blessed One and pose it has there already been in the Blessed Ones mind the thought If they come to me and ask me thus I shall answer thus Or does that answer occur to the Tathagata on the spotAs to that prince I shall ask you a question in return Answer it as you chooseWhat do you think prince Are you skilled in the parts of a chariotYes venerable sir I amWhat do you think prince When people come to you and ask What is the name of this part of the chariothas there already been in your mind the thought If they come to me and ask me thus I shall answer them thus Or does that answer occur to you on the spotVenerable sir I am well known as a charioteer skilled in the parts of a chariotAll the parts of a chariot are well known to meThat answer would occur to me on the spotSo too prince when learned nobles learned brahmins learned householders and learned recluses after formulating a question then come to the Tathagata and pose it the answer occurs to the Tathagata on the spotWhy is thatThat element of things has been fully penetrated by the Tathagata through the full penetration of which the answer occurs to the Tathagata on the spotWhen this was said Prince Abhaya said Magnificent venerable sir Magnificent venerable sir The Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many waysFrom today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeBut how venerable sir shall I refute his doctrineand said to the Blessed One  Venerable sir would a Tathagata utter such speech as would be unwelcome and disagreeable to othersTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named KammasadhammaThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable

bhikkhu here Ananda might attain Nibbana another bhikkhu here might not attain NibbanaWhat is the cause and reason venerable sir why one bhikkhu here might attain Nibbana while another bhikkhu here might not attain NibbanaHere Ananda a bhikkhu is practising thus If it were not it would not be mine it will not be and it will hot be mine What exists what has come to be that I am abandoningThus he obtains equanimityHe delights in that equanimity welcomes it and remains holding to itAs he does so his consciousness becomes dependent on it and clings to itA bhikkhu Ananda who is affected by clinging does not attain NibbanaBut venerable sir when that bhikkhu clings what does he cling toTo the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception AnandaWhen that bhikkhu clings venerable sir it seems he clings to the best object of clingingWhen that bhikkhu clings Ananda he clings to the best object of clingingHere Ananda a bhikkhu is practising thus If it were not it would not be mine it will not be and it will not be mine What exists what has come to be that I am abandoningThus he obtains equanimityHe does not delight in that equanimity welcome it or remain holding to itSince he does not do so his consciousness does not become dependent on it and does not cling to itA bhikkhu Ananda who is without clinging attains NibbanaIt is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellousThe Blessed One indeed has explained to us the crossing of the flood in dependence upon one support or another Here Ananda a noble disciple considers thus Sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come sensual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in lives to come material forms here and now and material forms in lives to come perceptions of forms here and now and perceptions of forms in lives to come perceptions of the imperturbable perceptions of the base of nothingness and perceptions of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception  this is personality as far as personality extendsThus Ananda I have taught the way directed to the imperturbable I have taught the way directed to the base of nothingness I have taught the way directed to the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception I have taught the crossing of the flood in dependence upon one support or another I haye taught noble liberationWhat should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them that I have done for you AnandaThere are these roots of trees these empty hutsMeditate Ananda do not delay or else you will regret it laterThis is our instruction to youThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsBlameworthy or blameless Condemned or commended by the wiseBeing undertaken and put into effect do they lead to harm and suffering or not or how does it appear in this caseme is the demonstration of the person possessed of the consciousness statedand sutam is the demonstration of its being neither less nor more and of undistorted apprehension of it since its not having been heard is deniedTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen the carpenter Pancakanga went to the venerable Udayin and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideThree kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One householderpleasant feeling painful feeling and neitherpainful norpleasant feeling These three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed OneNot three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One venerable Udayin two kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One pleasant feeling and painful feelingThis neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling has been stated by the Blessed One as a peaceful and sublime kind of pleasureA second timeBut the venerable Udayin could not convince the carpenter Pancakanga nor could the carpenter Pancakanga convince the venerable UdayinThe venerable Ananda heard their conversationThen he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideWhen he had finished the Blessed One told the venerable Ananda  Ananda it was actually a true presentation that the carpenter Pancakanga would not accept from Udayin and it was actually a true presentation that Udayin would not accept from the carpenter PancakangaI have stated two kinds of feeling in one presentation I have stated three kinds of feeling in another presentation I have stated five kinds of feeling in another presentation I have stated six kinds of feeling in another presentation I have stated eighteen kinds of feeling in another presentation I have stated thirtysix kinds of feeling in another presentation I have stated one hundred and eight kinds of feeling in another presentationThat is how the Dhamma has been shown by me in different presentationsWhen the Dhamma has thus been shown by me in different presentations it may be expected of those who will not concede allow and accept what is well stated and well spoken by others that they will take to quarreling brawling and disputing stabbing each other with verbal daggersAnanda there are these five cords of sensual pleasureWhat are the fiveForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the ear Odours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongueTangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lustThese are the five cords of sensual pleasure Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasureShould anyone say That is the utmost pleasure and joy that beings experience I would not concede that to himWhy is thatBecause there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than that pleasureAnd what is that other kind of pleasureHere Ananda quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureShould anyone say That is the utmost pleasure and joy that beings experience I would not concede that to himWhy is thatBecause there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than that pleasureAnd what is that other kind of pleasureHere Ananda with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentrationThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureShould anyone sayHere Ananda with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity mindful and fully aware and still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindfulThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureShould anyone sayHere Ananda with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpain norpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureShould anyone sayHere Ananda with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite spaceThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureShould anyone sayHere Ananda by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousnessThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureShould anyone sayHere Ananda by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingnessThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureShould anyone sayHere Ananda by completely surmounting the base of nothingness a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureShould anyone say That is the utmost pleasure and joy that beings experience I would not concede that to himWhy is thatBecause there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than that pleasureAnd what is that other kind of pleasureHere Ananda by completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feelingThis is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasureIt is possible Ananda that wanderers of other sects might speak thus The recluse Gotama speaks of the cessation of perception and feeling and he describes that as pleasureWhat is this and how is thisWanderers of other sects who speak thus should be told Friends the Blessed One describes pleasure not only with reference to pleasant feeling rather friends the Tathagata describes as pleasure any kind of pleasure wherever and in whatever way it is foundThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsme demonstrates an individual selfand sutam demonstrates an idea cognizedand asked him  Venerable sir how many kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed OneSimilarly evam demonstrates variety of mode by the description of the modes of the cognizances belonging to the cognitive series and a third time the venerable Udayin stated his positionme demonstrates an agent and sutam demonstrates an objective field for actionand a second time and a third time the carpenter Pancakanga stated hisSimilarly evam demonstrates a persons functionand me demonstrates a person connected with both these functionsand reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation between the venerable Udayin and the carpenter Pancakangame demonstrates a personand sutam demonstrates a function of that personwhile sutam is a description in terms of the factualSimilarly evam and me are a derivative description because they are stated derivatively upon this or that factBut it may be expected of those who concede allow and accept what is well stated and well spoken by others that they will live in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyesand by the word sutam he points out nondistraction because when someone is distracted hearing is absent in himfor when a distracted person is told quite unmistakably yet he says  I did not hear say it again And what is that other kind of pleasureAnd what is that other kind of pleasureAnd what is that other kind of pleasurewhile with this word sutam  which shows penetration of the class of what can be heard he likewise shows his own excellence in the Discriminations of Ideas and LanguageAnd what is that other kind of pleasureAnd what is that other kind of pleasureAnd what is that other kind of pleasureDissipates all lack of faith And swells faith in the Masters wordGotamas disciple saying In such manner  Thus I heard Is met with as event moment And time and mass and cause and viewObtainment and abandonment And lastly penetration tooAnd  on one occasion  is also said with reference to any one of the following occasions the occasion of the function of compassion from the two occasions of the function of knowledge and function of compassion  the occasion of the practising for others welfare from the two occasions of practising for ones own welfare and practising for others welfare the occasion of talking about the True Idea from the two occasions of the two alternative ways in which those who have met together should act  and the occasion of Preaching from the two occasions of preaching and practisingthe Occasion of Teaching called  one occasion  which is one By instrument and locative The meaning dictates whichTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow on that occasion the venerable Rahula was living at AmbalatthikaThen when it was evening the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the venerable Rahula at AmbalatthikaThe venerable Rahula saw the Blessed One coming in the distanceThe Blessed One sat down on the seat made readyand washed his feetThen the Blessed One left a little water in the water vessel and asked the venerable Rahula Rahula do you see this little water left in the water vessel Yes venerable sir Even so little Rahula is the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lieThen the Blessed One threw away the little water that was left and asked the venerable Rahula Rahula do you see that little water that was thrown away Yes venerable sir Even so Rahula those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie have thrown away their recluseshipThen the Blessed One turned the water vessel upside down and asked the venerable Rahula Rahula do you see this water vessel turned upside down Yes venerable sir Even so Rahula those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie have turned their recluseship upside downThen the Blessed One turned the water vessel right way up again and asked the venerable Rahula Rahula do you see this hollow empty water vessel Yes venerable sir Even so hollow and empty Rahula is the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lieSuppose Rahula there were a royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot poles fullgrown in stature highbred and accustomed to battle In battle he would perform his task with his forefeet and his hindfeet with his forequarters and his hindquarters with his head and his ears with his tusks and his tail yet he would keep back his trunkThen his rider would think This royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot poles performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet yet he keeps back his trunkHe has not yet given up his lifeBut when the royal tusker elephant performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet with his forequarters and his hindquarters with his head and his ears with his tusks and his tail and also with his trunk then his rider would think This royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot polesperforms his task in battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet and also with his trunkHe has given up his lifeNow there is nothing this royal tusker elephant would not doSo too Rahula when one is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie there is no evil I say that one would not doTherefore Rahula you should train thus I will not utter a falsehood even

homage to him and sat down at one sideTherefore Rahula you should train thus We will purify our bodily action our verbal action and our mental action by repeatedly reflecting upon themRahula whatever

distinguished by special qualities Blessed  is the best of words  Blessed  is the finest wordDeserving awe and veneration Blessed is his name thereforeby which last is meant  capricious He has gone to the end of being  thus he is called  Blessed  He has well maintained himself in being in many waysHe has caused abolishing  he is fortunate  has blessings  is a frequenter  a partaker  a possessor of what has been analysed  possessed of abolishment  associated with blessings  and a possessor of what has been analysed He has frequented  and he has rejected going in the kinds of being  thus he is Blessed  He has abolished lust and hate Delusion too he is free from taintsAbolished are all evil ideas   Blessed   his name may rightly be they become capable of finding both mundane and supramundane pleasureNor eer the ear ten sounds denies And offers food and drink for allThe Kosalans fair capital Beguiles the mind it charms the eyesSince all is there sabbam atthi  Therein the citys naming liesWas living  this is a term signifying without distinction a possessor of one or other of the abidings consisting of the four postures and the three abidings consisting in the heavenly the divine and the Noble Ones abidingsthe locative case is in the sense of  vicinityAt that SavatthiThe peerless city can recall The Gods own Alakamandathat is why it is said that he  was living for it was planted by prince Jeta tended and guarded by him and he was its owner which is why it was called Jeta Wood in that Jetas Woodand conversely if he lived there then at Savatthi  cannot be saidfor he cannot live in both places on one occasionIt may be replied as follows Was it not already said above  The locative case is in the sense of  vicinity    Consequently just as when herds of cattle are wandering in the vicinity of the Ganges the Jumna and so on it is said that  they are wandering  at  the   wandering  at  the Jumna  so too here there the Wood of Jeta and Park of Anathapindika in the vicinity of Savatthi when someone is living there it is said of him that he is  living at Savatthi in Jetas Wood Anathapindikas Park and lastly by the first he points out the Blessed Ones being born in the world and matured in the world and by the second his being left intact by the world and so onby the first his great helpfulness to men and by the second his great helpfulness to godsby the first the comfortable abiding that has for its sign the not giving up of such pleasure as is in conformity with the True Idea and by the second the comfortable abiding that has for its sign the pursuit of the morethanhuman idealby the first his resoluteness upon procuring creatures welfare and by the second his intactness in the effecting of others welfare and pleasureby the first his approach through compassion and by the second his withdrawal through understandingfor that deity is not specified by name and race which is why  a certain  is saidThe extreme of whose brilliance  here the word  extreme  means handsome But the word vanna is met with as skin  eulogy group of clans  reason shape measure the visibleform base  and so onThe whole of  now the word kevala has many meanings such as remainderless the most part unmixed with nothing extra firm dissociation and so onor else what is meant is  Being already thus gone towards having thereupon gone to the vicinity of the Blessed One called  a nearer place  what is more Nor above to one below Should one speak nor upwindso Who these faults has rectified Him they call  stood at one side and he did not sit down out of deference to the Great Disciples who were standing round the Blessed Onefor when deities want to sit down a seat is generated for them and not wanting that he stood at one side without turning his mind to sittingme demonstrates a personand sutam demonstrates the persons functionNow with the aim of revealing expounding and exhibiting the meaning thereof by way of a commentary on the Minor Books that is illustrative of the ultimate meaning this is said this statement of the Goingforrefuge is the beginning of the Minor BooksI go for refuge to the Community I go for refuge to the True Idea I go for refuge to the Enlightened One I honour the Jewel Threeness first That should be honoured most of allThen I shall make a comment versed In certain Minor Books withal Though their profundity would make Such work too hard an occupationFor one who like myself is not A giver of the Dispensation Yet still today we find no break In the former Teachers Explanation And we likewise have not forgot The Masters ninefold DispensationLet love of Truth the motive be Not liking for selfpraise nor aimTo carp at others and give blame So listen then attentivelySo I this work will undertake Will be my standby too I wotBecause the Ancients explanation Beside the Masters DispensationHerein since it was said above  Then I shall make a comment versed In certain Minor Books withal  I shall accordingly make the commentary after first defining what the Minor Books areThe  Minor Books  are one part of the Minor Collection The  Five Collections  areHerein the  ThreadsofArgument beginning with the Brahmajala Sutta are the Long Collection and the Minor Collection  consists of the rest of the Enlightened Ones utterance not included in the four Collections that is to say the Minor Readings  Lines on the True Idea  Exclamations  Sayings  the Chapter of ThreadsofArgument  Stories of Heavenly Mansions  Stories of Ghosts of the Departed  Psalms of the Brethren  Psalms of the Sisters  Birth Stories  the Book of Demonstration  the Path of Discrimination  Legends  the BuddhaHeritage  and the Volume of Good Conduct  as well as the Volume of Discipline and Volume of Basic Ideation  Why is this called the Minor CollectionBecause it is the mass and the home of many minor branches of the True Idea and according to what is said in the nonBuddhist world namely  Poṇikanikāyo cikkhallikanikāyo  grammatically establishing this both according to what is said in the Dispensation namely is these Minor Books  which are included in the Volume of ThreadsofArgument  and the meaning of which it is here intended to reveal expound and exhibit Of these Minor Books the book of Minor Readings is the beginning and it has nine component parts namely the Refuges the Training Precepts the Thirtytwofold Aspect the Boys Questions the GoodOmen the Jewel WithouttheWalls the TreasureStore and Lovingkindness But it is the beginning according to the  pathway  for the serial order of recitation of the Tipitaka composed by the line of former teachers not according to what was spoken first by the Blessed OneWhat was actually first said was this I travelled through the round of countless births not finding HouseBuilder you have now been seen  You shall not build the house again Your rafters have been broken down  Your ridgepole is demolished too My mind has now attained the Undetermined  And reached the end of every kind of craving  And this pair of stanzas was the very beginning of the whole of the Enlightened Ones UtteranceHowever of what was said by him as uttered speech When ideas are full manifest To the ardent and absorbed divine The Digha Majjhima Samyutta Anguttara and Khuddaka These five Collections are profound In idea and in meaning toothe  ThreadsofArgument beginning with the Mulapariyaya Sutta are the Middle Collection the  Threadsof Argument beginning with the Oghatarana Sutta are the Associated Collection the  ThreadsofArgument beginning with the Cittapariyadana Sutta are the Numerical Collection since what is a mass and a home is called a  collection   Bhikkhus I see no single collection so varied as the breathing things that are animals  One part of this Minor Collection but Seeking the HouseBuilder  How painful is birth ever and againbut it was said only with the mind without speech utterance His doubts all vanish for he knows That each idea must have its cause the following stanza was the beginningSo I shall begin the commentary on the meaning starting from the beginning of this book of Minor Readings with its nine component parts itself the beginning of the Minor BooksHerein it was laid down in the Schedule thus  A varied comment then we unfold On the word  thus  and some words moreTo give their sense before we tell The Suttas origin as well   and this is the opportunity to relate that origin Therefore after we have first told the origin of the Goodomen Question we shall then comment on the meaning of the stanzasWhat was the origin of the Goodomen Questionthey are illusory the prattle of foolsand they constitute an obstruction to a noble disciple in training herenanda asked Bhante how long does it take for the aspiration of buddhas to be achievedThe Buddha replied For buddhas nanda it takes at minimum four incalculables and  eons at the middling level eight incalculables and  eons at the maximum sixteen incalculables and  eonsAnd these divisions should be understood respectively in the case of those for whom wisdom is predominant those for whom faith is predominant and those for whom energy is predominantIn those for whom wisdom is predominant faith is weak and wisdom is sharp In those for whom faith is predominant wisdom is middling In those for whom energy is predominant faith and wisdom are weak and energy is strongBut without having completed four incalculables and  eons there is no possibility that one could become a buddha earlier even if one were to give gifts day after day like those of Vessantara and to accumulate all the other pāramīs such as good behavior to a corresponding degreeWhy notBecause ones knowledge would not have commenced nor expanded nor reached maturityIt is just as when grain is growing that needs three four or five months to ripen it is impossible that without having completed that time the grain might ripen earlierin a fortnight or a montheven though one fondles it and waters it a thousand times dailyWhy notBecause the grain would not have commenced nor expanded nor reached maturitySo too without having completed four incalculables and  eons there is no possibility that one could become a buddhaTherefore the fulfilling of the pāramīs must be pursued over the aforementioned time for the maturation of knowledgeWhen observing the uposatha they do so after they have assembled on the Jewel Terrace at the foot of the Mañjūsaka tree on Mount GandhamādanaThey achieve all the psychic powers meditative attainments and analytical knowledges Their excellent qualities are inferior to those of the buddhas but superior to those of disciples They give others the going forth and train them in proper behavior They observe the uposatha with this advice One should practice effacement of the mind and should not come to a stop or else they merely say Today is the uposathaFor they are not able to apply conceptual description to the worldtranscending Dhamma and thereby teach it Their breakthrough to the Dhamma is like a dumb person trying to describe the things he has seen in a dream or like a countrydweller trying to describe the dishes he tasted in the cityThey penetrate the taste of the goal only but not the taste of the DhammaPaccekabuddhas attain enlightenment themselves but do not enlighten othersBuddhas attain enlightenment themselves and enlighten othersWithout encountering buddhas paccekabuddhas arise only at a time when buddhas ariseWhen buddhas arise in the world after having fulfilled the pāramīs through this aspiration and this undertaking in the aforesaid amounts of time they arise in either a khattiya family or a brahmin family Paccekabuddhas arise in a family of khattiyas brahmins or householders But the chief disciples like the buddhas arise only in families of khattiyas or brahmins Buddhas never arise when the eon is dissolving but they arise when the eon is evolvingThe undertaking for all these possesses only two factors service and desirethe reason for this should be understood in the way already statedIt is not possible in less time than thisFor the two chief disciples one incalculable and  eons for the eighty great disciples  eons So too for the mother father attendant and son of a buddhaBut how much time does it take for the aspiration of disciples to be achievedThe rest should be understood in the way already statedHere the sight of one devoid of influxes means the sight of a buddha a paccekabuddha or an arahant discipleservice and desire these are the causes for the undertaking to reach successThe human state the achievement of the genderthe sight of one devoid of influxesFor one aspiring to become a paccekabuddha in this amount of time five prerequisites are recognized in making the undertakingThe reason should be understood in the way stated earlier in the case of buddhasIt is not possible in less time than thisFor paccekabuddhas two incalculables and  eons are requiredBut how long does it take for the aspiration of paccekabuddhas to be fulfilledAnd for one aspiring for buddhahood over such a period of time eight prerequisites must be met for making the undertakingHuman status achievement of the gender the cause seeing the Teacherthe going forth possession of excellent qualitiesservice and strong desirethrough the assemblage of these eight qualitiesthe undertaking reaches success constitute an obstruction to a noble disciple in training hereSuppose I were to abide with a mind abundant and exalted having transcended the world and made a firm resolution with the mindand split the main branches of the treeFor many a year Evil One for many a century for many a millennium I roasted in that Great HellDark One you have much to suffer By assaulting such a bhikkhu Who

directly knows this fact Who directly knows this factAn Enlightened Ones disciple Who directly knows this factand when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he stood at one sideWhen I do so there will be no more evil unwholesome mental states such as covetousness ill will and presumption in meWhen he practises in this way and frequently abides thus his mind acquires confidence in this baseit is possible that this consciousness of his leading to rebirth may pass on to rebirth in the imperturbableThis bhikkhus is declared to be the first way directed to the imperturbableit is possible that this consciousness of his leading to rebirth may pass on to rebirth in the imperturbableit is possible that this consciousness of his leading to rebirth may pass on to rebirth in the imperturbableit is possible that this consciousness of his leading to rebirth may pass on to rebirth in the base of nothingnessit is possible that this consciousness of his leading to rebirth may pass on to rebirth in the base of nothingnessit is possible that this consciousness of his leading to rebirth may pass on to rebirth in the base of nothingnessit is possible that this consciousness of his leading to rebirth may pass on to rebirth in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionfor this is the best object of clinging namely the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionBut venerable sir what is noble liberationThis is the Deathless namely the liberation of the mind through not clingingOn one occasion the Blessed One was traveling along the highway between Ukkattha and SetavyaThe brahmin Dona was also traveling along the highway between Ukkattha and SetavyaThe brahmin Dona then saw the thousandspoked wheels of the Blessed Ones footprints with their rims and hubs complete in all respects and thought It is astounding and amazingThese surely could not be the footprints of a human beingThen the Blessed One left the highway and sat down at the foot of a tree folding his legs crosswise straightening his body arid establishing mindfulness in front of himTracking the Blessed Ones footprints the brahmin Dona saw the Blessed One sitting at the foot of the tree graceful inspiring confidence with peaceful faculties and peaceful mind one who had attained to the highest taming and serenity like a tamed and guarded bull elephant with controlled facultiesHe then approached the Blessed One and said to himI will not be a deva brahminCould you be a gandhabba sirI will not be a gandhabba brahminCould you be a yakkha sirI will not be a yakkha brahminCould you be a human being sirI will not be a human being brahminWhen you are asked Could you be a deva sir you say I will not be a deva brahminWhen you aire asked Could you be a gandhabba sir you say I will not be a gandhabba brahminWhen you are asked Could you be a yakkha sir you say I will not be a yakkha brahminWhen you a re asked Could you be a human being sir you say I will not be a human being brahminWhat then could you be sirBrahmin I have abandoned those taints because of which I might have become a deva I have cut them off at the root made them like palm stumps obliterated them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingCould you be a deva sirI have abandoned those taints because of which I might have become a gandhabba   might have become a yakkha   might have become a human being I have cut them off at the root made them like palm stumps obliterated them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingJust as a blue red or white lotus flower though born in the water and grown up in the water rises above the water and stands unsoiled by the water even so though born in the world and grown up in the world I have overcome the world and dwell unsoiled by the worldRemember me brahmin as a BuddhaI have destroyed those taints by which I might have been reborn as a deva or as a gandhabba that travels through the skyby which I might have reached the state of a yakkha or arrived back at the human statehave dispelled and cut down these taintsAs a lovely white lotus is not soiled by the waterI am not soiled by the world therefore O brahmin I am a BuddhaOn one occasion the Blessed One was traveling along the road between Ukkattha and SetabyaDona the brahman saw in the Blessed Ones footprints wheels with  spokes together with rims and hubs complete in all their features On seeing them the thought occurred to him How amazing How astoundingThese are not the footprints of a human being Then the Blessed One leaving the road went to sit at the root of a certain tree  his legs crossed his body erect with mindfulness established to the foreThen Dona following the Blessed Ones footprints saw him sitting at the root of the tree confident inspiring confidence his senses calmed his mind calmed having attained the utmost control  tranquility tamed guarded his senses restrained a nagaOn seeing him he went to him and saidNo brahman I am not a devaAre you a gandhabba No a yakkha No a human being No brahman I am not a human beingWhen asked Are you a deva  you answer No brahman I am not a devaWhen asked Are you a gandhabba  you answer No brahman I am not a gandhabbaWhen asked Are you a yakkha  you answer No brahman I am not a yakkhaWhen asked Are you a human being  you answer No brahman I am not a human beingThen what sort of being are you Brahman the fermentations by which  if they were not abandoned  I would be a deva Those are abandoned by me their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThe fermentations by which  if they were not abandoned  I would be a gandhabba a yakkha a human being Those are abandoned by me their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingJust like a red blue or white lotus  born in the water grown in the water rising up above the water  stands unsmeared by the water in the same way I  born in the world grown in the world having overcome the world  live unsmeared by the worldRemember me brahman as awakenedand Dona the brahman was also traveling along the road between Ukkattha and SetabyaMaster are you a devaThe fermentations by which I would go to a devastate or become a gandhabba in the skyor go to a yakkhastate  humanstateThose have been destroyed by me ruined their stems removedLike a blue lotus rising up unsmeared by waterunsmeared am I by the world and so brahman Im awakeTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesall in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked RoofNow on that occasion a number of bhikkhus had declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One thus We understand Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingSunakkhatta son of the Licchavis heard A number of bhikkhus it seems have declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One thus We understand Birth is destroyed there is no more coming to any state of beingThen Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideDid they do so rightly or are there some bhikkhus here who declare final knowledge because they overestimate themselvesWhen those bhikkhus Sunakkhatta declared final knowledge in my presenceThus it is in this case Sunakkhatta that the Tathagata thinks Let me teach them the DhammaBut some misguided men here formulate a question come to the Tathagata and ask itIn that case Sunakkhatta though the Tathagata has thought Let me teach them the Dhamma he changes his mindThis is the time Blessed One this is the time Sublime One for the Blessed One to teach the DhammaHaving heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember itThen listen Sunakkhatta and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis replied to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said thisWhat are the fiveForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the earOdours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongueTangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust These are the five cords of sensual pleasureIt is possible Sunakkhatta that some person here may be intent on worldly material thingsBut when a person is intent on worldly material things only talk concerning that interests him and his thinking and pondering are in line with that and he associates with that kind of person and he finds satisfaction through himwhen talk about the imperturbable is going on he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his mind to understand it He does not associate with that kind of person and he does not find satisfaction through himSuppose Sunakkhatta a man had left his own village or town a long time agoHe would ask that man whether the people of that village or town were safe prosperous and healthy and that man would tell him whether the people of that village or town were safe prosperous and healthyWhat do you think Sunakkhatta Would that first man listen to him give him ear and exert his mind to understand Yes venerable sir So too Sunakkhatta it is possible that some person here may be intent on worldly material thingsWhen a person is intent on worldly material thingsand he does not find satisfaction through himHe should be understood as a person who is intent on worldly material thingsIt is possible Sunakkhatta that some person here may be intent on the imperturbableWhen a person is intent on the imperturbable only talk concerning that interests him and his thinking and pondering are in line with that and he associates with that kind of person and he finds satisfaction through him But when talk about worldly material things is going on he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his mind to understand it He does not associate with that kind of person and he does not find satisfaction through himJust as a yellow leaf that has fallen from its stalk is incapable of becoming green again so too Sunakkhatta when a person is intent on the imperturbable he has shed the fetter of worldly material thingsHe should be understood as a person not bound by the fetter of worldly material things who is intent on the imperturbableIt is possible Sunakkhatta that some person here may be intent on the base of nothingnessWhen a person is intent on the base of nothingness only talk concerning that interests him and his thinking and pondering are in line with that and he associates with that kind of person and he finds satisfaction through him But when talk about the imperturbable is going on he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his mind to understand it He does not associate with that kind of person and he does not find satisfaction through himJust as a thick stone that has split in two cannot be joined together again so too Sunakkhatta when a person is intent on the base of nothingness his fetter of the imperturbable has been splitHe should be understood as a person not bound by the fetter of the imperturbable who is intent on the base of nothingnessIt is possible Sunakkhatta that some person here may be intent on the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionWhen a person is intent on the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception only talk concerning that interests him and his thinking and pondering are in line with that and he associates with that kind of person and he finds satisfaction through him But when talk about the base of nothingness is going on he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his mind to understand it He does not associate with that kind of person and he does not find satisfaction through himSuppose a person has eaten some delicious food and thrown it upWhat do you think Sunakkhatta Could that man have any desire to eat that food againNo venerable sirWhy is thatBecause that food is considered repulsiveSo too Sunakkhatta when a person is intent on the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception his fetter of the base of nothingness has been rejectedHe should be understood as a person not bound by the fetter of the base of nothingness who is intent on the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionIt is possible Sunakkhatta that some person here may be completely intent on NibbanaWhen a person is completely intent on Nibbana only talk concerning that interests him and his thinking and pondering are in line with that and he associates with that kind of person and he finds satisfaction through him But when talk about the base of neitherperceptionnor nonperception is going on he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his mind to understand it He does not associate with that kind of person and he does not find satisfaction through himJust as a palm tree with its top cut off is incapable of growing again so too Sunakkhatta when a person is completely intent on Nibbana his fetter of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception has been cut off  cut off at the root made like a palm stump done away with so that it is no longer subject to future arisingHe should be understood as a person not bound by the fetter of the base of neitherperceptionnornon perception who is completely intent on NibbanaIt is possible Sunakkhatta that some bhikkhu here might think thus Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse the poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire lust and ill willThat arrow of craving has been removed from me the poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled I am one who is completely intent on NibbanaBecause he falsely thinks of himself thus he might pursue those things that are unsuitable for one completely intent on Nibbana He might pursue the sight of unsuitable forms with the eye he might pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable odours with the nose unsuitable flavours with the tongue unsuitable tangibles with the body or unsuitable mindobjects with the mindWhen he pursues the sight of unsuitable forms with the eyeunsuitable mindobjects with the mind lust invades his mindWith his mind invaded by lust he would incur death or deadly sufferingSuppose Sunakkhatta a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poisonThe surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knifeKnowing that a trace was left behind he would say Good man the arrow has been pulled out from you the poisonous humour has been expelled with a trace left behindEat only suitable food do not eat unsuitable food or else the wound may suppurateFrom time to time wash the wound and from time to time anoint its opening so that pus and blood do not cover the opening of the woundDo not walk around in the wind and sun or else dust and dirt may infect the opening of the woundTake care of your wound good man and see to it that the wound healsThe man would think The arrow has been pulled out from me the poisonous humour has been expelled with no trace left behindHe would eat unsuitable foodHe would not wash the wound from time to time nor would he anoint its opening from time to timeHe would walk around in the wind and sunHe would not take care of his wound nor would he see to it that the wound healsThen both because he does what is unsuitable and because the foul poisonous humour had been expelled with a trace left behindSo too Sunakkhatta it is possible that some bhikkhu here might think thus Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse the poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire lust and ill willBecause he falsely thinks of himself thusFor it is death in the Discipline of the Noble One Sunakkhatta when one abandons the training and reverts to the low life and it is deadly suffering when one commits some defiled offenceThat arrow of craving has been removed from me the poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled I am one who is completely intent on NibbanaBeing one who really is completely intent on Nibbana he would not pursue those things that are unsuitable for one completely intent on Nibbana He would not pursue the sight of unsuitable forms with the eye he would not pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable odours with the nose unsuitable flavours with the tongue unsuitable tangibles with the body or unsuitable mindobjects with the mindBecause he does not pursue the sight of unsuitable forms with the eyeunsuitable mindobjects with the mind lust does not invade his mindBecause his mind is not invaded by lust he would not incur death or deadly sufferingSuppose Sunakkhatta a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poisonThe surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knifeKnowing that no trace was left behind he would say Good man the arrow has been pulled out from you the poisonous humour has been expelled with no trace left behindEat only suitable food do not

left behindHe would eat only suitable foodFrom time to time he would wash the wound and from time to time he would anoint its openingHe would not walk around in the wind and sunHe would take care of his wound and would see to it that the wound healsThen both because he does what is suitable and because the foul poisonous humour has been expelled with no trace left behind the wound would healSo too Sunakkhatta it is possible that some bhikkhus here might think thus Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse the poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire lust and ill willBeing one who really is completely intent on Nibbana he would not pursue those things unsuitable for one completely intent on NibbanaSunakkhatta I have given this simile in order to convey a meaningThis is the meaning here Wound is a term for the six internal bases Poisonous humour is a term for ignorance Arrow is a term for craving Probe is a term for mindfulness Knife is a term for noble wisdom Surgeon is a term for the Tathagata the Accomplished One the Fully Enlightened OneWhen Sunakkhatta a bhikkhu practises restraint in the six bases of contact and having understood that attachment is the root of suffering is without attachment liberated by the destruction of attachment it is not possible that he would direct his body or arouse his mind towards any object of attachmentSuppose Sunakkhatta there were a bronze cup of beverage possessing a good colour smell and taste but it was mixed with poisonWhat do you think Sunakkhatta would that man drink that cup of beverage knowing If I drink this I will incur death or deadly suffering No venerable sir So too when a bhikkhu practises restraint in the six bases of contact and having understood that attachment is the root of suffering is without attachment liberated by the destruction of attachment it is not possible that he would direct his body or arouse his mind towards any object of attachmentSuppose Sunakkhatta there were a deadly poisonous snakeWhat do you think Sunakkhatta would that man give that deadly poisonous snake his hand or his thumb knowing If I am bitten by him I will incur death or deadly suffering No venerable sir So too when a bhikkhu practises restraint in the six bases of contact and having understood that attachment is the root of suffering is without attachment liberated by the destruction of attachment it is not possible that he would direct his body or arouse his mind towards any object of attachmentThat is what the Blessed One saidSunakkhatta son of the Licchavis was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel SanctuaryThen Talaputa the troupe headman approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideand said to him Venerable sir I have heard it said among actors of old in the lineage of teachers If an actor in the theatre or the arena entertains and amuses people by truth and lies then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devasEnough headman let it beDont ask me thatA second timeSurely headman I am not getting through to you when I say Enough headman let it be Dont ask me thatBut still I will answer youamong beings who are not yet free from lust who are bound by the bondage of lustamong beings who are not yet free from hatred who are bound by the bondage of hatredamong beings who are not yet free from delusion who are bound by the bondage of delusionThus being intoxicated and negligent himself having made others intoxicated and negligent with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the Hell of LaughterBut should he hold such a view as this If an actor in the theatre or the arena entertains and amuses people by truth and lies then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devasthat is a wrong view on his partFor a person with wrong view I say there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal realmWhen this was said Talaputa the troupe headman cried out and burst into tearsThe Blessed One said SO I did not get through to you when I said Enough headman let it be Dont ask me that I am not crying venerable sir because of what the Blessed One said to me but because I have been tricked cheated and deceived for a long time by those actors of old in the lineage of teachers who said If an actor in the theatre or the arena entertains and amuses people by truth and lies then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devasMagnificent venerable sir Magnificent venerable sirThe Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by the Blessed One as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down revealing what was hiddeashowing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsMay I receive the going forth under the Blessed One venerable sir may I receive the higher ordinationThen Talaputa the troupe headman received the going forth under the Blessed One he received the higher ordinationAnd soon not long after his higher ordination  the Venerable Talaputa became one of the arahantsWhat does the Blessed One say about thatand a third time Talaputa the troupe headman said Venerable sir I have heard it said among actors of old in the lineage of teachers What does the Blessed One say about thatIn the theatre or arena an actor entertains them with titillating things that excite them even more strongly to lustIn the theatre or arena an actor entertains them with infuriating things that excite them even more strongly to hatredIn the theatre or arena an actor entertains them with bewildering things that excite them even more strongly to delusionI go for refuge to the Blessed One and to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu SanghaThen the headman Yodhajiva the Mercenary approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side and said to him Venerable sir I have heard it said by mercenaries of old in the lineage of teachers When a mercenary is one who strives and exerts himself in battle if others slay him and finish him off while he is striving and exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the battleslain devasWhat does the Blessed One say about thatEnough headman let it be Dont ask me thatA second time and a third time Yodhajiva the headman said  Venerable sir I have heard it said by mercenaries of old in the lineage of teachers Surely headman I am not getting through to you when I say Enough headman let it be Dont ask me thatBut still I will answer youWhen headman a mercenary is one who strives and exerts himself in battle his mind is already low depraved misdirected by the thought let these beings be slain slaughtered annihilated destroyed or exterminatedIf others then slay him and finish him off while he is striving and exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the BattleSlain HellBut should he hold such a view as this When a mercenary strives and exerts himself in battle if others slay him and finish him off while he is striving and exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the battleslain devasthat is a wrong view on his partFor a person with wrong view I say there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal realmWhen this was said Yodhajiva the headman cried out and burst into tearsThe Blessed One said So I did not get through to you when I said Enough headman let it be Dont ask me thatI am not crying venerable sir because of what the Blessed One said to me but because I have been tricked cheated and deceived for a long time by those mercenaries of old in the lineage of teachers who said When a mercenary is one who strives and exerts himself in battle if others slay him and finish him off while he is striving and exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the battleslain devasMagnificent venerable sir  From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeWhat does the Blessed One say about thatBhikkhus for an immoral person for

enough for him to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyet unrealizedWhat fiveHere a forest bhikkhu reflects thus I am now dwelling all alone in the forestBut while I am living here a snake might bite me a scorpion might sting me or a centipede might sting me Because of that I might die which would be an obstacle for me Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizeThis is the first future peril considering which it is enough for a forest bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute  for the realization of the asyetunrealizedAgain a forest bhikkhu reflects thus I am now dwelling all alone in the forestBut while I am living here I might trip and fall down or the food that I have eaten might harm me or my bile or phlegm or sharp winds might become agitated in me Because of that I might die which would be an obstacle for me Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the asyet unattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizedThis is the second future peril considering which it is enough for a forest bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the realization of the asyetunrealizedAgain a forest bhikkhu reflects thus I am now dwelling all alone in the forestBut while I am living here I might encounter wild beasts such as a lion a tiger a leopard a bear or a hyena and they might take my life Because of that I would die which would be an obstacle for me Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizedThis is the third future peril considering which it is enough for a forest bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the realization of the asyetunrealizedAgain a forest bhikkhu

bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute  for the realization of the asyetunrealizedThese bhikkhus are the five future perils considering which it is enough for a forest bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizedand said to the Blessed One  I have heard venerable sir that a number of bhikkhus have declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed Onethere were some bhikkhus who declared final knowledge rightly and there were some who declared final knowledge because they overestimated themselvesTherein when bhikkhus declare final knowledge rightly their declaration is true But when bhikkhus declare final knowledge because they overestimate themselves the Tathagata thinks Let me teach them the DhammaTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Savatthi for almsThe venerable Rahula also dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe followed close behind the Blessed OneOnly material form Blessed One Only material form Sublime OneMaterial form Rahula and feeling perception formations and consciousnessThen the venerable Rahula considered thus Who would go into the town for alms today when personally admonished by the Blessed One  Thus he turned back and sat down at the root of a tree folding his legs crosswise setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness in front of himThe venerable Sariputta saw him sitting thereWhen mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is of great fruit and great benefitThen when it was evening the venerable Rahula rose from meditation and went to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to him he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One  Venerable sir how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that

outTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus I eat at a single session By so doing I am free from illness and affliction and I enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingCome bhikkhus eat at a single session By so doing you too will be free from illness and affliction and you will enjoy health strength and a comfortable abidingWhen this was said the venerable Bhaddali told the Blessed One Venerable sir I am not willing to eat at a single session for if I were to do so I might have worry and anxiety about itThen Bhaddali eat one part there where you are invited and bring away one part to eatBy eating in that way you will maintain yourselfVenerable sir I am not willing to eat in that way either for if I were to do so I might also have worry and anxiety about itThen when this training precept was being made known by the Blessed One the venerable Bhaddali publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus his unwillingness to undertake the trainingThen the venerable Bhaddali did not present himself to the Blessed One for the whole of that threemonth period of the Rains as he did not fulfil the training in the Teachers DispensationNow on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were engaged in making up a robe for the Blessed One thinking With his robe completed at the end of the three months of the Rains the Blessed One will set out wanderingThen the venerable Bhaddali went to those bhikkhus and exchanged greetings with themand when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideWith his robe completed at the end of the three months of the Rains the Blessed One will set out wanderingPlease friend Bhaddali give proper attention to your declaration Do not let it become more difficult for you later onYes friends he replied and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideVenerable sir may the Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the sake of restraint in the futureSurely Bhaddali a transgression overcame you in that like a fool confused and blundering when a training precept was being made known by me you publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus your unwillingness to undertake the trainingBhaddali this circumstance was not recognised by you The Blessed One is living at Savatthi and the Blessed One will know me thus The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who does not fulfil the training in the Teachers DispensationThis circumstance was not recognised by youAlso this circumstance was not recognised by you Many bhikkhus have taken up residence at Savatthi for the Rains and they too will know me thus The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who does not fulfil the training in the Teachers DispensationThis circumstance too was not recognised by youAlso this circumstance was not recognised by you Many bhikkhunis have taken up residence at Savatthi for the Rains and they too will know me thus The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who does not fulfil the training in the Teachers DispensationThis

Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the sake of restraint in the futureSurely Bhaddali a transgression overcame you in that like a fool confused and blundering when a training precept was being made known by me you publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus your unwillingness to undertake the trainingWhat do you think Bhaddali Suppose a bhikkhu here were one liberatedinbothways and I told him Come bhikkhu be a plank for me to walk across the mud Would he walk across himself or would he dispose his body otherwise or would he say NoNo venerable sirWhat do you think Bhaddali Suppose a bhikkhu here were one liberatedbywisdoma bodywitnessone attainedtoview one liberatedbyfaitha Dhammafollowera faithfollower and I told him Come bhikkhu be a plank for me to walk across the mud Wuld he walk across himself or would he dispose his body otherwise or would he say NoNo venerable sirWhat do you think Bhaddali Were you on that occasion one liberatedinbothways or one liberatedbywisdom or a bodywitness or one attainedtoview or one liberatedbyfaith or a Dhammafollower or a faithfollowerNo venerable sirBhaddali on that occasion were you not an empty hollow wrongdoerYes venerable sirVenerable sir a transgression overcame me in that like a fool confused and blundering when a training precept was being made known by the Blessed One I publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus my unwillingness to undertake the trainingVenerable sir may the Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the sake of restraint in the futureSurely Bhaddali a transgression overcame you in that like a fool confused and blundering when a training precept was being made known by me you publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus your unwillingness to undertake the trainingBut since you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we forgive youHere Bhaddali some bhikkhu does not fulfil the training in the Teachers DispensationHe considers thus Suppose I were to resort to a secluded resting place the forest the root of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle thicket an open space a heap of straw He resorts to some such secluded restingplaceWhile he lives thus withdrawn the Teacher censures him wise companions in the holy life who have made investigation censure him gods censure him and he censures himselfBeing censured in this way by the Teacher by wise companions in the holy life by gods and by himself he realises no superhuman state no distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesWhy is thatThat is how it is with one who does not fulfil the training in the Teachers DispensationHere Bhaddali some bhikkhu does fulfil the training in the Teachers DispensationHe considers thus Suppose I were to resort to a secluded resting place the forest the root of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle thicket an open space a heap of straw He resorts to some such secluded restingplaceWhile he lives thus withdrawn the Teacher does not censure him wise companions in the holy life who have made investigation do not censure him gods do not censure him and he does not censure himselfBeing uncensured in this way by the Teacher by wise companions in the holy life by gods and by himself he realises a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionWhy is thatThat is how it is with one who fulfils the training in the Teachers DispensationWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhanaWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified and bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbabilityWhy is thatThat is how it is with one who fulfils the training in the Teachers DispensationWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified and brightattained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsWhy is thatThat is how it is with one who fulfils the training in the Teachers DispensationWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified and brightattained to imperturbabilityhe directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints He understands as it actually is This is sufferingHe understands as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsWhen he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignoranceWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberatedHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingWhy is thatThat is how it is with one who fulfills the training in the Teachers DispensationThereupon the venerable Bhaddali asked Venerable sir what is the cause what is the reason why they take action against some bhikkhu here by repeatedly admonishing himWhat is the cause what is the reason why they do not take such action against some bhikkhu here by repeatedly admonishing himHere Bhaddali some bhikkhu is a constant offender with many offencesWhen he is corrected by the bhikkhus he prevaricates leads the talk aside shows disturbance hate and bitterness he does not proceed rightly he does not comply he does not clear himself he does not say Let me so act that the Sangha will be satisfiedBhikkhus taking account of this matter thinkBut here some bhikkhu is a constant offender with many offencesWhen he is corrected by the bhikkhus he does not prevaricate lead the talk aside or show disturbance hate and bitterness he proceeds rightly he complies he clears himself he says Let me so act that the Sangha will be satisfiedBhikkhus taking account of this matter thinkHere some bhikkhu is a chance offender without many offencesWhen he is corrected by the bhikkhus he prevaricates But here some bhikkhu is a chance offender without many offencesWhen he is corrected by the bhikkhus he does not prevaricateHere some bhikkhu progresses by a measure of faith and loveIn this case bhikkhus consider thus Friends this bhikkhu progresses by a measure of faith and loveLet him not lose that measure of faith and love as he may if we take action against him by repeatedly admonishing himSuppose a man had only one eye then his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives would guard his eye thinking Let him not lose his one eye So too some bhikkhu progresses by a measure of faith and loveVenerable sir what is the cause what is the reason why there were previously fewer training rules and more bhikkhus became established in final knowledgeWhat is the cause what is the reason why there are now more training rules and fewer bhikkhus become established in final knowledgeThat is how it is BhaddaliWhen beings are deteriorating and the true Dhamma is disappearing then there are more training rules and fewer bhikkhus become established in final knowledgeThe Teacher does not make known the training rule for disciples until certain things that are the basis for taints become manifest here in the Sanghabut when certain things that are the basis for taints become manifest here in the Sangha then the Teacher makes known the training rule for disciples in order to ward off those things that are the basis for taintsThose things that are the basis for taints do not become manifest here in the Sangha until the Sangha has reached greatnessbut when the Sangha has reached greatness then those things that are the basis for taints become manifest here in the SanghaThere were few of you Bhaddali when I taught the Dhamma through the simile of the young thoroughbred coltDo you remember that BhaddaliNo venerable sirTo what reason do you attribute thatVenerable sir I have long been one who did not fulfil the training in the Teachers DispensationThat is not the only cause or the only reasonBut rather by encompassing your mind with my mind I have long known you thus When I am teaching the Dhamma this misguided man does not heed it does not give it attention does not engage it with all his mind does not hear the Dhamma with eager earsStill Bhaddali I will teach you the Dhamma through the simile of the young thoroughbred coltListen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir the venerable Bhaddali repliedThe Blessed One said thisWhile the colt is being made to get used to wearing the bit because he is doing something that he has never done before he displays some contortion writhing and vacillationWhen the colt has become peaceful in that action the horse trainer further makes him get used to wearing the harnessWhile the colt is being made to get used to wearing the harness because he is doing something that he has never done before he displays some contortion writhing and vacillationWhen the colt has become peaceful in that action the horse trainer further makes him act in keeping in step in running in a circle in prancing in galloping in charging in the kingly qualities in the kingly heritage in the highest speed in the highest fleetness in the highest gentlenessWhile the colt is being made to get used to doing these things because he is doing something that he has never done before he displays some contortion writhing and vacillationWhen the colt has become peaceful in these actions the horsetrainer further rewards him with a rubbing down and a groomingWhen a fine thoroughbred colt possesses these ten factors he is worthy of the king in the kings service and considered one of the factors of a kingSo too Bhaddali when a bhikkhu possesses ten qualities he is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation an unsurpassed field of merit for the worldWhat are the tenHere Bhaddali a bhikkhu possesses the right view of one beyond training the right intention of one beyond training the right speech of one beyond training the right action of one beyond training the right livelihood of one beyond training the right effort of one beyond training the right mindfulness of one beyond training the right concentration of one beyond training the right knowledge of one beyond training and the right deliverance of one beyond training When a bhikkhu possesses these ten qualities he is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation an unsurpassed field of merit for the worldThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Bhaddali was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThere are Sunakkhatta these five cords of sensual pleasureand he were to see another man who had only recently left that village or townBhikkhus when a forest bhikkhu considers five future perils it is enough for him to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizedWhat fiveHere a bhikkhu reflects thus I am now young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of lifeBut there will come a time when old age assails this bodyNow when one is old overcome by old age it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas teaching it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle grovesBefore that unwished for undesirable disagreeable condition comes upon me let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizedThus when I am in that condition I will dwell at ease even though I am oldThis is the first future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute  for the realization of the asyetunrealizedBut there will come a time when illness assails this bodyNow when one is ill overcome by illness it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas teaching it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle grovesBefore that unwished for undesirable disagreeable condition comes upon me let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealized Thus when I am in that condition I will dwell at ease even though I am illThis is the second future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the realization of the asyetunrealizedAgain a bhikkhu reflects thus Food is now plentiful there has been a good harvest and almsfood is abundant so that one can easily subsist by means of gleaningBut there will come a time of famine a poor harvest when almsfood is hard to obtain and one cannot easily subsist by means of gleaningIn a time of famine people migrate to places where food is plentifulNow when living conditions are congested and crowded it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas teaching it is hot easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle grovesBefore that unwished for undesirable disagreeable condition comes upon me let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealized Thus when I am in that condition I will dwell at ease even in a famineThis is the third future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the realization of the asyetunrealized Again a bhikkhu reflects thus People are now dwelling in concord harmoniously without disputes blending like milk and water viewing each other with eyes of affectionBut there will come a time of peril of turbulence in the wilderness when the people of the countryside mounted on their vehicles flee on all sidesIn a time of peril people migrate to places where there is safetyand living conditions there are congested and crowdedBefore that unwished for undesirable disagreeable condition comes upon me let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealized Thus when I am in that condition I will dwell at ease even in time of perilThis is the fourth future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the realization of the asyetunrealizedAgain a bhikkhu reflects thus The Sahgha is now dwelling at ease in concord harmoniously without disputes with a single recitationBut there will come a time when there will be a schism in the SahghaNow when there is a schism in the Sahgha it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas teaching it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle grovesBefore that unwished for undesirable disagreeable condition comes upon me let me in advance arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealized Thus when I am in that condition I will dwell at ease even though there is a schism in the SahghaThis is the fifth future peril considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the realization of the asyetunrealizedThese bhikkhus are the five future perils considering which it is enough for a bhikkhu to dwell heedful ardent and resolute for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizedAgain a bhikkhu reflects thus I am now seldom ill or afflicted I possess an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for strivingand living conditions there are congested and crowdedNow When living conditions are congested and crowded it is not easy to attend to the Buddhas teaching it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in forests and jungle grovesBhikkhus there are these five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize themand make an effort to abandon themWhat fiveIn the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomThey will give full ordination to othersThese pupils too will be undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomThey in turn will give full ordination to othersThese pupils too will be undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomThus bhikkhus through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the DhammaThis is the first future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itAgain in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomThey will give dependence to othersThese pupils too will be undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomThey in turn will give dependence to othersThese pupils too will be undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomThus bhikkhus through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the DhammaThis is the second future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itAgain in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomWhile engaged in talk pertaining to the Dhamma in questions and answers they will slide down into a dark Dhamma but will not recognize itThus bhikkhus through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the DhammaThis is the third future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itAgain in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomWhen those discourses spoken by the Tathagata are being recited that are deep deep in meaning worldtranscending connected with emptiness they will not want to listen to them will not lend an ear to them or apply their minds to understand them they will not think those teachings should be studied and learnedBut when those discourses are being recited that are mere poetry composed by poets beautiful in words and phrases created by outsiders spoken by disciples they will want to listen to them lend an ear to them and apply their minds to understand them they will think those teachings should be studied and learnedThus bhikkhus through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the DhammaThis is the fourth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itAgain in the future there will be bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomThe elder bhikkhus being undeveloped in body virtuous behavior mind and wisdomwill be luxurious and lax leaders in backsliding discarding the duty of solitude they will not arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizedThose in the next generation will follow their exampleThey too will be luxurious and lax leaders in backsliding discarding the duty of solitude they too will not arouse energy for the attainment of the asyetunattained for the achievement of the asyetunachieved for the realization of the asyetunrealizedThus bhikkhus through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the DhammaThis is the fifth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itThese bhikkhus are the five future perils as yet unarisen

wisdombut will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior the higher mind and the higher wisdombut will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior the higher mind and the higher wisdomBhikkhus there are these five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize them and make an effort to abandon themWhat five In the future there will be bhikkhus who desire fine robesThey will give up the use of rag robes give up remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves and having converged upon the villages towns and capital cities will take up their residence there and they will engage in many kinds of wrong and improper searches for the sake of a robeThis is the first future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itAgain in the future there will be bhikkhus who desire fine almsfoodThey will give up going on alms round give up remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves and having converged upon the villages towns and capital cities will take up their residence there seeking the finest delicacies with the tips of their tongues and they will engage in m any kinds of wrong and improper searches for the sake of almsfoodThis is the second future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to

future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itAgain in the future there will be bhikkhus who bond closely with bhikkhunis female probationers and novicesWhen they form such close bonds it can be expected that they will live the spiritual life dissatisfied commit a certain defiled offense or give up the training and revert to the lower lifeThis is the fourth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itAgain in the future there will be bhikkhus who bond closely with monastery workers and novicesWhen they form such close bonds it can be expected that they will engage in the use of various kinds of storedup goods and give gross hints in regard to the ground and vegetationThis is the fifth future peril asyetunarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize it and make an effort to abandon itThese bhikkhus are the five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the futureYou should recognize them and make an effort to abandon thembut will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior the higher mind and the higher wisdomWhen he had done so they said to him Friend Bhaddali this robe is being made up for the Blessed Oneand said Venerable sir a transgression overcame me in that like a fool confused and blundering when a training precept was being made known by the Blessed One I publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus my unwillingness to undertake the trainingfor it is growth in the Noble Ones Discipline when one sees ones transgression as such and makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma by undertaking restraint for the futureperhaps I might realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesperhaps I might realise a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble oneshe directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past liveshe directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he understands how beings pass on according to their actionsThis is the cause this is the reason why they take action against some bhikkhu here by repeatedly admonishing himthis is the cause this is the reason why they do not take such action against some bhikkhu here by repeatedly admonishing himand his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives brought a surgeonthen he would probe for the arrow with a probethen he would pull out the arrow and would expel the poisonous humour leaving a trace of it behindbut it is incapable of harming youand it is incapable of harming meand the wound would suppurateand pus and blood would cover the opening of the woundand dust and dirt would infect the opening of the woundthe wound would swell and with its swelling he would incur death or deadly suffering Even if it should be pursued by knowledge for a hundred or a thousand years it would be with unthoughtof beginning with unknown beginning It wouldnt be possible to know its beginning from here or from there the meaning is that it is without a delimiting first or last pointSamsara is the uninterruptedly occurring succession of the aggregates etche might pursue those things that are unsuitable for one completely intent on NibbanaWith his mind invaded by lust he would incur death or deadly sufferingAnd the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such a way that the litigation against him is settled quicklyAnd the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such a way that the litigation against him is not settled too quicklyAnd the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such a way that the litigation against him is not settled too quicklyAnd the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such a way that the litigation against him is settled quicklyLet him not lose that measure of faith and love as he may if we take action against him by repeatedly admonishing himand then the Teacher makes known the training rule for disciples in order to ward off those things that are the basis for taintsThose things that are the basis for taints do not become manifest here in the Sangha until the Sangha has reached the acme of worldly gainthe acme of famethe acme of great learningthe acme of longstanding renownbut when the Sangha has reached the acme of longstanding renown then those things that are the basis for taints become manifest here in the Sangha and then the Teacher makes known the training rule for disciples in order to ward off those things that are the basis for taintsBhaddali suppose a clever horsetrainer obtains a fine thoroughbred colt He first makes him get used to wearing the bitbut through constant repetition and gradual practice he becomes peaceful in that actionbut through constant repetition and gradual practice he becomes peaceful in that actionbut through constant repetition and gradual practice he becomes peaceful in those actionsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the country of the Anguttarapans at a town of theirs named ApanaThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Apana for almsHaving entered the grove he sat down at the root of a tree for the days abidingWhen it was morning the venerable Udayin dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he too went into Apana for almsHaving entered the grove he sat down at the root of a tree for the days abidingThen while the venerable Udayin was alone in meditation the following thought arose in his mind How many painful states has the Blessed One rid us of How many pleasant states has the Blessed One brought us How many unwholesome states has the Blessed One rid us of How many wholesome states has the Blessed One brought usThen when it was evening the venerable Udayin rose from meditation went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one sideand told him  Here venerable sir while I was alone in meditation the following thought arose in my mind How many painful states has the Blessed One rid us of How many wholesome states has the Blessed One brought usVenerable sir formerly we used to eat in the evening in the morning and during the day outside the proper timeThen there was an occasion when the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus please abandon that daytime meal outside the proper timeVenerable sir I was upset and sad thinking Faithful householders give us good food of various kinds during the day outside the proper time yet the Blessed One tells us to abandon it the Sublime One tells us to relinquish itOut of our love and respect for the Blessed One and out of shame and fear of wrongdoing we abandoned that daytime meal outside the proper timeThen we ate only in the evening and in the morningThen there was an occasion when the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus please abandon that night meal which is outside the proper timeVenerable sir I was upset and sad thinking The Blessed One tells us to abandon the more sumptuous of our two meals the Sublime One tells us to relinquish itOnce venerable sir a certain man had obtained some soup during the day and he said Put that aside and we will all eat it together in the eveningNearly all cooking is done at night little by dayOut of our love and respect for the Blessed One and out of shame and fear of wrongdoing we abandoned that night meal which was outside the proper timeIt has happened venerable sir that bhikkhus wandering for alms in the thick darkness of the night have walked into a cesspit fallen into a sewer walked into a thornbush and fallen over a

this This recluse is much too exactingAnd they do not abandon that and they show discourtesy towards meas well as towards those bhikkhus desirous of training For them that thing becomes a strong stout tough unrotting tether and a thick yoke  Suppose Udayin a quail were tethered by a rotting creeper and would thereby expect injury captivity or deathNow suppose someone said The rotting creeper by which that quail is tethered and thereby expects injury captivity or death is for her a feeble weak rotting coreless tether Would he be speaking rightlyNo venerable sirFor that quail the rotting

found existing in the worldWhat are the fourHere Udayin some person practises the way to the abandoning of attachment to the relinquishing of attachmentWhen he is practising the way memories and intentions associated with attachment beset himHe tolerates them he does not abandon them remove them do away with them and annihilate themSuch a person I call fettered not unfetteredWhy is thatBecause I have known the particular diversity of faculties in this personHere Udayin some person practises the way to the abandoning of attachment to the relinquishing of attachmentWhen he is practising the way memories and intentions associated with attachment beset himHe does not tolerate them he abandons them removes them does away with them and annihilates themSuch a person too I call fettered not unfetteredWhy is thatBecause I have known the particular diversity of faculties in this personHere Udayin some person practises the way to the abandoning of attachment to the relinquishing of attachmentWhen he is practising the way memories and intentions associated with attachment beset him now and then through lapses of mindfulness His mindfulness may be slow in arisingbut he quickly abandons them removes them does away with them and annihilates themJust as if a man were to let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron plate heated for a whole day the falling of the water drops might be slowSuch a person too I call fettered not unfetteredWhy is thatBecause I have known the particular diversity of faculties in this personHere Udayin some person having understood that attachment is the root of suffering divests himself of attachment and is liberated with the destruction of attachmentSuch a person I call unfettered not fetteredWhy is thatBecause I have known the particular diversity of faculties in this personThere are Udayin five cords of sensual pleasureWhat are the fiveForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the ear Odours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongue Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lustThese are the five cords of sensual pleasureNow Udayin the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure  a filthy pleasure a coarse pleasure an ignoble pleasure I say of this kind of pleasure that it should not be pursued that it should not be developed that it should not be cultivated that it should be fearedHere Udayin quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana With the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhana With the fading away as well of rapture he enters upon and abides in the third jhanaWith the abandoning of pleasure and pain he enters upon and abides in the fourth jhanaThis is called the bliss of renunciation the bliss of seclusion the bliss of peace the bliss of enlightenment I say of this kind of pleasure that it should be pursued that it should be developed that it should be cultivated that it should not be fearedHere Udayin quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana Now this I say belongs to the perturbableAnd what therein belongs to the perturbableThe applied thought and sustained

I say also belongs to the perturbableAnd what therein belongs to the perturbableThe rapture and pleasure that have not ceased therein that is what belongs to the perturbableHere Udayin with the fading away as well of rapturea bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the third jhanaNow this I say also belongs to the perturbableAnd what therein belongs to the perturbableThe equanimity and pleasure that have not ceased therein that is what belongs to the perturbableHere Udayin with the abandoning of pleasure and pain a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana Now this I say belongs to the imperturbableHere Udayin quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana That I say is not enough Abandon it I say surmount it I sayAnd what surmounts itHere Udayin with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana That surmounts it But that too I say is not enough

say is not enoughAbandon it I say surmount it I sayAnd what surmounts itHere Udayin with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space That surmounts it But that too I say is not enough Abandon it I say surmount it I sayAnd what surmounts itHere Udayin by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness That surmounts it But that too I say is not enough Abandon it I say surmount it I sayAnd what surmounts itHere Udayin by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness That surmounts it But that too I say is not enough Abandon it I say surmount it I sayAnd what surmounts itHere Udayin

surmount it I sayAnd what surmounts itHere Udayin by completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception a bhikkhu enters and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling That surmounts it Thus I speak of the abandoning even of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionDo you see Udayin any fetter small or great of whose abandoning I do not speakNo venerable sirThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Udayin was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsWhen he had wandered for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to a certain grove for the days abidingWhen he had wandered for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to that same grove for the days abidingand screamed out in terror Mercy me a devil has come for meBetter bhikkhu that you get your belly cut open with a sharp butchers knife than this prowling for alms for your bellys sake in the thick darkness of the nightdo not abandon that and they show discourtesy towards meas well as towards those bhikkhus desirous of training For them that thing becomes a strong stout tough unrotting tether and a thick yokeIt is possible Sunakkhatta that some bhikkhu here might think thus Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse the poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire lust and ill willand his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives brought a surgeonthen he would probe for the arrow with a probe then he would pull out the arrowand would expel the poisonous humour without leaving a trace of it behindand it is incapable of harming youso that pus and blood do not cover the opening of the woundand it is incapable of harming meand the wound would not suppurateand pus and blood would not cover the opening of the woundFor them that thing becomes a feeble weak rotting coreless tetherdo not abandon that and they show discourtesy towards meFor them that thing becomes a feeble weak rotting coreless tetherbut they would quickly vaporise and vanishSo too here some person practises the wayHis mindfulness may be slow in arisingbut he quickly abandons them removes them does away with them and annihilates themTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Catuma in a myrobalan groveNow on that occasion five hundred bhikkhus headed by the venerable Sariputta and the venerable Maha Moggallana had come to Catuma to see the Blessed OneWhile the visiting bhikkhus were exchanging greetings with the resident bhikkhus and were preparing resting places and putting away their bowls and outer robes they were very loud and noisyThen the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda thus Ananda who are these loud noisy people One would think they were fishermen hawking fishVenerable sir they are five hundred bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and Moggallana who have come to Catuma to see the Blessed OneAnd while the visiting bhikkhus were exchanging greetings with the resident bhikkhus and were preparing resting places and putting away their bowls and outer robes they have been very loud and noisyThen Ananda tell those bhikkhus in my name that the Teacher calls the venerable onesYes venerable sir he replied and he went to those bhikkhus and told them The Teacher calls the venerable onesYes friend they replied and they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one sideWhen they had done so the Blessed One asked them Bhikkhus why are you so loud and noisy One would think you were fishermen hawking fishVenerable sir we are five hundred bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and Moggallana who have come to Catuma to see the Blessed OneAnd it was while we visiting bhikkhus were exchanging greetings with the resident bhikkhus and were preparing resting places and putting away our bowls and outer robes that we were very loud and noisyGo bhikkhus I dismiss you You cannot live with meYes venerable sir they replied and they rose from their seats and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on their right they put away the things in their resting places and taking their bowls and outer robes they departedNow on that occasion the Sakyans of Catuma had met together in their assembly hall for some business or otherSeeing the bhikkhus coming in the distance they went to them and asked Where are you going venerable sirsFriends the Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by the Blessed OneThen let the venerable ones be seated awhile Perhaps we shall be able to restore his confidenceYes friends they repliedThen the Sakyans of Catuma went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one sideand said Venerable sir let the Blessed One delight in the Sangha of bhikkhus venerable sir let the Blessed One welcome the Sangha of bhikkhusIf they get no opportunity to see the Blessed One there may take place in them some change or alterationVenerable sir just as when young seedlings get no water there may take place in them some change or alteration so too venerable sir there are new bhikkhus here just gone forth recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline If they get no opportunity to see the Blessed One there may take place in them some change or alterationVenerable sir just as when a young calf does not see its mother there may take place in it some change or alteration so too venerable sir there are new bhikkhus here just gone forth recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline If they get no opportunity to see the Blessed One there may take place in them some change or alterationVenerable sir let the Blessed One delight in the Sangha of the bhikkhus venerable sir let the Blessed One welcome the Sangha of bhikkhusThen the Brahma Sahampati knew with his mind the thought in the Blessed Ones mind so just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm he vanished in the Brahmaworld and appeared before the Blessed OneThen he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One he said  Venerable sir let the Blessed One delight in the Sangha of bhikkhus venerable sir let the Blessed One welcome the Sangha of bhikkhusThe Sakyans of Catuma and the Brahma Sahampati were able to restore the Blessed Ones confidence with the similes of the seedlings and the young calfThen the venerable Maha Moggallana addressed the bhikkhus thus Get up friends take your bowls and outer robesThe Blessed Ones confidence has been restored by the Sakyans of Catuma and the Brahma Sahampati with the similes of the seedlings and the young calfYes friend they replied and taking their bowls and outer robes they went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one sideWhen they had done so the Blessed One asked the venerable Sariputta What did you think Sariputta when the Sangha of bhikkhus was dismissed by meVenerable sir I thought thus The Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by the Blessed OneThe Blessed One will now abide inactive devoted to pleasant abiding here and now and we too shall now abide inactive devoted to pleasant abiding here and nowStop Sariputta stop Such a thought should not be entertamed by you againThen the Blessed One addressed the venerable Maha Moggallana What did you think Moggallana when the Sangha of bhikkhus was dismissed by meVenerable sir I thought thus The Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by the Blessed OneThe Blessed One will now abide inactive devoted to pleasant abiding here and now Now the venerable Sariputta and I shall lead the Sangha of bhikkhusGood good MoggallanaEither I shall lead the Sangha of bhikkhus or else Sariputta and Moggallana shall lead itThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of fears to be expected by those who go down to the waterWhat are the fourThey are fear of waves fear of crocodiles fear of whirlpools and fear of sharks These are the four kinds of fears to be expected by those who go down to the waterSo too bhikkhus there are four kinds of fears to be expected by certain persons who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness in this Dhamma and DisciplineWhat are the fourThey are fear of waves fear of crocodiles fear of whirlpools and fear of sharksWhat bhikkhus is fear of wavesHere some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness considering I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be knownThen after he has gone forth thus his companions in the holy life advise and instruct him thus You should move to and fro thus you should look ahead and look away thus you should flex and extend the limbs thus you should wear the patched cloak bowl and robes thusThen he thinks Formerly when we were in the home life we advised and instructed othersAnd so he forsakes the training and reverts to the low lifeHe is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of wavesNow waves is a term for angry despairWhat bhikkhus is fear of crocodilesHere some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness considering I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be knownThen after he has gone forth thus his companions in the holy life advise and instruct him thus This can be consumed by you this cannot be consumed by you this can be eaten by you this cannot be eaten by you this can be tasted by you this cannot be tasted by you this can be drunk by you this cannot be drunk by you You can consume what is allowable you cannot consume what is not allowable you can eat what is allowable you cannot eat what is not allowable you can taste what is allowable you cannot taste what is not allowable you can drink what is allowable you cannot drink what is not allowable You can consume food within the proper time you cannot consume food outside the proper time you can eat within the proper time you cannot eat outside the proper time you can taste food within the proper time you cannot taste food outside the proper time you can drink within the proper time you cannot drink outside the proper timeThen he thinks Formerly when we were in the home life we consumed what we liked and did not consume what we did not like we ate what we liked and did not eat what we did not like we tasted what we liked and did not taste what we did not like we drank what we liked and did not drink what we did not like We consumed what was allowable and what was not allowable we ate what was allowable and what was not allowable we tasted what was allowable and what was not allowable we drank what was allowable and what was not allowable We consumed food within the proper time and outside the proper time we ate within the proper time and outside the proper time we tasted food within the proper time and outside the proper time we drank within the proper time and outside the proper timeAnd so he forsakes the training and reverts to the low lifeHe is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of crocodilesNow crocodiles is a term for gluttonyWhat bhikkhus is fear of whirlpoolsHere some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness considering I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be knownThen after he has gone forth thus when it is morning he dresses and taking his bowl and outer robe he goes into a village or townfor alms with his body unguarded with his speech unguarded with mindfulness unestablished and with sense faculties unrestrained He sees some householder there or householders son furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure enjoying himself with themHe considers thus Formerly when we were in the home life we were furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure and we enjoyed ourselves with themMy family has wealthI can both enjoy wealth and make meritAnd so he forsakes the training and reverts to the low lifeNow whirlpools is a term for the five cords of sensual pleasureWhat bhikkhus is fear of sharksHere some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness considering I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be knownThen after he has gone forth thus when it is morning he dresses and taking his bowl and outer robe he goes into a village or town for almswith his body unguarded with his speech unguarded with mindfulness unestablished and with sense faculties unrestrained He sees a woman there lightly clothed lightly dressedWhen he sees such a woman lust infects his mindBecause his mind has been infected by lust he forsakes the training and reverts to the low lifeHe is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of sharksNow sharks is a term for womenBhikkhus these are the four kinds of fears to be expected by certain persons who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness in this Dhamma and DisciplineThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsvenerable sir let the Blessed One show compassion towards the Sangha of bhikkhus now as he used to show compassion towards it in the pastVenerable sir there are new bhikkhus here just gone forth recently come to this Dhamma and Disciplinevenerable sir let the Blessed One show compassion towards the Sangha of bhikkhus now as he used to show compassion towards it in the pastand now these bhikkhus who seem like they might be our sons or our grandsons think that they can advise and instruct usNow when faithful householders give us good food of various kinds during the day outside the proper time it seems these bhikkhus put a muzzle on our mouthsHe is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of whirlpoolsand dust and dirt would not infect the opening of the woundand because it had healed and was covered with skin he would not incur death or deadly sufferingBecause his mind is not invaded by lust he would not incur death or deadly sufferingand a man came who wanted to live not to die who wanted pleasure and recoiled from painand a man came who wanted to live not to die who wanted pleasure and recoiled from painThat arrow of craving has been removed from me the poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled I am completely intent upon NibbanaThat arrow of craving has been pulled out from me the poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled I am one who is completely intent on NibbanaTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kosalan country at Nalakapana in the Palasa GroveNow on that occasion many very wellknown clansmen had gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness under the Blessed One  the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Nandiya the venerable Kimbila the venerable Bhagu the venerable Kundadhana the venerable Revata the venerable Ananda and other very wellknown clansmenAnd on that occasion the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhusThen referring to those clansmen he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus those clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness under me  do they delight in the holy lifeWhen this was said those bhikkhus were silentA secondand a third time referring to those clansmen he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus those clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness under me  do they delight in the holy lifeFor a second and third time those bhikkhus were silentThen the Blessed One considered thus Suppose I question those clansmenThen he addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus Anuruddha do you all delight in the holy lifeSurely venerable sir we delight in the holy lifeGood good AnuruddhaIt is proper for all you clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness to delight in the holy lifeAs you are still endowed with the blessing of youth blackhaired young men in the prime of life you could have indulged in sensual pleasures yet you have gone forth from the home life into homelessnessIt is not because you have been driven by kings that you have gone forth from the home life into homelessness or because you have been driven by thieves or owing to debt fear or want of a livelihoodRather did you not go forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness after considering thus I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known Yes venerable sirWhat should be done Anuruddha by a clansman who has gone forth thusWhile he still does not attain to the rapture and pleasure that are secluded from sensual pleasures and secluded from unwholesome states or to something more peaceful than that covetousness invades his mind and remains ill will invades his mind and remains sloth and torpor invade his mind and remain restlessness and remorse invade his mind and remain doubt invades his mind and remains discontent invades his mind and remains weariness invades his mind and remainsThat is so while he still does not attain to the rapture and pleasure that are secluded from sensual pleasures and secluded from unwholesome states or to something more peaceful than thatWhen he attains to the rapture and pleasure that are secluded from sensual pleasures and secluded from unwholesome states or to something more peaceful than that covetousness does not invade his mind and remain ill will sloth and torporrestlessness and remorsedoubtdiscontent weariness does not invade his mind and remainThat is so when he attains to the rapture and pleasure that are secluded from sensual pleasures and secluded from unwholesome states or to something more peaceful than thatHow then Anuruddha do you all think of me in this way The Tathagata has not abandoned the taints that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death That is why the Tathagata uses one thing after reflecting endures another thing after reflecting avoids another thing after reflecting and removes another thing after reflectingNo venerable sir we do not think of the Blessed One in that wayGood good AnuruddhaThe Tathagata has abandoned the taints that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and death he has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingJust as a palm tree whose crown is cut off is incapable of further growth so too the Tathagata has abandoned the taints that defilecut them off at the root made them like a palm stump done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arisingWhat do you think Anuruddha What purpose does the Tathagata see that when a disciple has died he declares his reappearance thus Soandso has reappeared in suchandsuch a place soandso has reappeared in suchandsuch a placeVenerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One have the Blessed One as their resortIt would be good if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these wordsHaving heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember itAnuruddha it is not for the purpose of scheming to deceive people or for the purpose of flattering people or for the purpose of gain honour or renown or with the thought Let people know me to be thus that when a disciple has died the Tathagata declares his reappearance thus Soandso has reappeared in suchandsuch a place soandso has reappeared in suchandsuch a placeRather it is because there are faithful clansmen inspired and gladdened by what is loftyHere a bhikkhu hears thus The bhikkhu named soandso has died the Blessed One has declared of him He was established in final knowledgeAnd he has either seen that venerable one for himself or heard it said of him That

the destruction of three fetters she has become a streamenterer no longer subject to perdition bound for deliverance headed for enlightenmentAnd she has either seen that sister for herself or heard it said of her That sisters virtue was thus her state of concentration was thus her wisdom was thus her abiding in attainments was thus her deliverance was thusRecollecting her faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom she directs her mind to such a stateIn this way too a woman lay follower has a comfortable abidingSo Anuruddha it is not for the purpose of scheming to deceive people or for the purpose of flattering people or for the purpose of gain honour and renown or with the thought Let people know me to be thus that when a disciple has died the Tathagata declares his reappearance thus Soandso has reappeared in suchandsuch a place soandso has reappeared in suchandsuch a placeRather it is because there are faithful clansmen inspired and gladdened by what is loftyThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Anuruddha was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Kusinara in the Grove of OfferingsThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this  What do you think about me bhikkhus That the recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes Or that the recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of almsfood Or that the recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of a resting place Or that the recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of some better state of beingWe do not think thus about the Blessed One The recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes or for the sake of almsfood or for the sake of a resting place or for the sake of some better state of beingSo bhikkhus you do not think thus about me The recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robesor for the sake of some better state of being Then what do you think about meVenerable sir we think thus about the Blessed One The Blessed One is compassionate and seeks our welfare he teaches the Dhamma out of compassionSo bhikkhus you think thus about me The Blessed One is compassionate and seeks our welfare he teaches the Dhamma out of compassionSo bhikkhus these things that I have taught you after directly knowing them  that is the four foundations

should all train in concord with mutual appreciation without disputingWhile you are training in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing two bhikkhus might differ about the higher DhammaNow

without disputing some bhikkhu might commit an offence or a transgression  Now bhikkhus you should not hurry to reprove himIf such occurs to you bhikkhus it is proper to speakThen it may occur to you bhikkhus I shall not be troubled but the other person will be hurt for the other person is given to anger and revenge However he is not firmly attached to his view and he relinquishes easily and I can make that person emerge from the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesomeIt is a mere trifle that the other person will be hurtIf such occurs to you bhikkhus it is proper to speakThen it may

one cannot realise NibbanaIf others should ask that bhikkhu thus Was it the venerable one who made those bhikkhus emerge from the unwholesome and established them in the wholesomeAnswering rightly the bhikkhu would answer thus Here friends I went to the Blessed One The Blessed One taught me the Dhamma Having heard that Dhamma I spoke to those bhikkhusThe bhikkhus heard that Dhamma and they emerged from the unwholesome and became established in the wholesomeAnswering thus the bhikkhu neither exalts himself nor disparages others he answers in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from his assertionThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordswho when they hear that direct their minds to such a stateand that leads to their welfare and happiness for a long timehe directs his mind to such a stateIn this way too a bhikkhu has a comfortable abidinghe directs his mind to such a stateshe directs her mind to such a statewho when they hear that direct their minds to such a stateand that leads to their welfare and happiness for a long timeTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow on that occasion a bhikkhu named Gulissani a forestdweller of lax behaviour had come on a visit to stay in the midst of the Sangha for some business or otherThe venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus with reference to the bhikkhu Gulissani thusWhat has this venerable forestdweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest doing as he likes since he is disrespectful and undeferential towards his companions in the holy lifeSince there would be those who would say this of him a forestdwelling bhikkhu who has come to the Sangha and is living in the Sangha should be respectful and deferential towards his companions in the holy lifeWhen a forestdwelling bhikkhu comes to the Sangha and is living in the Sangha he should be skilled in good behaviour regarding seats thus I shall sit down in such a way that I do not encroach upon elder bhikkhus and do not deny new bhikkhus a seatIf he is

the Hall with the Peaked RoofNow on that occasion the wanderer Vacchagotta was staying in the Wanderers Park of the Single Whitelotus Mango TreeThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Vesall for almsThen the Blessed One thought It is still too early to wander for alms in Vesall Suppose I went to the wanderer Vacchagotta in the Wanderers Park of the Single Whitelotus Mango TreeThen the Blessed One went to the wanderer Vacchagotta in the Wanderers Park of the Single Whitelotus Mango TreeWelcome to the Blessed OneIt is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come hereLet the Blessed One be seated this seat is readyThe Blessed One sat down on the seat made readyVenerable sir do those who speak thus say what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from their assertionVaccha those who say thus do not say what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to factVenerable sir how should I answer that I may say what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact How may I explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from my assertionVaccha if you answer thus The recluse Gotama has the threefold true knowledge you will be saying what has been said by me and will not misrepresent me with what is contrary to factYou will explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from your assertionj  For in so far as I wish I recollect my manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars I recollect my manifold past livesAnd in so far as I wish with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and I understand how beings pass on according to their actionsIf you answer thus The recluse Gotama has the threefold true knowledge you will be saying what has been said by me and will not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact You will explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from your assertionWhen this was said the wanderer Vacchagotta asked the Blessed One Master Gotama is there any householder who without abandoning the fetter of householdership on the dissolution of the body has made an end of sufferingVaccha there is no householder who without abandoning the fetter of householdership on the dissolution of the body has made an end of sufferingMaster Gotama is there any householder who without abandoning the fetter of householdership on the dissolution of the body has gone to heavenVaccha there are not only one hundred or two or three or four or five hundred but far more householders who without abandoning the fetter of householdership on the dissolution of the body have gone to heavenVaccha there is no Ajivaka who on the dissolution of the body has made an end of sufferingMaster Gotama is there any Ajivaka who on the dissolution of the body has gone to heavenWhen I recollect the past ninetyone aeons Vaccha I do not recall any Ajivaka who on the dissolution of the body went to heaven with one exception and he held the doctrine of the moral efficacy of action the doctrine of the moral efficacy of deedsThat being so Master Gotama this fold of other sectarians is empty even of a chance of going to heavenThat being so Vaccha this fold of other sectarians is empty even of a chance of going to heavenThe wanderer Vacchagotta saw the Blessed One coming in the distanceand said to him Let the Blessed One come venerable sirand the wanderer Vacchagotta took a low seat sat down at one sideand said to the Blessed One  Venerable sir I have heard this The recluse Gotama claims to be omniscient and allseeing to have complete knowledge and vision thus Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to meAnd by realising for myself with direct knowledge I here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsMaster Gotama is there any Ajivaka who on the dissolution of the body has made an end of sufferingThat is what the Blessed One saidThe wanderer Vacchagotta was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Boars Cave on the mountain Vulture PeakThen the wanderer Dighanakha went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he stood at one sideThis view of yours Aggivessana Nothing is acceptable to me  is not at least that view acceptable to youIf this view of mine were acceptable to me Master Gotama it too would be the same it too would be the sameWell Aggivessana there are plenty in the world who say It too would be the same it too would be the sameThose are few in the world who say It too would be the same it too would be the sameAggivessana there are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Everything is acceptable to me There are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Nothing is acceptable to me And there are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this Something is acceptable to me something is not acceptable to meAmong these the view of those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view Everything is acceptable to me is close to lust close to bondage close to delighting close to holding close to clinging The view of those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view Nothing is acceptable to me is close to nonlust close to nonbondage close to nondelighting close to nonholding close to nonclingingWhen this was said the wanderer Dighanakha remarked Master Gotama commends my point of view Master Gotama recommends my point of view Aggivessana as to those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view Something is acceptable to me something is not acceptable to meNow Aggivessana a wise man among those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view Everything is acceptable to me considers thus If I obstinately adhere to my view Everything is acceptable to me and declare Only this is true anything else is wrong then I may clash with the two others with a recluse or brahmin who holds the doctrine and view Nothing is acceptable to me and with a recluse or brahmin who holds the doctrine and view Something is acceptable to me something is not acceptable to me I may clash with these twoand when there is a clash there are disputes when there are disputes there are quarrels when there are quarrels there is vexationForeseeing for himself clashes disputes quarrels and vexation he abandons that view and does not take up some other viewThis is how there comes to be the abandoning of these views this is how there comes to be the relinquishing of these viewsA wise man among those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view Nothing is acceptable to me considers thus If I obstinately adhere to my view Nothing is acceptable to me and declare Only this is true anything else is wrong then I may clash with the two others with a recluse or brahmin who holds the doctrine and view Everything is acceptable to me and with a recluse or brahmin who holds the doctrine and view Something is acceptable to me something is not acceptable to me I may clash with these twoand when there is a clash there are disputes when there are disputes there are quarrels when there are quarrels there is vexationForeseeing for himself clashes disputes quarrels and vexation he abandons that view and does not take up some other viewThis is how there comes to be the abandoning of these views this is how there comes to be the relinquishing of these viewsA wise man among those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view Something is acceptable to me something is not acceptable to me considers thus If I obstinately adhere to my view Something is acceptable to me something is not acceptable to me and declare Only this is true anything else is wrong then I may clash with the two others with a recluse or brahmin who holds the doctrine and view Everything is acceptable to me and with a recluse or brahmin who holds the doctrine and view Nothing is acceptable to me I may clash with these twoand when there is a clash there are disputes when there are disputes there are quarrels when there are quarrels there is vexationForeseeing for himself clashes disputes quarrels and vexation he abandons that view and does not take up some other viewThis is how there comes to be the abandoning of these views this is how there comes to be the relinquishing of these viewsNow Aggivessana this body made of material form consisting of the four great elements procreated by a mother and father and built up out of boiled rice and porridge is subject to impermanence to being worn and rubbed away to dissolution and disintegration It should be regarded as impermanent as suffering as a disease as a tumour as a dart as a calamity as an affliction as alien as disintegrating as void as not selfWhen one regards this body thus one abandons desire for the body affection for the body subservience to the bodyThere are Aggivessana three kinds of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingOn the occasion when one feels pleasant feeling one does not feel painful feeling or neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling on that occasion one feels only pleasant feelingOn the occasion when one feels painful feeling one does not feel pleasant feeling or neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling on that occasion one feels only painful feelingOn the occasion when one feels neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling one does not feel pleasant feeling or painful feeling on that occasion one feels only neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingPleasant feeling Aggivessana is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and ceasing Painful feeling too is impermanent conditioned dependency arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and ceasing Neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling too is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction vanishing fading away and ceasingSeeing thus a welltaught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with pleasant feeling disenchanted with painful feeling disenchanted with neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling Being disenchanted he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is liberatedWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberatedHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingA bhikkhu whose mind is liberated thus Aggivessana sides with none and disputes with none he employs the speech currently used in the world without adhering to itNow on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was standing behind the Blessed One fanning himThen he thought The Blessed One indeed speaks of the abandoning of these things through direct knowledge the Sublime One indeed speaks of the relinquishing of these things through direct knowledgeAs the venerable Sariputta considered this through not clinging his mind was liberated from the taintsBut in the wanderer Dighanakha the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose All that is subject to arising is subject to cessationThe wanderer Dighanakha saw the Dhamma attained the Dhamma understood the Dhamma fathomed the Dhamma he crossed beyond doubt did away with perplexity gained intrepidity and became independent of others in the Teachers DispensationThen he said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusFrom today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeand said to the Blessed One Master Gotama my doctrine and view is this Nothing is acceptable to me the view of theirs as to what is acceptable is close to lust close to bondage close to delighting close to holding close to clinging while the view of theirs as to what is not acceptable is close to nonlust close to nonbondage close to nondelighting close to nonholding close to nonclingingyet they do not abandon that view and they take up still some other viewand who abandon that view and do not take up some other viewNow on that occasion the Buddha the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi treethe tree of awakeningnewly fully awakenedThen he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseThen in the first watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in forward and reverse order From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth From birth as a requisite condition then agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering  stressFrom the remainderless fading and cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth From the cessation of birth then agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair all cease Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering  stressThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAs phenomena grow clearto the brahmanardent in jhānahis doubts all vanishwhen he discerns a phenomenon with its cause Ud Then in the middle watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in forward and reverse order From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform  Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering  stress  Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering  stressThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAs phenomena grow clearto the brahmanardent in jhānahis doubts all vanishwhen he penetrates the ending of requisite conditions Ud Then in the last watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in forward and reverse order From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform  Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering  stress  Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering  stressThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAs phenomena grow clearto the brahmanardent in jhānahe stands routing Māras armyas the sun illumining the sky Ud The Discussion of the Bodhi is finishedTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkNow on that occasion the wanderer Sandaka was staying in the Pilakkhatree Cave with a large assembly of wanderersThen when it was evening the venerable Ananda rose from meditation and addressed the bhikkhus thus Come friends let us go to the Devakata Pool to see the cave Yes friend those bhikkhus repliedThen the venerable Ananda went to the Devakata Pool together with a number of bhikkhusNow on that occasion the wanderer Sandaka was seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar loudly and noisily talking many kinds of pointless talk such as talk of kings robbers ministers armies dangers battles food drink clothing beds garlands perfumes relatives vehicles villages towns cities countries women heroes streets wells the dead trifles the origin of the world the origin of the sea whether things are so or are not soThen the wanderer Sandaka saw the venerable Ananda coming in the distanceSeeing him he quieted his own assembly thus Sirs be quiet sirs make no noise Here comes the recluse Ananda a disciple of the recluse GotamaThese venerable ones like quiet they are disciplined in quiet they commend quiet Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one he will think to join usThen the wanderers became silentThe venerable Ananda went to the wanderer Sandakawho said to him Let Master Ananda comeWelcome to Master AnandaIt is long since Master Ananda found an opportunity to come hereLet Master Ananda be seated this seat is readyThe venerable Ananda sat down on the seat made readyWhen he had done so the venerable Ananda asked him For what discussion are you sitting together here now Sandaka And what was your discussion that was left unfinishedMaster Ananda let be the discussion for which we are now sitting together hereMaster Ananda can well hear about it laterIt would be good if Master Ananda would give a talk on his own teachers DhammaThen Sandaka listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes sir he repliedThe venerable Ananda said this  Sandaka these four ways that negate the living of the holy life have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened and also these four kinds of holy life without consolation have been declared wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life or if he should live it would not attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeBut Master Ananda what are those four ways that negate the living of the holy life that have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life or if he should live it would not attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeHere Sandaka some teacher holds such a doctrine and view as this There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit or result of good and bad actions no this world no other world no mother no father no beings who are reborn spontaneously no good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other worldA person consists of the four great elements When he dies earth returns and goes back to the body of earth water returns and goes back to the body of water fire returns and goes back to the body of fire air returns and goes back to the body of air the faculties are transferred to spaceFour men with the bier as fifth carry away the corpse The funeral orations last as far as the charnel groundthe bones whitenburnt offerings end with ashes Giving is a doctrine of foolsWhen anyone asserts doctrine that there is giving and the like it is empty false prattleFools and the wise are alike cut off and annihilated with the dissolution of the body after death they do not existAbout this a wise man considers thus This good teacher holds this doctrine and view There is nothing givenIf this good teachers words are true then here in this teaching I have done my duty by not doing it here I have lived the holy life by not living itBoth of us are exactly equal here in this teaching both have arrived at equality yet I do not say that both of us are cut off and annihilated with the dissolution of the body that after death we shall not existBut it is superfluous for this good teacher to go about naked to be shaven to exert himself in the squatting posture and to pull out his hair and beard since I who live in a house crowded with children who use Benares sandalwood who wear garlands scents and unguents and accept gold and silver shall reap exactly the same destination the same future course as this good teacherWhat do I know and see that I should lead the holy life under this teacherSo when he finds that this way negates the living of the holy life he turns away from it and leaves itThis is the first way that negates the living of the holy life that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life or if he should live it would not attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeAgain Sandaka here some teacher holds such a doctrine and view as this When one acts or makes others act when one mutilates or makes others mutilate when one tortures or makes others inflict torture when one inflicts sorrow or makes others inflict sorrow when one oppresses or makes others inflict oppression when one intimidates or makes others inflict intimidation when one kills living beings takes what is not given breaks into houses plunders wealth commits burglary ambushes highways seduces anothers wife utters falsehood  no evil is done by the doerIf with a razorrimmed wheel one were to make the living beings on this earth into one mass of flesh into one heap of flesh because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evilIf one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing and slaughtering mutilating and making others mutilate torturing and making others inflict torture because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evilIf one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving gifts and making others give gifts making offerings and making others make offerings because of this there would be no merit and no outcome of meritBy giving by taming oneself by restraint by speaking truth there is no merit and no outcome of meritAbout this a wise man considers thus This good teacher holds this doctrine and view When one actsIf this good teachers words are true then here in this teaching I have done my duty by not doing it here I have lived the holy life by not living itBoth of us are exactly equal here in this teaching both have arrived at equality yet I do not say that whatever both of us do no evil is doneBut it is superfluous for this good teacherSo when he finds that this way negates the living of the holy life he turns away from it and leaves itThis is the second way that negates the living of the holy life that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedAbout this a wise man considers thus This good teacher holds this doctrine and view There is no causeIf this good teachers words are true then here in this teaching I have done my duty by not doing it here I have lived the holy life by not living itBoth of us are exactly equal here in this teaching both have arrived at equality yet I do not say that both of us will be purified without cause or conditionWhat do I know and see that I should lead the holy life under this teacherSo when he finds that this way negates the living of the holy life he turns away from it and leaves itThis is the third way that negates the living of the holy life that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedAgain Sandaka here some teacher holds such a doctrine and view as this There are these seven bodies that are unmade not brought forth uncreated without a creator barren standing like mountain peaks standing like pillarsThey do not move or change or obstruct each other None is able to arouse pleasure or pain or pleasureandpain in anotherWhat are the sevenThey are the earthbody the waterbody the firebody the airbody pleasure pain and the soul as the seventh These seven bodies are unmadeThere are these fourteen hundred thousand principal kinds of generation and sixty hundred kinds and six hundred kinds there are five hundred kinds of action and five kinds of action and three kinds of action and action and halfaction there are sixtytwo ways sixtytwo subaeons six classes eight planes of man fortynine hundred kinds of livelihood fortynine kinds of wanderers fortynine hundred abodes of serpents twenty hundred faculties thirty hundred hells thirtysix elements of dust seven percipient breeds seven nonpercipient breeds seven sheathless breeds seven kinds of gods seven kinds of men seven kinds of demons seven lakes seven knots seven kinds of chasms seven hundred kinds of chasms seven kinds of dreams seven hundred kinds of dreams and there are eightyfour hundred thousand great aeons wherein by running and wandering through the round of rebirths fools and the wise both will make an end of sufferingThere is none of this By this virtue or observance or asceticism or holy life I shall make unripened action ripen or annihilate ripened action as it comesPleasure and pain are meted out The round of rebirths is limited there is no shortening or extending it no increasing or decreasing itJust as a ball of string when thrown goes as far as the string unwinds so too by running and wandering through the round of rebirths fools and the wise both will make an end of sufferingAbout this a wise man considers thus This good teacher holds this doctrine and view There are these seven bodiesIf this good teachers words are true then here in this teaching I have done my duty by not doing it here I have lived the holy life by not living itBoth of us are exactly equal here in this teaching both have arrived at equalityyet I do not say that both of us will make an end of suffering by running and wandering through the round of rebirthsWhat do I know and see that I should lead the holy life under this teacherSo when he finds that this way negates the living of the holy life he turns away from it and leaves itThis is the fourth way that negates the living of the holy life that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedIt is wonderful Master Ananda it is marvellousHere Sandaka some teacher claims to be omniscient and allseeing to have complete knowledge and vision thus Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to meHe enters an empty house he gets no almsfood a dog bites him he meets with a wild elephant a wild horse a wild bull he asks the name and clan of a woman or a man he asks the name of a village or a town and the way to go thereWhen he is questioned How is this  he replies I had to enter an empty house that is why I entered it I had to get no almsfood that is why I did not get any I had to be bitten by a dog that is why I was bitten I had to meet with a wild elephant a wild horse a wild bull that is why I met with them I had to ask the name and clan of a woman or a man that is why I asked I had to ask the name of a village or a town and the way to go there that is why I askedAbout this a wise man considers thus This good teacher claims to be omniscient and allseeing to have complete knowledge and visionWhen he is questioned How is this  he replies I had tothat is why I askedSo when he finds that this holy life is without consolation he turns away from it and leaves itThis is the first kind of holy life without consolation that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life or if he should live it would not attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeAgain Sandaka here some teacher is a traditionalist one who regards oral tradition as truthBut when a teacher is a traditionalist one who regards oral tradition as truth some is well remembered and some is wrongly remembered some is true and some is otherwiseAbout this a wise man considers thus This good teacher is a traditionalistSo when he finds that this holy life is without consolation he turns away from it and leaves itThis is the second kind of holy life without consolation that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedHe teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following a line of inquiry as it occurs to himBut when a teacher is a reasoner an inquirer some is well reasoned and some is wrongly reasoned some is true and some is otherwiseAbout this a wise man considers thus This good teacher is a reasonerSo when he finds that this holy life is without consolation he turns away from it and leaves itThis is the third kind of holy life without consolation that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedBecause he is dull and confused when he is asked such and such a question he engages in verbal wriggling in eelwriggling I dont say it is like this And I dont say it is like that And I dont say it is otherwise And I dont say it is not so And I dont say it is not not soAbout this a wise man considers thus This good teacher is dull and confusedThis is the fourth kind of holy life without consolation that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedIt is wonderful Master Ananda it is marvellousBut Master Ananda what does that teacher assert what does he declare wherein a wise man certainly would live the holy life and while living it would attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeHere Sandaka a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightenedhe purifies his mind from doubt  Having thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionA wise man certainly would live the holy life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty distinction and while living it he would attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeAgain with the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhanaWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsas Sutta  Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesA wise man certainly would live the holy life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty distinctionA wise man certainly would live the holy life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty distinctionHe understands as it actually is This is sufferingHe understands as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsWhen he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from taint of ignoranceWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberatedHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingA wise man certainly would live the holy life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty distinction and while living it he would attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeBut Master Ananda when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed one who has lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and is completely liberated through final knowledge could he enjoy sensual pleasuresSandaka when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed and is completely liberated through final knowledge he is incapable of transgression in five casesA bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is incapable of deliberately depriving a living being of life he is incapable of taking what is not given that is of stealing he is incapable of indulging in sexual intercourse he is incapable of knowingly speaking falsehood he is incapable of enjoying sensual pleasures by storing them up as he did formerly in lay lifeBut Master Ananda when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed is his knowledge and vision that his taints are destroyed continuously and uninterruptedly present to him whether he is walking or standing or sleeping or awakeAs to that Sandaka I shall give you a simile for some wise men here understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simileSuppose a mans hands and feet were cut off Would he know My hands and feet are cut off continuously and uninterruptedly whether he is walking or standing or sleeping or awake or would he know My hands and feet are cut off only when he reviews this factThe man Master Ananda would not know My hands and feet are cut off continuously and uninterruptedly rather he would know My hands and feet are cut off only when he reviews this factSo too Sandaka when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyedhis knowledge and vision that his taints are destroyed is not continuously and uninterruptedly present to him whether he is walking or standing or sleeping or awake rather he knows My taints are destroyed only when he reviews this factHow many emancipated are there in this Dhamma and Discipline Master AnandaThere are not only one hundred Sandaka or two hundred three hundred four hundred or five hundred but far more emancipated ones than that in this Dhamma and DisciplineIt is wonderful Master Ananda it is marvellousThere is no lauding of ones own Dhamma and no disparaging of the Dhamma of others there is the teaching of the Dhamma in its full range and so many emancipated ones appearBut these Ajivakas those mothers dead sons laud themselves and disparage others and they recognise only three emancipated ones namely Nanda Vaccha Kisa Sankicca and Makkhali GosalaThen the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assembly Go sirs The holy life is to be lived under the recluse GotamaIt is not easy for us now to give up gain honour and renownThat is how the wanderer Sandaka exhorted his own assembly to live the holy life under the Blessed Oneone of the recluse Gotamas disciples staying in Kosambiand the wanderer Sandaka took a low seat and sat down at one sideafter death they do not existthere is no merit and no outcome of meritWhat do I know and see that I should lead the holy life under this teacherAgain Sandaka here some teacher holds such a doctrine and view as this There is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings beings are defiled without cause or condition There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings beings are purified without cause or condition There is no power no energy no manly strength no manly endurance All beings all living things all creatures all souls are without mastery power and energy moulded by destiny circumstance and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six classesin the six classesBut it is superfluous for this good teacherEven those who cut off someones head with a sharp sword do not deprive anyone of lifethe sword merely passes through the space between the seven bodiesHerein there is no killer no slaughterer no hearer no speaker no cognizer no intimaterfools and the wise both will make an end of sufferingBut it is superfluous for this good teacher to go about naked to be shaven to exert himself in the squatting position and to pull out his hair and beard since I who live in a house crowded with children who use Benares sandalwood who wear garlands scents and unguents and accept gold and silver shall reap exactly the same destination the same future course as this good teacherThese Sandaka are the four ways that negate the living of the holy life that have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life or if he should live it would not attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomehow the four ways that negate the living of the holy life have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees

enlightened wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life or if he should live it would not attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomehe teaches a Dhamma by oral tradition by legends handed down by what has come down in scripturessome is true and some is otherwiseAgain Sandaka here a certain teacher is a reasoner an inquirersome is true and some is otherwiseAgain Sandaka here a certain teacher is dull and confusedSo when he finds that this holy life is without consolation he turns away from it and leaves itthus he engages in verbal wriggling in eelwrigglingThese Sandaka are the four kinds of holy life without consolation that have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life or if he should live it would not attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomehow the four kinds of holy life without consolation have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees

disputelet them not fall into a disputeA wise man certainly would live the holy life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty distinctionWith the abandoning of pleasure and painhe enters upon and abides in the fourth jhanaWith the fading away as well of rapturehe enters upon and abides in the third jhanaWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingslet them not fall into a disputelet them not fall into a

how beings pass on according to their actionsWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taintslet the venerable ones not fall into a disputelet the venerable ones not fall into a disputeWhen a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyedhe is incapable of transgression in these five casesThen with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration the Blessed One went from the root of the Bodhi treethe tree of awakeningto the Goatherds Banyan tree and sat at the root of the Goatherds Banyan tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseThen a certain overbearing brahman went to the Blessed One andAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One To what extent Master Gotama is one a brahman And which are the qualities that make one a brahmanThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAny brahman who has banished evil qualitiesnot overbearing not stained his mind controlledgone to the end of wisdom the holy life completedRightly would that brahman speak the holy teachingHe has no swelling of pride anywhere in the world Ud The Discussion of the Goatherds Banyan Tree is finishedThen with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration the Blessed One went from the root of the Goatherds Banyan tree to the Mucalinda and sat at the root of the Mucalinda tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseAnd on that occasion a great outofseason stormcloud rose up with seven days of rainy weather cold winds  intense darknessThen Muccalinda the nāga kingleaving his dwelling place and encircling the Blessed Ones body seven times with his coilsstood with his great hood spread over the Blessed One Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by cold Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by heat Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  creeping thingsThen with the passing of seven days Muccalinda the nāga king realizing that the sky had cleared and was free of clouds unraveled his coils from the body of the Blessed One abandoned his own appearance and assuming the appearance of a young man stood in front of the Blessed One with hands before his heart paying homageThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedBlissful is solitude for one whos content who has heard the Dhamma who seesBlissful is nonaffliction with regard for the world restraint for living beingsBlissful is dispassion with regard for the world the overcoming of sensualityBut the subduing of the conceit I am That is truly the ultimate blissThe Discussion of the Mucalinda is finishedThen with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration the Blessed One went from the root of the Mucalinda to the Rājāyatana and sat at the root of the Rājāyatana tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseNow on that occasion the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were traveling on the road from Ukkalā to that districtThen a devatā who had been a bloodrelative of Tapussa and Bhallika said to the merchants There is the Blessed One my dears staying at the root of the Rājāyatana tree newly fully awakened Go and serve the Blessed One cooked grainmeal and honey balls That will be for your longterm welfare  happinessThen the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika taking cooked grainmeal and honey balls went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one sideAs they were standing there the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika said to the Blessed One Lord May the Blessed One accept our cooked grainmeal and honey balls for that will be for our longterm welfare  happinessThen the thought occurred to the Blessed One Tathāgatas do not accept things with their handsHow shall I accept the cooked grainmeal and honey ballsThen the Four Great Kings having known with their awareness the train of thought in the Blessed Ones awareness presented four stone bowls from the four directions to the Blessed One May the Blessed One accept the cooked grainmeal and honey balls here in the bowlsThe Blessed One accepted the exquisite stone bowls and the cooked grainmeal and honey balls Having accepted them he consumed themThen the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika ME knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl fell down with their heads at the Blessed Ones feet and said to the Blessed One We go to the Blessed One for refuge  to the Dhamma May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeAnd they were the first twostatementlay followers in the worldThe Discussion of the Rājāyatana is finishedThen with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration the Blessed One went from the root of the Rājāyatana tree to the Goatherds Banyan treeHe stayed there at the root of the Goatherds Banyan treeThen while he was alone and in seclusion this line of thinking arose in his awareness This Dhamma that I have attained is deep hard to see hard to realize peaceful refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseBut this generation delights in attachment is excited by attachment enjoys attachmentFor a generation delighting in attachment excited by attachment enjoying attachment these things are hard to see thisthat conditionality and dependent coarising This state too is very hard to see the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingAnd if I were to teach the Dhamma and if others would not understand me that would be tiresome for me troublesome for meJust then these verses unspoken in the past unheard before occurred to the Blessed OneEnough now with teaching what only with difficulty I reachedThis Dhamma is not easily realized by those overcome with aversion  passionWhat is fine subtle deep hard to see going against the flowthose delighting in passion cloaked in the mass of darkness wont seeAs the Blessed One reflected thus his mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the DhammaThen Brahmā Sahampati having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed Ones awareness thought The world is lost The world is destroyed In that the mind of the Tathāgata the Arahant the Rightly Selfawakened One inclines to dwelling at ease not to teaching the DhammaThen just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Brahmā Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmāworld and reappeared in front of the Blessed OneArranging his upper robe over one shoulder he knelt down with his right knee on the ground saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart and said to him Lord let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma Let the One WellGone teach the DhammaThere are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma There will be those who will understand the DhammaThat is what Brahmā Sahampati said Having said that he further said thisIn the past there appeared among the Magadhansan impure Dhamma devised by the stainedThrow open the door to the DeathlessLet them hear the Dhamma realized by the Stainless OneJust as one standing on a rocky cragmight see people all around belowSo O wise one with allaround visionascend the palace fashioned of the DhammaFree from sorrow behold the peoplesubmerged in sorrow oppressed by birth  agingRise up hero victor in battleO Caravanleader wander without debt in the worldTeach the Dhamma O Blessed OneThere will be those who will understandWhen that was said the Blessed One said to Brahmā Sahampati To me Brahmā this thought occurred This Dhamma that I have attained is deep A second time the Blessed One said to Brahmā Sahampati Brahmā this thought occurred to me This Dhamma that I have attained is deep As I reflected thus Brahmā my mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the DhammaA third time Brahmā Sahampati said to the Blessed One Lord let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma  Teach the Dhamma O Blessed OneThen the thought occurred to the Blessed One To whom should I teach the Dhamma firstWho will quickly understand this DhammaThen the thought occurred to him This ḷāra Kālāma is wise competent intelligent He has long had little dust in his eyes What if I were to teach him the Dhamma first He will quickly understand this DhammaThen an invisible devatā informed the Blessed One Lord ḷāra Kālāma died seven days agoAnd knowledge  vision arose within him ḷāra Kālāma died seven days agoThe thought occurred to him A great loss has ḷāra Kālāma suffered If he had heard this Dhamma he would have quickly understood itThen the thought occurred to the Blessed One To whom should I teach the Dhamma firstWho will quickly understand this DhammaThen the thought occurred to him This Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise competent intelligent He has long had little dust in his eyes What if I were to teach him the Dhamma first He will quickly understand this DhammaThen an invisible devatā informed the Blessed One Lord Uddaka Rāmaputta died last nightAnd knowledge  vision arose within him Uddaka Rāmaputta died last nightThe thought occurred to him A great loss has Uddaka Rāmaputta suffered If he had heard this Dhamma he would have quickly understood itThen the thought occurred to the Blessed One To whom should I teach the Dhamma firstWho will quickly understand this DhammaThen the thought occurred to him They were very helpful to me the group of five monks who attended to me when I was resolute in exertion What if I were to teach them the Dhamma firstThen the thought occurred to the Blessed One Where is the group of five monks staying nowAnd with the divine eye purified  surpassing the human he saw that they were staying near Bārāṇasī at the Deer Park in IsipatanaThen having stayed at Uruvelā as long as he liked the Blessed One set out to wander by stages to BārāṇasīUpaka the jīvaka saw the Blessed One traveling on the road between Gayā and the Awakening and on seeing him said to him Clear my friend are your faculties Pure your complexion and brightOn whose account have you gone forthWho is your teacherIn whose Dhamma do you delightWhen this was said the Blessed One replied to Upaka the jīvaka in versesAllvanquishing allknowing am Iwith regard to all things unadheringAllabandoning released in the ending of cravinghaving fully known on my own to whom should I point as my teacher Dhp I have no teacher and one like me cant be foundIn the world with its devas I have no counterpartFor I am an arahant in the world I the unexcelled teacherI alone am rightly selfawakened Cooled am I unboundTo set rolling the wheel of Dhamma I go to the city of the KasisIn a world become blind I beat the drum of the DeathlessUpaka From your claims my friend you deserve to be an infinite conquerorConquerors are those like me who have reached fermentations endIve conquered evil qualities and so Upaka Im a conquerorWhen this was said Upaka said May it be so my friend andshaking his head taking a sideroadhe leftThen wandering by stages the Blessed One arrived at Bārāṇasī at the Deer Park in Isipatana and went to where the group of five monks were stayingFrom afar they saw him coming and on seeing him made a pact with one another Friends here comes Gotama the contemplative living luxuriously straying from his exertion backsliding into abundanceHe doesnt deserve to be bowed down to to be greeted by standing up or to have his robe  bowl received Still a seat should be set out if he wants to he can sit downBut as the Blessed One approached unable to keep to their pact the group of five monks went out to greet the Blessed OneOne received his robe  bowl Another laid out a seat Another set out water for washing his feet a footstand and a pebble foot wiperThe Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out Having sat down he washed his feetStill they addressed the Blessed One by name and as friendWhen this was said the Blessed One said to them Dont address the Tathāgata by name and as friendThe Tathāgata monks is a worthy one rightly selfawakened Lend ear monks the Deathless has been attained I will instruct you I will teach you the DhammaPracticing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which sons of good families rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  nowWhen this was said the group of five monks replied to Blessed One But friend Gotama by that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one So how can you nowliving luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundancehave attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble oneWhen this was said the Blessed One replied to them The Tathāgata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundance The Tathāgata monks is a worthy one rightly selfawakenedLend ear monks the Deathless has been attained I will instruct you I will teach you the DhammaPracticing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  nowA second time the group of five monks replied to Blessed One A second time the Blessed One replied to them A third time the group of five monks said to the Blessed One But friend Gotama by that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one So how can you nowliving luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundancehave attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble oneWhen this was said the Blessed One replied to the group of five monks Monks do you remember my ever saying this before nowNo lordThe Tathāgata monks is a worthy one rightly selfawakened Lend ear monks the Deathless has been attained I will instruct you I will teach you the DhammaPracticing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  nowAnd so the Blessed One was able to convince themThen the group of five monks were eager to listen to the Blessed One They lent their ears and set their minds for the sake of knowledgeThen he addressed the group of five monks SN These two extremes are not to be indulged in by one who has gone forththat which is devoted to sensual pleasure in sensuality base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitableAvoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathāgataproducing vision producing knowledgeleads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingAnd what is the middle way realized by the Tathāgata thatproducing vision producing knowledgeleads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingPrecisely this Noble Eightfold Path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThis is the middle way realized by the Tathāgata thatproducing vision producing knowledgeleads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingNow this monks is

explanation was being given there arose to Ven Kondañña the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationAnd when the Blessed One had set the Wheel of Dhamma in motion the earth devas cried out At Bārāṇasī in the Game Refuge at Isipatana the Blessed One has set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deva Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the cosmosOn hearing the earth devas cry the devas of the Four Kings Heaven took up the cry On hearing the devas of the Four Great Kings cry the devas of the Thirtythree took up the cry the Yama devas the Tusita devas the Nimmānarati devas the Paranimmitavasavatti devas the devas of Brahmās retinue took up the cry At Bārāṇasī in the Game Refuge at Isipatana the Blessed One has set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deva Māra or Brahmā or anyone at all in the cosmosSo in that moment that instant the cry shot right up to the Brahmā worldsAnd this tenthousand fold cosmos shivered  quivered  quaked while a great measureless radiance appeared in the cosmos surpassing the devaeffulgence of the devasThen the Blessed One exclaimed So you really know Kondañña So you really knowAnd that is how Ven Kondañña acquired the name AññāKondaññaKondañña who knowsThen Ven AññāKoṇḍañña having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message said to the Blessed One May I receive the Goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence May I receive the AcceptanceCome bhikkhu said the Blessed One The Dhamma is welltaught Live the holy life for the right ending of stress BMCSuch was the venerable ones AcceptanceThen the Blessed One taught and admonished the other monks with talk on the dhammaThen being taught and admonished by the Blessed One with talk on the Dhamma the dustless spotless eye of Dhamma arose for Ven Vappa and Ven BhaddiyaWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to

said the Blessed One The Dhamma is welltaught Live the holy life for the right ending of stressSuch was the venerable ones AcceptanceThen the Blessed One subsisting on food brought back taught and admonished the remaining monks with talk on the dhammaWhatever three monks brought back having gone on their almsround with that the group of six sustained themselvesThen being taught and admonished by the Blessed One with talk on the Dhamma the dustless spotless eye of Dhamma arose for Venerable Mahānāma and Venerable AssajiWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThey having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness

disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion he is released With release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this worldThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the group of five monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of the group of five monks through lack of clingingsustenance were released from effluentsAt that time there were six arahants in the worldThe Discussion of the Group of Five is finishedThe first recitation section on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himrather the person should be examined thus I shall not be troubled and the other person will not be hurt for the other person is not given to anger and revenge he is not firmly attached to his view and he relinquishes easily and I can make that person emerge from the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesomebut it is a much greater thing that I can make that person emerge from the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesomefor the other person is not given to anger and revenge though he is firmly attached to his view and he relinquishes with difficulty yet I can make that person emerge from the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesomebut it is a much greater thing that I can make that person emerge from the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesomefor the other person is given to anger and revenge and he is firmly attached to his view and he relinquishes with difficulty yet I can make that person emerge from the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesomebut it is a much greater thing that I can make that person emerge from the

emerge from the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesomeThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to come to beWhat fourThe nutriment edible food gross or subtle second contact third mental volition fourth consciousnessThese are the four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to come to beThese four kinds of nutriment have craving as their source craving as their origin they are born and produced from cravingThis craving has feeling as its source feeling as its origin it is born and produced from feelingAnd this feeling has what as its sourceFeeling has contact as its sourceAnd this contact has what as its sourceContact has the six sense bases as its source And these six sense bases have what as their sourceThe six sense bases have nameandform as their sourceAnd this nameandform has what as its sourceNameandform has consciousness as its sourceAnd this consciousness has what as its sourceConsciousness has volitional formations as its sourceAnd these volitional formations have what as their source what as their origin from what are they born and producedVolitional formations have ignorance as their source ignorance as their origin they are born and produced from ignoranceThus bhikkhus with ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be with volitional formations as condition consciousness  Such is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingBut with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations with the cessation of volitional formations cessation of consciousness Such is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingBhikkhus these four kinds of nutriment have what as their source what as their origin from what are they born and producedAnd this craving has what as its source what as its origin from what is it born and producedTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus there are some recluses and brahmins who speculate about the future and hold views about the future who assert various doctrinal propositions concerning the future Some assert thus The self is percipient and unimpaired after death Some assert thus The self is nonpercipient and unimpaired after death Some assert thus The self is neither percipient nor nonpercipient and unimpaired after death Or they describe the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existing being at death Or some assert Nibbana here and nowThus they either describe an existing self that is unimpaired after death or they describe the annihilation destruction arid extermination of an existing being at death or they assert Nibbana here and nowThus these views being five become three and being three become five This is the summary of the five and three Therein bhikkhus those recluses and brahmins who describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self percipient and unimpaired after death to be either material or immaterial or both material and immaterial or neither material nor immaterial or percipient of unity or percipient of diversity or percipient of the limited or percipient of the immeasurable Or else among those few who go beyond this some assert the consciousnesskasina immeasurable and imperturbable to be the selfThose good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self to be either materialor they describe it to be percipient of the immeasurable Or else since the perception there is nothing is declared to be the purest supreme best and unsurpassed of those perceptions  whether perceptions of form or of the formless of the limited or the immeasurable That is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having known There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond thatWhy is thatBecause they say Perception is a disease perception is a tumour perception is a dart this is peaceful this is sublime that is nonperceptionThe Tathagata bhikkhus understands this thus Those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as nonpercipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self nonpercipient and unimpaired after death to be either materialor neither material nor immaterialThat any recluse or brahmin could say Apart from material form apart from feeling apart from perception apart from formations I shall describe the coming and going of consciousness its passing away and reappearance its growth increase and maturation  that is impossibleThat is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having known There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond that Therein bhikkhus those recluses and brahmins who describe the self as neither percipient nor nonpercipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self neither percipient nor nonpercipient and unimpaired after death to be either material or immaterial or both material and immaterial or neither material nor immaterialWhy is thatBecause they say Perception is a disease perception is a tumour perception is a dart and nonperception is stupefaction this is peaceful this is sublime that is neither perceptionnornonperception  The Tathagata bhikkhus understands this thusIf any recluses or brahmins describe the entering upon this base to come about through a measure of formations regarding what is seen heard sensed and cognized that is declared to be a disaster for entering upon this baseThat is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having known There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond that Therein bhikkhus those recluses and brahmins who describe the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existing being at death criticise those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after death and they criticise those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as nonpercipient and unimpaired after death and they criticise those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as neither percipient nor nonpercipient and unimpaired after deathWhy is thatAll these good recluses and brahmins rushing onwards assert their attachment thus We shall be thus after death we shall be thus after deathJust as a merchant going to market thinks Through this that will be mine with this I will get that so too these good recluses and brahmins seem like merchants when they declare We shall be thus after death we shall be thus after deathThe Tathagata bhikkhus understands this thusJust as a dog bound by a leash tied to a firm post or pillar keeps on running and circling around that same post or pillar so too these good recluses and brahmins through fear of personality and disgust with personality keep running and circling around that same personaliThat is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having known There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond thatBhikkhus any recluses or brahmins who speculate about the future and hold views about the future who assert various doctrinal propositions concerning the future all assert these five bases or a certain one among themSome assert thus The self and the world are eternal only this is true anything else is wrong  Some assert thus The self and the world are not eternal only this is true anything else is wrong  Some assert thus The self and the world are both eternal and not eternal only this is true anything else is wrong  Some assert thus The self

thus The self and the world are neither finite nor infinite only this is true anything else is wrong Some assert thus The self and the world are percipient of unity only this is true anything else is wrong  Some assert thus The self and the world are percipient of diversity only this is true anything else is wrong Some assert thus The self and the world are percipient of the limited only this is true anything else is wrong Some assert thus The self and the world are percipient of the immeasurable only this is true anything else is wrong Some assert thus The self and the world experience exclusively pleasure only this is true anything else is wrong Some assert thus The self and the world experience exclusively pain only this is true anything else is wrong Some assert thus The self and the world experience both pleasure and pain only this is true anything else is wrong Some assert thus The self and the world experience neither pleasure nor pain only this is true anything else is wrongTherein bhikkhus as to those recluses and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this The self and the world are eternal only this is true anything else is wrong that apart from faith apart from approval apart from oral tradition apart from reasoned cogitation apart from reflective acceptance of a view they will have any pure and clear personal knowledge of this  that is impossibleThat is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having known There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond that Therein bhikkhus as to those

cogitation apart from reflective acceptance of a view they will have any pure and clear personal knowledge of this  that is impossibleSince they have no pure and clear personal knowledge even the mere fragmentary knowledge that those good recluses and brahmins clarify about their view is declared to be clinging on their partThat is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having known There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond thatThat rapture of seclusion ceases in himWith the cessation of the rapture of seclusion grief arises and with the cessation of grief the rapture of seclusion arisesThe Tathagata bhikkhus understands this thusand with the cessation of grief the rapture of seclusion arisesThat is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having known There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond thatHere bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future through complete lack of resolve upon the fetters of sensual pleasure and with the surmounting of the rapture of seclusion enters upon and abides in unworldly pleasure He thinks This is the peaceful this is the sublime that I enter upon and abide in unworldly pleasureThat unworldly pleasure ceases in himWith the cessation of unworldly pleasure the rapture of seclusion arises and with the cessation of the rapture of seclusion unworldly pleasure arisesJust as the sunlight pervades the area that the shadow leaves and the shadow pervades the area that the sunlight leaves so too with the cessation of unworldly pleasure the rapture of seclusion arises and with the cessation of the rapture of seclusion unworldly pleasure arisesThe Tathagata bhikkhus understands this thusThis good recluse or brahmin with the relinquishing of views about the past and the futureThat is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having known There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond thatHere bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future through complete lack of resolve upon the fetters of sensual

recluse or brahmin with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future through complete lack of resolve upon the fetters of sensual pleasure and with the surmounting of the rapture of seclusion unworldly pleasure and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling regards himself thus I am at peace I have attained Nibbana I am without clingingThe Tathagata bhikkhus understands this thusYet this good recluse or brahmin still clings clinging either to a view about the past or to a view about the future or to a fetter of sensual pleasure or to the rapture of seclusion or to unworldly pleasure or to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingAnd when this venerable one regards himself thus I am at peace I have attained Nibbana I am without clinging that too is declared to be clinging on the part of this good recluse or brahminThat is conditioned and gross but there is cessation of formations Having understood There is this seeing the escape from that the Tathagata has gone beyond thatBhikkhus this supreme state of sublime peace has been discovered by the Tathagata that is liberation through not clinging by understanding as they actually are the origination the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of the six bases of contact Bhikkhus that is the supreme state of sublime peace discovered by the Tathagata that is liberation through not clinging by understanding as they actually are the origination the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of the six bases of contactThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThere is no giving He says this intending that there are no fruits of giving offering and liberalityThen the Blessed One having understood Brahmās invitation out of compassion for beings surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened OneAs he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One he saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other worldJust as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some blue or red or white lotusesborn and growing in the watermight flourish while immersed in the water without rising up from the water some might stand at an even level with the water while some might rise up from the water and stand without being smeared by the water so too surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One the Blessed One saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world Having seen this he answered Brahmā Sahampati in verseOpen are the doors to the DeathlessLet those with ears unleash their convictionPerceiving trouble O BrahmāI did not tell people the refined sublime DhammaThen Brahmā Sahampati thinking Im the one who created the opportunity for the teaching of the Dhamma by the Blessed One bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him keeping him to his right and disappeared right thereThe Discussion of the Brahmās Request is finishedAs I reflected thus Brahmā my mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the DhammaA second time Brahmā Sahampati said to the Blessed One Lord let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma There will be those who will understand the DhammaThe Tathagata bhikkhus understands this thussome assert the base of nothingness immeasurable and imperturbable to be the self Therein bhikkhus those recluses and brahmins who describe the self as nonpercipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self nohpercipient and unimpaired after death to be either material or immaterial or both material and immaterial or neither material nor immaterialTherein bhikkhus these criticise those recluses and brahmins who describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after deathTherein bhikkhus these criticise those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after death and they criticise those good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as nonpercipient and unimpaired after deathThose good recluses and brahmins who describe the self as neither percipient nor nonpercipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self neither percipient nor nonpercipient and unimpaired after death to be either materialor neither material nor immaterialThose good recluses and brahmins who describe the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existing being at death through fear of personality and disgust with personality keep running and circling around that same personalityThen the Blessed One addressed the monks I am released from all snares whether human or divineMonks you are also released from all snares whether human or divineWander monks for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human beings and devasDont any two of you go the same wayTeach the Dhamma fine in the beginning fine in the middle fine in the end Expound the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely complete surpassingly pureThere are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma There will be those who will understand the DhammaI will go to the military town of Uruvelā to teach the DhammaThen Mara the Evil One went to the Blessed One and on arrival recited this verse in his presenceYoure bound by all snares human and divineYoure bound by a great bond Contemplative youre not freed from meThe Buddha Im released from all snares whether human or divineIm freed from the great bond Youre struck down EndmakerMāra A snare of the mind that travels in the airI will bind you with it Contemplative youre not freed from meThe Buddha Forms sounds aromas and tastes tactile sensations that delight the mindMy desire there is gone Youre struck down EndmakerThen Māra the Evil Onesad  dejected  The Blessed One knows me the One WellGone knows mevanished right thereThe Discussion of Māra is finishedAt that time the monks were bringing those wanting the Goingforth and those wanting the Acceptance from many countries and many directions The Blessed One will give them the Goingforth and the AcceptanceThat tired the monks along with those wanting the Goingforth and those wanting the AcceptanceThen when the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness At this time the monks are bringing those wanting the Goingforth and those wanting the Acceptance from many countries and many directions The Blessed One will give them the Goingforth and the AcceptanceThat tires the monks along with those wanting the Goingforth and those wanting the AcceptanceWhy dont I allow the monks Monks you may now give the Goingforth and the Acceptance in whatever country in whatever directionThen in the evening rising from seclusion the Blessed One having assembled the Saṅgha of monks and given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks just now when I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness At this time the monks are bringing those wanting the Goingforth and those wanting the Acceptance from many countries and many directions The Blessed One will give them the Goingforth and the Acceptance That tires the monks along with those wanting the Goingforth and those wanting the Acceptance Why dont I allow the monks Monks you may now give the Goingforth and the Acceptance in whatever country in whatever direction I allow you monks to now give the Goingforth and the Acceptance in whatever country in whatever direction MvIThe Goingforth and Acceptance should be given like thisFirsthaving gotten him to shave his head  beard to clothe himself in ochre robes to arrange his robe over one shoulder to bow down at the feet of the monks to sit in the kneeling position and to raise his hands palmtopalm in front of the hearthe should be told Say this I go to the Buddha for refuge I go to the Dhamma for refuge I go to the Saṅgha for refuge A second time I go to the Buddha for refuge A second time I go to the Dhamma for refuge A second time I go to the Saṅgha for refuge A third time I go to the Buddha for refuge A third time I go to the Dhamma for refuge A third time I go to the Saṅgha for refugeMonks I allow the Goingforth and the Acceptance by means of these three goings for refugeThe Discussion of Acceptance by Three Goingsforrefuge is finishedAt that time in Bārāṇasī there was a son of a good family named Yasadelicate a moneylenders sonHe had three palaces one for the cold season one for the hot season and one for the rainy seasonFor four months he was entertained in the rainyseason palace by minstrels without a single man among them and he did not once come down from the palaceThen the young man Yasa enjoying himself provided  endowed with the five strings of sensuality fell asleep first Then his retinue fell asleep afterwards An oil lamp was left burning the whole nightThen Yasa waking up first saw his retinue sleepingone with a vīṇā under her arm another with a mudiṅga drum around her neck another with an āḷambara drum on her chest another with disheveled hair another drooling others babbling in their sleeplike a charnel ground as it were right within reachSeeing this the drawbacks became apparent and his mind became established in disenchantmentThen Yasa exclaimed How distressing How oppressive Then Yasa put on his golden slippers and went to the door of the residenceNonhuman beings opened the door May there be no obstacle to Yasas Goingforth from home into homelessnessThen Yasa went to the city gateNonhuman beings opened the gate May there be no obstacle to Yasas Goingforth from home into homelessnessThen Yasa went to the Deer Park in IsipatanaAt that time the Blessed One having gotten up as the night was ending was walking back and forth in the openThe Blessed One saw Yasa coming from afar and on seeing him got down from the walking path and sat down on a seat laid outYasa not far from the Blessed One exclaimed How distressing How oppressive Then the Blessed One said to Yasa Yasa This isnt distressing This isnt oppressiveCome Yasa Sit down Ill teach you the DhammaThen Yasa He says this isnt distressing this isnt oppressive thrilled and exultant took off his golden slippers went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One gave him a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciationWhen the Blessed One knew that Yasas mind was readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and pathJust as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for Yasa as he was sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThen Yasas mother going up into the palace and not seeing Yasa went to the moneylender and on arrival said to him Your son Yasa is nowhere to be seen householderSo the moneylender sent horseback messengers out in the four directions and went himself to the game reserve in IsipatanaHe saw the tracks of the golden slippers and on seeing them followed themThe Blessed One saw him coming from afar and on seeing him the thought occurred to him Why dont I fabricate a fabrication of psychic power such that the moneylender householder sitting here wouldnt see Yasa sitting here Then the Blessed One fabricated such a fabrication of psychic powerThe moneylender householder approached the Blessed One and said Could it be lord that the Blessed One has seen Yasa the son of a good family Now then householder sit down It could be that sitting here you might indeed see Yasa sitting hereThen the moneylender He says I might sitting right here see Yasa sitting here thrilled and exultant bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One gave him a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciationWhen the Blessed One knew that the moneylenders mind was readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and pathJust as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for the moneylender as he was sitting right there Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThen the moneylender having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord Magnificent Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the Saṅgha of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeAnd so he was the first threestatement lay disciple in the worldAs Yasas father was being taught the Dhamma and as Yasa was reflecting on the level as he had seen and known it his mind was

disenchanted with contact at the eye And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain With that too he grows disenchantedHe grows disenchanted with the ear He grows disenchanted with the nose He grows disenchanted with the tongue He grows disenchanted with the body He grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellect And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain He grows disenchanted with that too Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion he is released With release there is the knowledge ReleasedHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this worldAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of the  monks through lack of clingingsustenance were released from effluentsThe Fire explanation is finishedThe third recitation section on the Marvels at Uruvelā is finishedThen the Blessed One having stayed at Gayā Head as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Rājagaha with the large Saṅgha of monksa thousand monksall of them former coiledhair asceticsTraveling by stages he arrived at RājagahaAnd there at Rājagaha the Blessed One stayed at the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine in the Saplingforest ParkKing Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard Master Gotama the contemplativea son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clanhas arrived at Rājagaha and is staying at the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine in the Saplingforest ParkAnd of that master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessedHe makes knownhaving realized it through direct knowledgethis world with its devas Māras  Brahmās its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  commonfolkhe explains the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end he expounds the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureIt is good to see such a worthy oneThen King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha accompanied by  Magadhan householders and brahmans went to the Blessed One On arrival he bowed down and sat to one sideSome of the  Magadhan householders and brahmans also bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side Some of them having raised their hands palmtopalm in front of the heart to the Blessed One sat to one side Some of them after announcing their name and clan in the Blessed One presence sat to one side Some of them staying silent sat to one sideThen the thought occurred to the  Magadhan householders and brahmans Is the great contemplative living the holy life under Uruvelakassapa or is Uruvelakassapa living the holy life under the great contemplativeThe Blessed One having known with his awareness the train of thought in the awarenesses of the  Magadhan householders and brahmans addressed Uruvelakassapa in verseHaving seen what while living at Uruvelā has the teacher of ascetics abandoned the fireI ask you about this matter Kassapa Why has your fire oblation been abandonedUruvelakassapa Forms sounds and flavors tooSensuality and womensacrifices promise theseHaving known of acquisitions This is stainedI no longer delight in oblations or sacrificesThe Buddha to Kassapa Now your mind doesnt delightin forms sounds or flavorsThen in the world with its humans and devaswhat is your minds delight Explain it to me KassapaUruvelakassapa Having seen the state of peacewithout acquisitions having nothing unattached in sensuality and becomingthe state unchanging leading to nothing elseI no longer delight in oblations or sacrificesThen Ven Uruvelakassapa got up from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder and putting his head down at the Blessed Ones feet said The Blessed One is my teacher I am his disciple The Blessed One is my teacher I am his discipleThen the thought occurred to the  Magadhan householders and brahmans Uruvelakassapa is living the holy life under the great contemplativeThen the Blessed One having known with his awareness the train of thought in the minds of the  Magadhan householders and brahmans gave them a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciationWhen the Blessed One knew that their minds were readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and pathJust as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for  Magadhan householders and brahmans headed by Bimbisāra as they were sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation  declared themselves layfollowersThen King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message said to the Blessed One Lord before when I was still a prince young man I had five aspirations They are now fulfilled for meLord before when I was still a prince I thought O may I be consecrated as king That Lord was my first aspiration Now it is fulfilled for meAnd may an arahant rightly selfawakened alight in my kingdom This Lord was my second aspiration Now it is fulfilled for meAnd may I attend on that Blessed One That Lord was my third aspiration Now it is fulfilled for meAnd may that Blessed One teach me the Dhamma That Lord was my fourth aspiration Now it is fulfilled for meAnd may I understand that Blessed Ones Dhamma That Lord was my fifth aspiration Now it is fulfilled for meLord before when I was still a prince I had these five aspirations They are now fulfilled for meMagnificent lord Magnificent Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge and the Dhamma and the Saṅgha of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life And may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow along with the Saṅgha of monksThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to his right and leftAs the night was ending King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having ordered exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared had the time announced to the Blessed One Its time Lord The meal is readyThen the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robes entered Rājagaha with the large Saṅgha of monksa thousand monksall of them former coiledhair asceticsNow at that time Sakka King of the Devas assuming the form of a brahman youth went along ahead of the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha singing this verseThe Tamed One with the tamed with the former coiled hair ascetics The Thoroughly Released One with the thoroughly releasedThe color of golden ginger The Blessed One entered RājagahaThe Released One with the released with the former coiled hair ascetics The Thoroughly Released One with the thoroughly releasedThe color of golden ginger The Blessed One entered RājagahaThe One who has Crossed Over with those who have crossed over with the former coiled hair asceticsThe Thoroughly Released One with the thoroughly releasedThe color of golden gingerThe Blessed One entered RājagahaThe Peaceful One with the peaceful ones with the former coiled hair asceticsThe Thoroughly Released One with the thoroughly releasedThe color of golden gingerThe Blessed One entered RājagahaHe has ten spheres of influence ten powers knower of ten Dhammas possessing tensurrounded by ten hundreds the Blessed One entered RājagahaOn seeing Sakka King of the Devas the people said How handsome that brahman youth How goodlooking that brahman youth How inspiring that brahman youthWhose is that brahman youthWhen that was said Sakka King of the Devas addressed the people in verseThat Enlightened One everywhere tamedthat pure matchless individual worthy wellgone in the world his attendant am IThen the Blessed One went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadhas residence and sat down on a seat laid out along with the Saṅgha of monksThen King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with his own hands served  satisfied the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Blessed One with exquisite staple  nonstaple food When the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the king sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the thought occurred to him Where should the Blessed One staythat would be neither too far from the village nor too close accessible where interested people could come out not crowded by day with few noises or sounds of voices at night far from wind and crowds private from human beings and appropriate for seclusionThe thought occurred to him I have this Bamboo Grove Park which is neither too far from the village nor too close accessible where interested people could come out not crowded by day with few noises or sounds of voices at night far from wind and crowds private from human beings and appropriate for seclusionWhat if I were to give the Bamboo Grove Park to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Blessed OneSo King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha taking a golden water vessel made this offering to the Blessed One I give this Bamboo Grove Park to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Blessed OneThe Blessed One accepted the monasteryThe Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with Dhamma talk got up from his seat and leftThen the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow a monasteryThe Discussion of the Meeting with Bimbisāra is finishedNow at that time Sañjaya the wanderer was staying in Rājagaha with a large assembly of wanderers in allAnd at that time Sāriputta and Moggallāna were living the holy life under SañjayaThey had made this agreement May whoever attains the Deathless first inform the otherThen early in the morning Ven Assaji adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robes entered Rājagaha for alms gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out  his eyes downcast his every movement consummateSāriputta the wanderer saw Ven Assaji going for alms in Rājagaha gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out  his eyes downcast his every movement consummateOn seeing him the thought occurred to him Surely of those monks in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is oneWhat if I were to go to him and question him Friend on whose account have you gone forth Or who is your teacher Or in whose Dhamma do you delightBut then the thought occurred to Sāriputta the wanderer This is the wrong time to question him Having entered among houses he is going for almsWhat if I were to follow behind this monk The path is found by those who seek itThen Ven Assaji having gone for alms in Rājagaha took his almsfood and leftThen Sāriputta the wanderer went to Ven Assaji and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one sideAs he was standing there Sāriputta the wanderer said to Ven Assaji Clear my friend are your facultiespure your complexion

wandererWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationNarrator addressing Sāriputta the wanderer Just this Dhamma even if just this much and you experienced the sorrowless stateunseen neglected for many tenthousands of eonsThen Sāriputta the wanderer went to Moggallāna the wandererMoggallāna the wanderer saw Sāriputta the wanderer coming in the distance and said to him Clear my

subject to origination is all subject to cessationNarrator addressing Moggallāna the wanderer Just this Dhamma even if just this much and you experienced the sorrowless stateunseen neglected for many tenthousands of eonsThen Moggallāna the wanderer said to Sāriputta the wanderer Lets go to the Blessed Ones presence the Blessed One is our teacherSāriputta There are these  wanderers who live here in dependence on us and look up to us Lets inform them of thisThey will do whatever they think So Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the wanderers and on arrival said to them Friends we are going to the
