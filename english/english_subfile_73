Only brahmins are the light caste other castes are darkOnly brahmins are purified not othersOnly brahmins are Brahmās rightful sons born of his mouth born of Brahmā created by Brahmā heirs of BrahmāYouve both abandoned the first caste to join an inferior caste namely these shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our KinsmanThis is not right its not properThats how the brahmins insult usActually Vāseṭṭha the brahmins are forgetting their tradition when they say this to youFor brahmin women are seen menstruating being pregnant giving birth and breastfeedingYet even though theyre born from a brahmin womb they sayOnly brahmins are the first caste other castes are inferiorOnly brahmins are the light caste other castes are darkOnly brahmins are purified not othersOnly brahmins are Brahmās rightful sons born of his mouth born of Brahmā created by Brahmā heirs of BrahmāThey misrepresent the brahmins speak falsely and make much bad karmaPurification in the Four CastesVāseṭṭha there are these four castesaristocrats brahmins merchants and workersSome aristocrats kill living creatures steal and commit sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh and nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious with wrong viewThese things are unskillful blameworthy not to be cultivated unworthy of the noble onesand are reckoned as such They are dark deeds with dark results criticized by sensible people Such things are seen in some aristocratsAnd they are also seen among some brahminsmerchantsand workersBut some aristocrats refrain from killing living creatures stealing and committing sexual misconduct They refrain from speech thats false divisive harsh and nonsensical And theyre content kindhearted with right viewThese things are skillful blameless to be cultivated worthy of the noble onesand are reckoned as such They are bright deeds with bright results praised by sensible people Such things are seen in some aristocratsAnd they are also seen among some brahminsmerchantsand workersBoth these things occur like this mixed up in these four castesthe dark and the bright that which is praised and that which is criticized by sensible people Yet of this the brahmins sayOnly brahmins are the first caste other castes are inferiorOnly brahmins are the light caste other castes are darkOnly brahmins are purified not othersOnly brahmins are Brahmās rightful sons born of his mouth born of Brahmā created by Brahmā heirs of BrahmāSensible people dont acknowledge thisWhy is thatBecause any mendicant from these four castes who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentis said to be foremost by virtue of principle not without principleFor principle Vāseṭṭha is the first thing for people in both this life and the nextAnd heres a way to understand how this is soKing Pasenadi of Kosala knows thatthe ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the SakyansAnd the Sakyans are his vassalsThe Sakyans show deference to King Pasenadi by bowing down rising up greeting him with joined palms and observing proper etiquette for himNow King Pasenadi shows the same kind of deference to the Realized One But he doesnt think The ascetic Gotama is wellborn I am illbornHe is powerful I am weakHe is handsome I am uglyHe is influential I am insignificantRather in showing such deference to the Realized One he is only honoring respecting and venerating principleAnd heres another way to understand how principle is the first thing for people in both this life and the nextVāseṭṭha you have different births names and clans and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from different familiesWhen they ask you what you are you claim to be ascetics followers of the SakyanBut only when someone has faith in the Realized Onesettled rooted and planted deep strong not to be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the worldis it appropriate for them to sayI am the Buddhas trueborn child born from his mouth born of principle created by principle heir to principleWhy is thatFor these are terms for the Realized One the embodiment of truth and the embodiment of holiness and the one who has become the truth and the one who has become holyThere comes a time when Vāseṭṭha after a very long period has passed this cosmos contractsAs the cosmos contracts sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radianceThere they are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long timeThere comes a time when after a very long period has passed this cosmos expandsAs the cosmos expands sentient beings mostly pass away from that host of radiant deities and come back to this realmHere they are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long timeSolid Nectar AppearsBut the single mass of water at that time was utterly darkThe moon and sun were not found nor were stars and constellations day and night months and fortnights years and seasons or male and female Beings were simply known as beingsAfter a very long period had passed solid nectar curdled in the waterIt appeared just like the curd on top of hot milkrice as it coolsIt was beautiful fragrant and delicious like ghee or butterAnd it was as sweet as pure manuka honeyNow one of those beings was recklessThinking Oh my what might this be they tasted the solid nectar with their fingerThey enjoyed it and craving was born in themAnd other beings following that beings example tasted solid nectar with their fingersThey too enjoyed it and craving was born in themThe Moon and Sun AppearThen those beings started to eat the solid nectar breaking it into lumpsBut when they did thistheir luminosity vanishedAnd with the vanishing of their luminosity the moon and sun appearedstars and constellations appeareddays and nights were distinguishedand so were months and fortnightsand years and seasonsTo this extent the world had evolved once moreThen those beings eating the solid nectar with that as their food and nourishment remained for a very long timeBut so long as they ate that solid nectar their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearancesome beautiful some uglyAnd the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly onesWere more beautiful theyre the ugly onesAnd the vanity of the beautiful ones made the solid nectar vanishThey gathered together and bemoanedOh what a taste Oh what a tasteAnd even today when people get something tasty they sayOh what a taste Oh what a tasteTheyre just remembering an ancient primordial saying but they dont understand what it meansGroundSproutsWhen the solid nectar had vanished groundsprouts appeared to those beingsThey appeared just like mushroomsThey were beautiful fragrant and delicious like ghee or butterAnd they were as sweet as pure manuka honeyThen those beings started to eat the groundsproutsWith that as their food and nourishment they remained for a very long timeBut so long as they ate those groundsprouts their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearancesome beautiful some uglyAnd the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly onesWere more beautiful theyre the ugly onesAnd the vanity of the beautiful ones made the groundsprouts vanishBursting PodsWhen the groundsprouts had vanished bursting pods appeared like the fruit of the kadam treeThey were beautiful fragrant and delicious like ghee or butterAnd they were as sweet as pure manuka honeyThen those beings started to eat the bursting podsWith that as their food and nourishment they remained for a very long timeBut so long as they ate those bursting pods their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearancesome beautiful some uglyAnd the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly onesWere more beautiful theyre the ugly onesAnd the vanity of the beautiful ones made the bursting pods vanishThey gathered together and bemoanedOh what weve lost Oh what weve lostthose bursting podsAnd even today when people experience suffering they sayOh what weve lost Oh what weve lostTheyre just remembering an ancient primordial saying but they dont understand what it meansRipe Untilled RiceWhen the bursting pods had vanished ripe untilled rice appeared to those beings It had no powder or husk pure and fragrant with only the ricegrainWhat they took for supper in the evening by the morning had grown back and ripenedAnd what they took for breakfast in the morning had grown back and ripened by the eveningso the cutting didnt showThen those beings eating the ripe untilled rice with that as their food and nourishment remained for a very long timeGender AppearsBut so long as they ate that ripe untilled rice their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance And female characteristics appeared on women while male characteristics appeared on menWomen spent too much time gazing at men and men at womenThey became lustful and their bodies burned with feverDue to this fever they had sex with each otherThose who saw them having sex pelted them with dirt ashes or cowdung sayingGet lost filth Get lost filthHow on earth can one being do that to anotherAnd even today people in some countries when a bride is carried off pelt her with dirt ashes or cowdungTheyre just remembering an ancient primordial saying but they dont understand what it meansSexual IntercourseWhat was reckoned as immoral at that time these days is reckoned as moralThe beings who had sex together werent allowed to enter a village or town for one or two monthsEver since they excessively threw themselves into immoralitythey started to make buildings to hide their immoral deedsThen one of those beings of idle disposition thoughtHey now why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfastWhy dont I gather rice for supper and breakfast all at onceSo thats what he didThen one of the other beings approached that being and saidCome good being we shall go to gather riceTheres no need good being I gathered rice for supper and breakfast all at onceSo that being following their example gathered rice for two days all at once thinking This seems fineThen one of the other beings approached that being and saidCome good being we shall go to gather riceTheres no need good being I gathered rice for two days all at onceSo that being following their example gathered rice for four days all at once thinking This seems fineThen one of the other beings approached that being and saidCome good being we shall go to gather riceTheres no need good being I gathered rice for four days all at onceSo that being following their example gathered rice for eight days all at once thinking This seems fineBut when they started to store up rice to eatthe rice grains became wrapped in powder and huskit didnt grow back after reaping the cutting showed and the rice stood in clumpsDividing the FieldsThen those beings gathered together and bemoanedOh how wicked things have appeared among beingsFor we used to be mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and we remained like that for a very long timeAfter a very long period had passed solid nectar curdled in the waterBut due to bad unskillful things among us the savory nectar vanishedthe groundsprouts vanishedthe bursting pods vanishedand now the rice grains have become wrapped in powder and husk it doesnt grow back after reaping the cutting shows and the rice stands in clumpsWed better divide up the rice and set boundariesSo thats what they didNow one of those beings was reckless While guarding their own share they took anothers share without it being given and ate itThey grabbed the one who had done this and saidYou have done a bad thing good being in that while guarding your own share you took anothers share without it being given and ate itDo not do such a thing againYes sirs replied that beingBut for a second timeand a third time they did the same thing and were told not to continueAnd then they struck that being some with fists others with stones and still others with rodsFrom that day on stealing was found and blaming and lying and the taking up of rodsThe Elected KingThen those beings gathered together and bemoanedOh how wicked things have appeared among beings in that stealing is found and blaming and lying and the taking up of rodsWhy dont we elect one being who would rightly accuse those who deserve it blame those who deserve it and expel those who deserve itWe shall pay them with a share of riceThen those beings approached the being among them who was most attractive goodlooking lovely and illustrious and saidCome good being rightly accuse those who deserve it blame those who deserve it and banish those who deserve itWe shall pay you with a share of riceYes sirs replied that being They acted accordinglyand were paid with a share of riceElected by the people Vāseṭṭha is the meaning of elected one the first term to be specifically invented for themLord of the fields is the meaning of aristocrat the second term to be specifically inventedThey please others with principle is the meaning of king the third term to be specifically inventedAnd that Vāseṭṭha is how the ancient primordial terms for the circle of aristocrats were created for those very beings not others for those like them not unlike legitimately not illegitimatelyFor principle Vāseṭṭha is the first thing for people in both this life and the nextThe Circle of BrahminsThen some of those same beings thoughtOh how wicked things have appeared among beings in that stealing is found and blaming and lying and the taking up of rods and banishmentWhy dont we set aside bad unskillful thingsSo thats what they didThey set aside bad unskillful things is the meaning of brahmin the first term to be specifically invented for themThey built leaf huts in a wilderness region where they meditated pure and bright without lighting cooking fires or digging the soil They came down in the morning for breakfast and in the evening for supper to the village town or royal capital seeking a mealWhen they had obtained food they continued to meditate in the leaf hutsWhen people noticed this they saidThese beings build leaf huts in a wilderness region where they meditate pure and bright without lighting cooking fires or digging the soil They come down in the morning for breakfast and in the evening for supper to the village town or royal capital seeking a mealWhen they have obtained food they continue to meditate in the leaf hutsThey meditate is the meaning of meditator the second term to be specifically invented for themBut some of those beings were unable to keep up with their meditation in the leaf huts in the wilderness They came down to the neighborhood of a village or town where they dwelt compiling textsWhen people noticed this they saidThese beings were unable to keep up with their meditation in the leaf huts in the wilderness They came down to the neighborhood of a village or town where they dwelt compiling texts Now they dont meditateNow they dont meditate is the meaning of reciter the third term to be specifically invented for themWhat was reckoned as lesser at that time these days is reckoned as primaryAnd that Vāseṭṭha is how the ancient primordial terms for the circle of brahmins were created for those very beings not others for those like them not unlike legitimately not illegitimatelyFor principle Vāseṭṭha is the first thing for people in both this life and the nextThe Circle of MerchantsSome of those same beings taking up an active sex life applied themselves to various jobsHaving taken up an active sex life they apply themselves to various jobs is the meaning of merchant the term specifically invented for themAnd that Vāseṭṭha is how the ancient primordial term for the circle of merchants was created for those very beings not others for those like them not unlike legitimately not illegitimatelyFor principle Vāseṭṭha is the first thing for people in both this life and the nextThe Circle of WorkersThe remaining beings lived by hunting and menial tasksThey live by hunting and menial tasks is the meaning of worker the term specifically invented for themAnd that Vāseṭṭha is how the ancient primordial term for the circle of workers was created for those very beings not others for those like them not unlike legitimately not illegitimatelyFor principle Vāseṭṭha is the first thing for people in both this life and the nextThere came a time when an aristocrat brahmin merchant or worker deprecating their own vocation went forth from the lay life to homelessness thinkingI will be an asceticAnd that Vāseṭṭha is how these four circles were created for those very beings not others for those like them not unlike legitimately not illegitimatelyFor principle Vāseṭṭha is the first thing for people in both this life and the nextOn Bad ConductAn aristocrat brahmin merchant worker or ascetic may do bad things by way of body speech and mind They have wrong view and they act out of that wrong view And because of that when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellAn aristocrat brahmin merchant worker or ascetic may do good things by way of body speech and mind They have right view and they act out of that right view And because of that when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmThe Qualities That Lead to AwakeningAn aristocrat brahmin merchant worker or ascetic who is restrained in body speech and mind and develops the seven qualities that lead to awakening becomes extinguished in this very lifeAny mendicant from these four castes who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentis said to be the foremost by virtue of principle not without principleFor principle Vāseṭṭha is the first thing for people in both this life and the nextBrahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verseThe aristocrat is first among peoplewho take clan as the standardBut one accomplished in knowledge and conductis first among gods and humansThat verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra not poorly sung well spoken not poorly spoken beneficial not harmful and I agree with itI also sayThe aristocrat is first among peoplewho take clan as the standardBut one accomplished in knowledge and conductis first among gods and humansThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesThe Lions Roar at Udumbarikās MonasteryOn the Wanderer NigrodhaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak MountainNow at that time the wanderer Nigrodha was residing in the lady Udumbarikās monastery for wanderers together with a large assembly of three thousand wanderersThen the householder Sandhāna left Rājagaha in the middle of the day to see the BuddhaThen it occurred to himIts the wrong time to see the Buddhaas hes in retreatAnd its the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicantsas theyre in retreatWhy dont I visit the wanderer Nigrodha at the lady Udumbarikās monastery for wanderersSo he went to the monastery of the wanderersNow at that time Nigrodha was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such astalk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existenceNigrodha saw Sandhāna coming off in the distanceand hushed his own assemblyBe quiet good sirs dont make a soundThe householder Sandhāna a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is comingHe is included among the whiteclothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama who is residing near RājagahaSuch venerables like the quiet are educated to be quiet and praise the quietHopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approachThen those wanderers fell silentThen Sandhāna went up to the wanderer Nigrodha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to NigrodhaThe way the wanderers make an uproar as they sit together and talk about all kinds of unworthy topics is one thingIts quite different to the way the Buddha frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still far from the madding crowd remote from human settlements and fit for retreatWhen Sandhāna said this Nigrodha said to himSurely householder you should know better With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse With whom does he engage in discussion With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdomStaying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotamas wisdom Not frequenting assemblies he is unable to hold a discussionHe just lurks on the peripheryHes just like the nilgai antelope circling around and lurking on the peripheryPlease householder let the ascetic Gotama come to this assembly Ill sink him with just one question Ill roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow potWith clairaudience that is purified and superhuman the Buddha heard this discussion between the householder Sandhāna and the wanderer NigrodhaThen the Buddha descended Vultures Peak Mountain and went to the peacocks feeding ground on the bank of the Sumāgadhā where he walked mindfully in the open airNigrodha saw himand hushed his own assemblyBe quiet good sirs dont make a sound The ascetic Gotama is walking mindfully on the bank of the SumāgadhāThe venerable likes quiet and praises quietHopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approachIf he comes Ill ask him this questionSir what teaching do you use to guide your disciples through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual lifeThen those wanderers fell silentMortification in Disgust of SinThen the Buddha went up to the wanderer Nigrodhawho said to himCome Blessed One Welcome Blessed OneIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come herePlease sir sit down this seat is readyThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outwhile Nigrodha took a low seat and sat to one sideThe Buddha said to himNigrodha what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinishedNigrodha saidWell sir I saw you walking mindfully and saidIf the ascetic Gotama comes Ill ask him this questionSir what teaching do you use to guide your disciples through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual lifeThis is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrivedIts hard for you to understand this Nigrodha since you have a different view creed preference practice and traditionPlease ask me a question about the higher mortification in disgust of sin in your own traditionHow are the conditions for the mortification in disgust of sin completed and how are they incompleteWhen he said this those wanderers made an uproarIts incredible its amazing The ascetic Gotama has such power and might For he sets aside his own doctrine and invites discussion on the doctrine of othersThen Nigrodha having quieted those wanderers said to the BuddhaSir we teach mortification in disgust of sin regarding it as essential and clinging to itHow are the conditions for the mortification in disgust of sin completed and how are they incompleteIts when a mortifier goes naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared on purpose for them or an invitation for a mealThey dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drink no beerThey go to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls They feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a dayThey eat once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnight They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervalsThey eat herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung They survive on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruitThey wear robes of sunn hemp mixed hemp corpsewrapping cloth rags lodh tree bark antelope hide whole or in strips kusa grass bark woodchips human hair horsetail hair or owls wingsThey tear out their hair and beard committed to this practiceThey constantly stand refusing seatsThey squat committed to persisting in the squatting positionThey lie on a mat of thorns making a mat of thorns their bedThey make their bed on a plank or the bare groundThey lie only on one sideThey wear dust and dirtThey stay in the open airThey sleep wherever they lay their matThey eat unnatural things committed to the practice of eating unnatural foodsThey dont drink committed to the practice of not drinking liquidsTheyre committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day including the eveningWhat do you think NigrodhaIf this is so is the mortification in disgust of sin complete or incompleteClearly sir if that is so the mortification in disgust of sin is complete not incompleteBut even such a completed mortification has many defects I sayDefectsBut how does the Buddha say that even such a completed mortification has many defectsFirstly a

or brahmin being honored respected esteemed and venerated among good familiesThey thinkThis one who lives in abundance is honored respected esteemed and venerated among good familiesBut I a selfmortifier who lives rough am not honored respected esteemed and venerated among good families Thus they give rise to jealousy and stinginess regarding familiesThis too is a defect in that mortifierFurthermore a mortifier sits meditation only when people can see themThis too is a defect in that mortifierFurthermore a mortifier sneaks about among families thinkingThis is part of my mortification this is part of my mortificationThis too is a defect in that mortifierFurthermore a mortifier sometimes behaves in an underhand mannerWhen asked whether something agrees with them they

own views holding them tight and refusing to let goThis too is a defect in that mortifierWhat do you think NigrodhaAre such mortifications defective or notClearly sir theyre defectiveIts possible that a mortifier might have all of these defectslet alone one or other of themOn Reaching the ShootsFirstly Nigrodha a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification But theyre not happy with that as

the fundamental purpose of the spiritual lifeWell there is something better and finer than this Thats what I use to guide my disciples through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual lifeWhen he said this those wanderers made an uproarIn that case were lost and so is our tradition We dont know anything better or finer than thatNigrodha Feels DepressedThen the householder Sandhāna realizedObviously now these wanderers want to listen to what the Buddha says Theyre paying attention and applying their minds to understandSo he said to the wanderer NigrodhaNigrodha remember you said this to meSurely householder you should know better With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse With whom does he engage in discussion With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdomStaying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotamas wisdom Not frequenting assemblies he is unable to hold a discussion He just lurks on the peripheryHes just like the nilgai antelope circling around and lurking on the peripheryPlease householder let the ascetic Gotama come to this assembly Ill sink him with just one question Ill roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow potNow the Blessed One perfected and fully awakened has arrived here Why dont you send him out of the assembly to the periphery like a nilgai antelope Why dont you sink him with just one question Why dont you roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow potWhen he said this Nigrodha sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to sayKnowing this the Buddha said to himIs it really true Nigrodhaare those your wordsIts true sir those are my words It was foolish stupid and unskillful of meWhat do you think NigrodhaHave you heard that wanderers of the past who were elderly and senior the teachers of teachers said thatwhen the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas of the past came together they made an uproar a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topicslike you do in your tradition these daysOr did they say that the Buddhas frequented remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still far from the madding crowd remote from human settlements and fit for retreat like I do these daysI have heard that wanderers of the past who were elderly and senior said thatwhen the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas of the past came together they didnt make an uproarlike I do in my tradition these daysThey said that the Buddhas of the past frequented remote lodgings in the wilderness like the Buddha does these daysNigrodha you are a sensible and mature man Did it not occur to youThe Blessed One is awakened tamed serene crossed over and extinguished And he teaches Dhamma for awakening taming serenity crossing over and extinguishmentThe Culmination of the Spiritual PathNigrodha saidI have made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of me to speak in that wayPlease sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in futureIndeed Nigrodha you made a mistake It was foolish stupid and unskillful of you to speak in that wayBut since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt with it properly I accept itFor it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is deal with it properly and commit to restraint in the futureNigrodha this is what I sayLet a sensible person comeneither devious nor deceitful a person of integrity I teach and instruct themBy practicing as instructed they will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life in seven years They will live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessLet alone seven yearsLet a sensible person comeneither devious nor deceitful a person of integrity I teach and instruct themBy practicing as instructed they will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life in six years five years four years three years two years one year seven months six months five months four months three months two months one month a fortnightLet alone a fortnightLet a sensible person comeneither devious nor deceitful a person of integrity I teach and instruct themBy practicing as instructed they will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life in seven daysThe Wanderers Feel DepressedNigrodha you might thinkThe ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants pupilsBut you should not see it like thisLet your teacher remain your teacherYou might thinkThe ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to give up our recitationBut you should not see it like thisLet your recitation remain as it isYou might thinkThe ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to give up our livelihoodBut you should not see it like thisLet your livelihood remain as it isYou might thinkThe ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to start doing things that are unskillful and considered unskillful in our traditionBut you should not see it like thisLet those things that are unskillful and considered unskillful in your tradition remain as they areYou might thinkThe ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to stop doing things that are skillful and considered skillful in our traditionBut you should not see it like thisLet those things that are skillful and considered skillful in your tradition remain as they areI do not speak for any of these reasonsNigrodha there are things that are unskillful corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death I teach Dhamma so that those things may be given upWhen you practice accordingly corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow Youll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom having realized it with your own insight in this very lifeWhen this was said those wanderers sat silent dismayed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say as if their minds were possessed by MāraThen the Buddha thoughtAll these foolish people have been touched by the Wicked OneFor not even a single one thinksCome let us lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama for the sake of enlightenmentfor what do seven days matterThen the Buddha having roared his lions roar in the lady Udumbarikās monastery for wanderers rose into the air and landed on Vultures PeakMeanwhile the householder Sandhāna just went back to RājagahaLong DiscoursesSakkas QuestionsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans east of Rājagaha theres a brahmin village named Ambasaṇḍā north of which on Mount Vediyaka is the Indasāla caveNow at that time Sakka the lord of gods became eager to see the BuddhaHe thoughtWhere is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHe saw that the Buddha was at the Indasāla caveand addressed the gods of the ThirtyThreeGood sirs the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Indasāla caveWhat if we were to go and see that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaYes lord replied the godsThen Sakka addressed the fairy PañcasikhaDear Pañcasikha the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Indasāla caveWhat if we were to go and see that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaYes lord replied the fairy Pañcasikha Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of woodapple he went as Sakkas attendantThen Sakka went at the head of a retinue consisting of the gods of the ThirtyThree and the fairy PañcasikhaAs easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the heaven of the gods of the ThirtyThree and landed on Mount Vediyaka north of AmbasaṇḍāNow at that time a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā as happens through the glory of the godsPeople in the villages round about terrified shocked and awestruck saidMount Vediyaka must be on fire today blazing and burningOh why has such a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and AmbasaṇḍāThen Sakka addressed the fairy PañcasikhaMy dear Pañcasikha its hard for one like me to get near the Realized Ones while they are on retreat practicing absorption enjoying absorptionBut if you were to charm the Buddha first then I could go to see himYes lord replied the fairy Pañcasikha Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of woodapple he went to the Indasāla cave When he had drawn near he stood to one side thinkingThis is neither too far nor too near and hell hear my voicePañcasikhas SongStanding to one side Pañcasikha played his arched harp and sang these verses on the Buddha the

to him bowing down humblyto he whose daughter is of such a kindWhen Pañcasikha had spoken the Buddha said to himPañcasikha the sound of the strings and the sound of your voice blend well togetherso that neither overpowers the otherBut when did you compose these verses on the Buddha the teaching the Saṅgha the perfected ones and sensual loveThis one time sir when you were first awakened you were staying near Uruvelā at the goatherds banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā RiverAnd at that time I was in love with the lady named Bhaddā Suriyavacchasā the daughter of the fairy king TimbaruBut the sister desired anotherit was Mātali the charioteers son named Sikhaḍḍī who she lovedSince I couldnt win that sister by any meansI took my arched harp to Timbarus home where I played those versesWhen I finished Suriyavacchasā said to meDear sir I have not personally seen the Buddha But I did hear about him when I went to dance for the gods of the ThirtyThree in the Hall of JusticeSince you extol the Buddha let us meet up todayAnd thats when I met up with that sisterBut we have not met sinceThe Approach of SakkaThen Sakka lord of gods thoughtPañcasikha is exchanging pleasantries with the BuddhaSo he addressed PañcasikhaMy dear Pañcasikha please bow to the Buddha for me sayingSir Sakka lord of gods with his ministers and retinue bows with his head at your feetYes lord replied Pañcasikha He bowed to the Buddha and saidSir Sakka lord of gods with his ministers and retinue bows with his head at your feetSo may Sakka with his ministers and retinue be happy Pañcasikha said the Buddhafor all want to be happywhether gods humans demons dragons fairies or any of the other diverse creatures there may beFor that is how the Realized Ones salute such illustrious spiritsAnd being saluted by the Buddha Sakka entered the Indasāla cave bowed to the Buddha and stood to one sideAnd the gods of the ThirtyThree did likewiseas did PañcasikhaAnd at that time the uneven places were evened out the cramped places were opened up the darkness vanished and light appeared as happens through the glory of the godsThen the Buddha said to SakkaIts incredible and amazing that you the venerable Kosiya who has so many duties and so much to do should come hereFor a long time Ive wanted to come and see the Buddha but I wasnt able being prevented by my many duties and responsibilities for the gods of the ThirtyThreeThis one time sir the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincensetree hutThen I went to Sāvatthī to see the BuddhaBut at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in some kind of meditation And a divine maiden of Great King Vessavaṇa named Bhūjati was attending on the Buddha standing there paying homage to him with joined palmsSo I said to herSister please bow to the Buddha for me sayingSir Sakka lord of gods with his ministers and retinue bows with his head at your feetWhen I said this she said to meIts the wrong time to see the Buddhaas hes in retreatWell then sister please convey my message when the Buddha emerges from that immersionI hope that sister bowed to youDo you remember what she saidShe did bow lord of gods and I remember what she saidI also remember that it was the sound of your chariot wheels that pulled me out of that immersionSir I have heard and learned this in the presence of the gods who were reborn in the host of the ThirtyThree before meWhen a Realized One arises in the world perfected and fully awakened the heavenly hosts swell while the demon hosts dwindleAnd I have seen this with my own eyesThe Story of GopikāRight here in Kapilavatthu there was a Sakyan lady named Gopikā who had confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and had fulfilled her ethicsLosing her attachment to femininity she developed masculinity When her body broke up after death she was reborn in a good place a heavenly realmIn the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree she became one of my sonsThere they knew him asthe god GopakaMeanwhile three others mendicants who had led the spiritual life under the Buddha were reborn in the inferior fairy realmThere they amused themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation and became my servants and attendantsAt that Gopaka scolded themWhere on earth were you at good sirs when you heard the Buddhas teachingFor while I was still a woman I had confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and had fulfilled my ethics I lost my attachment to femininity and developed masculinity When my body broke up after death I was reborn in a good place a heavenly realm In the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree I became one of Sakkas sonsHere they know me asthe god GopakaBut you having led the spiritual life under the Buddha were reborn in the inferior fairy realmWhen scolded by Gopaka two of those gods in that very life gained mindfulness leading to the host of Brahmās Ministers But one god remained attached to sensualityI was a laywoman disciple of the seerand my name was GopikāI was devoted to the Buddha and the teachingand I faithfully served the SaṅghaBecause of the excellence of the Buddhas teachingIm now a mighty splendid son of Sakkareborn among the Three and ThirtyAnd here they know me as GopakaThen I saw some mendicants who Id seen beforedwelling in the host of fairiesWhen I used to be a humanthey were disciples of GotamaI served them with food and drinkand clasped their feet in my own homeWhere on earth were they atwhen they learned the Buddhas teachingsFor each must know for themselves the teachingso welltaught realized by the seerI was one who followed youhaving heard the fine words of the noble onesIm now a mighty splendid son of Sakkareborn among the Three and ThirtyBut you followed the best of menand led the supreme spiritual lifebut still youre born in this lesser realma rebirth not befittingIts a sorry sight I see good sirsfellow Buddhists in a lesser realmReborn in the host of fairiesyou only wait upon the godsMeanwhile I dwelt in a housebut see my distinction nowHaving been a woman now Im a male godblessed with heavenly sensual pleasuresScolded by that disciple of Gotamawhen they understood Gopaka they were struck with urgencyLets strive lets try hardwe wont serve others any moreTwo of them aroused energyrecalling the Buddhas instructionsRight away they became dispassionateseeing the drawbacks in sensual pleasuresThe fetters and bonds of sensual pleasuresthe ties of the Wicked One so hard to breakthey burst them like a bull elephant his ropesand passed right over the ThirtyThreeThe gods with Indra and Pajāpatiwere all gathered in the Hall of JusticeAs they sat there they passed over themthe heroes desireless practicing puritySeeing them Vāsava was struck with a sense of urgencythe master of gods in the midst of the group saidThese were born in the lesser fairy realmbut now they pass us byHeeding the speech of one so movedGopaka addressed VāsavaThere is a Buddha a lord of men in the worldKnown as the Sakyan Sage hes mastered the sensesThose sons of his were bereft of mindfulnessbut when scolded by me they gained it backOf the three there is one who remainsdwelling in the host of fairiesBut two recollecting the path to awakeningserene spurn even the godsThe teachings explained in such a waythat not a single disciple doubts itWe venerate the Buddha the victor lord of menwho has crossed the flood and cut off doubtThey attained to distinction fittingthe extent to which they understood the teaching hereTwo of them mastered the distinction ofthe host of Brahmās MinistersWe have come here dear sirto realize this same teachingIf the Buddha would give me a chanceI would ask a question dear sirThen the Buddha thoughtFor a long time now this spirit has led a pure life Any question he asks me will be beneficial not uselessAnd he will quickly understand any answer I give to his questionSo the Buddha addressed Sakka in verseAsk me your question Vāsavawhatever you wantIll solve each and everyproblem you haveThe first recitation section is finishedHaving been granted an opportunity by the Buddha Sakka asked the first

abscess a dart Passion drags a person to be reborn in life after lifeThats why a person finds themselves in states high and lowElsewhere among other ascetics and brahmins I wasnt even given a chance to ask these questions that the Buddha has answeredThe dart of doubt and uncertainty has lain within me for a long time but the Buddha has plucked it outLord of gods do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahminsI do sirIf you wouldnt mind lord of gods tell me how they answeredIts no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting hereWell speak then lord of godsSir I approached those who I imagined were ascetics and brahmins living in the wilderness in remote lodgings But they could not answer and they even questioned me in returnWhat is the venerables nameSo I answered themDear sir I am Sakka lord of godsSo they asked me another questionBut lord of gods what deed brought you to this positionSo I taught them the Dhamma as I had learned and memorized itAnd they were pleased with just that muchWe have seen Sakka lord of gods And he answered our questionsInvariably they become my disciples I dont become theirsBut sir I am the Buddhas disciple a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningOn Feeling HappyLord of gods do you recall ever feeling such joy and happiness beforeI do sirBut howOnce upon a time sir a battle was fought between the gods and the demonsIn that battle the gods won and the demons lostIt occurred to me as victorNow the gods shall enjoy both the nectar of the gods and the nectar of the demonsBut sir that joy and happiness is in the sphere of the rod and the sword It doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentBut the joy and happiness I feel listening to the Buddhas teaching is not in the sphere of the rod and the sword It does lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentBut lord of gods what reason do you see for speaking of such joy and happinessI see six reasons to speak of such joy and happiness sirWhile staying right hereremaining in the godly formI have gained an extended lifeknow this dear sirThis is the first reasonWhen I fall from the heavenly hostleaving behind the nonhuman lifeI shall consciously go to a new wombwherever my mind delightsThis is the second reasonLiving happily under the guidanceof the one of unclouded wisdomI shall practice according to methodaware and mindfulThis is the third reasonAnd if awakening should ariseas I practice according to the methodI shall live as one who understandsand my end shall come right thereThis is the fourth reasonWhen I fall from the human realmleaving behind the human lifeI shall become a god againin the supreme heaven realmThis is the fifth reasonThey are the finest of godsthe glorious AkaniṭṭhasSo long as my final life goes onthere my home will beThis is the sixth reasonSeeing these six reasons I speak of such joy and happinessMy wishes unfulfilleddoubting and undecidedI wandered for such a long timein search of the Realized OneI imagined that asceticsliving in seclusionmust surely be awakenedso I went to sit near themHow is there successHow is there failureBut they couldnt answer such questionsabout the path and practiceAnd when they found out that Iwas Sakka come from the godsthey questioned me instead aboutthe deed that brought me to this stateI taught them the Dhammaas I had learned it among menThey were delighted with that sayingWeve seen VāsavaNow since Ive seen the Buddhawho helps us overcome doubttoday free of fearI pay homage to the awakened oneDestroyer of the dart of cravingthe Buddha is unrivaledI bow to the great herothe Buddha Kinsman of the SunJust

moment was eased of her great sorrowand it was like being sprinkled on the head with a hundred pots of cool water brought from lake Anotattaand being free from fever she was delightedand explaining the joy and gladness that had arisen because of the acceptance of these serious rulesshe uttered this exalted utterance It is as though and so onIt is as though venerable nandaa woman or a man young youthful having ornaments with head washedhad been given a garland of waterlilies or a garland of jasmine or a garland of whirlybird flowersand having accepted it with both hands were to place it on top of the most important limb on the headjust so venerable nandaI accept these eight serious rules which should not be transgressed for as long as life lastsThen venerable nanda approached the Fortunate Oneand after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one sideWhile sitting on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate OneMahāpajāpatī Gotamī reverend Sir has acceptedthe eight serious rules which should not be transgressed for as long as life lastsIf nanda women in this Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised One had not obtainedthe going forth from the home to the homeless lifenanda the spiritual life would have been longlastingthe Good Dhamma would have endured for a thousand yearsBut because nanda women in this Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised Onehave gone forth from the home to the homeless lifenow nanda the spiritual life will not be longlastingthe Good Dhamma nanda will now endure for only five hundred yearsJust as nanda those families having lots of women and few menare easily plundered by thieves and nighttime robbersBy nighttime robbers means having lit lights in a potand discerned valuables in anothers house by their light they are plundered by burglars and thievesjust so nanda wherever in this Dhamma and Disciple women receivethe going forth from the home to the homeless lifethe spiritual life will not be longlastingJust as nanda in ripe rice fieldswhich go down with the disease called DeadheartThe disease called Deadheart meanssome worms pierce the stem and enter the middle of the stalkAt the place where it departs from the pierced stemthe sap is not able to get to the rice headthat rice field is not longlastingjust so nanda wherever in this Dhamma and Disciple women receivethe going forth from the home to the homeless lifethe spiritual life will not be longlastingJust as nanda in ripe sugarcane fieldswhich go down with the disease called Red RotThe disease called Red Rot means being reddened on the inside of the sugar canethat sugarcane field is not longlastingjust so nanda wherever in this Dhamma and Disciple women receivethe going forth from the home to the homeless lifethe spiritual life will not be longlastingJust as nanda a man might prepare an embankment as a precaution round a large lakeso that the water does not overflowjust so nandathe eight serious rules were laid down by me as a precautionwhich should not be transgressed for as long as life lastsAn embankment as a precaution round a large lakethis is the meaning that is shown in thisjust as with a large tank that has no embankmentwhatever water could have stayed there had there been a embankment at the beginningcannot stay there cannot remain because there is no embankmentin the same way although these grounds for offense have not arisenthe precaution is taken that the serious rules that are not to be transgressed are laid downbecause if for women these rules about going forth were not laid downthe Good Dhamma can endure only for five hundred yearsBut with the precaution regarding the going forth being laid down they will endure for another five hundred yearsThus at first it was said it will endure for one thousand yearsOne thousand yearsthis was said in regard to those who have attained destruction of the pollutants together with the analytic knowledgesbut a further thousand years beyond that for those who have attained destruction of the pollutants through dry insighta thousand years in regard to those who are NonReturnersa thousand years in regard to those who are OnceReturnersa thousand years in regard to those who are Stream Enterersthus the Good Dhamma of penetration to Awakening will endure for five thousand years in allThen there will be only the Dhamma of learningFor there being no learning there will be no penetrationbut there being learning there will also be penetrationBut the signs of the disappearance of learning will last for a long timeTranslationTranslationin the evening time while sitting in the Dhamma Hallthis conversion aroseIndeed the Buddhas are very powerfulIndeed gods and men have faith in the TeacherBoth on this side and the other side of the Ganges along a pathway for eight leaguesbecause of gaining faith in the Buddhaafter the ground was made smooth by the Kingssand was scattered and various coloured flowers were strewn about kneedeepthrough the power of the Nāgas the waters of the Ganges were covered with lotuses of five coloursas far as the dwelling place of the Highest of the High Divinitiesthe inside of the whole universe became like one great ornament and festivalAfter the Teacher came and asked What is the talk about monks amongst those who have assembled together at presentThey said It is just soMonks this worship and respect didnt arise through the power of my being an Buddhanor through the powers of the Nāgas Gods and High DivinitiesIt arose through the power of trifling donations I made in the pastAfter hearing that he was begged by the monks to show them the pastIn the past in Takkasilā there was a brāhmaṇa called SaṅkhaHis son a sixteen year old student called Susīmaafter approaching his Father one day saidAfter going to Bārāṇasī Dear I wish to learn the scripturesThen his Father said to himAlright Dear a brāhmaṇa called soandso is my friendafter going into his presence you could learn themAfter agreeing by saying Good he gradually went to Bārāṇasīand after approaching the brāhmaṇa he explained he had been sent by his FatherThen after accepting him saying He is my friends sonand relieving his anxietyon an auspicious day he began to recite the scripturesQuickly learning it and learning a great deal he retained it all himselfjust like precious oilin no long time he learned it from his teachers lipsand having learned all he became skilled in making recitation of the teachingand he could understand the beginning and middle of it but not the endAfter approaching his teacher he saidI see the beginning and the middle of this teaching but not the endHaving heard that the teacher said I also do not see it DearWhen this was said he said Then who knows the end teacherAfter being asked he said There are seers living in Isipatanaafter approaching you could ask themWhen this was said by the teacher after approaching the Paccekabuddhas he askedDo you know the end of the teachingYes we knowWill you teach it to meWe will not teach one who has not goneforthif you want to know the meaning of the end you should go forthAfter replying Good he went forth in their presenceThey said to him You should learn thisand saying You should dress thus and you should cover yourself thus and so onthey methodically taught him good conductTraining right there and having the supporting conditionsin no long time after attaining the Pacceka Awakeningthroughout the whole of the city of Bārāṇasī like a fullmoon in the skyhe attained the highest gains and the highest fameAs the deeds he had performed in past lives led only to a short lifespanin no long time he was Finally EmancipatedThen the Paccekabuddhas and the populace after performing the funeral ceremoniesand gathering the relics had a Shrine built at the gate to the cityThe brāhmaṇa Saṅkha thinking My son has been gone a long time I would like to know what happenedand desiring to see him after leaving from Takkasilāgradually reaching Bārāṇasīand seeing the populace gathered roundthinking Surely one of these will know what happened to my sonafter approaching askedA student called Susīma came heredoes anyone know what happened to himYes brāhmaṇa we knowafter learning the Three Vedas from a certain brāhmaṇa and goingforthand attaining Independent Awakening he was Finally Emancipatedand this is the Shrine we establishedAfter beating the ground with his hand crying and weepinggoing to the courtyard of the Shrine and removing the grasscarrying sand in his outer robe and sprinkling it in the courtyard of the Shrineand sprinkling water all round from his water pitcherworshipping with wild flowerserecting his robe as a flagand binding his own parasol over the Shrine he departedThe Teacher after showing them the past saidThen monks I was the brāhmaṇa SaṅkhaI removed the grass in the courtyard of the Paccekabuddha Susīmas ShrineBecause of that deed of mineafter clearing the road for eight leagues around of thorns and stumpsthe Kings made the ground clean and evenI sprinkled sand thereBecause of that deed of minesand was sprinkled on the road for eight leaguesI worshiped there with wild flowersBecause of that deed of minevarious coloured flowers were sprinkled round the road for eight leaguesand fivecoloured lotuses covered the top of the waters of the Ganges for one leagueI sprinkled the ground all round with water from my water pitcherBecause of that deed of mineit rained flowers down on VesālīThere I erected my robe and bound the parasolBecause of that deed of mineas far as the dwelling place of the Highest of the High Divinities there were flags robes and parasols upon parasols and so on raised on highand the inside of the whole universe became like one great ornament and festivalThus monks this worship and honourdid not arise for me because of the power of being an Buddhanor through the powers of the Nāgas Gods and High Divinitiesbut because of the power of trifling donations I made in the pastAfter saying that teaching the Dhamma he recited this versethere was a river named the RohiṇīHaving bound the river in with a dikeThen in the month of Jeṭṭhathe workers from both cities assembled togetherThere those who dwelt in Koliya city saidThis water is not enough for both you and us to carry awaybut our crops will mature with a single wateringtherefore give us this waterThose who dwelt in Kapilavatthu city saidAfter you have filled your storestaken our red gold blue jewels and black coinswe will not be able with handbaskets and sacks in our hands to wander to the doors of your housesbut our crops will mature with a single wateringtherefore give us this waterWe will not giveWe will not give eitherAfter the quarrel had grown one of them rose up and gave another a blowand he to another thus after striking one anotherand offending against the birth of the Kingly families the quarrel grewand the Koliyan workers saidHaving siezed you people of Kapilavatthu sons of the Sākiyans you can roar awayLike dogs and jackals and others you have cohabited with your own sistersWhat will they do to us with their elephants and horses their shields and swords and so onThe Sākiyan workers also saidNow having siezed you sons of lepers you can roar awayLike helpless and miserable animals they dwelt in Jujube treesWhat will they do to us with their elephants and horses their shields and swords and so onHaving left that place they related all that was done to the appointed councillorsand they related it to the ministers of the Kingly clanThen the Sākiyans said We will show them the power and strength of those who cohabited with their sistersand that day they went out to fightThe Koliyans also said We will show them the power and strength of those who dwell in Jujube treesand that day they went out to fightOther teachers say Slaves of the Sākiyans and Koliyans after going to the river for waterand placing their headrollssat around having a pleasant conversationOne of them took anothers headroll thinking it her ownand because of this saying This is my headroll this is your headrollgradually a quarrel broke out between the slaveworkers who dwelt in both citiesand also between the servants headmen ministers and princesand that day they all went out to fightBut the former explanation has come down in many of the ancient Commentariesand it is considered suitable to uphold itAnd so that day in the evening time they will go out to fightThen at that time the Fortunate One was living near Sāvatthīand towards the time of dawn he was looking around the worldand saw these groups going out to battle that dayHaving seen it considering With my going there will this quarrel be pacified or will it nothe knew Having gone there for the purpose of pacifying the quarrel I will relate three Storiesand the quarrel will be pacified through thatThen for the purpose of illustrating the benefits of concord after relating two Stories I will teach the Discourse on Taking up a StickThen having heard that teaching those people who dwell in both citieswill give twohundred and fifty young men eachI will make them go forth and there will be a Great Assembly at the conclusionThen after taking care of his body in the morningand entering Sāvatthī for alms he returned after the alms roundIn the evening time after leaving the Perfumed Cottage without having told anyonetaking his robe and bowlin the sky between the two armies after folding his legs crosswiseto make it dark during the day for the purpose of giving them spiritual anxietyhe sat there emitting rays from his darkcoloured hairThen seeing their minds were anxioushe emitted the sixcoloured Buddha raysHaving seen the Fortunate One those who resided at Kapilavatthu after thinking The Teacher our foremost relative has comehas he seen the reason for our disputeunderstood It is not possible now the Teacher has cometo attack the bodies of others with spearslet the people dwelling in Koliya kill or capture us and they threw aside their weaponsThe people dwelling in Koliya also did the sameThen the Fortunate One having descended from the sky in that delightful placesat down on the appointed noble Buddha seat in a sandy bedwith his unmatched Buddhaglory shiningThose Kings having worshipped the Fortunate One sat downThen the Teacher knowingly asked Why have you come Great KingsNot for seeing the river venerable Sir not for playbut having got ready for battle in this place we have comeThis dispute is on account of what Great KingsOn account of water venerable SirWhat is water worth Great KingsIt has little worth venerable SirAnd what is earth worth Great KingsIt is priceless venerable SirWhat are Nobles worth Great KingsNobles are also priceless venerable SirWhy would you destroy Nobles Great KingsThere is certainly no satisfaction in this quarrelBecause of a quarrel Great Kingsa certain tree god and a black lionwere bound by anger reaching through the whole aeonand having said that he related the Phandana Tree StoryAfter that he said There should certainly not be Great Kings this relying on the word of anotherHaving relied on another through the tale of one harea great crowd of fourfooted animals stretching three thousand leagueshave jumped into the great oceantherefore one shouldnt rely on the word of anotherand having said that he related the Thud StoryAfter that he said Sometimes the one who is weak Great Kingssees the strong ones faultsometimes the strong one sees the weak ones faulttherefore a quail bird once slaughtered a Nāga elephantand having said that he related the Quail StoryThus having related three Stories to pacify the quarrelto illustrate the value of concord he related two StoriesThere is no one able to find fault in concord Great Kingsand having said that he related the Righteous Tree StoryAfter that he said Nobody was able Great Kings to find an opening when there was concordBut when a dispute had arisen amongst one anotherthen one hunters son having destroyed their lives took them awayThere is certainly no satisfaction in disputesand having said that he related the Quail StoryThus having related these five Storiesat the end he related the Discourse on Taking up a StickThen the Kings being pleased said If the Teacher had not comehaving slaughtered each other we would have set flowing a river of bloodbecause of the Teacher we have received back our livesIf the Teacher had lived in the housethe four great island kingdoms surrounded by the twothousand islands would have gone into his handand he would have had more than a thousand childrenand would have gone about with a retinue of NoblesBut after giving up his fortune and going forth he attained Complete AwakeningNow he should go around with a retinue of Nobles alsoand those who dwelt in the two cities gave twohundred and fifty young men eachand the Fortunate One having given them the goingforth returned to the Great WoodNow while the Teacher was living in Jetas Woodhe told this about the seductions of a former wifeIn relating the story after asking the monk what was the cause of his dissatisfactionhe said It is because of my former wifeMonk this one has been unbeneficial to you in the past alsoand having lost the absorptions because of heryou came to a great calamity and after saying this he spoke aboutIn the past when King Brahmadatta was ruling in Benaresthe Awakening One after being born in a noble and wealthy brahmin family came of age and learned a craftThen after goingforth in the Seers ordination and attaining the absorptions and deep knowledgeshe made his dwelling in the area of the HimālayasThen one deer at the place where he was urinatinghaving eaten grass mixed with semen drank waterSo much was her mind bound to him that after becoming pregnantfrom that time forth after going somewhere and eating grass in that placeshe wandered around in the neighbourhood of his hermitageThe Great Being after examining the facts understood the reasonAfterwards she gave birth to a human boyThe Great Being brought him up with a Fathers loveNow when he had come of age his Father after giving the goingforthtaught him the preliminary meditation exerciseIn no long time having given rise to the absorptions and the deep knowledges he amused himself with the bliss of absorptionand had awful power and the faculty of the greatest resolveBecause of the power of his virtue Sakkas dwelling place shookReflecting Sakka knew the reason for it and thinkingI will break his virtue through some means or otherfor three long years he prevented rain in the whole kingdom of Kāsīuntil the kingdom was as though burnt by fireWith an unsuccessful harvest the people having become oppressed by faminethey blamed it on the impurity of the KingThen they stood at the Kings window and asked Why is this sayingGreat King for three years the skygod hasnt rained and the whole kingdom is dried uppeople are suffering make the skygod rain KingThe King after establishing the virtuous practices and maintaining the fastday was still unable to make the rain fall downAt that time in the middle of the nighttime Sakkaafter entering and illuminating the royal chamber stood in the airThe King having seen him asked Who are youI am SakkaWhat have you come forDoes the skygod rain on your kingdom Great KingHe doesnt rainBut do you know the reason for it not rainingI do not knowGreat King in the area of the Himālayas lives an ascetic named Isisiṅgawho has awful power and the faculty of the greatest resolveWhen the skygod rains regularly becoming angry he glares at the skytherefore the skygod does not rainBut now what is to be done in this caseWhen his power is broken the skygod will rainBut who is able to break his powerYour daughter Great King Naḷinikā is able After summoning her send her saying After going to such and such a placebreak the ascetics powerThus after advising the King he returned to his own place in HeavenThe King on the following day after discussion with his ministersand summoning his daughter spoke the first verseThe country is dried up and the Kingdom will be destroyedCome Naḷinikā do you go to bring the brahmin  for meHerein him for me bring that unbeneficial brahmin  under your control for mebreak his virtue by the power of the defilement of loveHaving heard that she spoke the second verseI cannot bear suffering King I have no skill in roadsHow will I go through a wood elephants inhabitHerein bear suffering I Great King cannot bear sufferingand I do not know the road how will I goThen the King spoke two versesHaving gone through the prosperous country with an elephant and chariotAnd with a wooden raft  you can go like this NaḷinikāGo and take with you elephants horses soldiers and noblesBy your beauteous form you will bring him under your controlHerein by a wooden raft etc means good Naḷinika not by foot will you gobut through your own prosperous wellfed and safe countryhaving gone with an elephant vehicle a with a chariot vehiclefrom there onwards with covered vehicles and so on in the openairgo across the waters by a naval raft by a wooden raftBy your beauteous form having gone without being weariedby your beautiful and fortunate form you will bring that brahmin  under your controlThus he spoke with his daughter about what shouldnt be spoken of in order to protect his KingdomShe accepted the proposition saying It is goodThen having given her all she required he sent her off with the ministersThe ministers after taking her arriving at the borderlandssetting up the camp in that place having the Kings daughter taken upentering the Himālayas with a forester who knew the pathin the morningtime arrived near to the area of his hermitageAt that time the Buddhatobe after making his son stay behind in the hermitagehad himself entered the wilds looking for various kinds of fruitThe forester after approaching his hermitage and standing near that lovely placewhile pointing it out spoke two verses to NaḷinikāMarked by the sign of the plantain surrounded by the Himālayan birchHere is seen Isisiṅgas delightful hermitageHere is seen the smoke of what is reckoned a fireI think it is emitted now from the very powerful Isisiṅgas sacred fireHerein what is reckoned as a plantain the flag the sign of that is marked by the sign of the plantainSurrounded by the Himālayan birch means encircled by a wood of willow treesReckoned means the

StreamEntryThe Buddha said at that time Naḷinikā was his former wife Isisiṅga was the dissatisfied monkand I the FatherRemembering the promise he had given to the greatly famous Bimbisāra  an abode of virtue who was like a flag in the noble line of kings  and wishing to be freed from ithe went to the garden called the Laṭṭhi Wood which was ornamented with countless trees and groves where groups of peacocks had begun to danceThe Lord of Men Bimbisāra having heard of the Great Seers coming adorned with the ornament of joy and happinesssurrounded by his great ministers after going to that garden beautifying the hair of his head with the lotuslike feet of the Teacherwhile sitting gave to Bimbisāra the Deathless waters of the True Dhamma Then resplendent with the beauty the great beauty sung of by Sakka the King of the Devasthe Greatly Famous One honoured by Devas Dānavas and SnakeLords after going to fair Rājagaha which was like the Lord of the Devas cityand being led to the Lord of Mens house by the Lord of Men himself at the end of the meal the Best of Men making the great Earth shakeaccepted the fair Bamboo Grove Monastery which was resplendent with fullflowering kingly trees that brought pleasure to the eyesHaving made a fence out of his mass of pure and excellent moral practice and raised the brilliant excellent sceptre of concentration while whirling about the supremely sharp and auspicious arrow of his vast Buddhaknowledge He the Lord of Sages respected by Suras and men having charming lotuslike feet pure lotuslike eyes delightful jasminelike teeth who was an ocean of precious virtues the Protector of those without protection who was beautiful like a golden effulgence with a gentle moonlike face dwelt as he liked in that supreme dwelling place which was situated in a large pure creepercovered arbor on a mass of white sand which decorated the earth which had fragrant flowers the perfume of which was spread about by a gentle breeze and which was adorned with various lotus flowers in the nearby lakeIn that place the walls and gates were made of sapphire rock and appeared like a golden mountain because of the Bodhisattas radianceThe mass of the people having seen him became greatly excited and asked Who is this Is it a Sakka a Brahmā a Māra or a Nāga and so forthHaving entered the city and gathered just enough food for sustenance looking just a yokes distance ahead of him  while going along the Royal Roadthe people were disturbed by him like the ocean that was churned with Mount Meru as a churning stick then having gone to Mount Paṇḍavaand sitting in its shade on a delightful piece of land he began to eat his mixedup foodThe Hero of Great Strength simply through reflection prevented his creeping snakelike innards from emerging from his anthilllike bodyHaving eaten the Best of Men having been approached and offered the kingdom countless times by the Lord of Men Bimbisārarefused the kingdom then he was begged by Bimbisāra saying Having become an unsurpassed Buddha please teach the Dhamma to meThen as this great festival with the Lord of the Devas and his hosts was continuing in this way the Wicked Māra thought thusSo this successful  prince Siddhattha wishes to escape from my sphere of influence straight away I will make him unsuccessfulAfter creating a thousand broad and terrible arms and collecting various blazing weapons with them and mounting the charming and fierce tusker called Girimekhala who was one hundred and fity leagues in extenthe surrounded by his army which had many faces firecoloured hair broad red circular protruding eyes terrible lipbiting mouths snakelike arms and various weaponsafter approaching that place while roaring a most terrible roar ordered Seize and bind this Siddhattha here with the sight of that the hosts of Suras were put to flight like cotton that has arisen in a violent windMāra the Murderer made a fierce and noisy wind like a deep roaring stormcloud  but was not able to move even a corner of his auspicious delightful and excellent robe with it thenhe made fall a terrible and awful rain like the heavy rain at the dissolution of the world but not even a drop of water was able to fall near the Incomparable One then having seen that wonder with a very sad face hecaused to rain down an extremely terrible fire like flaming fiery great rocks ashes and mud a torrent of weapons like rain a torrent of blazing charcoal and sand like rain but all of theseafter approaching from the sky through the strength and power of Māra and falling in the vicinity of him who had reached the peak of merit changed into a garland of flowers and so on then having made a supremely awful darkness like the darkness between the worlds the One of Wicked Character only beheld a mass of exceedingly beautiful and most delightful light that arose and shone from the Bodhisattas body like a hundred risen suns which destroys the darkness of delusionthen his face altogether  red with anger with a frowning appearance  having an extremely fearsome deformed appearance he let fly his most excellent freeflying  WheelWeapon which had an extremely sharp edge which could surely split into pieces  Meru the King of mountains as though it were the soft stem of a palm tree but with the approach of that weapon he was unable to do anything to that Mine of Virtue but having ascended into the sky from that place it became a sunshade made of flowers over his headAlso the great many blazing rocky peaks which were hurled at him having fallen from the sky attained the state of garlands of flowershaving seen that grieving having approached the vicinity of the Hero he said This unconquered seat has come to merise from this seat Then the Devout One who had done good and meritorious deeds said Māra you said you have earned this seatwho is the witness Called upon like this the Wicked One having stretched forth his hand towards his army said All these are witnessesWith a terrible roar of I am witness I am witness after he had made them declare their witness he addressed the Bodhisatta thusWho is your witness Siddhattha Then that Incomparable One said Here Māra I have no sentient witnessesThen after withdrawing his shining right hand from his beautiful dyed robe like golden lightning emerging from a glittering  cloudand pointing towards the earth the earth of his perfections he said Why are you so silent now and having made the earth resoundand having made her roar countless hundreds of times like a roaring stormcloud with the elephantlike strength of a Buddha the elephant Girimekhala was grounded with his knees on the earthHaving seen that Māra after thinking Now let him have it now let him have it  like a brokentoothed snake with its arrogance destroyed having a very sad faceand having abandoned his countless weapons clothes and ornaments he fled with his army as far as the Cakkavāḷa mountain on the edge of the universeThe hosts of Devas after seeing Māras army fleeing in fear in grief spoke thus This is the defeat of Māra and the victory of Prince SiddhatthaRejoicing in that place worshipping the Hero with fragrant perfumes and so on with countless shouts of righteous praise they returned to their abodes clad in festive clothesSo now I will show the range of places used for the Rains Retreat by the One who Gives Benefit to the Three

Bodhisattas Great Renunciation that noble horse while being harnessed by Channa neighed excitedlyThat noise went out and spread over the whole city but all the Hosts of Suras in the city allowed no one to hear itThen that Good Man thought joyously First having seen my unsurpassed son and having departed later on I will become a BuddhaAfter thinking thus and going to his wifes apartments and

the ocean of the Vedas  That Budding Victor  after the death of his parentshaving been shown the immeasurable wealth by the councillor who managed the estate and after surveying that mass in the countless hundreds of storeroomsand piling up the wealth said Alas My father and the rest have gone to the gods and have not taken even one cent  with themThat Mine of Virtue became really anxious  and thought thus Although I have received this valuable wealth I am bound to goHaving sat down in seclusion in his own beautiful house while surveying the faults in the body and advising himself he thought thusPainful is the breakup of the body painful also is its arising again  I am subject to death subject to old age subject to sicknessHaving thus seen the countless faults in the body and so on after informing the king and having the drums beaten in the cityfor seven days thereafter he satisfied the beggars who gathered at the sound of the drum with a flood of gifts just as bees gather and are satisfied with the sweet scent of a multitude of blossomsThe Excellent One having approached the supreme garden which was like the very joyful Lord of the Devas Nandana Grove  in Tāvatisa a grove shining with rows of fullblossoming Sāla trees which like a row of bees which stole the peoples minds and eyesand having spent the day in that place in the eveningtime went with the grace of a lion to the vicinity of the Bodhi TreeThe Lord of Men set out along a wide road which had been prepared by Brahmās Suras Asuras Great Snakes and BirdKings  The twiceborn brāhmaṇa Sotthiya a grass collector having seen him offered him a handful of grassAs the Supreme Man was going along blue waterlilies lotuses and other flowers fell like showers of rain from the skyAs the Supreme Man was going

silver mountain covered in coral and sapphire while standing on firm faultless ground on the Eastern side of the tree threw a fistful of grassAt once there was a fourteencubit seat then the One of Great Wisdom having seen that wonder thoughtLet my flesh blood bones muscles and skin dry up but I will surely never give up the effort to attain AwakeningThe Great Champion the Supreme Man sat in

stood at the head of the dancinggirls singing songs of praiseAlso thirtytwo princesses stood there worshipping with a golden casket full of divine flowers they had taken hold ofThe Firm One while lying in that place after raising his charming lotuseyes and once more contemplating the Buddha thought thusIf I so wished today after slaying the endless battle of existence and becoming a novice in the Saṅgha I could enter the excellent city of NibbānaBut what is there for me in another dress or in the destruction of the defilements  Like this Buddha Complete Emancipation is best for me only after becoming a supreme Buddha myself and carrying the people across the ocean of existence with the boat of the Dhamma and bringing them to the City of NibbānaAfter reflecting thus while lying there in the mud like a very lovely banana trunk he radiated beautifullyThe Hero after seeing the pleasing and Fortunate individual with his mind detached and his six coloured rays his heart uplifted with the joy that had arisen made his aspiration for Complete AwakeningAfter approaching the place where the sage was lying in the mud also being a bridge for the world and seeing him making a bridge out

senses after hearing the Victorious Ones word rejoicing arising from the mud and folding his legs crosswise sat down on the flower seat and was worshipped by the assembly of Devas with flowers and so onThe Devas from the ten thousand worldsystems rejoicing praised the Hero who was sitting on the flowerseatThen while sitting he examined above below in the main and intermediate directions what things make one Awakenedexamining all the elements of the Dhamma in this way the first thing he saw in his own stream of consciousness  was the perfection of givingunderstanding it thus and seeking out the next perfection in this way after seeing by himself with the eye of knowledge all the perfectionsand enduring a great deal of suffering in the rolling on of Sasāra  seeking the peaceful the deathless after fulfilling the perfection of giving giving to all beings like a wishfulfilling tree or a wishfulfilling jewel granting their desires he gave whatever they longed for beginning with excellent food and so forth and doing a good many other things as many as the stars in the sky gladly the Hero having torn out his charming eyes gave them to beggarshe also gave his bodys flesh more than the dust on the earth and his blood more than the waters in the oceanAfter giving away his diademardorned heads in excess of Mount Sineru  and making the earth shake he gave away his wife and childrenThus after fulfilling all the perfections such as virtue renunciation and wisdom and attaining his individuality as Vessantara and from there passing awayand rearising in the Tusita Heaven  the beautiful abode of the Suras for a very long time he dwelt there enjoying endless blessingsHaving worshipped the Great Seers supreme lotus feet with my head which gives the sweetness of

and honeyballs brought by the merchants in the bowl offered by the Great KingsAt the end of his meal having gone to the root of the GoatHerders Tree he recalled the profundity of the Dhamma he had understood thusThis Dhamma which has been understood by me is deep and peaceful like the mass of water borne by the earth and so onWhile the King of the Dhamma was reflecting mindfully on the deep nature of the Dhamma thinking While I was practising and thinking to penetrate this Dhammawith great effort to those who came forward  and requested it after cutting off my head delightfully decorated

endowed with firm strength and Kanthaka the supreme horse each individually thought of overcoming the wall in the same wayThen having understood the Bodhisattas mind the Suras who were in possession of the door rejoicing in the auspicious departure opened the doorThen Māra the Murderer thought This Siddhattha the one who has accomplished his aim I will make one who has not accomplished his aim  and after going up into the firmament while standing there he said this to himDo not renounce the world Great Champion seven days from now the divine Wheel Treasure  will certainly appear to youThe

the food and drink respectfully offer their thankssaying  May our relatives live long Those to whom we owe this gainfor we have been honoured those who give are not without rewardFor in that place there is no ploughing and cattlerearing is not found theresimilarly there is no trading or buying and selling of goldThe departed in that place who have died have to subsist on giftsJust as water that rains on the highlands flows down to the lowlandsso too what has been given here is of benefit to the departedJust as rivers that are full flow and fill up the oceanso too what has been given here is

all things on every occasionfor perhaps those savings are removed from that place or he forgets the signs telling where they lieor nāgas take them away or yakkhas carry them offor the heirs he dislikes extract them unseenand when his merit comes to an end all of it will be destroyedBut that woman or man who through giving virtuerestraint and selfcontrol has well stored up his savingsplacing

sensual pleasuresThen several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for almsThen after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the

and told him had happened They asked the BuddhaSir where have those laywomen been reborn in the next lifeAmong those laywomen there were streamenterers oncereturners and nonreturnersNone of those laywomen died without some fruit of the practiceThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentThe world is caught up in delusionbut is looked on as making senseThe fool caught up in attachmentis surrounded by darknessIt seems as if eternalbut for one who sees there is nothingSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a brahmin town of the Mallas named ThūṇaThe brahmins and householders of Thūṇa heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familywhile wandering in the land of the Mallas has arrived at Thūṇa together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsThey filled the well with grass and chaff right to the top thinkingDont let these shavelings these fake ascetics drink the waterAnd then the Buddha left the road went to the root of a tree and sat down on the seat spread outWhen he was seated he said to Venerable nandaPlease

Grove the squirrels feeding groundAt that time Venerables Sāriputta and Moggallāna were staying near the pigeons alcoveNow at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting outdoors in the moonlight his head freshly shaven having entered a certain state of immersionNow at that time two native spirits who were friends were on their way from the north to the south on some businessThey saw Sāriputta meditating thereOne of the spirits said to the otherI feel inspired friend to give this ascetic a blow on the headThe other spirit repliedEnough friend dont hit the asceticThat is an eminent ascetic powerful and mightyFor a second time the first spirit said to the otherI feel inspired friend to give this ascetic a blow on the headFor a second time the other spirit repliedEnough friend dont hit the asceticThat is an eminent ascetic powerful and mightyFor a third time the first spirit said to the otherI feel inspired friend to give this ascetic a blow on the headFor a third time the other spirit repliedEnough friend dont hit the asceticThat is an eminent ascetic powerful and mightyIgnoring his friend the first spirit struck SāriputtaThe blow was so strong it would have felled a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits tall or split apart a great mountain peakBut then the spirit crying out I burn I burn fell into the Great Hell right thereWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman Venerable Moggallāna saw that spirit striking Venerable SāriputtaHe approached him and saidI hope youre keeping well reverend I hope youre alright I hope that you are not in painI am alright Reverend Moggallānabut my head does hurt a littleIts incredible Reverend Sāriputta its amazingHow mighty and powerful is Venerable SāriputtaJust now a native spirit struck you on the headThe

littleIts incredible Reverend Moggallāna its amazingHow mighty and powerful is Venerable Moggallāna in that he can even see a native spiritWhereas I cant even see a mudgoblin right nowWith clairaudience that is purified and superhuman the Buddha heard that discussion between those two spiritual giantsThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentOne whose mind is like a rocksteady never tremblingfree of desire for desirable thingsnot getting annoyed when things are annoyingfrom where will suffering strike onewhose mind is developed like thisSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas MonasteryNow at that time Buddha lived crowded by monks nuns laymen and laywomen by rulers and their ministers and teachers of other paths and their disciplesCrowded he lived in suffering and discomfortThen he thoughtThese days I live crowded by monks nuns laymen and laywomen by rulers and their ministers and teachers of other paths and their disciplesCrowded I live in suffering and discomfortWhy dont I live alone withdrawn from the groupThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kosambi for almsAfter the meal on his return from almsround he set his lodgings in order himself Taking his bowl and robe without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha he set out to go wandering alone towards Pārileyya with no companionWhen he eventually arrivedhe stayed in a protected forest grove at the foot of an auspicious sal treeA certain bull elephant was also living crowded by live crowded by other males females younglings and cubsHe ate the grass theyd trampled and they ate the broken branches he dragged down He drank muddy water and after his bath the female elephants bumped into himCrowded he lived in suffering and discomfortThen he thoughtThese days I live crowded by other males females younglings and cubs I eat the grass theyve trampled and they eat the broken branches Ive dragged down I drink muddy water and after my bath the female elephants bump into me Crowded I live in suffering and discomfortWhy dont I live alone withdrawn from the herdSo he left the herd and went to Pārileyya where he approached the Buddha in the protected forest grove at the foot of an auspicious sal treeThere he attended on the Buddha clearing the vegetation from the place where the Buddha stayed and using his trunk to set out water for drinking and washingThen as the Buddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mindFormerly I lived crowded by monks nuns laymen and laywomen by rulers and their ministers and teachers of other paths and their disciples Crowded I live in suffering and discomfortBut now I live uncrowded by monks nuns laymen and laywomen by rulers and their ministers and teachers of other paths and their disciples Being uncrowded I live in happiness and comfortAnd to the bull elephant also this thought came to mindFormerly I lived crowded by other males females younglings and cubs I ate the grass theyd trampled and they ate the broken branches Id dragged down I drank muddy water and after my bath the female elephants bumped into me Crowded I lived in suffering and discomfortBut now I live uncrowded by other males females younglings and cubs I eat untrampled grass and other elephants dont eat the broken branches I have dragged down I dont drink muddy water and the female elephants dont bump into me after my bath Being uncrowded I live in happiness and comfortThen understanding his own seclusion and knowing what that elephant was thinking on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentThe giant elephantwith tusks like chariotpolesagrees heart to heart with the spiritual giantsince each finds joy in the woods aloneWith MeghiyaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā on the Cālikā mountainNow at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddhas attendantThen Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to himSir Id like to enter Jantu village for almsPlease Meghiya go at your convenienceThen Meghiya robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Jantu village for almsAfter the meal on his return from almsround in Jantu village he went to the shore of Kimikālā riverAs he was going for a walk along the shore of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango groveWhen he saw this he thoughtOh this mango grove is lovely and delightful Its truly good enough for meditation for a kinsman who wants to meditateIf the Buddha allows me Ill come back to this mango grove to meditateThen Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened addingIf the Buddha allows me Ill go back to that mango grove to meditateWhen he had spoken the Buddha said to himWere alone Meghiya Wait until another mendicant comesFor a second time Meghiya said to the BuddhaSir the Buddha has nothing more to do and nothing that needs improvementBut I haveIf you allow me Ill go back to that mango grove to meditateFor a second time the Buddha saidWere alone Meghiya Wait until another mendicant comesFor a third time Meghiya said to the BuddhaSir the Buddha has nothing more to do and nothing that needs improvementBut I haveIf you allow me Ill go back to that mango grove to meditateMeghiya since you speak of meditation what can I sayPlease Meghiya go at your convenienceThen Meghiya got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he went to that mango grove and having plunged deep into it sat at the root of a certain tree for the days meditationBut while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad unskillful thoughts namelysensual malicious and cruel thoughtsThen he thoughtIts incredible its amazingIve gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faithbut Im still harassed by these three kinds of bad unskillful thoughtssensual malicious and cruel thoughtsThen in the late afternoon Venerable Meghiya came out of retreat and went to the Buddha He bowed sat down to one side and told the Buddha what had happenedMeghiya when the hearts release is not ripe five things help it ripenWhat fiveFirstly a mendicant has good friends companions and associatesThis is the first thing Furthermore a mendicant is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertakenThis is the second thing Furthermore a mendicant gets to take part in talk about selfeffacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment when they want without trouble or difficulty That is talk about fewness of wishes contentment seclusion aloofness arousing energy ethics immersion wisdom freedom and the knowledge and vision of freedomThis is the third thing Furthermore a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities They are strong staunchly vigorous not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualitiesThis is the fourth thing Furthermore a mendicant is wise They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble penetrative and leads to the complete ending of sufferingThis is the fifth thing that when the hearts release is not ripe helps it ripenThese are the five things that when the hearts release is not ripe help it ripenA mendicant with good friends companions and associates can expect to be ethical A mendicant with good friends companions and associates can expect to take part in talk about selfeffacement that helps open the heart A mendicant with good friends companions and associates can expect to be energetic A mendicant with good friends companions and associates can expect to be wise But then a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further thingsThey should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed love to give up hate mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit I amWhen you perceive impermanence the perception of notself becomes stabilized Perceiving notself you uproot the conceit I am

the minds of the mendicants staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā the Buddha said to Venerable nandaA light it appears to me has arisen in this quarter nanda a brightness has arisenIm not put off

thoughtHe is practicing the imperturbable meditationThey all sat in imperturbable meditationAnd then as the night was getting late in the first watch of the night Venerable nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and saidSir the night is getting late It is the first watch of the night and the visiting mendicants have been sitting

monasteryNow at that time a certain mendicant was sitting not far from the Buddha crosslegged with his body straight As a result of past deeds he suffered painful sharp severe and acute feelings which he endured unperturbed with mindfulness and awarenessThe Buddha saw him meditating and enduring that painThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentA mendicant who has left all deeds behindshaking off the dust of past deedsunselfish steady poisedhas no need to complainSo I have heardAt one time when he was first awakened the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the tree of awakening on the bank of the Nerañjarā RiverThere the Buddha sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomWhen seven days had passed the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion and surveyed the world with the eye of a BuddhaHe saw sentient beings tormented with many torments and burning with many feversborn of greed hate and delusionThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentThis world born in tormentovercome by contact speaks of disease as the selfFor whatever it thinks it is it turns out to be something elseThe world is attached to continued existence overcome by continued existencetaking pleasure only in continued existence yet it becomes something elseWhat it enjoys that is the fearwhat it fears that is the sufferingBut this spiritual life is ledin order to give up continued existenceOf the ascetics and brahmins who say that through continued existence one is freed from continued existence none are themselves freed from continued existence I sayOf the ascetics and brahmins who say that through annihilation of existence one escapes from continued existence none have themselves escaped from continued existence I sayFor this suffering originates dependent on all attachment With the ending of all grasping there is no origination of sufferingJust look at this worldMired in all sorts of ignorance beings in love with being are not released from continued existenceWhatever states of continued existence there areeverywhere all overall are impermanent suffering and perishableIn this way one seeing with right wisdomin accord with truthgives up craving for continued existencewhile not look forward to ending existenceExtinguishment comes from the ending of all cravingsfading away and cessation with nothing left overThere is no further existencefor that mendicant extinguished without graspingVictorious in

passed Mahākassapa emerged from that state of immersionIt occurred to himWhy not enter Rājagaha for almsfoodNow at that time five hundred deities were ready and eager for the chance to offer alms to MahākassapaBut Mahākasspa refused those deities In the morning he robed up took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for almsNow at that time Sakka lord of Gods wished to give alms to MahākassapaHaving manifested in the appearance of a weaver he worked the loom while the demon maiden Sujā fed the shuttleThen as Mahākassapa wandered indiscriminately for almsfood in Rājagaha he approached Sakkas houseSeeing Mahākassapa coming off in the distanceSakka came out of his house greeted him and took the bowl from his hand He reentered the house and filled the bowl with rice from the potThat almsfood had many tasty soups and saucesThen it occurred to MahākassapaNow what being is this who has such psychic powerIt occurred to himThis is Sakka lord of GodsKnowing this he said to SakkaThis is your doing Kosiyadont do such a thing againBut sir Kassapa we too need meritWe too ought make meritThen Sakka bowed and respectfully circled Mahākassapa keeping him on his right Then he rose into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky expressed this heartfelt sentiment three timesOh the gift the best gift is well established in KassapaOh the gift the best gift is well established in KassapaOh the gift the best gift is well established in KassapaWith clairaudience that is purified and superhuman the Buddha heard Sakka express this heartfelt sentiment while sitting in the

Pilindavaccha the teacher summons youYes reverend Pilindavaccha replied He went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to himIs it really true Vaccha that you addressed the mendicants as lowlifesYes sir he repliedThen having applied his mind to Pilindavacchas past lives the Buddha said to the mendicantsMendicants dont complain about the mendicant VacchaHe doesnt addresses the mendicants as lowlifes out of hateFor five hundred lives without interruption he was reborn in a brahmin familyFor a long time he has addressed people as lowlifeThats why he addresses the mendicants as lowlifesThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentIn whom dwells no deceit or conceitrid of greed unselfish with no need for

saidHurry back masterRecalling that I am dissatisfied and shall resign the trainingThen the Buddha took Nanda by the arm and as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from Jetas Grove and reappeared among the gods of the ThirtyThreeNow at that time five hundred dovefooted nymphs had come to attend to Sakka the lord of godsThen the Buddha said to NandaNanda do you see these five hundred dovefooted nymphsYes sir he repliedWhat do you think Nanda Who is more attractive goodlooking and lovelythe finest lady of the Sakyan land or these five hundred dovefooted nymphsCompared to these five hundred dovefooted nymphs the finest lady of the Sakyan land is like a deformed monkey with its ears and nose cut offCompared to these five hundred dovefooted nymphs she doesnt count theres no comparison shes not worth a fractionThese five hundred dovefooted nymphs are far more attractive goodlooking and lovelyRejoice Nanda rejoiceI guarantee you five hundred dovefooted nymphsIf sir you guarantee me five hundred dovefooted nymphs I shall happily lead the spiritual life under the BuddhaThen the Buddha took Nanda by the arm and as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the gods of the ThirtyThree and reappeared at Jetas GroveThe mendicants heardIt seems Venerable Nandawho is both the Buddhas halfbrother and maternal cousinleads the spiritual life for the sake of nymphsAnd it seems that the Buddha guaranteed him five hundred dovefooted nymphsMonks who were his friends accused him of being a hireling and a lackeyIt seems Nanda is a hireling it seems he is a lackey he leads the spiritual life for the sake of nymphsAnd it seems that the Buddha guaranteed him five hundred dovefooted nymphsThen Nandahorrified repelled and disgusted at being called a hireling and a lackeyliving alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having

Buddha saidThe wanderers who follow other paths are blind and sightlessThey dont understand what is beneficial or what is not beneficial nor what is the truth and what is not the truthThats why they are arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed wordsOnce upon a time mendicants right here in Sāvatthī there was a certain kingThen the king addressed a manPlease

the streets of the poor the destitute and the weaversThe Buddha saw him wandering for alms in the streets of the poor the destitute and the weaversThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the

this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentHaving barred out bad qualitiesthose who live always mindfulwith fetters ended awakenedthey are the worlds true brahminsThird Upon AwakeningSo I have heardAt one time when he was first awakened the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the tree of awakening on the bank of the Nerañjarā RiverThere the Buddha sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomWhen seven days had passed the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion In the last part of the night he reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse orderWhen this exists that is due to the arising of this that arisesWhen this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases That isIgnorance is a condition for choicesChoices are a condition for consciousnessConsciousness is a condition for name and formName and form are conditions for the six sense fieldsThe six sense fields are conditions for contactContact is a condition for feelingFeeling is a condition for cravingCraving is a condition for graspingGrasping is a condition for continued existenceContinued existence is a

I have heardAt one time when he was first awakened the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the tree of awakening on the bank of the Nerañjarā RiverThere the Buddha sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomWhen seven days had passed the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion In the second part of the night he reflected on dependent origination in

death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress ceaseThat is how this entire mass of suffering ceasesThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentWhen things become clearto the keen meditating brahminhis doubts are dispelledsince hes known the end of conditionsWith BāhiyaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth was residing by Suppāraka on the ocean shore where he was honored respected revered venerated and esteemed And he received robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickThen as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mindI am one of those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfectionThen a deity who was a former relative of Bāhiya having compassion and wanting whats best for him approached him and saidBāhiya youre not a perfected one nor on the path to perfectionYou dont have the practice by which you might become a perfected one or one on the path to perfectionThen who exactly are those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfectionIn the northern lands there is a city called SāvatthīThere that Blessed One is now staying the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHe is a perfected one and teaches the Dhamma for the sake of perfectionImpelled by that deity Bāhiya left Suppāraka right awaySojourning no more than a single night in any place he made his way to Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery in the Jeta Grove at SāvatthīAt that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open airBāhiya approached them and saidSirs where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor I want to see himHe has entered an inhabited area for almsfood BāhiyaThen Bāhiya rushed out of the Jeta Grove and entered Sāvatthī where he saw the Buddha walking for alms He was impressive and inspiring with peaceful faculties and mind attained to the highest selfcontrol and serenity like an elephant with tamed guarded and controlled facultiesBāhiya went up to the Buddha bowed down with his head at the Buddhas feet and saidSir let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach me the DhammaThat would be for my lasting welfare and happinessThe Buddha said thisIts not the time Bāhiya so long as I have entered an inhabited area for almsfoodFor a second time Bāhiya saidBut you never know sir when life is at risk either the Buddhas or my ownLet the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach me the DhammaThat would be for my lasting welfare and happinessFor a second time the Buddha saidIts not the time Bāhiya so long as I have entered an inhabited area for almsfoodFor a third time Bāhiya saidBut you never know sir when life is at risk either the Buddhas or my ownLet the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach me the DhammaThat would be for my lasting welfare and happinessIn that case Bāhiya you should train like thisIn the seen will be merely the seen in the heard will be merely the heard in the thought will be merely the thought in the known will be merely the knownThats how you should trainWhen you have trained in this way you wont be by thatWhen youre not by that you wont be in thatWhen youre not in that you wont be in this world or the world beyond or in between the twoJust this is the end of sufferingThen due to this brief Dhamma teaching of the Buddha Bāhiyas mind was right away freed from defilements by not graspingAnd when the Buddha had given Bāhiya this brief advice he leftBut soon after the Buddha had left a cow with a baby calf charged at Bāhiya and took his lifeThen the Buddha wandered for alms in Sāvatthī After the meal on his return from almsround he departed the city together with several mendicants and saw that Bāhiya had passed awayHe said to the monksMendicants pick up Bāhiyas corpseHaving lifted it onto a cot and carried it cremate itand build a monumentMendicants one of your spiritual companions has passed awayYes sir replied those mendicants They did as the Buddha asked then returned to the BuddhaSir Bāhiyas corpse has been cremated and a monument built for himWhere has he been reborn in his next lifeMendicants Bāhiya was astute He practiced in line with the teachings and did not trouble me about the teachingsBāhiya of the Bark Cloth has become fully extinguishedThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentWhere water and earthfire and air find no footingthere no star does shinenor does the sun shed its lightthere the moon glows notyet no darkness is foundAnd when a sage a brahmin finds understandingthrough their own sagacitythen from forms and formlessfrom pleasure and pain they are releasedSo I have heardAt one time when he was first awakened the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherds banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā RiverThere the Buddha sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomWhen seven days had passed the Buddha emerged from that state of immersionThen a certain brahmin of the whiny sort went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one sideMaster Gotama how do you define a brahmin And what are the things that make one a brahminThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentA brahmin who has barred out bad qualitiesnot whiny not stained but selfcontrolleda complete knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journeymay rightly proclaim the brahmin doctrinefree of pride about anything in the worldWith SaṅgāmajiSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha

to the Jetavana taking their boyNow at that time Venerable Saṅgāmaji was sitting at the root of a tree for the days meditationThen his former wife went up to him and saidI have a little child ascetic

Saṅgāmaji neither looked at the boy nor spoke to himThen his former wife went a little distance away Looking back she saw Saṅgāmaji ignoring the boy and thoughtThis ascetic doesnt even want his childShe returned to pick up the boy then leftWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman the Buddha saw how Saṅgāmajis went back for the childThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion

any ascetic or brahmin at the storehouse of King Pasenadi of Kosala But it was only to drink there not to take awayKnowing this the wanderer thoughtWhy dont I go to the kings storehouse drink as much oil as I can then come home and throw it up so it can be used for the deliveryThen he did just that But when he got home he was unable to either bring it up or pass it outHe rolled to and fro

Mucalinda tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā RiverThere the Buddha sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomJust then a great storm blew up out of season bringing seven days of rain cold winds and cloudsMucalinda the dragon king came out from his abode encircled the Buddhas body with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head thinkingMay the Buddha not be hot or cold nor be bothered by flies mosquitoes wind sun or reptilesWhen seven days had passed the Buddha emerged from that state of immersionWhen he knew the sky was clear Mucalinda unwrapped his coils from the Buddhas body Hiding his own form he manifested in the form of a brahmin youth He stood in front of the Buddha venerating him with joined palmsThen knowing the meaning of this on that
