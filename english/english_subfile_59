Then from the right side the son of Māra called Mārapramardaka said
When the venerable Aśvajit reached the spot where Upatiṣya was
Then the Bhagavān mindfully and knowingly arose from that samādhi
Assuming the lotus posture

How do their physical features come about
Before me with palms joined

Venerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as empty or not empty is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattva
Lord look at us such beautiful maidens

The bodhisattva Maitreya asked the Bhagavān
Similarly the servants starting with Vajrakaṃkāla
He is called the one who is like the udumbara flower because it is so rare for him to appear and be seen
It neither bestows nor withholds the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities
Whose is this consciousness
At that point the bodhisattvas and the gods each perceived that the Bodhisattva was resting in equilibrium upon their particular lion throne and not on those set forth by the others
By reciting this mantra over whatever flowers one may find and
Why dont you take them in
Similarly owing to their utter purity
The saṅghas alms should not be given to them
and a hundred thousand divine instruments sounded without even being played
The assemblies of gods using jewel pitchers Filled with differently scented waters
I ask that you release all those held in prisons And that you endow the poor with wealth
Then Senior āradvatīputra addressed Senior Subhūti as follows
Blessed One all these many mansions that now fill up and adorn this Sahā world are amazing Blissful One they are truly amazing
great bodhisattva beings would have absolutely attained omniscience
Young man in that way you should never weary of making offerings to serving and being an attendant to all tathāgatas
One night as I was lying in bed I was astonished to see that the lamp was laughing
Physician this is excellent Generous and sublime aide this is excellent
There will be many śrāvakas there
through indiscretion he came to misfortune
Young man why is that

Thus bodhisattvas are free from impure acquisitions
irreversible bodhisattvas may be called reversible
Among the leaves the upper bodies of the buddhas offspring are visible
Indeed the medicinal tree forms no such thoughts whatsoever
What are those ten They are as follows When they themselves are donors they also establish others in the practice of generosity

Son we have got you back alive
The Bodhisattva now touched his right hand to his head
Consider noble son the god Candras possession of great magical power
This completes the ninth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Teaching
Remaining in midair with their bodies invisible
With blazing intelligence this capable man illuminates his own assertions and smashes those of others
Prostrating with their heads to the Blessed Ones feet
āriputra it is through the bodhisattva instructions and the great secret of the bodhisattvas that you have appeared here within my teaching
Then it was the great king Virūḍhaka who arose from his seat
One should take an equal portion of each and make a pill with honey
Mahauṣadhi ask whatever questions you wish and I shall answer them
They are the ones who train all the śrāvakas and solitary buddhas
Venerable Lord By what then will enlightenment be attained
The Blessed Buddha was resident at the Jetavana Anāthapiṇḍadas grove near rāvastī
There are those of superior mediocre and inferior faculties
having heard the inconceivable and measureless benefits of the qualities that come from the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena
They will have health great strength and clear faculties
declared that if any monk takes something of anothersin the community or outside the monasterywhich he has not been given
The four sides are the four means of magnetizing
We will teach the word enlightenment Therefore we will be formidable śrāvakas

in the right manner and so forth
O gods It is so It is so It is just as you have said
and who have continuous confidence of speech based upon this samādhi
He tirelessly teaches the Dharma bringing joy to the four assemblies encouraging them and inspiring them He is able to teach the Dharma He is able to aid those who maintain celibacy
It is afflicted by the four hundred and four diseases
They are like an illusion that deceives the mind
Thus consciousness leaves the sense faculties
Some said that birds would no longer fly in the sky and some that pregnant women would no longer give birth safely
Bhagavān it is so exclaimed those bodhisattvas Sugata it is so
Similarly ordinary people do not apprehend the limit of future time or the present
In this way immature ones engage in lust Combat resistance and also butchery
So why should I veil my face
With wisdom examining all phenomena They send emanations to other realms 
inducing all sentient beings and establishing them in the fourth meditative concentration and the rest
This is the ordinary form of propagation
One must worship her with flowers Lamps incense and so forth
Everything else appeared just as it was before
in the presence of these four assemblies he demonstrated multiple miraculous forms vivid brilliant and distinct which were emanated through his magical abilities
With respect to the unproduced there is no arising
He manifests as being in the state of parinirvāṇa as being born
At that time the mother of the Bodhisattva observed the five basic precepts
see that this earth is scarred with tree stumps thorn bushes ravines precipices sewage and cesspits they should reflect
Desires too are foulsmelling disagreeable and not worthy of being looked upon
Subhūti it is because all those things associated with this vehicle and with those who would attain emancipation and that in which emancipation is attained are nonexistent and they are nonapprehensible
They will convey and teach them to others truly explaining them and elucidating them
So long will the four meditative concentrations and similarly the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptions emerge in the world
What is absence of involvement with either external or internal
Stretched our hands and pointed out Queen Māyā resting in her bed
Thus noble son it is difficult to find Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
the Bhagavān has in this way repeatedly praised the teaching of the Dharma of being wise in skill in methods
At the foot of each perfumetree sits a bodhisattva and the trees emit perfumes like this one

the tathāgata arhat perfectly complete buddha endowed with perfect knowledge and virtue
A noble being shines when speaking And even when silent a noble being shines Just like a nightingale does Whenever seen or heard
The fourfold assembly waited there For the explanation that Mañjusvara would give 
the samādhi named Giving Joy
Having bowed his head at the Blessed Ones feet he sat off to one side
Bodhisattvas should be like the earth without attachment or anger
or Vaiśravaṇa
It seals the world with its gods humans and asuras
no other being is able to digest such a drop of vital energy
No birth is the fixed rule
Similarly they neither associate the truth of the origin of suffering with omniscience nor do they disassociate it therefrom
they gave not a word in response
invite him to throw a flower onto the maṇḍala
What are those ten They are venerability being worthy of offerings making others journey along reliability providing sustenance providing perfect provisions possessing vast accumulations insatiability heading the gathering and skill in reaching the city of omniscience
Such is how this massive heap of pure anguish is brought to an end
Similarly they themselves should become equipoised in the first meditative concentration
Mañjuśrī what does a bodhisattva great being not turn back from
 There is no person who dies in this world Who departs and goes to another world
He came into the presence of the Jina Bowed to his feet and sat before him 
After they traded their goods and made a profit the traders set out for rāvastī with the two boys in tow
Having covered them all rain falls simultaneously and equally everywhere on all of them
beyond voice
and he is free from signs
Bhadrapāla that is how beings come to be born in the realms of hell that is how they are affected by specific kinds of causes
they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom
And with that the two became renunciants in Sañjayins order
seven godly realms seven human realms seven great oceans
Bodhisattvas with insight instead will think Throughout all the worlds
Mahāmaudgalyāyana
In due course passing through the country of Magadha he set off on his way to Kāśi
However in giving their gifts they are tied by three fetters
If alms are adulterated with the five kinds of impure foods one should protect oneself on the eighth fourteenth and fifteenth lunar days
It is inconceivable It is beyond the level of thought
That unique supreme yāna within the three realms

That god then placed the garments on top of his head and returned right then to his celestial realm in order to venerate them
Then she said to the lad Son of a lord please wait a moment while I climb up to the roof of the house
Noble ones if you drink this excellent medicine you will quickly be freed from the poison or venom and will be happy and healthy
There is the meditative stability named Lamp of the Moon or Immaculate Moon
Do not befriend those who take life or those with misguided beliefs
Ultimately they are not oncereturners yet relatively they do return in order to ripen beings
The tongue is outer form
will not easily be exhausted even in a hundred thousand quintillion eons
Similarly those who hold maintain recite aloud master and are attentive to this transcendent perfection of wisdom in the right manner
In the excellent state of little movement he obtained the awakened mind
let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with a hundred thousand bodhisattva followers
that they do not cognize future phenomena as future phenomena
He came into the presence of the Buddha Bowed down to his feet and sat before him 
and who when cultivating the nature of things that is emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
may I cause all beings to extract substance from all that lacks substance
He was an unerring vessel of mindfulness able to recall the teachings of all the buddhas The number of dhāraṇīs he had received was infinite
You have had in the past for many millions of eons The goal of being the ultimate refuge and protector
Moreover āradvatīputra the maturity of a great bodhisattva being also entails absorption in the three gateways to liberation by engaging in the understanding that all things are without duality
Always avoid sinful companions Be in the company of good companions
On the seventh ground bodhisattvas accomplish the qualities of the buddhas and the true mastery of skillful means Thereby they attain the inconceivable body
āradvatīputra it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena and to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities that physical forms are nonexistent
and they will not be captivated by desire hatred delusion or by the mind with its five aspects of concomitance and its afflicted mental states
Moreover those bodhisattvas who have emerged are emerging or will emerge definitively by way of this absorption acquire an unfathomable number of qualities
nausea urinary retention fatigue pyrexia arthritis and bone pain
The abiding mode of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is mundane and its nonabiding mode is supramundane
The monk Vīradatta wordlessly indicated his agreement took his alms and went to the main temple
And so the boy was named Udayana
When the Bhagavān sees strength in our motivation then he declares this
Yet others arrived with uncountable inconceivable quadrillions of apsaras singing and playing musical instruments while they sat in palaces of great jewels gems beaming uninterruptedly from the array of pure oceanground jewels
the arrows would all fall to the ground in succession one after the other
But the king just responded
The body has enlightenments characteristics And a buddha realm has the same
in the same vein as before up to and including omniscience
Kolita too came to see phenomena through the unclouded and pristine eyes of Dharma
Consider noble son the analogy of a lion that is unperturbed by the howling of foxes
In whatever life I might be born may I possess magnificent happiness and joy
There are a variety of wishgranting trees on those kings of mountains
Bhagavān I wish to free all beings from all fear and all suffering
This mother of the guhyakas is celebrated as the essence of illusion
That restraint of the mind through which wise ones In their minds do not forsake enlightenment
I am suffering in thinking of my sons I shall not allow this fire to burn them So that I am without sons and lineage
Venerable Lord When all things are indivisible signless
If one were to ask why it is because the emptiness of the links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death is not aging and death and the aforementioned links Also aging and death do not exist elsewhere apart from the emptiness of aging and death
He even sees his own body with wellproportioned limbs and thinks
From their bodies many Dharma gates are heard
Assemble all the local lords and gather the merchants householders ministers gatekeepers and all the local people
No one can comprehend the departure and arrival of the teacher
forming an incalculably immense assembly of bodhisattvas were also staying there
They will become conceited through their arrogant false words But how can there be enlightenment for someone whose conduct has gone astray 
Monks when the Bodhisattva bathed in the Nairañjanā River and enjoyed a meal his physical strength came back to him
In that time I empower myself And I similarly empower all beings
and all terms are false and deceptive phenomena
The river Gaṅgā bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating both shores
By these words of truth May medicines be transformed into ambrosia
He who counts the air by its unit
owing to the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena
turn toward solitude and depart from home
it is because once the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment all things are unapprehended
I should be regarded as your owner
There were many hundred thousand quintillions of pillars made of precious materials
Then Senior āradvatīputra addressed Senior Subhūti as follows
Noble son a bodhisattvas buddhafield is a field of high resolve
Inside the womens quarters of King uddhodanas excellent residence all the instruments such as the great kettledrums the clay and wooden kettledrums the flutes lutes reed pipes threestringed lutes bells and cymbals suddenly emitted wonderful music by themselves without being played
They should not strive in any way toward the Dharma or dissociate themselves from nonDharma
Similarly it does not enhance feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness nor does it diminish them
It is precisely because they neither know nor see that they come to be styled ordinary people
You aśiketu have been a peaceful king with fine teeth Loving and compassionate with a crown jewel shining like the moon
Then nanda recited these verses The countless jinas are so wonderful
You may be able to fill the world with poison And put ablaze the great trichiliocosm
You could soothe many tens of millions of creatures
The beautiful three folds on our bellies
how do great bodhisattva beings attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment dependent on the transcendent perfection of wisdom
If you ask Subhūti how great bodhisattva beings act as an ally of the worlds in this regard
Why are you collecting them again
 There is the meditative stability named Seal of the King
 When I saw this bhikṣu who had perfect conduct And who had kindness like that of a father
for those severely tormented by the sickness of afflictions like a medicinal elixir
Such fools think they have grasped the only truth
abandoned and let go of my eyes
In fact his hands and feet are prominently webbed unlike those of other human beings
absence of uncertainty suspicion and doubt with regard to the qualities of the buddhas and the persons who embody such qualities
The youth Candraprabha then went down from Vulture Peak Mountain
nanda you should remember this Dharma discourse as The Transfer of Consciousness You should also remember it as The Questions of Bhadrapāla
When it is retained this is called pūraka
let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with many quintillions of bodhisattva followers
Similarly if they engage with the notion that the self exists in feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness or that the self does not exist therein
Should first give rise to the mind of awakening And completely perfect the two accumulations
The earth element does not think I support the seed
If a bodhisattva has these eight qualities when he transmigrates at death away from the Sahā universe he will go safe and sound to a pure buddhafield
Similarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle too is neither darkness nor light
and they may attract by wisdom and the other transcendent perfections those sentient beings who are attracted by ethical discipline who are attracted by tolerance who are attracted by perseverance who are attracted by meditative concentration and who are attracted by wisdom
bowed down to his feet circumambulated the Bhagavān three times and sat to one side
Therefore this Dharma teaching was named Turning the Wheel of Dharma
Blessed One since the blessed buddhas do not smile in the absence of causes and conditions what are the causes for this smile and what are the conditions
things are not apprehended because other realized beings up to and including genuinely perfect buddhas are nonapprehensible
that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana rose into the air
If you ask why Subhūti it is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom precedes all dedications of merit
and says to him Hey you have been freed go wherever you want to
so great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should dwell with respect to all things
What you may wonder does the bodhisattvas skill in making others withdraw from objects consist in
To establish all beings in awakening
The expression all phenomena designates all these
Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings abide in the ineffable transcendent perfection of wisdom and do not apprehend anything that may be arising ceasing afflicted purified or extraneous to that extent
Each one of them acquired and possessed four great continents and was the king of them
At this the Blessed One spoke the verses of dependent arising
Only then should they familiarize themselves with the idea that all phenomena are in essence inexpressible nonarising nonceasing not perceptible and not in the slightest way existing
Blessed One I would like to go to that world called Endurance
Similarly has it not been taught that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will take birth miraculously
Bodhisattvas should be as insatiable as the ocean in their onepointed desire to learn
What are these ten
And yet fill the world like a vessel
there fell a great rain of uragasāra sandalwood
With my hair this long I cannot be a monk So he took his sword cut off his hair and then cast it into the air
It is certainty in the truth It is the direct experience of liberation
Overpowered by the māras with poor understanding They act through being afflicted by the kleśas
not transferred at the later limit and
He blazed with energy in order to inspire people who were lazy
Those who always possess and remember the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets Display
in the same vein Subhūti all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are nonexistent being inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
Come We must live the holy life under the guidance of the Blessed One
they should reflect in the same vein as before
Subhūti in emptiness past physical forms are nonapprehensible
No concept of villages and no concept of towns
Thus the attainment of the tolerance of the birthlessness of things is the entrance into nonduality
This is the medicine for performing enthrallment
The second dedication prayer is
vision knowledge intelligence prudence and insight and a light began to shine
Mañjughoṣa is present his palms together in homage He has been praised and extolled by all the buddhas
Wherever this sūtra So eloquently spoken happens to be Whether it be in villages homes or towns Children will not perish
With this thought in mind the companions left the Bodhisattva and
just as when the lineage of medical cure remains unbroken the physician is pleased and rejoices
circumambulated them three times proclaiming the following verses
If it has fallen on the arrow the student will be capable of performing the acts of enthrallment
I would correctly disregard that reason for contradicting me and so on in the same vein as before
Those who knowing this dispense generosity and so forth
At that point a delightful breeze was felt
He disciplines the bodhisattvas only by means of perfumes
and in that way he will satisfy beings with various kinds of Dharma teachings
his going forth should be allowed and he should be ordained
His speech was uninterrupted captivating and pleasant to hear It was affectionate worthy to be remembered encouraging satisfying and delightful
each goddess beautiful with the same characteristics as just described
Nor does he speak truly
Then he will free them from old age death sickness pain lamentation suffering depression and distress and
Ignorance and craving function as causes by having the nature of afflictions
adorned by cords of gold
Seeing them he knows These beings because of their previous good actions have little anger and great desire while these have little desire and great anger some have little wisdom some are wise and some are ripened and pure and some hold wrong views
and in the same vein they apprehend the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and develop a view of them in an apprehending manner
Indeed he set himself at the frontlines and destroyed the enemy hordes of the afflictions with the firm vajra weapon of supreme wisdom
With worldly goods and not through the Dharma They gave many things to the śrāvakas also 
Elder how many years have you passed
At that point one could hear all sorts of pleasant and cheerful sounds There were sounds that inspired love and made everyone serene There were inviting and refreshing sounds impossible to describe or imitate agreeable sounds that do not produce fear
They give up even their bodies and lives to preserve the sublime teachings
He was skilled in analyzing phenomena
likewise they do not consider whether feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are with signs or signless
On top of a lotus a moon and a sun
The strengths the dhyānas and likewise the liberations And numerous millions of samādhis
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja now came to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and sat before him
all of them are transformed exclusively into yellowness
It teaches the sameness of the three times with regard to phenomena and is a gateway to the actual state of all phenomena
However Māra the evil one felt jealous and magically raised the edge of the pond
Similarly the real nature of the fruit of entering the stream and the real nature of the Tathāgata
So it is Subhūti that this transcendent perfection of wisdom gives rise to the tathāgatas and instructs the worlds of sentient beings
Lord in all the towns villages cities kingdoms and palaces wherever this formulation of the Dharma will be practiced upheld and correctly taught
They are the inconceivably numerous families of wisdom concerning the composite
but afterward gave them all such great carts magnificent carts
The mediocre are to do likewise
and his bodhisattva saṅgha will consist of six hundred million ordained bodhisattvas
Noble son the windlike bodhisattvas similarly blow on the lofty mountains of the merit and wisdom of those sentient beings that have gathered the accumulations throughout many eons thus revealing their powers miracles and great emanations
This is why you cultivated discipline ethical conduct love compassion and the power of forbearance
The perfection of concentration is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Vimukticandra
their heads flaming with the hair streaming upward
With the soles of his feet making patterns on the ground The invited Bhagavān entered into the city 
However Bhagavān those newly following in the Bodhisattvayāna will have doubts
O garuḍa Swan Hey hey Move move Svāhā
In this way they avoid any form of observation of the body and any application of mindfulness to the body and they do not direct their minds to the body
Noble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities have received abundant teaching
The days and the nights Pass fruitfully for them
Monks this was the circumstance and the reason why the Bodhisattva projected light from his body in the quiet of the night
The gods in the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges
It is teaching to others through the five higher cognitions the Dharma teachings of the Buddha that are difficult to understand
At this supreme seat you have conquered with love the wicked army of demons Hero today you shall attain awakening
thinking With higher knowledge I should actualize the cessation of suffering that truth of noble beings vision arose
Similarly the nonarising nonaffliction and nonpurification of the applications of mindfulness are without foundation
they think I have circled in saṃsāra for a hundred years an eon a hundred eons a thousand eons
He will constantly be giving the teaching Of this way to buddhahood to humans and devas
and the devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras rishis garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas kumbhāṇḍas pretas pūtanas humans and nonhumans who have great power
Then akra lord of the gods bowed down with palms joined in the direction of the ThusGone One and
Padma and Mahāpadma
and possessed an altruistic mindset of compassion and benevolence
to make others hear a great Dharma teaching and has therefore created such an omen
Mañjuśrī how does the Thusgone One teach the ultimate truth
However the precious gemstone that exists among the human beings of Jambudvīpa has few attributes
Divine son the ultimate truth transcends everything up through the domain of omniscient wisdom that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects
They resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that negative and nonvirtuous attributes which have previously arisen might be renounced
the element of consciousness produces a body
Such is the bodhisattvas excellent behavior
and they will listen to the sacred teachings from them
At all times they teach the sacred doctrinethat is to say the six transcendent perfectionsto sentient beings
They also believe that yogurt butter mustard seeds barley magic strings dūrvā grass jewels gold silver and other such items are auspicious
Of all those who see this multitude of buddha emanations That many beings will be brought to supreme enlightenment 
Based on such excellent absorption they crush and scatter all bodies comprised of existence aggregates elements and sense sources
The physical activity of the Blissful One knows no bounds or borders
and what action has caused that rebirth
The arhat elder replied Venerable now is not the time to answer your question
At this Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara bowed his head to the Bhagavats feet and departed
However in the entire great trichiliocosm the Bodhisattva did not see anyone like himself
The buddhas expound skillfulness in methods And they teach different kinds of yānas They also elucidate the single yāna
If you promise to be my slave I will enable you to hear it
It is for that purpose that I was born into this world And I shall teach here the highest enlightenment 
The one who paints the picture Should have reddish eyes As well as red hands and feet Eyes like those of a bird and the legs of a black antelope It is such a person who shall draw the Savioress
I longed for the supreme peace of this samādhi And made many offerings to the guides
They do not see them as bubbles of water
The royal palace of King Subāhu who commands an army of brave warriors is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived
Those who are intent on pratyekabuddhahood And the bhikṣus and likewise bhikṣunīs
The elder monks said
Well then is enlightenment attained by means of a path that is neither cultivated nor not cultivated
 they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed and unimpeded with respect to the past
But the bodhisattva should neither destroy the compounded nor rest in the uncompounded
Arisen from the gnosis of the syllable hū
Because of the way they afflict and since they afflict beings in the three realms in this way they are called afflictions
They do not make assumptions about the sense field of sights and they do not make assumptions about the other sense fields starting from there and continuing up to the sense field of mental phenomena
Fortyeight fingerwidths can be divided In this way at eight fingerwidths is located the secret chakra The other chakras located within forty fingerwidths
I hail from the Middle Country and I seek to serve at the feet of a master
likewise they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with formative predispositions consciousness name and form the six sense fields sensory contact sensation craving grasping rebirth process actual birth and aging and death
Young man it is in that way that an offering is made to the tathāgatas
āradvatīputra it is far removed from the psychophysical aggregates the sensory elements and the sense fields
Their minds were perfectly free their insight perfectly liberated
Bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind obtain the samādhi that is like a vajra
This is the kind of dream that I have had
Such is the bodhisattvas commitment to the vows of bodhisattva training
craving contributes to grasping grasping contributes to becoming
and akra mighty king of the gods then exclusively requested this specific chapter of the transcendent perfection of wisdom
and stuff it into the heart of a beeswax effigy
The earth is his seat
And there is never pride when there are praises This is nature of the teaching that benefits the world 
What are those ten They are gentle speech a radiant smile without angry frowning speaking meaningfully speaking the Dharma teaching equally not showing off being flawless being unafflicted being free of hostility and possessing a diverse eloquence
great serpents
Tell us Mañjusvara the meaning of this sign And eliminate the doubts of the bodhisattvas 
What is their verbal purity
There are no more noble son
It is the sameness of everything from self to liberation
Those who wish to enter the great ocean or caves or to make use of the sacred essence
Similarly they perfect the emptiness of internal phenomena
Grasses medicinal herbs and flowers grew in a timely manner
Monks in this way the Bodhisattva displayed true wonders to the worldly ones
The color of the uraga sandalwood was like the finest blue beryl
On the relative level conceptuality is a gateway to disturbing emotions
Hence even his reincarnation is like a liberation
The eye faculty when it sees attractive people moves toward them
It has not been revealed so that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness might be grasped or not grasped
as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
The fixed rule is the definitive meaning
It is born of the concentrations the liberations the meditations and the absorptions
Blessed One please teach us that powerful dhāraṇī pleaded the bodhisattvsas
The bodhisattvas light of wisdom similarly pervades everywhere within a hundred leagues or a thousand leagues or one hundred thousand leagues
their limbs are fleshy
for it leads to the sublime marks and signs to the complete purity of the buddha realms and to the thorough ripening of those sentient beings that are greedy
Divine son such is the spiritual community of hearers belonging to the Blessed thusgone worthy perfect Buddha Ratnaketu
From that great bliss itself
While living alone in solitude diligent and persevering devoted to his resolve
to believe in a self a sentient being a lifeforce or a person
You place in the deathless state those who indulge in the wrong path
When they have attained this stainless samādhi of peace They will have no kleśas and be undefiled

If not prevented from doing so I will wash them lay them out cut them
You may wonder noble son what these qualities may imply from the bodhisattvas being undaunted through to their protecting the crops of virtue
Whoever wishes to attain enlightenment Should give the teaching of this sūtra 
O Venerable Lord It is wonderful that great bodhisattva beings have practiced the emptiness of inherent existence with respect to all things and
has crossed the four rivers is wellgrounded in his use of the four foundations of miraculous conduct
According to their dispositions they understand the three vehicles
and even for a single day offers gifts of the sacred doctrine and worldly gifts
When from the expansive cloud of Dharma the rain of teachings falls
Seeing him there the minister was surprised
To this day the gods in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree hold an annual Festival of the Bowl
They will teach countless thousands of sūtras Without the slightest interval 
or go for refuge in the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha or purely observe discipline
It is difficult to attain faith in the teachings And to become a mendicant 
They will be fraudulent with weights and measures Always engaging in actions that the buddhas have rejected
Countless other majestic gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas humans and nonhumans were also present
It is appropriate patience It is the level of patience
They give the gift of the Dharma without thought of reward They do not search for fame or gain
tongueconsciousness
In the same way bodhisattva great beings should have conviction that merit has a connection to everything
But after incanting the same poison with a mantra Ones happiness and lifespan will increase
Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña
The sounds of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness that emerge
She returned during the final watch and said Noble Saṅgharakṣita why do you sleep
Blessed One this teaching of yours is exceedingly pithy
And it appears as though youre on the verge of dying
The house is terrifying in that way
Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings have turned away from the level of ordinary people
In whom knowledge has developed and ignorance is destroyed Practices the peace of this samādhi 
all of these will make assumptions on that basis
Likewise wishing to take the path followed by the buddhas in the company of numerous sentient beings great bodhisattva leaders
And they will be stupid and dull rolling back and forth
One who is endowed with merit and wisdom
What signs do they have
She harbors no attachment or hatred
Do any of these physical conditions or others like them afflict your body
Through the blessings of the Tathāgata you have made a splendid request
those who write it down hold it and read it aloud with gifts of perfumes flower garlands

So also can the methods described in other tantras and practice manuals be employed here
Whoever can engender this bliss Through regular practice
The great city of Vaiśālī did not become obscured neither did the land of Jambudvīpa nor the world of four continents
that they do not waver
They will be attentive to that talk conceptualize it and having done so they will even dedicate this toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
without characteristics not made into two
People for whom there is suffering in store could never dream like that
How can they become skilled in all the various ways of dedicating merit and thus gain skill in methods
When the Jina shone light through the buddha realm Meru
It involves pain
On the relative level distraction is a gateway to thought
Surrounded and revered by this retinue of many hundreds of thousands the Blessed One taught the Dharma
But those who know and realize that dhyāna Is without kleśas or pride reject such arrogance 
And how should they strive in learning
Even those who entertain wrong views find wrong views unpleasant they do not wish for them do not like them and do not enjoy them
Knowing oneself is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Those who continually gather and offer flowers and incense to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara

You may wonder noble son how bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to the wilderness
Then he said Upatiṣya join me in a pledge
multistoried buildings that were covered with gold
Similarly they have not trained in the applications of mindfulness
What is suffering It is the pain that accompanies birth growing old falling sick and dying It also includes the suffering of meeting the unpleasant and parting from the pleasant Not finding what is being sought is also suffering In short the five perpetuating aggregates are suffering
If you ask why O child of enlightened heritage it is because omniscience and so forth are without desire and are not an object of desire
Sentient beings are stingy greedy covetous and avaricious
This āradvatīputra is the natural luminosity of the mind with which great bodhisattva beings are endowed
They will also establish them in the fruitional attributes from the ten powers of the tathāgatas up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
What must be absent to avoid everything down to formations to manifest

Similarly noble son continued the Blessed One
The teacher of the teaching had passed away And this was the time of the latter years
Some sleep on a stool or in the water while others sleep in ashes on rocks gravel planks thorns grass or sticks
He has thoroughly integrated his realization with skill in liberative art
He also posted guards
and Subhūti in the same vein the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities constitute the sameness of great bodhisattva beings
Just as when he was alive his passing into nirvāṇa will also accomplish sentient beings roots of virtue to their full extent
These words that are emanated Also reach millions of realms

The devas dānavas gandharvas yakṣas āsuras and humans
Thus bodhisattvas absorb the great rain of Dharma

All of them were fully clairvoyant and well settled in the essential nature of all dharmas
Monks replied the Blessed One
Moreover nanda if those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage smell the perfusive scent of nonhuman beings

Are the three gateways to liberation also nonconceptual

What you may wonder are the bodhisattvas eighteen unique qualities
Those words will now never come to pass
They will not inspire regret in those who follow the Bodhisattvayāna by saying
Anantaghoṣa Suvimuktaghoṣa Mārabala and Māravitrāsana

āradvatīputra bodhisattvas do perceive all such phenomena distinctly but that pertains to the relative truth not the ultimate truth
or an invalid who has been delivered from all his ills

Being reincarnated as if being liberated he has the power and ability to teach the Dharma that liberates living beings from their bondage

they demonstrate the sacred doctrine accordingly to sentient beings
accrue deeds that are destitute of the sacred doctrine
What does it portend he asked
depositing the atoms in that manner in that way into world realms in an eastern direction
One should drink one karṣa of powdered bawchan seed with buttermilk water sour gruel or milk

It should be chanted once each day
 The one who completely abandons the concept of self And the doctrine of an individual that these beings follow

Thereupon the Bhagavān to explain what this meant related an account of the past by chanting the following extensive verses to the youth Candraprabha
To all of them I go for refuge
some were made of crystal
in the same vein when they have not turned away from all the causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
The bodhisattvas will have these qualities By remaining in samādhi just as they have been taught 
Having incanted water one should strike blood will flow
Elephantmāgadhikā with sweet flag Horsesmell and fresh buffalo butter
He is endowed with the thirtytwo marks of a great being He is called the supreme being
nor is it heard remembered or cognized
He became joyful and happy
He revered the best of sages And is therefore honored now himself
Every one of all those bodhisattva mahāsattvas was a dharmabhāṇaka
Similarly the purity of phenomena is profound due to the absolute purity of the applications of mindfulness due to the absolute purity of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and due to the absolute purity of the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
With understanding one pursues the Dharma in the correct way
the vetālas Rāmadeva Kāmadeva and so forth made of human bone
That is the same as the inconceivable knowledge Of all the buddhas concerning states of existence 
Venerable Lord this transcendent perfection is ethical discipline
nanda
So I will teach to the śrāvakas this great extensive sūtra the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma which is an instruction for bodhisattvas and is possessed by all the buddhas
Why does it terrify the māras Because it accomplishes all the strengths and because it brings all the kleśas to an end
Once they are purified and illumined One should perceive that great numbers of buddhas Melt into light and enter the seedsyllable
Even though our forces are powerful our task would be a difficult one
The beings who are guided hear the teaching of the Dharma from the tathāgatas in accord with their individual natures and their individual aspirations
For a hundred and eighty thousand million years I made excellent offerings to that buddha 
Noble son great caravan leaders can never gather enough wealth
When the Bhagavān had thus spoken the Youthful Mañjuśrī the venerable nanda
She satisfied me with food that had perfect divine flavors
that some achieve complete awakening that some achieve complete awakening and turn the wheel of Dharma
Noble one stay a little while until you see an omen
May you worship revere and venerate it more and more
Next measuring the length of a shadow

There are no forms whatsoever
bodhisattvas make the following aspiration
The one who crushes all the māras
Some who were upon the roofs Developed the sublime
I am speaking correctly I am not speaking otherwise
Young man because those bodhisattva mahāsattva possess the accumulation of merit that comes from being skillful in methods they will quickly attain this samādhi and
observe discipline
All songs nonsense
Save them from the sea of existence
Then the Bhagavān said to Brother Mahākāśyapa and the other great sthaviras
 It is unique knowledge the knowledge of births It is infinite knowledge completely perfect knowledge
is the noncultivation of the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousness
even a particle the size of a fraction of the tip of a hair
They saw the Victorious One who was like the sun in a cloudless sky And whose face was like an autumn moon
As for those sentient beings who have entered the Great Vehicle they will become irreversible That too is why bodhisattvas and not hearers receive a prophecy
If you ask what is the emptiness of conditioned phenomena
Noble lady although you have an irreversible aspiration for enlightenment and immeasurable wisdom it will be difficult for you to attain enlightenment
You should know that henceforth by putting an end to the accumulation of nonvirtuous actions
 Existing not existing and both are extremes Pure and impure are also extremes
I will definitely practice generosity by offering food
What are those two functions
She should have little attachment anger and ignorance
Blessed One when the ThusGone One has passed into nirvāṇa I will take hold of this sūtra which has been taught by the ThusGone One and grasp it read it understand it and teach it extensively to others
They practice in order to know how the afflictions come about within them due to mistaken imputation how they come about due to error and how they remain once they have manifested
They do not consider whether the eyes are calm or not calm
And also for treating barrenness
This tīrthika tīrthikas name wishes to renounce this identity and go forth
it is the case that they correctly perceive formative predispositions to resemble a plantain tree in which the actual core is nonapprehensible when the outer layers are peeled away
the fruits manifest as the results of three types in the three realms
They saw many millions of buddhas Those who numbered no fewer than five hundred
the bliss of the unsurpassed wisdom that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects becomes in a manner that is beyond reference points the sustenance of all beings
They turn them away from the fourth meditative concentration and establish them in the formless absorption of the sense field of infinite space

We are born with perfect bodies for the sake of pleasure
Though he lived purely his entire life he never attained any of the store of qualities
They do not maintain discipline out of fear of being a poor human being
they cannot be separated they cannot be differentiated and they cannot be severed
Their embrace of saṃsāra is boundless
What is the nondissipation of the results of karma It is knowing that the results of karma do not dissipate like a dream
commanded them Princes you must slay this bhikṣu
The blind who without a guide have fallen into ravines Cannot be led out by anyone else here
bowed down to the Bhagavāns feet
What is the knowledge of the skandhas It is perceiving the skandhas to be like mirages
These six thousand bhikṣunīs both bhikṣunīs in training and those who have passed beyond training will be bodhisattva dharmabhāṇakas with you under those tathāgatas
When witnessing others who suffer greatly
They are constantly hearing the Dharma
And not falling from the level of increasing wisdom Are distinctive qualities of the first patience 
When born in the family of Buddha They become turners of the wheel
What family is known to be pure And fitting for the Bodhisattva to take birth in
The kings the rulers however many there were Came from the cardinal and intermediate directions
owing to the fact that all those other attributes up to and including buddhahood are nonexistent
These are called the four assurances of the tathāgatas
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not let the mindsets of all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas even arise
The gods demigods yakṣas gandharvas and nāgas Who supported him Made offerings to him day and night Because of seeing his qualities
It dispels all obscurity and darkness
Ah This world is prone to suffering
Venerable Lord If physical forms are not one thing and the expanse of reality another and
He became exhilarated and quickly went to the park
it is because the natural expression of those transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom though without entity is still the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the rest
Young man those are the ten benefits for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who live by receiving alms in the austerity of the disciplines of mendicancy
May you open the gates to liberation May you explain the inalienable way of Dharma
We prostrate to you unrivaled perfect man
Noble son this is how the accumulation of merit increases as the result of a single repetition of the sixsyllable mahāvidyā
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings should train accordingly in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and they should maintain their skill in means
It is the subjugation of adversaries through the Dharma
Noble son having served the buddhas of this excellent eon the good Amartyā will attain perfect buddhahood within this very buddha realm
Nor is it the domain of the solitary buddhas
approached the Bodhisattva Singing songs and playing musical instruments of all types they made offerings to the Bodhisattva
Things are not apprehended because the expanse of reality is nonapprehensible
Alas my man with thighs like the trunk of an elephant With fair hands and feet and with coppercolored nails
Mati behind and
do not generate desire for the transcendent perfection of generosity
Therefore Lord I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness
No striving or giving up
Similarly do not generate desire for the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship and individual enlightenment
Similarly how could this illusory person
Then with flowers and so forth Make pure offerings in the sky Offering them with joy
Similarly the ten powers of the tathāgatas are empty of the ten powers of the tathāgatas
the inconceivably numerous designations concerning the kleśas
I will even refine the buddhafields I will also bring sentient beings to maturity and so on in the same vein as before down to they will also approach omniscience
Similarly they teach the doctrine that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are impermanent
it is because owing to the emptiness of essential nature
Even after departing thence they will once again be incinerated by an inferno
A noble son or daughter may establish all beings in the trichiliocosm within the fruitions of a streamenterer oncereturner nonreturner and worthy one
When practicing generosity by offering the marrow of their bones
Bhagavat be my protector refuge and support
 They cannot be harmed by weapons or by fire And in that way their bodies are ungraspable
āradvatīputra do you think that anything other than the real nature of physical forms constitutes a bodhisattva
Indeed I say that liberation from suffering would also be nonexistent
Listen young man to these my words A bhikṣu should always dwell in solitude
This is because beings lack skill in the true meaning and experience things dualistically
they do not apprehend gifts they do not apprehend their transcendent perfection of generosity nor do they apprehend recipients
to others this king of samādhis the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena
They abide in the abode of all afflictions
do not imagine consciousness to have been accumulated or heaped up
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings of whom the level of irreversible pristine cognition has been foreordained are few in number
Everything appeared to be limitless boundless and ineffable like space
Why is that Because when sentient beings approach the thusgone ones through joy faith and appreciation they gain the capacity to receive the teaching of the Dharma
Young man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of reasoning What are the four kinds of reasoning
and someone to be our protector when we are dead
I would correctly disregard that reason for contradicting me and so on in the same vein as before
attains the fruit of entering the stream the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
The householder thought If I were to go forth they would also put me to work
Samantabhadra then said
Seventytwo thousand external channels Are located in the flesh and give rise to fat
Seeing the miraculous power of the BlissGone One with his ocean of qualities
Subhūti the supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle is also neither long nor short nor square nor round
Bhikṣus the Mahābrahmā named Sudharma spoke these verses to the great assembly of Brahmās
As she did so she offered the prayer May the Bodhisattva take my food and thereby truly attain perfect and completely unexcelled awakening
syād yathedam brahme brahma ghoṣe brahmasvare vajre vajraghoṣe vajradhare sthite sāre acale araṇe iṣaṇe arāṇete śūre varāgra prāpte sāgaravate May I have wellbeing in all directions Svāha
By such truth and true words as follows true words at the irreversible level are called the words that are supreme in the world
and the things that I was inspired to say commencing therefrom are also nonarising
Son of noble family after the ThusGone One Amitābha has passed into nirvāṇa there will come a night when the sacred Dharma disappears As soon as that happens at the break of dawn on the very next day
Venerable Lord if the notion of fundamental ignorance as a self is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of fundamental ignorance as a nonself become a bodhisattva
Nothing lasts longer than a flash of lightning in the sky
eightyfour thousand beings within that assembly developed the aspiration to attain the unequaled highest complete enlightenment
At that point all the bodhisattvas addressed the blessed thusgone Padmanetra
How is wisdom integrated with liberative art a liberation
have turned away from the level of the pratyekabuddhas they are revealed to be irreversible
This is what has been taught By the ākya lion the protector
They will never forget any Dharma that they have been taught
Radiating light rays throughout the ten directions
O Passion Vajrī hū phaṭ
I will turn the wheel of Brahmā
 Ah God of gods you who are worthy of offerings Dharmabhāṇaka why do you continue to remain silent
Missing hands hunchbacks dwarves Those with goiters the mute the deaf Those with mobility aids with elephantiasis
They lose their flesh and again have flesh See the inconceivable result of actions 
He did not consider it to be anything other than feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness
So how about those who actually listen to the Dharma And develop faith and joy
The light from all luminous beings From devas humans kings and asuras
This concludes the glorious Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma the great extensive sūtra the instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all the buddhas
They should learn the ripening of demons yet
A domain where one realizes that all the buddhafields are indestructible and uncreatable having the nature of infinite space yet where one manifests the establishment of the qualities of the buddhafields in all their variety and magnitude such is the domain of the bodhisattva
At this spectacle everyone present exclaimed Blessed One we now see the extent to which these two bodhisattva great beings are cared for by those blessed buddhas
Having a good conscience is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
Similarly bodhisattvas are the ground from which the seeds of all the virtuous qualities of all beings sprout
It is soothing auspicious and does not burn
Bhikṣus it is like this
He came to the arranged seat and sat upon it
and in the same vein as before all other fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are revealed therein
It is nondeviation nonfluctuation and nondistraction from sameness
Those who will possess this sūtra Because of their compassion for beings
And scatters upon it the petals of Royal jasmine blue lotuses and magnolias
To bring all beings to maturation they take birth in the desire realm
In the same way even though these beginner bodhisattvas wish to cross the great ocean of the Mahāyāna
and have no ignorance regarding any phenomenon that causes ignorance
It does not think or ponder
They should not make assumptions on account of the transcendent perfection of generosity Similarly they should not make assumptions on account of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom
neither concentration nor distraction
You are young and in the prime of life You have a beautiful complexion and you are strong
With your mind free of a point of reference
The four legs of her bed break off and she ends up lying on the ground
It provides control over the abandonment of conceptuality And the dawn of nonconceptuality
Similarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the nonactualization of the understanding of all phenomena and the nonactualization of the understanding of the aspects of the path and of omniscience
Without any conceited superiority over others it does not make proclamations regarding itself
Vāsuki Takṣaka Manasvin
In the four directions should be placed four girls who have performed their ablutions They should be well adorned and hold weapons in their hands Each of them should also have a bell and a jewel vessel
The same refrain may also be applied in the case of each of the aforementioned terms from physical forms to omniscience
and he will have the same display of the qualities of his buddha realm as Sāgaravaradharabuddhivikrīḍitābhijña
Yet the group that is undetermined will understand the Dharma if I teach it
Mañjuśrī it is only in relative terms that a mind is said to be liberated
kaṭapūtanas and pāṃśukūla piśācas too
without production and without nonproduction
and how do they not enter into the maturity of a bodhisattva
The stopping of a fire or a sword
What you may wonder does the bodhisattvas perfect giving of reverence and worship consist in
Noble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara thus has an incalculable accumulation of merit
The sequence for the peaceful activity is as follows
recite this mantra  times
wishes to benefit them and has no anger or partiality
The nāga kings too followed suit
He appeared sitting on his seat Without having prostrated to the Buddha
Bhikṣus who among you in this Sahā world realm
Moreover young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of speech desist from killing
They are the inconceivably numerous kinds of great learning concerning the composite
Similarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely pure because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are unsullied
And do not develop a mind of malice or a mind of avarice That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind 
Because their mindstreams are onepointed they do not think or examine
Venerable Lord How is this purity of phenomena not subject to rebirth in the world system of form
Those are the samādhis he attained
These words came from the precious stūpa
If he asks What work can I do
attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood
This stainless tantra the precious essence Is the root of all tantras It contains the sacred bestowal of empowerment
He lived with the deportment of a buddha
He would have only uttered a small amount Like a drop of water from an ocean 
You perceive sensory elements when there are no sensory elements
then how about if they actually meet their friend
With tears I had to bring him the king of all horses
until beings gradually attain unsurpassable truly perfect enlightenmentteinote xmlidUT Thus
teaching all sentient beings joyfully
It is because we are true sons of the Tathāgata but we have also had inferior aspiration
For a thousand million eons he will hold The stainless Dharma they have taught
Resonating with the words impermanence subject to suffering empty and selfless
You should not have conviction in the fruit of entering the stream
May I show them the Dharma of tranquility which brings fulfillment through knowledge
saying Come Child of enlightened heritage you should retain hold master recite and be attentive to it in the correct manner
They who desiring liberation possess this stainless samādhi See the countless guides of the past
dried up the ocean of blood and tears freed me from mountains of bones
Its the truth its the truth
Their senses are completely purified
Knowing this they spoke in verse He who teaches a wrong and ruinous path Is known to be an inferior teacher
They will hear without exception All that is said between the devas In the realm of Brahmā In Akaniṣṭha and bhāsvara
I am freed from the notion of a self
O gods it is because all those things which one might emulate from which emulation might arise and into which emulation might subside are nonexistent and nonapprehensible
Divine son ultimately reality is unborn
We shall also abstain from Delighting in the ways of solitary buddhas
The strength of ten gods from the Heaven Entirely Free of Strife is the same as the strength of one god from the Joyous Heaven
Like sap dripping From a cut tree branch
such as rotten smells pleasant smells and unpleasant smells
Noble son do not create a cause for remorse
He is invisible to people When merged with the prāṇamind
After rubbing into the hair the milky sap of common milk hedge and sesame oil the hair will become white
Since sentient beings are nonapprehensible the psychophysical aggregates sensory elements and sense fields are nonapprehensible
why at this time are there said to be the designations of śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas
I would be scorned by noble beings and derided by those who observe pure conduct
rishis garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas humans and nonhumans
for we are old
From Delusion Vajrī
And I say to them that I am like this or that Because somehow I must bring them to enlightenment And somehow they must obtain the Buddhas Dharma
Young man the last of all those tathāgatas was the Tathāgata the arhat
The crowd told him It was Devadatta Sundarananda said That was not right of Devadatta
a rain of flowers fell from the sky
in the same vein why do you say that nor does the real nature of all those other phenomena up to and including the link of aging and death constitute a bodhisattva
Enlightenment is free of the functioning of all intentional thoughts
He will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are imbued with happiness or that they are imbued with suffering
Venerable Lord it is wonderful how much this transcendent perfection of wisdom benefits great bodhisattva beings without relinquishing omniscience
We will make beings who are without roots of merit create roots of merit
For six years he practiced the supreme concentration The allpervasive concentration
Stabbing with tridents They injure creatures
What are you staring at for seven days
Moreover āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
For seven days an unseasonable rain fell spoiling the food and drink leaving it unsuitable for consumption
Padmaśrīgarbha you should not have any doubts or uncertainties as to whether the person who at that time at that point was named King Glorious Splendor was somebody else
whenever they do not engage with the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are calm or that they are not calm
In emptiness future and present feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonapprehensible
Brahmin you definitely speak the truth
Venerable Lord If all phenomena are the expanse of reality then
The daughters now put on sixtyfour displays of amorous behavior
The land there is perfectly even like the palm of a hand and there are no grasses trees rocks walls or mountains
whereas for others the wisdom of the ten grounds arose
and the same goes for feelings perceptions and formative predispositions because they too are nonapprehensible
Therefore Bhagavān although we express all the emptiness absence of attributes and absence of aspiration in the Dharma that the Bhagavān is teaching
And makes offerings to the text With perfumes garlands and ointments
read it aloud
Its blossoming petals illuminated by moonlight free from the torment of pride and arrogance were pristine Emitting the scent of discipline
Why is that nanda it is because friends please and delight each other
I shall cause splendorous bodhisattva great beings to assemble
The arhat ward wondered If my preceptor was ethical learned
āriputra that means that whether a monk dwells in the forest at the base of a tree in an abandoned building or out in the open he should train himself by thinking The sense pleasures are foulsmelling
Their garland is virtuous aspiration And their clothing is good conscience and consideration
displaying the form of Brahmā to sentient beings who are to be trained by the form of Brahmā
garments parasols standards
I experienced every kind of suffering
Noble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities are welcomed by akra Brahmā and the guardians of the world
He will empty the three lower realms totally And fill the city of gods and humans
Neither getting up nor lying down He did nothing to protect his body
Venerable Lord In what should great bodhisattva beings who seek emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment abide
The kings brother encircled by his entire army Came to the forest where the two bhikṣus dwelt 
and distinct from them they acquire a golden hue beautiful to behold with a fine and splendid physique and the finest of complexions I will even refine the buddhafields I will also bring sentient beings to maturity
Beyond that is the number called dhvajāgraniśāmaṇī
The nature of all things is liberation
When they teach the Dharma There is no apprehending of an object
There are no second or third yānas
The threatening executioners represent the formations
do you think that they would generate many merits on this basis
Subhūti those persons who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas and who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom without hesitation will enter into the irreversible level
Is the bodhisattvas use of words
in the same way feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are without foundation
You are constantly without any attachment Speak the words that are the result of good actions 
the orb of the moon nonetheless appears there
It is indefinable
Noble son this is how bodhisattva great beings abandon sexual misconduct
whether it is a park a temple a palace the foot of a tree a house or a cave
My beloved sons these twenty children of mine
They are fixated on opinions
Venerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of tolerance acquire the transcendent perfection of wisdom
Noble son bodhisattvas who possess ten qualities have an eloquence that brings everyone joy
O Black Acala hū phaṭ
It is a wonderful and marvelous attribute of great bodhisattva beings that great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom can determine how all things are
Although I am a buddha I am denigrated as cohabiting with socalled beautiful women and the like
In this way one should meditate on The White Acala and so forth with firm application
Homage to the Omniscient One
Vemacitrin Rāhula And Prahlāda have also assembled
The Secret Guardian of Bliss is the fruitional tantra
I reveal the vision of the tathāgatas wisdom
The chariots shafts were bound with silk and tied with cotton ribbons
Those princes constantly maintained celibacy and planted roots of merit with many hundreds of thousands of buddhas
As for death along with birth The secret of their nonorigination destroys the lord of death
and know things with the consciousness of an illusory creature
It is the same as a rainbow
Mañjuśrī just as the balacakravartin king unties the crest jewel he had kept for a long time and gives it to the supreme warriors
So now be at ease and be happy
That is nonconceptual and effortless 
That is what I ask of you
Like the goddess of wealth who is the giver of riches You will bestow your Dharma throughout the whole world
and then another hundred thousand eons he attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood
Noble ones your father King ubhavyūha has faith in the brahmins therefore you will not be given permission to see the Tathāgata
In the northern direction
They will utter praises of samādhi But will have no interest in samādhi 
Similarly the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of being no longer subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment are nonapprehensible owing to their utter purity
Subhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom does not teach anything at all nor does it not teach anything It does not grasp anything at all nor does it offer anything nor does it give rise to anything nor does it cause anything to cease nor does it bring about the affliction or the purification of anything nor does it diminish or enhance anything
The rebirth process is pure owing to the purity of grasping
However when these beings are liberated from the hell realms
So I shall go forth and take my meals here while taking my Dharma among my tīrthika brethren
He never chased away mosquitoes bees and poisonous snakes
but the Tathāgata makes it appear to be spoiled by many faults

Son of noble family if a kṣatriya on whom royal authority has been bestowed commits any of these five root transgressions this kṣatriya will forfeit all previously generated roots of virtue

There were no devas asuras or humans
Monks the Bodhisattva first gave his silken robes to a god in the form of a hunter and then he donned the hunters saffroncolored robes
the handling of ashes
What is being undisturbed by disrespect It is being aware of worldly qualities
For many thousands of eons you have trained well and rested in the suchness of emptiness
They do not offer them garlands perfume unguents butter lamps incense powders clothing parasols victory banners and ribbons
A lover must not abandon lust Lest he would be living a lie
For sixtytwo quintillion eons In the past my eyes were destroyed
and the treasure of accomplishment by developing receptiveness to the truth of nonorigination
He is making a threatening gesture with his index finger
Vajrapāṇi continued the Blessed One
After exhausting your previous stores of merit
Noble one the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara for eightyfour thousand years made an offering with a hundred thousand musical instruments to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Meghadundubhisvararāja and gave him eightyfour thousand bowls made of the seven precious materials
Being rid of the threat of execution represents the bodhisattva great beings being free from the three realms while in fact
In his left hand he is holding a blue lotus
Noble son such is the bodhisattvas expertise concerning the absence of self
Likewise venerable āriputra when this door of the inconceivable liberation is taught all the disciples and solitary sages are sightless like the man blind from birth
Let us frolic dear while the trees are in bloom
Everyone had made his preparations and at dawn on the third day we all left the city coming out through its gate
Here one should meditate having overcome This perpetually shifting mind itself As well as its attendant objects of meditation The forms and so forth that it latches onto

In the very dreadful later era We will teach this supreme sūtra
For shame The teacher of these people cannot even cure his own sicknesses How then can he cure the sicknesses of others
And they create a lovely beautiful Variety of stūpas for my relics Which are made from precious materials
The buddhas do not supremely realize any dharma
Reveling in warm flesh and blood
They are the obsession with perceiving things as phenomena
I have seen the one who is to inherit my money gold property grain treasures and storehouses
If however one is going to be a woman
and similarly who practice in order that they might grasp or reject the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness
They sleep on beds of grass sticks and ashes They sleep on thorns or sit upright
From this day on you will be like my own son born from me
They all taught this excellent samādhi And then those supreme humans passed into nirvāṇa 
The generosity practiced by offering food with such thoughts will provide longevity and happiness
Full of respect and devotion they joined their palms and bowed before him Standing expectantly in his presence they asked with concern
one will be free of fetters and fetters will not occur
to accept the absence of a soul
Thus Nārāyaṇa caught me in the noose of truth
O gods This is the real nature of all things through which great bodhisattva beings after attaining manifestly perfect buddhahood with regard to the real nature acquire the title tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
the knowledge that contaminants will not be regenerated
the allinclusive assembly of bodhisattvas and the great śrāvakas
mastering all those roots of virtue
They were skilled in their emancipation from cyclic existence as they had demonstrated for many tens of millions of eons
came from the east and the realms shook a rain of lotuses fell
With an outlook of equality on the superior and inferior On those with good conduct and those without good conduct
so it is that they correctly perceive the real nature of feelings
The Bhagavān has given us two tasks to perform

How conclusive is my nirvāṇa Or the practice I have been taught 
Then Senior āradvatīputra asked the Blessed One as follows

It delights scholars It is praised by sages It is adorned by priests It is praised by the gods It is cleansed by those who perform ritual ablutions It is delighted in by the world of the four castes
Sit here Bhagavān Tathāgata ākyamuni
It is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who seek to abide in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should maintain these doctrines and do so without apprehending anything
āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that physical forms are impermanent
Here the ignorance that drives the thirst for existence And induces inappropriate actions
The great yogī who masters the animate and inanimate with thought alone Is constantly offered desirable things and served according to his pleasure
the transcendent perfection of wisdom possessed by great bodhisattva beings
Having abandoned all activity

Some flirted and acted shy
and if they are not endowed with the fiery roots of virtue
Now you must defeat Māra Touching the earth with the perfect palm of your hand
This Kāśyapa will see A full three hundred billion jinas
On this moon the size of the trichiliocosm Visualize the great obstructor utterly shaking
They are dedicated to the teachings of the Tathāgata in order to realize causes and conditions as the cause of attaining nirvāṇa for themselves
If after having submitted to his station the follower of another tīrthika order has a sense of reverence
all the acts of generosity that they make are offered with an omniscient mind
Will always have the Teacher present before him And he will have vast happiness i
so it is that they correctly perceive the cessation of perceptions
Noble one this is the supreme gift
For this way of Dharma to remain for a long time
He had compassion for the world and wanted to help
Nor does space think I do not obstruct the eye consciousness
Apart from that in those buddhafields that have not yet been refined
Subhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist had conjured up a large gathering of people
And those children playing here and there
Divine son in this way the self is not ultimately the self
The pratyekabuddhas will also wish to see them
Gentlemen prepare the debate arena

Thus addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the Buddha
A light of golden hue shines here constantly so bright that it is hard to distinguish day and night and neither the moon nor the sun shines here distinctly
such as a yakṣa
All phenomena are the essence of mind
Then Vaiśravaṇa arose And with palms joined said
Will have sharp wisdom and great strength
Noble son the thusgone ones possess great compassion that is unlike that of any hearer solitary buddha or bodhisattva
It is in this way that these corporeal aggregates exclusively endowed with suffering cease
Because mind is by nature luminous
King Virūpākṣa then arose And with palms joined said
They do not become bald And their hair does not become white
With his claim Passing beyond suffering is attained when the path of renunciation is accomplished he has attained a fearlessness that the entire world including its gods cannot overturn Therefore
These higher beings are both truly superior through their inconceivable qualities
without occurrence without origin
The gnosis that penetrates the elements in such a way is the entrance into nonduality
saying You should become a śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
Venerable Lord How wonderful it is that great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom should determine
You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest all ordinary behavior without forsaking cessation
Listen further noble son
I reside on the level of nirvāṇa
Lying slander verbal abuse and irresponsible chatter
They worship limitless buddhas and are capable of upholding the gateways to Dharma
With a wellproportioned body due to having understood the twelve links of dependent origination
Or a female kāpālika
If you ask why Subhūti it is because all the transcendent perfections are subsumed in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom
If youre asking my age I have seen sixty years he replied
and by means of these roots of virtuous action which are associated with hearing the transcendent perfection of wisdom
When the king had heard those words He became distressed sorrowful and afraid
I neither made it nor did I change it
Sometimes I assume the form of a hell being
Divine son what do you think
Oh Oh With your ocean of wisdom cut through All the worlds creepers of doubt
the emptiness of external phenomena
A noble one without evil Shines perpetually
They will read and master the sacred Dharma just as they will teach it abundantly to others
the outflow of views
They do not strive to be reborn among the higher realms as a king or in the buddha realms
The inquirer asks Do you have male organs The postulant responds I do
This palace if abandoned by you Will be like a withered and used garland
Those who have evil minds Will at that time mock us
A great healer of the wounds of disturbing emotions
The herbs are given in such and such a way so as to cure such and such an illness
Being reborn in those states they will become blind lame decrepit or without a tongue
 When they hear the unique Dharma from another They never have any doubt in it
Having conquered the evil deeds of body speech and mind Transform them into the essence of wisdom fire
She is there solely to benefit others
Venerable Lord if the notion of sights as arising is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of sights as ceasing become a bodhisattva
Some scattered red lotuses night lotuses Blue lotuses and excellent golden flowers
All bodhisattvas of great renown Respectfully pay homage First when they arrive And only then do they take their seats
Then he let go of his attachment toward the body
Also all the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas who reside along with their monastic community of śrāvakas in the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges
I offered you as an ascetic attendant to the noble āriputra Go and serve him
present and future buddhas in all the buddha realms in the ten directions to become visible right there at the seat of awakening

avoiding discouragement through spiritual heroism when learning of the immeasurable virtues of the Buddha
Whatever treasures there are in the earth Chests of iron that are filled with wealth With gold with silver and with cowries
One should make a lamp wick with fibers of white lotus and put lampblack into a dish of unbaked clay along with clarified butter from a brown cow
the right paw of a dog in heat
It is the same as that for having anger and being without anger
Again the bodhisattvas asked
It is therefore called the jewel of the ūrṇā
At that point the thousandeyed Indra the destroyer of cities changed into a garuḍa with a diamond beak and
Free from unvirtuous wishes it is content
There are the trainings that I have taught To the laymen who wear white clothing
His dreadlocks stream upward Bound by a vajra ornamentimagine him like this
he is the cutting off of conventional expressions
For that long none of us will abandon the greatly renowned sage
who wish to attain genuinely perfect buddhahood
that is going to a place where influential people gather and proclaiming Generosity produces no karmic result
I shall transcend saṃsāra
and the gods adorned the sky above it with parasols victory flags banners and canopies
Similarly they should not dwell on the notions that those who are tied to one further rebirth those who are no longer subject to rebirth or those who are arhats pratyekabuddhas bodhisattvas and tathāgatas are worthy of gifts
By such truth and true words as follows in order that Ia blessed perfectly and completely awakened thusgone arhatmay end this persons desire anger and ignorance
in the world systems of the eastern direction which are as numerous as the sands of the River Ganges
Listen great king
At a time when King Mahāpadma and his armies were dominant
Monks it then occurred to the ThusGone One rāḍa Kālāma is pure and has all the other qualities
On these occasions even the gods delight and rejoice in it proclaiming
BlissGone One now would be a perfect time
Noble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities keep their smiling faces free of angry frowns
The śrāvakas there were beyond number Those śrāvakas of the sugatas were numberless
As well one hundred thousand gods bathed the Guides body with fragrant water

Therefore they should hear this king of samādhis the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena
And bows to the mind of awakening
Great Sage you left home and lived in the forest
cannot be averted from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
In fact all possible sublime and perfect forms sounds smells tastes and textures were present within that peaked structure
The nature of nonarising is indeed omniscience
The noble one with pure heart then felt respect for his father
Relying upon this peace the level of buddhahood Is engaging in the meditation of samādhi 
Because of their activities conduct and excellent qualities bodhisattvas are beautiful and delightful to behold for all beings
One should also consider all compounded phenomena as impermanent impermanence as suffering and suffering as selfless
They do not inspire beings to an enlightenment that is other than form
Their courage with respect to the transcendent perfection of generosity and similarly with respect to the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom will not be broken
They could not with their color bring color there or with their brilliance bring brilliance
He is pure in his voice
Your word is well given
Well done Great Being You overpowered the demonic hordes And attained the sublime state deathless and free of anguish
They see many quintillions of buddhas As numerous as the sands of the Ganges
The Bodhisattva took up a writing board made of sandalwood
Young man in what way should bodhisattva mahāsattvas be skillful in methods
without the living beings therein knowing their motion or its origin
What are these  gateways They are as follows
All sentient beings who hear the name of this tathāgata
They have various kinds of delights and joys there With millions of gardens mansions and airborne palaces
Reverend nanda it is like the medicine called delicious which reaches the stomach but is not digested until all poisons have been eliminatedonly then is it digested
and the same goes for all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death
Know that they will leave behind vast Dharma activity and rebirth in buddha realms in order to perfectly teach this Dharma teaching and after my nirvāṇa they will be born here out of compassion for beings and in order to benefit them
The eloquence of bodhisattvas is not lacking in terms of meaning
Whoever has authentic attainment will not form elaborations
This is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived To this others replied This is not a worthy place
For many endless eons my hands feet ears and nose Were cut off
A tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world in order to reveal to beings the vision of the tathāgatas wisdom
Taking up the cowrie one should recite the Kurukullā mantra one hundred and eight times
Moreover āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the sensory elements from the eyes to mental phenomena are impermanent owing to their lack of skill in means
They gain control over all modes of birth

were contented delighted elated and joyful With happiness and gladness they presented the Bhagavāns body with their own clothing
his eyes became filled with tears and he said
when they engage with feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness in a similar manner they engage in the conditioning of physical forms
bring emptiness directly to mind
Do not be discouraged nanda
By many hundred thousands of Brahmās As he stepped on the threshold of the citys gateway
Somewhere on the road between Rājagṛha and Gaya they met a group of people who were enjoying a feast
Subhūti if you ask how great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom abiding in the six transcendent perfections which arise through the maturation of past actions and similarly established in the five extrasensory power and the four unhindered discernments attract by their generosity those sentient beings who are attracted by generosity
Lead me to obtain the skillful means and wisdom of the noble MahāyānaHaving spoken these words they should go back to bed to sleep

Then while his mindpurified and cleansed lucid free of basic and subsidiary afflictions supple flexible and immovablewas immersed in this way
They bring to maturity sentient beings who are neither fettered nor liberated
and the great disciples descended from their thrones likewise and having bowed at the feet of the Buddha withdrew to one side
Then you will not endure hardships for long you will not suffer and you will not be distressed
nor is it an object of comprehension
If you ask why Subhūti it is because the basis of the variety of false views never exists and is nonapprehensible This being the case how could they possibly come and go

the manifestations of the thusgone ones would also be pointless
Noble son you must understand that these are deeds of Māra and you must not fall under their influence
like the blossoming flower of a royal sal tree
With dullness one fails to practice in relation to virtuous or unvirtuous qualities and as a result one will take rebirth in the lower realms
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti created ninety million lionthrones exactly like those already there and the bodhisattvas were seated
How could they be differently designated
It neither has the mindsets of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas nor is it without them
When it is exhaled this is known as recaka
but the consciousness that depends on the eyes has no form

Subhūti it is because enlightenment itself is the path and the path itself is enlightenment
The god āntamati replied
the body reborn in every life
Then the Bhagavān encircled and esteemed by that assembly of many hundred thousands taught the Dharma
but the rākṣasīs who lived on Siṃhala Island sent untimely winds
They are kind and helpful to them But the foolish are happy when harm comes to the wise
by remaining silent assented to eat a meal
the samādhi named Entering the Chariot of the Dharma
As a comparison I can count each hair on all fourlegged beings such as herds of oxen donkeys buffaloes horses and elephants dogs jackals goats and similarly lions tigers wolves deer monkeys hares pigs and so on and rats and cats and so on but
They will never be harmed by poison or weapons Their bodies will not be struck by clods stones or sticks
And that is how I thought this whole huge mass of suffering comes to cease
He has no striving or giving up
Having relinquished the ubiquitous clinging to existence suffering falsely construed
agents actors petitioners
those iron fetters and those wooden stocks would open
Noble one Who cut off the hands of a renunciant
They will be attached to their robes and alms bowls greedy for cloth And be devoted to acquisition and forsake the Dharma 
The strength of all gods from the classes of the Four Great Kings is the same as the strength of one Kubera
after Mahauṣadhi had belonged to heterodox sects for five hundred lifetimes he formulated the thought
nd the Four Mahārājas and the other Cāturmahārājakāyika devas
excellent knowledge of the thusgone ones greatness because of being inspired by the vast
AllSeeing One please come here
Their friends are the aids to enlightenment
Those who delight in study discipline and generosity Are endowed with patience and gentleness
seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment
Ultimately they do not reify them either and they are not attached to them
They had no yearning no aspiration for a sūtra like this and opposed it and attacked it
Noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are endowed with skillful means
Similarly they do not consider the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and likewise all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are permanent or that they are impermanent that they are imbued with happiness or that they are imbued with suffering that they are a self or that they are not a self or In the same vein that they are pure or that they are impure and so forth
He became the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha named Jñānaśūra
Seeing that it was now midnight the Bodhisattva called upon Chanda
The gods will all guard protect and preserve him and all of his purposes will be fulfilled
The inferior are to apply themselves to the eyes of the central figure
Awakening Mañjuśrī is by nature luminous because the mind is by nature luminous that is why it is said to be luminous by nature
abandoned and let go of my bones and marrow
the charioteer of those to be guided by the unexcelled being who possesses the four types of confidence
Noble son when bodhisattvas give up all such associations they must not become hostile to any of these people
I will love others in the same way that I love myself
And no concept of view and no concept of no view i
mentally practice the three modes of excellent conduct
You should make offerings to that sage as he practices to fulfill his aspirations
The perishing of the decrepit aggregates is death
As a sharp pain shot through his heart he began to scheme
and causes the entire world with its devas humans and asuras to hear his speech
nail it with a peg one finger long made of bone or iron
Moreover if because of its unvirtuous actions a snake does bite the snake itself will die
they will all have great miraculous abilities great power the eight liberations and dhyāna
You may wonder how bodhisattvas bring the qualities of buddhahood to maturation
When those sugatas have passed into nirvāṇa
the deva śvara the deva Maheśvara
He had complete knowledge of others previous lives And he had transcended the world
One should visualize the syllables in reverse order
When faced with the pleasant and the unpleasant They always have a liberated mind 
I will definitely offer chariots palanquins horses elephants and shoes
Spoke unpleasant things to me for an entire eon
After all since the earth contains many gems its surface is covered with one beauty after another
The king was informed of this reply and thought
Divine son understanding this utter wishlessness is awakening
The goddess then said
Finally during the last part of the night he summoned the five excellent companions and said
in the same way the formless element of consciousness carried by formless merit is made to give rise to divine bodies
If someone had to insert into their fingernail The entire element of earth And having done so go away And climb up to the world of Brahmā
Who has meditated on this stainless samādhi of peace 
Blessed One may all beings achieve this absorption that encapsulates all merit
The deer and birds contemplate deeply in that way
When sentient beings see these forms they will long to have them
Thus the emptiness of omniscience is indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they cannot be bisected
Supramundane physical forms are neither fettered nor liberated and similarly supramundane feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberated
Like the coral tree or the kovidāra tree this was a tree that one could never tire of beholding
Bhagavān the number of those world realms would be incalculable
Accordingly Nārāyaṇa you should listen carefully and keep in mind what I am about to say
Why Because gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas and demigods understand that before long the bodhisattva will sit at the seat of awakening
for it leads to the pure teaching of the Dharma
Subhūti reversible bodhisattvas may be called irreversible
So she let the ornaments be thrown into the pond
The light from his burning right hand made that of the many quintillions of offering lamps seem dark
and when they see one they will be delighted and rejoice
Then with his stainless hand radiating hundreds of light rays tender and smooth shining brighter than the rays of the sun adorned with the signs of past virtuous conduct as soft as the bulb of a lotus flower and whose palm had the design of a thousandspoked wheel the Blessed One stroked the heads of the Licchavi people and instructed them
then noble ones do you think that anyone could conceive of or calculate count or determine the number of those world realms
You do not know do not hear the sounds of people speaking or the sounds of drums conches and so on which are five yojanas away
This is the way that bodhisattvas apply the remedy for anger and give up the conditions for anger to arise
Also they should reflect Alas This cyclic existence is limitless like space Alas This world system of sentient beings is limitless like space and yet apart from the conventional designations sentient being cyclic existence and liberation there are no sentient beings at all who are trapped within cyclic existence or who attain nirvāṇa There are no sentient beings at all who attain final liberation
Performing enlightened activity in the trichiliocosm
Bhaiṣajyarāja will take those sights as a sign
who lived and dwelt in the ṣipatana Deer Park near Vārāṇasī
Will in accordance with Vajradharmas words Hereby experience the supreme accomplishment
Furthermore in this buddhafield he will teach them the Dharma called The Wheel of No Return
The wise are in accord with other wise people Like butter is with ghee 
the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat
Those who have not trained in pure conduct And who have no wisdom will not see them 
Therefore young man follow my teaching And maintain this restraint of the body
Then the Bhagavat the tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha ākyamuni asked
O Wonderful King of Dharma you turned the wheel of Dharma before men and gods With its threefold revolution its manifold aspects Its extreme peace and its purity of nature

There the Thusgone worthy perfect Buddha Ratnaketu at present lives and teaches the Dharma
Noble one these bodhisattva mahāsattvas all have instant comprehension
I will pronounce their names So please listen to me Lord of the World
The bodhisattva Sunetra declared
 Their luminosity radiates as they walk  They satisfy whichever gods and humans encounter them
Once I have conquered him all the gods in the desire realm will also be restrained
then once sentient beings have been favored with the power of the instructions
False and deceptive such phenomena fool childish beings
With perfectly pure wisdom he was turning the wheel of Dharma
Bodhisattvas are generous because they desire enlightenment That is the uniqueness of this attainment of samādhi 
I was offered this because the benefactor knew of my discipline great learning and humble ways
That noble man or noble woman will be seated at the Bodhimaṇḍa
Māra Pāpīyān said
I am freed from blindness
Compared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consisting of the bodhisattvas acts of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
Blessed One how do bodhisattvas revel in superknowledge
nanda think of this example Consider a man who is strong and wellregarded but has only one son
nanda the bodhisattva mahāsattvas of the past who were practicing infinite bodhisattva conduct
That fruit is empty too It has no coming It has no going No one makes it arise It is not stopped by anybody
then great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom in that manner will have the good fortune to actualize manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
And followed that which was not the Dharma
You should not teach them austerity But instead you should praise generosity 
Devas asuras and nāgas upon seeing it Were astonished and cried out Ha ha ha xi
the emptiness of nondispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all things
The vinaya of the hearers does not contain all the teachings of the Buddha and it also lacks skillful means
Until one reaches unsurpassable complete and perfect awakening the state of truly perfect awakening ones actions will be conducive to it
nothing was ever destroyed is destroyed or will ever be destroyed
the width of his body is proportionate to its length and its length is proportionate to its width
Oh the suffering Oh the suffering Death is suffering
Subhūti do you think that the sentient beings inhabiting this world system of the great trichiliocosm are many
They attain the enlightenment that is peace free of misery They perceive beings afflicted by illness and aging
There on the lion throne of the Dharma may they thoroughly trample on Māra in order to overcome him
They should also encourage others to acquire the maturity of the bodhisattvas
Through wisdom that realizes That phenomena are by nature empty And that nothing intrinsically arises You reached the other shore and wholly perfected the wisdom of a buddha
Noble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities access emptiness
the samādhi named Unadorning
Mañjuśrī he said you say that all phenomena are the nature of the realm of phenomena
and swiftly attain emancipation in omniscience without ever descending to the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas
The Blessed One then addressed akra mighty lord of the gods
A follower of Mantra who has a pure body
In that kūṭāgāra appeared a throne spread with many hundreds of thousands of calico cloths
and all those pratyekabuddhas of the present who abide in the innumerable countless world systems of the ten directions
Dwell in lovingkindness and be compassionate
This light illuminated the entire great trichiliocosm
He who is involved in sights sounds categories and ideas is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in sights sounds categories and ideas
they do not become vindictive
Through the karma we created in the past We have these brilliant beautiful airborne palaces Accept them out of compassion for us Knower of the world enjoy them in whatever way you wish
Its king uddhodana descends from pure families on both his mothers and fathers side His wife as well is pure
Bodhisattvas will rest in meditation When their mind is focused upon that image

And make love to the mother
You are skilled in the nature of phenomena selfarisen one Therefore ocean of wisdom I have asked you my questions 
Reverend Maudgalyāyana that is not the way to teach the Dharma to the householders in their white clothes
Having made the offering they sat fanning the Blessed One with a chowrie
a core of emerald and flower anthers made of the light of Brahmās precious stone
the illusory absorption Moreover as soon as they attain that absorption they emanate whatever bodies in whatever way will perfect sentient beings roots of virtue
Once he has sat at the Bodhimaṇḍa The conceptions of Māra cease 
Thus bodhisattvas bring down a continuous and delightful flower rain of the true and indisputable Dharma from wishfulfilling trees upon the circles of their retinue
Name is empty of name In names there are no names
Noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten such qualities have knowledge of the world
Bodhisattvas are beyond all forms of fixation and so they engage with all aspects of the world without fixation
Such forms are of yourself as well All that has been explained
Noble son replied the Blessed One
O Jina you who teach the supreme Dharma You have the power of a lord of liberating wisdom
For example Subhūti space is not something that is seen nor is it heard remembered or cognized
