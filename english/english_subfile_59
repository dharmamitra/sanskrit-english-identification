fortunateHe has no desire for themIn accordance with the aspirations observed by the buddhas through this offering of residences may I become a shelter a protector a support a refuge and a helper for all beingsThe venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana asked nandaOne should then visualize him Being eaten also by Māmakīand  brave heroic and handsome foot soldiers wearing excellent and solid armorGreat bodhisattva beings would have absolutely attained the five degrees of enlightenment even though they are without insightthe garuḍa rulers Mahātejas and Mahākāya each with his retinue of garuḍasWithout forsaking his great vow protected by his solid armorThe conditions for the aggregates the sense fields and the elements Are ignorance craving and karmaThe mind that is pure bright and stainless That indeed is the transcendent insightDaṇḍotpala śarapuṅkha Nicula and girikarṇikāHow do they have a loving nature and how do they have a compassionate natureThen the two monks saida sound comes forth from the great Dharma drumSimilarly those feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness that have not been grasped are not consciousness and the restWho would not be thrilled when enjoying the passion of love Even a decayed tree would be brought back to lifeThe gandharva Pañcaśikha thoughtUltimately they are not hearersthe Blessed One directed the bodhisattva to sit down on a lotus flower to the sideSo the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya asked the Blessed OneSome are for impurities And others for curds Though the potter makes the pots By using the same claywhere they paused to recover from the weariness of the roadBrahmā this queen of incantations called Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm which delivers from all grahas is the buddha seal of as many perfectly awakened thusgone arhats as there are grains of sand in the river GangesHomage to Tathāgata Sarvasvarāṅgarutanirghoṣaśrīand then sat down in front of him on lotus seats that appeared through the force of their aspirationsSome scatter beautiful flowers never seen beforeNot aiming for the three worlds it has modest wishesThe Lord Buddha thus surrounded and venerated by these multitudes of many hundreds of thousands of living beings sat upon a majestic lionthrone and began to teach the DharmaConsider noble son how the wind carries a sweetly fragrant rain that pacifies the torments of sentient beings by soothing and cooling their bodiesBy apprehending dreams and dreamerswho have not planted the roots of virtuous actionYour mind is completely liberated Like a full moon free of eclipseYet when the wise one attains the level Of the unfathomable Dharma treasureand relish the taste of the three gateways of liberationIt is because through this Dharma teaching being taught just once through hearing it countless innumerable beings will quickly attain the highest complete enlightenmentEach thinks that he is king never taking on the role of a student or accepting the DharmaOh my The mendicant Gautama has turned black Have you seen hes so dark The mendicant Gautama has the color of the madgura fish Previously his complexion was so beautiful but now it has all changed Monks at that point I thought to myselfThe one who developed the aspiration to enlightenment In the presence of Indraketudhvajarājain this regard Subhūti great bodhisattva beings abide in the meditative stability of sameness with regard to all things and they do not consider whether anything is in equipoise or distractedThey leave behind all transmigration caused by their own habitual tendenciesFrom the time when I first begin to set my mind on enlightenment until I am seated at the Focal Point of EnlightenmentAt that time the great being the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi himself brandished a vajra three times at his heart centerYou should see form like a man blind from birth hear sounds as if they were echoesthat they are not a self that they are empty that they are signless that they are without aspirations that they are calmthere is no type of being whatsoever that can disturb what has been blessed through the blessings of a bodhisattvaThey may speak of the sense source of the eye yet ultimately no sense source of the eye can be observed and they cannot be attached itVenerable Lord Are those great bodhisattva beings who undertake training in order to terminate physical forms and become detached from them so that they cease and do not arise actually training in omniscienceIndeed each of them had completed all the bodhisattva groundsThere was a diminution among all beings Of the wisdom of the way of pure conductAnd the red Passion Vajrī in the northwestAlways considering the matter well you gave to lowly people what is hard to giveHow could they depart having left behind the dharma bodythe element of consciousness may take rebirth among dogs or pigs that eat dirt and refusetogether with his saṅgha of bodhisattvas and saṅgha of bhikṣusThe fact that you see such a buddhafield as this as if it were so impureAfter agreeing to do just that Saṅgharakṣita departedThen the goddess released her magical power and each returned to their ordinary formCome join me Upatiṣya As we have faith in only what is perfect we shall go forth from home into the homelessnessWhen Māra awoke from this dream he was so terrified that he gathered all his family membersIn the age of destruction there will be many beings Who will have few possessions but will not leave their homes āradvatīputra just as the notion of degenerate morality with respect to the aggregate of ethical discipline possessed by the tathāgatas arhats and completely perfect buddhas is without foundationThis fierce unbearable suffering Will remind them of their previous intentions And they will undoubtedly be pacifiedThis bodhisattva will engage in austerities and that one will notwith regard to all things in all their aspects there is nothing at all that the eye of the buddhas possessed by great bodhisattva beingshe praised him with these versesthe samādhi named Unceasing True Natureand they make assumptions about those giftsOthers live in villages or remote placesSimilarly owing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of a selfAccording to the sequence of possessing One four ten or two hundred and fifty vowsFurthermore noble arhats renounced stealing sexual misconduct lyingIn that regard the Tathāgata is the same neutral without concepts and does not make any distinctionsAlways protecting the teaching of the Buddha That is what the Jina the Lord of the Dharma teaches One should then surround the drawing with the garland mantra and wrap everything with a red stringResounds throughout all the worldsHow could they be differentiatedFor example Subhūti just as when the faculty of the life force has ceased at the time of a mans death all the other sense faculties will ceaseMahauṣadhi do not think that their consciousness and the consciousness of an insect are any differentThe seers grabbed hold of his robeIn the same way when the ornaments were struck by the light radiating from the Bodhisattvas body they lost all their glitter gleam and shineThey are the most excellent cart Which the Buddhas sons continually enjoyThe seed phrase supreme ta teaches the indivisibility of all phenomena within suchnessAnd is entreated to turn the wheel of the Dharma by a billion Brahmā godsThey abide within the domain of the buddhasA mans desire comes quickly And he will remain in the vagina for longWhen the sun was shining he did not seek shadeFor as long as he does not obtain power There is no evil whatsoever Nor is there any meritthe meditative stability endowed with ideation and scrutinyilluminating all the boundless and immeasurable buddha realmsthe realms that filled the entire field of phenomenaThey have attained great compassion Toward all beingsYou must carry through to the end this burden you bearin the same way in the northwestOne should add that powder to buttermilk kept in a new vesselOne who is violent toward others is not a proper renunciantFor those in possession of the five qualities are reliable Reverend as for one of four yearsSimilarly O gods this doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousnessWhere did all the previous thusgone ones the worthy ones the perfect buddhas turn the wheel of DharmaThose who have fallen into those hells Experience the sensation of suffering gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and yakṣas in their multitudes rejoiced in his gloryThe Jina to whom these offerings were made will he give a prophecy Will this lord of humans teach the Dharma Subāhu the venerable āriputra the venerable MahāmaudgalyāyanaWhen the king heard these noises he asked his fellow ākyasit is because these transcendent perfections have not been enunciated and explained by the tathāgatas arhats and completely perfect buddhasāriputra one cannot take birth in the realm of Bhagavān Tathāgata Amitāyus merely with minimal roots of virtueby reciting  timesThe rays of the sun Mañjuśrī are free from mentality mind and consciousnessWith the socalled empowerment of the Victor Locanā and the other four ariseThat is how wisdom grows Like a tree on a snow mountain then at that time they have come near to the highest complete enlightenmentthey are close to itThen they should go back to bed to sleepBecause he realizes the way of the ultimate truth he is the one who abides in signlessness Since he is unstained by any undertaking he abides in wishlessnessif those who make offerings to you are not thereby purifiedThere was present a bhikṣu a dharmabhāṇaka A celibate who was the heart son of the Sugataand its corporeal state is cast off it will acquire the aggregates of another bodyKusumanilayā She Whose Abode Is the FlowersSubhūti the emptiness of names will not attain emancipation from the three world systems and will not come to rest in omniscienceConsider noble son how a lion never sees anyone like itself no matter where it goes and therefore it is undaunted and free from fearSimilarly they do not apprehend the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty or the notion that they are not emptyand subsequently establish other sentient beings too on the paths of the ten virtuous actionsthe samādhi of stainless lightAnd it bathes the herbsthe rainy season the short rainy season and the long rainy seasonIt flies through the sky but does not dwell therein and is unsulliedThe gods strewed a rain of divine flowers over KapilavastuBhagavān I too will make practice essential and without care for life or body I shall train as the tathāgatas haveAll beings who were living in the hells along with those born as animals and all those in the realm of the lord of deathTheir energy vigor and great determination will become the great enthusiasm and determination needed to bring the six perfections to complete perfectionIn the same way they will know the smells of The princes the princesses and the haremsAll yakṣas bhūtas and piśācas who rob people of their radiance will abide in lovingkindnessThrough the nature of sentient beings they understand the nature of all phenomenaHere in Jambūdvīpa the sage Asita looked with the divine eye To the city of Kapilavastu King uddhodanas sublime cityEnlightenment is unadulterated since it is free of the afflictions of the instinctually driven succession of livesThey may neglect and disregard the state of omniscienceThey will cry out What have I who delighted in bad actions doneAs soon as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara entered samādhiFurthermore noble arhats renounced and swore to refrain from stealing sexual misconductMoreover Subhūti formative predispositions are pure owing to the purity of fundamental ignoranceThen the sages make a prediction and say You will later become a stainless victorious oneWhen he attains enlightenment living beings with the transcendences of tolerance discipline and the superior trancehence beautiful with the thirtytwo auspicious signswill be born in his buddhafieldThe minds of two hundred fully ordained nuns were liberated from contaminants and freed from graspingThese unsurpassable words are not to be found They have never been found and never will be found In front of his assembly of bhikṣus The Jina roared this lions roar And there is no mingling with homeless mendicants That is what the Jina the Lord of the Dharma teaches Hence this as well is not an appropriate place for the Bodhisattva to be conceivedMay we abandon the condition of womanhood And all become bhikṣus like you The belly is one big load of urine and excrement excreting filthwho is there who would not conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment From that time forth I no longer recommend the vehicles of the disciples and of the solitary sages but recommend the MahāyānaThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana was dedicated to hardship in following the teaching of that BhagavānBhagavān we too will guard protect and conceal that kind of dharmabhāṇaka who upholds a sūtra such as thisAnd if all their voices were to describe the benefit Of possessing one verse from this samādhiSir are you Koṣṭhila People know me thusMoreover Subhūti the evil Māra approaching in the guise of a fully ordained monk might say to these bodhisattvasUpatiṣya it took a long time for my parents to give their consent How long will it be until you have consentand then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara said to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamaladalavimalanakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñanot

actions Their community of followers remains united Will in a future time be selfarisen jinas So their conduct you should hear from meWhat are those ten They dispel the darkness of ignorance mature those who are to be trained shine in the ten directions manifest virtuous qualities cause the fading of defilements spread light subdue the unwholesome ways of the nonBuddhists reveal the equal and

liberation but I must not establish that many in all these causal attributes up to and including the three gateways to liberationAt this the complete assembly of bodhisattvas with bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya standing in front to them with hands together in homage requestedIt is to not forsake the omniscient mindSome are to be converted by śrāvakasHe then saw that it was matricideand in that way they do not objectify words conceptualize themis the noncultivation of the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental facultyThe Blessed One now addressed Mañjuśrī KumārabhutaThe nature of the sensory element of mental consciousness is emptiness and in the same vein emptiness is the sensory element of mental consciousness and so forthnanda I will ask you a question and you should answer as best you canendowed with a supremely good complexion excellent figureNot forming mental constructs or concepts one does not create the pastAll the worlds were flooded with bright light including even the dark spaces between them that were riddled with evilNoble son such is the bodhisattvas perfect giving of the DharmaIf you ask what are the five eyes they comprise  the eye of flesh  the eye of divine clairvoyance  the eye of wisdom  the eye of the sacred doctrine and  the eye of the buddha These are called the five eyesthey are incapable of dedicating the nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessHe has control over usHow is it that a universal monarch comes to possess the precious horsePrajñākūṭa said I have seen that when the bhagavān tathāgata ākyamuni had become a bodhisattva dedicated to attaining enlightenment he generated much meritDuring a third a fourth a fifth a sixth a seventh an eighth a ninth and a tenth intermediate eon he sat on the Bodhimaṇḍa at the foot of the Bodhi tree with legs always crossed never standing up with his mind unwavering and his body motionless but even so during that time those qualities did not manifest for himMañjuśrī of course an echo does not know any phenomenaIf you ask what these two are they comprise the tolerance of suffering and the tolerance that understands the profound nature of phenomenaOr the noose is wisdom and the sword is skillful meansHere having triumphed through the power of impartiality I drank the elixir of nectar For the sake of which Those with the ten powers cultivated impartiality for myriad eonsSenior Subhūti how should one know that when they are practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom they do possess skill in meansanything that strengthens or weakens and so forth any of those other attributes up to and including buddhahoodNoble son when the charnel grounddwelling bodhisattvas enter a templeāradvatīputra The purity of phenomena is not subject to affliction due to absolute purityHaving seen the nature of life one neither belongs to it nor is one utterly liberated from itShe therefore became depressed and in order to enthrall Mahākāla this Kurukullā compendium was taughtWhat were these sixteen They wereHowever they do not see these levels as eternal and delightful abodesPerceiving the buddhas in the center of the sky one regards the buddhas by the power of concentrationIf the Blessed One was about to foretell rebirth as a god the rays of light would fade into his navelThe people there upon hearing those sounds settle into the recollection of the Buddha the recollection of the Dharma and the recollection of the SaṅghaHence as he has no conceit does not think does not conceive and does not clingConditioned by birth aging and death come into beingThe face was not transferred there The face will never be found in the reflectionAt that very moment akra placed such a rock before him and the Bodhisattva now began to wash the dusty ragAnd as long as they have not completely and fully awakened to unsurpassable truly perfect awakening they will be reborn in pleasant forms of existenceOverpowered by the noose of Timehaving attained the equanimity of omniscient gnosisIt is for the sake of sentient beings that they cultivate this generosity and so forthCame to see the Guide accompanied by A hundred thousand trillion beings They never cease longing to listen To the supreme unequaled Dharma of the buddhasSimilarly they teach the doctrine that the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty

discernmentMahāpratibhāna the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna made a momentous prayerThat which is pure is nonarisingAnything that is conceptualized neither arises

poured it into the monks begging bowlThey are covetousness ill will and wrong viewBhikṣus then all the Mahābrahmās who lived in those fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds and who had gathered togetherIf you ask why Subhūti it is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the precursor of all aspects of enlightenmentMoreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings fill the world systems of the great trichiliocosm with the seven precious thingsand so that thought dawned in the ThusGone Ones mindVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is inexpressibleHowever Subhūti because physical forms are imagined fabricated and verbally constructedtheir attributes being entirely impermanent unstable ephemeral changeable and so on andSubhūti in no respect do they abide in conditioned and unconditioned phenomena or in the emptiness of conditioned phenomenao that he abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatshipto distinguish the levels of concentrationāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of tastes and the sensory element of gustatory consciousness as entities and nonentitiesWhat are those ten They are the aspiration that is not inferior the aspiration that knows no dejection the aspiration to persist for the benefit of all beings the aspiration of praise to all buddhas the aspiration to annihilate all demons the aspiration not to depend on others limitless aspiration fearless aspiration aspiration free of weariness and the aspiration to full perfectionTo illustrate this consider how a wooden puppet connected to a rod can be made to do anythingHe is able to bless the countless sounds of sentient beings and transform them into the Dharma language of the Buddha ThereforeIf you have the thought that at that time on that occasion the king was someone else do not see it in that wayMoreover Subhūti the evil Māra might approach great bodhisattva beings and dissuade them sayingTherefore son of noble family those bodhisattva great beings who strive to be diligent should exert themselves in the accumulation of learning it is ungraspablewhile the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive and the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixedNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities remain constantly in equipoise without any interruptionThey are trustworthy They are peaceful bright pure unstained and clearI must first consult my parentsWhen practicing generosity by offering delicaciesHolding various beautiful kinds of crowns And positioned in the sky they paid homage to the Sugata Noble sir through these considerations one can understand that all passions constitute the family of the tathāgatasLesser dullness does not involve natural misdeedsThe display of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One the thusgone King of the GoldenHued Lions Play which I described before would not equal even one hundredth of this display of qualitiesYoung man when Bodhisattva mahāsattvas know that all phenomena have no existence have no essenceVajrapāṇi repliedThen the youth Candraprabha rose from his seatThe sound does not dwell in the woodYour hair and uṣṇīṣa are blueblack and the locks of your hair curlhumans and nonhumans saw this light that was the great miraculous sign of the BhagavānOnce again the Bodhisattva thoughtThe lord buddhas have round fingers and toesWhy is it the highest wealth Because it brings the attainment of an excellent rebirth as a deva or human and it brings the attainment of liberationit is through having the earth as their basis and support that all grass thickets herbs and trees grow to become sizeableBlessed One that was how the mighty strongman Vimalatejā arrived with immense pride conceit and arrogance YetThen he sprinkled well the ground in the great city of RājagṛhaI rejoice in those who have no entanglements Who have no envy or yearning for a homeThis is called knowledge of the cessation of sufferingIf someone attacks a dharmabhāṇaka And they hear this mantrait is because it is through the transcendent perfection of wisdom that the bodhisattvas have appearedThe brahmin Māṭhara thoughtIf you ask how they correctly perceive feelingsWhen he said the letter ḍha out came the statement The impure regions mīḍhaviṣayāḥI pay homage to you the hero who has subjugated the four enemiesEighty quintillion beings who heard it Quickly reached the level of the śrāvakasRevatī is in the form of a dogPlay the most pleasant instruments cymbals and drumsthe animal realms and the World of the Lord of Deathof the transcendence of tolerance consummated through the principle of selflessnessNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities have abundant faithYet when the wealth is gone one becomes a beggar miserable in old age At that point just like a vulture one becomes dislikedThe faculty of absorption is a gateway to the light of the Dharmathe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of existence concerning the kleśasRaise high the banner of the ThusGone OneThe sides are the three liberationsand seek wholly positive actions Monks this is how you should trainMonks the Bodhisattva then went to the home of the village girl Sujātā where he sat down at the seat that had been prepared for himall wholesome mental engagements are a cause of purificationwith an excited gasp assumes the element of dharmas at which point the sensory fields cease to existIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of the limit of past timeConsider also noble son the following analogyThis is because having mastered the above mnemonic incantationsteach the sacred doctrine to sentient beingsSubhūti the nature of physical forms does not come from anywhere it does not go anywhere and it does not abide anywhereWith respect to the tathatā there is neither something coproducedThe domain of the four bases of magical powers where they are effortlessly mastered such is the domain of the bodhisattvaGentlemen who knows the Lokāyata philosophyMoreover Subhūti physical forms are pure owing to the purity of the transcendent perfection of wisdomthanks to their correct knowledge their minds were perfectly liberatedNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities are specialists in the discoursesNor does the nonbondage and nonliberation of physical forms constitute physical formsThey will not become angry with anyone even at the cost of their livesFrom the right side Māras son named Acalamati saidgods nāgas and gandharvasWith that respect my renown increased As did my merit fame and qualities They always possess the nature of an illusory song and danceThe thorough cognition of the eye Mañjuśrī is to be ungraspableBecause they do not harbor doubt they will not appropriateAnd avoid false wordsBlessed One these four collections of the Dharma are all profound they are like spacein a powerful wayNanda and Upananda said These black begging bowl carriers might as well be snatching babiesWhere do the water element the fire element the wind element the space element and the element of consciousness come fromWhen nothing is apprehended That is called enlightenment Similarly if they engage with the notion that aspirations exist in feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness or that aspirations do not exist therein then they are merely engaging with mental imagesThe six entrances are a cause of afflictionIn the same way Subhūti when individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas are endowed with faith tolerance confidence higher aspiration willingness volition and renunciationDivine son you ask how disturbing emotions are tamedIt is like being born as an insect conditioned by a dirty loathsome smell or being born as a creature in order to turn into smelly curd honey or beerNoble sir flowers like the blue lotus the red lotus the white lotus the water lily and the moon lily do not grow on the dry ground in the wildernessIn former times you were a personal priest to a kingthat this śrāvaka bhikṣu of mine Kāśyapa will serve three hundred billion buddhas will venerate them honor them make offerings to them praise them and respect themLikewise all the different species of flowers that grow in water as well as on land manifested there at the seat of awakeningThe person who has it written out In a volume with correct wordsand in the same vein among the other god realms up to and including the gods of the sense field of neither perception nor nonperceptionHow does it hold onto a person who possesses the strength of nine thousand elephants or the king of elephantsCompletely free of discursive conceptual movementEven after enlightenment he is my son A great rishi who holds the inheritance of DharmaIn such ways do these fools believe themselves to be pureSimilarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that I as a great bodhisattva being should perfect the five extrasensory powers of a bodhisattva The Blessed One has feet that are well positionedinstead of focusing on the lineage of the Buddha the lineage of the Dharma the lineage of the Saṅgha and the Great VehicleSattva lotus and vajra Are considered posturesThe third root mantrawas now also permeated by that light so that all the beings who lived there could see one anotherAwakening too is neither even nor unevenwith regard to the outer body continue to observe the physical body without generating any apperceptions dependent on the physical bodyIf the king of mountains Sumeru were to become birch barkMay all your past aspirations become fulfilled Please proceedThe name of this sūtra Is Entering Great CompassionBhaiṣajyarāja repliedOh You too were here You were here I was here GoodThose great bodhisattva beings who think they should seek to train all sentient beings and thenIf the Bodhisattva becomes awakened all by himself He will awaken billions of beingsYour mind is the same as spaceFor one week for the sake of peoples happiness Please give food drink clothing chariots palanquins and horsesYou are unerring fearless confident and braveOwing to the utter purity of all things they do not apprehend bodhisattvasI must by all means develop and maintain the qualities of a mendicant a monk and a field of generosity It is skill in the āyatanas and the knowledge of the higher cognitions It is the elimination of the kleśas and the level of selfsubjugationone should fill a bowl with rice cooked with milk or curdIf anyone does so they will face capital punishmentn short After purifying all habitual tendencies without exception I will completely accomplish the two accumulations of merit and wisdomThe three corner channels are filled with warmthI should free myself from this sickness and should strive to abandon itThrough the strength of his love he will vanquish Māra That mighty foulplaying wrestleralong with his bannered forces of footmen and cavalryThen Tathāgata Padmottama praised the qualities of this sixsyllable mahāvidyāWhen he knew that they were settled the Bodhisattva questioned and examined the bodhisattvas regarding the divisions pertaining to the Great VehicleWhat is the origin of suffering It is the craving that perpetuates existence which is attended upon by the passion for enjoyment and which finds pleasures here and thereThey dedicate it toward purifying omniscient wisdomHe had attained the power of retention and the fearlessnessesSimilarly the eyes the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty constitute apprehension for bodhisattvasHe never refused but gave courageously with an open handBhagavān for the sake of showing compassion to us accept these airborne palaces of the Brahmāsas the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confidentHe replied This is owing to the perpetual exhaustion and refinement of all thingsYoung brahmins replied Sañjayin this is how I see it and this is my philosophybut perceive to the contrary that it does not bring about attainmentHaving bound and burned them up I have ensured that they can no longer appearone should drink sugar and white mustard oilLikewise all those Indras Brahmās Lokapālas and gods bowed at the feet of the Buddha and withdrew to one sidethe Saṅgha is itself the nature of the Dharmaits Brahmā and his retinuesMother we have guided our father toward the highest complete enlightenmentSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who train accordingly will refine all the attributes powers and assurances of the buddhas They will not fall into the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhasand what is this vehicle of the bodhisattvas wherein emancipation is not attained through limited vehiclesWhen that night was over on the sixth morning he went back into the capital city of RatnāvatīWe thought that we had obtained a great deal and were devoted to intent upon and dedicated to these dharmas from the TathāgataBhagavān I wish to eliminate the evil mārasthat the emaciating spirits gandharvas or gods that possess those people would be visibleAround this on the left and right Is a mantra garland as fine as a strand of hair The vowels and consonants enwrap the drop like a snakeBecause of familiarity with the practice this mantra holder May do as he wishes with beautiful goddessesIt teaches the understanding of the sameness of phenomena and is a gateway to the awakening of all phenomenaIf one feels a prickling sensation in ones navel when pricking the soles of the feetāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena as entitieswe will make a name for ourselves and find our fortune tooBecause it generates and completes a body as well as its appearance through the condition of feeling it is called consciousness Young man what is the teaching of this samādhiwhich has become one raging flame in the shape of a reed basket Within this Avīci hell there is a pot from which comes the sound of wailing Many hundreds of thousands of tens of millions of hundreds of millions of beings have been thrown into that potHow should they train in the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThey are the inconceivably numerous words of conduct concerning the compositethe tathāgata the arhat the perfectly awakened Buddha the knowledgeable and venerable one the sugataimbued with suffering without a self empty signless lacking aspirations calm void purified nonarising unceasing and nonentitiesThe shade of the tree Where this perfect being is seated Does not leave himThose who hear the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets Display will have happinessHe also meditated on the four brahmavihāras In order to benefit the world and its devas Having become fixated they conceive of the understanding of all thingsAt the center of the royal palace Is the dwelling place of the Dharma King Encircled by a cool pond And shaded by sandal treesbhikṣus the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha says to themThe bodhisattva Siṃhamati declaredApart from in the mind Things and entities are not seen anywhere at allAre each transformed into a deity either five six or thirtysevenBahujīmūtā She of the Many CloudsAnd open the door to deathlessnessthe emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all things the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristicsIn the same way all the bodhisattvas the great spiritual heroes told the stories of their conversations with Vimalakīrti and declared their reluctance to go to himIf they were to discriminate thinking Should I give it or not give itwould not have to acquire omniscience HoweverOnly after the Blessed One had given his consent did his hair fall out and was he clothed in robesapart from that making common cause with all sentient beingsSo Yamas guardians will bring them to the great Kālasūtra hell and put them into ita state of interruption through the path of tranquility and imperceptible like emptinessTo ākyamuni you offered a handful of gold and you praised IndraketuConsider further noble son the analogy of the windOffering flowers and flower garlands represents the attainment of the precious flowers of retention eloquence and the branches of awakeningWhat mantra should he reciteWhat you may wonder are the thusgone ones four fearlessnessesYou should practice toleranceOn the relative level generosity is a gateway to great wealthYet nothing increases or decreasesSo the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi then supplicated the ThusGone One a second time and a third timeLord of Men Pure Being demonstrate passing awayBlessed One much largertBodhisattvas should be like boats bringing all beings to freedomWhen Vimalakīrti had discoursed in this way two hundred gods obtained the pure doctrinal vision in regard to all things without obscurity or defilementThey manifest all sorts of bodies forms and bodily natures and are certain of mentally created abodes and bodiesHere again the same refrain should be applied exactly as beforeAnd also the thusgone ones of the present have gained their complete awakening and gone completely beyond suffering by means of precisely this trainingYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who dwell in solitude while maintaining those qualities of the DharmaThey will not conceptualize the meditative stability of emptinessāradvatīputra do you think that these five acquisitive psychophysical aggregates can train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscienceAnd the parents will suffer as long as that only son does not recover from his sicknessplace any of their wealth or possessions such as cowry shells gold precious stones pearls beryl conchs crystals or coralsand that the Blessed One exempted them alone from the vinaya guidelines he laid down for his disciplesHis clothing is blue and luminous His three eyes are beautifully red and looking upwardAccording to some this service includes providing the saṅgha with drinks According to others it includes fanning themThe tantra of The Arising of Tārā is an ocean of yogic practiceThey should conduct themselves with their minds intent on emptiness and similarly with their minds intent on signlessness and aspirationlessnessThe Blessed One was staying in the Country of the Bhargas on Mount uśumāra in a fearsome forest of wild animals together with a great saṅgha of about  monks eminent śrāvakaelders who possessed clairvoyanceThere is the meditative stability named Supreme SourceHe will empty your city O evil kinsman With your army powerless you will be without an army and without alliesThe Dharma is not a sight a sound a category or an ideaReverend āriputra the Tathāgata has taught the eight liberations You should concentrate on those liberations listening to the Dharma with a mind free of preoccupations with material thingsThe

palms before the Bhagavān bowed and spoke these verses to the BhagavānNoble son those who write out this sixsyllable mahāvidyā are writing out the collection of eightyfour thousand Dharmasor for those who have not themselves emerged from the muck to free others from the mucknanda do you see these two thousand śrāvakas both those in training and those who have passed beyond trainingIt is doing exactly what one has said one will doDivine son so it isThey know if there is deficiency or not in others minds Like looking into a clear pure bowl of sesame oil He was accompanied by his entire retinue by immeasurable countless bodhisattvas and by gods and nāgasnanda the five other transcendent perfections which are acquired through the transcendent perfection of wisdom are dedicated to the

meaning and not insisting on the superficial teachings interpretable in meaningTo beings who are to be trained through omniscience they teach the path of omniscience and not the path of the solitary buddhasThey will listen to the sacred Dharma without any concern for material thingsI acted with such dedication so that This way of the Dharma may be taughtThen filled it to the brim with foodConsider noble son the example of water that is deep and hard to fathomit is always in this sort of way by this sort of path and through this sort of diligenceThough they travel on the vast extensive seaThe Blessed One said Sons of noble family what you have said is trueSelfarisen guides of the world This samādhi you have taught is excellent And I bow down to your feet One could not conclude measuring the lifespan of that bhagavān It will be countless hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eonsSimilarly if they engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty or that these are not emptyAt that time Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra said to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara Avalokiteśvara it is excellent

bodhisattva beings who wish to meditate on the four applications of mindfulness and the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold paththis Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is supreme over all the sūtras taught by all the tathāgatasThe third robe is for when one goes to the villages towns marketplaces and hamletsHe has attained stainless freedom and

buddhahoodEvil one you are lost You are brooding like an old craneMahāpratibhāna then the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna made this resolutionThe Blessed One replied āradvatīputra it is soSimilarly the emptiness of internal phenomena is neither heard nor seen owing to the inanimate nature of phenomenain that way has him clearing away the rubbish heaps for twenty yearsWill you newly ordained monks name delight in living on clothes from a pile of discarded rags for so long as you liveThere will be many who will have to endure harm from royal families Who will

priestly families are dominant in the world the bodhisattva is born into a priestly familyThe aspect of awakening of the complete discernment of the Dharma is a gateway to the light of the DharmaSimilarly the gods of the Brahmākāyika realm and the gods of the Brahmapurohita Brahmapariṣadya Mahābrahmā bhāsvara Parīttābha Apramāṇābha ubhakṛtsna Parīttaśubha Apramāṇaśubha realms and so

sixteen young princes enjoyed delightful captivating and beautiful amusements of many kindsfaith as the mind is free of doubtJust so having empowered the eyessimilarly with their minds intent on the similes of a magical display a mirage the moons reflection in water a dream an optical aberration an echo and a phantomThen the physician thinks again and again as to what method would cure the man of his illnessI will fulfill all their aspirations I will care for themWhat is perpetual application It is seeking for and inquiring about any virtueSamantaprāsādikaEating half himself and giving the other half to the two boys he became pallid emaciated feeble withered thin and weakVenerable nanda what do you thinkIn their bodies no disease will occurwhen he saw between the villages a man afflicted with suffering and seriously illAll the vast worlds Now appeared as one They could be seen as clearly as the palm of a handWith his newfound fearless confidence in the Dharma taught by the Teacher he stood up from his seatwould fold their hands toward this reflection They would scatter flowers and offer perfumes toward it sayingIndeed he is a Dharma king who guides according to the DharmaAs for us whose faculties are deteriorated like a burned and rotten seed what else can we do if we do not become receptive to this Great VehicleThus you who share Vajrapāṇis lineage listen and remember thisthey proclaimed Monk very good very goodLikewise they then achieve and maintain the mind endowed with loving kindness the volition of which permeates a second direction of space and similarly a third a fourth the nadir the zenith the horizon and the entire universeThey remain in that meditation of the absence of attributes And know the emptiness of all phenomena Subhūti the fruit is not attained even when one has cultivated the pathEvil one you are overcome with pride Like an ungrateful ruffianHis body was proportioned like a nyagrodha tree blazing with light and great splendorWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas aspiration to annihilate all demons consist inAt a certain point the householder insulted his son prompting his son to thinkSarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin grasped the dharmabhāṇakas feet tightly and saidSince in this way they are bodies of space No harm is caused to the celestial mansionsthe bodies of those great bodhisattva beings will be purifiedI made offerings to sixty trillion buddhas thereto be tolerant of those who are disrespectful and not to become full of oneself when people are respectful nor arrogant or discouraged when meeting with

passed away from that life then pleased twenty thousand million tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas who were all named BhīṣmagarjitasvararājaThe Bhagavān replied nanda the monk Stainless Light has given rise to the mind set on enlightenment with noble intentSimilarly the two prominent backs of his arms are elegant fine and beautiful to beholdWhen they are free of obscurations and the path is uninterrupted they become utterly pure and the negative tendencies of body speech and mind fall awaythey do not realize the quiescence of all things until they have attained omniscienceThey perceive the mind as being like a dream being like a mirageso we would sooner die and face our death with him than turn him overHowever they do not apply themselves diligently to the relative truthTheir lips are red like the balsam fruitSimilarly they neither associate feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness with the limit of future time nor do they disassociate them therefromThose who rejoice in these bodhisattvas who set their mind on enlightenment will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmenttaking my instruction that he be given a daily wage to induce him to work in my homeThe knowledge of that mode of nature Is the same in the teachings of all the supreme jinas Bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind attain the three doorways to liberationthey are neither conditioned nor are they unconditionedThese are the eight pure mind states that one will attainand having made these offerings they dedicate them saying Through these my roots of virtue may I attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield and may all sentient beings possess divine foods with a hundred flavorsthen that merit would be sufficient for producing a single hair follicle on the body of a thusgone onewhen all things are dreamlike nonentities with nonentity as their essential nature and endowed with the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor endon what basis do you awaken to unexcelled and completely perfect buddhahoodBy practicing the generosity that is free of harming others one will gain stable enjoymentsNoble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are similar to the earthKolita went to Upatiṣya and saidJust as when the emanations of a tathāgata dispense generosityWhat is freedom from dualismSimilarly they should not dwell on the status of one who ranks among the eight kinds of realized individualsIt cannot be conceived of through any attribute and so it is taught to be inconceivableMañjuśrī what do you mean by genuinely abideWhen I heard the words of the rishi I was happy content delighted and overjoyedIf I myself were to proclaim a secret in order to protect the Dharma of the pious and ensure that the Dharma abides for a long timeit has the defining characteristic of being unobstructed with regard to all phenomena causal and fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omnisciencenor does it not come to restSimilarly the other aggregates up to and including consciousness do not disrupt emptinessBodhisattvas know the characteristics of all phenomena to be equalAlthough he is suffering he is treated with an antidote and recoversSaṅgharakṣita washed his feet outside the thatched hut before going back insideWhen he sees me and my retinue He will be powerless but to rise and bow to my feetWhy then do you think wed let you go while youre still alivethen when ākyamuni Buddha was engaged in the career of the bodhisattvaYou have acted in accordance with the worlddespising the aggregates that are Vairocana and so forth He replied This is owing to the nongrasping of all thingsFor the one who understands that This samādhi will not be difficult to attain Well Padmaśrīgarbha it is that bodhisattva great beings never fail to strive for boundless activities Not wishing to attain intellectual knowledge Keeping the mind free from hypocrisyor even cast away all the qualities of a buddhaAlthough one seeks them in the ten directions The words of the Buddha will not be found As it is in the nature of such beings to watch over the world with their buddha eye during the three times of the day and nightThe buddhas do not apprehend the mind In any way everIf a mountain made of vajra were thrown Onto someones head to kill themYoung man how do bodhisattva mahāsattvas obtain the treasure of knowing the past the future and the presentGolden light shone forth and all the lower realms were purifiedFrom the depths to the summit of existence And all of it were given as an offering to the jinas Therefore noble one we ask that you come with us across the oceanThrough this thought of the Dharma There will be a continuity of correct thoughts Kolita thoughtThe demon of the aggregates the demon of the afflictions the demon of the lord of death and the demon of the godthese are the four demons will they be able to vanquishwould be the accomplishment involving the lord painted on canvasTranscendent perfection is calm and peaceful Transcendent perfection is empty of its own defining characteristicshe produced many miraculous manifestationsIt is impossible and out of the question that the thusgone ones could ever err or express themselves in meaningless wayshrough bile phlegm and so forthSon of noble family through this instruction alone will one attain the absorption that encapsulates all meritThey who possess this supreme samādhi Constantly think I will always act in accordance With what the Jinas words have taughtThey have the ten strengths are adorned by the signs And they illuminate all ten directions If you ask why āradvatīputra it is because this union of great bodhisattva beings this union of emptiness is supremeIs there no imputation of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessNever did he seek shelter from the wind the sun and the rainSubhūti in the same way one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the emptiness of internal phenomenawith a staircase to the upper level and perfectly outfitted with beds seats and suppliesAnd make her sit facing oneselfBowing his head at the Blessed Ones feet he said I go with the Blessed Ones guidanceToday he sets out for the supreme magnificent tree to conquer the armies of Mārathey view its dwindling they view its disintegrationOf themselves they cherish not even an atom And are not saddened to give themselves away very beautiful similar to and rivaling divine maidensI shall become a refuge for all beingsIn this way Māyā is a suitable vessel In this way the Holy Being is supremely beautifulThere are also other cases that warrant further exclusionSons of Kutsa sons of Vātsa sons of āṇḍili sons of Bhāradvāja sons of the Five sons of the Further FiveVenerable Lord the world indulges in notions of I and mine saying I identify with physical forms Similarly I identify with feelings I identify with perceptions I identify with formative predispositions I possess formative predispositions I identify with consciousness Similarly I identify with the eyes I possess eyes I identify with the ears I possess ears and so with the nose the tongue the body and the mental facultySimilarly they do not engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness have aspirations or that they are without aspirationsAs sūtras they are collected in the canon of the bodhisattvas stamped with the insignia of the king of incantations and teachingsone should recite one thousand times the mantraThey will also open the gates to immortalityThis will cure headacheThe hair of their heads is untangledThey do not look upon what others have and have not doneis also this same emptiness of inherent existenceBlessed One how does consciousness with its diamondlike essence produce lowly bodiesa quadrillion lifetimes then several billion several tens of billions several trillions and several quadrillions of lifetimesThey will not be too tall they will not be too short nor will they be sallow in complexionThe time to experience the joys of pleasure has arrivedThey were holding flowers

completely awaken to unsurpassable perfectly complete enlightenmentI will soon fall into a great hellthe four supports for miraculous ability the five faculties the five powersHow should they train in the transcendent perfection of toleranceThe one who possesses this samādhi Has practiced homelessness in my teachingthey will strive and apply themselves to further increasing enriching and expanding virtuous factors wherever this has not yet been doneBhagavān we have obtained a priceless great jeweldelivering them from the wilderness of cyclic existenceas many bodhisattva great beings as there are atoms of dust in ten ineffable quintillion buddhafields approached him from all the ten directionsTherefore young man this samādhi of that Dharma teaching should be cherished by bodhisattva mahāsattvasWith various fragrances and flowers All evil is surely vanquishedwhich caused him some consternationDuring all those eons they served ten million buddhas and heard this samādhi from all those tathāgatasOthers will steal from themSimilarly the essential natures of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither profound nor subtleThey bring liberation to fruition Those are the ten aspects and so on in the same vein down to They see sentient beings in the world systems of all the ten directions according to the past deeds they have accumulated andNoble son the wisdom of the thusgone ones is limitless inexhaustible endless and similar to spacenot to be describedAlthough they visit the inconceivable buddha realms by means of their miraculous powers ultimately there is no coming or goingThis city is a manifestation of my miraculous powersnor are physical forms something other than emptinessIf your uncle the famous monk known as reverend nanda is

conditions and bases they will no longer be controlled by those phenomena that make up a bodyDesire is always overcome by repulsiveness Anger is constantly defeated by loveSubhūti one should know that great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom in this manner possess the attribute of not regressing from omniscienceHaving brought forth a mind of lovingkindness He should bathe at dawn in a sanctified locationWith uninterrupted absorption in the formation of diligence he never loses his diligence ThereforeTheir bath is pure aspiration And morality their unguent and perfumeEven your father mother friends and relativesSimilarly the Bodhisattva served  million solitary buddhasHe teaches the Dharma in the form of Vāyu to beings who are to be taught by Vāyuand were amazed astonished and intriguedBy opposing the sacred doctrine they oppose the saṅghaThey know that all phenomena are like space That therefore is what is termed patience Disciplined mindful joyful and without pride To him who is full of qualities you should bow downMañjuśrī naturally occurring bodhicitta is rareIn this way they complete and remain within the fourth

perfection of conductAnd from whom did you learn these rudiments of mantrathe nature of the noble eightfold path is emptiness and that emptiness is indeed the noble eightfold pathSubhūti physical

feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are devoid of a sentient being and yet sentient beings speak of sentient beingsHe lost his alliesThe Blessed One is endowed with closefitting teethhe might go ahead in spite of the fact that it is not possible to build or to adorn a buddhafield in empty spaceTherefore young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish for this

an eye disease or an ear nose tongue or throat diseaseA buddha socalled because of comprehending all dharmas is endowed with the wisdom eye of the noble ones and the body of Dharma and thus perceives the dharmas of those still in training and those beyond trainingThe domain of wishlessness where one voluntarily manifests lives in the world such is the domain of the bodhisattvaIt is for this reason that the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas are described as omniscient masters of all phenomenain all such cases āradvatīputra this craving for the sacred doctrine in the case of great bodhisattva beings indicates their immaturityThis is called knowledge of the origin of sufferingIf they were to think this SubhūtiSince the combination of these three is needed The lower and upper

mental phenomena as permanent or impermanent do not constitute a bodhisattvaAre these sentient beings not already aware of the power of the thusgone onesHis excellent realm will be beautiful Pleasant and attractive for a multitude of beings He will live there as a friend for the world And will liberate quintillions of beingsThis completes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra The Ornament of the Light of Awareness That Enters the Domain of All BuddhasThus bodhisattvas transform all beingsThey teach the Dharma to beings of diverse inclinations by means of their sovereign power and the power of their roots of virtue which consists of various methods insights and states of concentrationThrough these skills in methods they liberate this and that being here and there from attachmentIf you ask what are the seven branches of enlightenmentand their ordination will at some point cause even the kings treasury and stores to dwindle diminishWhile circling within a great mass of suffering they take

the relative levelHis fingers and toes are webbedReverend āriputra he who is interested in the Dharma is not interested even in his own body much less in a chairNoble ones wait a little while because

mindsDelightful to behold it will be decorated with lattices of goldHonored in the world by demigods gods and men Free from birth aging illness and deathThey also perceive those who are beautiful

should be supremely delightedThey carefully engender faith in those Who are of families in Jambudvīpa who have no faithBodhisattva great beings should practice generosity in pursuit of these two

reborn among the hell realms the animal realms or in the World of the Lord of DeathEven wood stone and other objectsTwo measures of one thumb tip to one index fingertip is one cubitand completely fulfills all aspirations he is named Avalokiteśvara Three thousand beings within the circle of Bhagavān ākyamunis assembly attained receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomenaAll ailments and sufferings of those in the hell realms starting with the Hell of Ultimate Torment ceased at that momentHe adorned it with the raiment of the Tuṣita deities and also beautified the groundsThis bhagavān residing inside the stūpa And I who am upon this seatSubhūti all things have a modality that is neither diminished nor enhancedAnd has faith in it for even an instant Will have merit that is limitlessVenerable Lord How do unskilled great bodhisattva beings descend to the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhasand similarly the cessation of desire the cessation of hatred the cessation of delusionThis is called signlessness as a gateway to liberationEnlightenment is the eradication of all marksThey are not patient because of mundane considerations nor out of shameDue to their correct perception their minds were utterly liberated and they had perfected the sacred mastery of all mental statesDivine son on the ultimate level all phenomena are free from superimposition and therefore all phenomena are completely pacifiedThe different parts of the day and night are described asThe Dharma is said by the victorious ones To have twelve formsTheir certainty in understanding and seeing is one of nonseeingWill split into seven pieces Like the blossom of a basil shrubOne who wishes to stop excessive rainfall should obtain a snake from a snake charmerIf you ask why āradvatīputra it is because those who have not been favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and are without skill in means will incur this very outcomeYou should place your trust in this Dharma discourse called Complete Embrace by all Buddhas which praises inconceivable qualitiesLikewise in the west the bhagavān buddhas of the west such as the Tathāgata Amitāyus the Tathāgata Amitaskandha the Tathāgata Amitadhvaja the Tathāgata MahāprabhaO Vasudharā give suchandsuch girl to me Cause her to be given to me Svāhāa bodhisattva great being who has no knowledge is called one who possesses great knowledgethey do not do so out of  violenceThe king greeted him with words of welcome and askedThis way of the buddhas that is always in the worldThat kind of great wisdom Is the inconceivable wisdom of a buddhaNoble son should you wonder question or have doubts regarding the identity of the prince known as Ratnākara at that time there is no needThereupon the venerable āriputra had this thoughtand observe and abide by its utter abandonment his mind in the absence of grasping was freed from defilementsThe gods with garlands in their arms were overjoyed And entered the kings palace which was similar to the god realmSome of them showed off their virgin bodies that had never given birthI should give a gift to that personThe amount of merit that comes from rejoicing On hearing a single verse that has been passed on from one to anotherPractice it What is itWhen donors are giving to others they have no thoughts such as Give to us and not them May this be ours and not anyone elsesand their perception of liberating pristine cognition even though they meditate they will not understand even a fraction of the ethical discipline of the tathāgatasIn the same vein as before how is this transcendent perfection of wisdom instructive because all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are unseenand will appear in the world as the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha the one with perfect wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tames beings the teacher of gods and humans the buddha the bhagavān named PadmavṛṣabhavikrāminIf there is no knowledge of the circle of saṃsāra There can be no knowledge of nirvāṇaSimilarly they should train in the applications of mindfulness and in the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and in the ten powers of the tathāgatas and in the same vein in the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThey do not have evident aging And thus have no suffering or death Because the object of a thusgone one which a bodhisattva must accomplish is inconceivableShe was untroubled by attachment anger or delusionThese phenomena are deceptive hollow insubstantial like a mirage like a reflection like an echo like an illusion transient fluctuating and dependently originatingI will practice the six transcendent perfections until my buddhafield has become one with as many buddhafields are there are in the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River GangesUnsullied always free of the kleśas And lead millions of other beings to be the same his practice is tantamount to his total dedicationLiving on roots fruits and leaves They wear grass mendicants robes and skins Still others wander nakedThose who delight in vast forests Become perfectly happy mendicants Then the blessed Hatred Vajrī tightly embraced Lord Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa and saidtThe strength of ten dominant men is the same as the strength of one incredibly dominant manWhatever your reasoning one is not liberated by perceiving physical forms and all the other aggregates up to and including consciousness as entitiesNoble ones if you do that then you will have repaid the Tathāgatahis body became motionless and his mind became motionlessBlessed One just listening to this Dharma teaching and paying homage to it is already a great miracle and a great wonderThe Bodhisattva told herBlessed One that is how the bodhisattva great beings by means of the unsurpassed wisdom beyond focusand while seated thereFrom this consciousness arise name and formAjita at that time there were two hundred million bodhisattvas among the Bhagavāns followersI am the son of Māyādevī Who has now become Caṇḍaroṣaṇarespect for a virtuous ascetic respect for a brāhminFather Mother it is best you let me goNext they go beyond the sense source of infinite space and instead conceive of infinite consciousnessSenior Subhūti what is the nature of the finality of existence and so forthAvalokiteśvara then manifested in the form of a brahmin and went among the devas in the uddhāvāsa realmsInvestigating impermanence is a gateway to the light of the DharmaMonks once the Bodhisattva had left his home he crossed over the lands of the ākyas the Kroḍyas and the Mallasuntil finally if birth does not arise then aging and death do not manifestI should establish innumerable and countless sentient beings in the transcendent perfection of generosityUpāli his going forth should not be allowednor is there a middleShining he entered the royal capital Like the full moon the king of the stars Likewise Subhūti all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are also without limitsAbout this no noble son or daughter should have any doubts hesitation or reservationsBy the power of the Bodhisattvaan unsurpassable guide who tames beings a teacher of devas and humansAt the time of death it has physical feelingsSome great bodhisattva beings when they practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomDivine son understanding this state of being beyond something to apprehend whatsoever is awakeningRāhu The moon dispels darknessThis queen of incantations Great Upholder of the Secret Mantra will intoxicate all those with hostile intentions ill will

aggregates are empty of inherent existenceIn that casesome at Lake Anavatapta some along gently lapping pondsThey know that the sense pleasures are without substanceIn order to make this offering to the Bhagavān they left the great city of Rājagṛha through the gateway of peaceConsider noble son the analogy of fireThe Tathāgata does not see the three realms in the way that ordinary foolish beings see themYou do not form conceptsThe light then streamed to Gayāśīrṣa where it first circled the mountain then the Blessed One and finally it dissolved into his crown protuberanceThen he will attain awakening the state free from old age and deathFrom the śāla forestAll śrāvakas the sons of the jinas Some of whom stay always at the foot of a tree Thinking That bhikṣu is in that placeIs it permanent or would you say that it is impermanentMañjuśrī replied Ratnavara benefit is differentiated through formationAt that the young brahmin Koṣṭhila desiring and in search of esoteric instruction set off from the Middle Country for the South When my company of wives saw him they were overjoyedand a variety of shopsI beg you best of all humans Look uponAlso Subhūti you said that this vehicle overpowers and attains emancipation from the world with its gods humans and antigodsThey poured down a rain of flaming sparks Shaking the peak of Mount SumeruThere were twelve thousand akras from various foursector universesI felt no anger aggression hatred or confusion The buddhas of the past and of the future And the jinas the supreme men of the presentAnd he sets his mind on perfect and supreme awakeningSimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle too is neither materialwould know that these are sesame these are husked rice these are beans these are kidney beans these are barley these are wheat these are lentils these are unhusked rice these are other grains such as millet and these are mustardThe four subtle demons are naturally Destroyed in the four chakrasWhat will you achieve through this manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas are moist with the qualities of joy faith and delightThey sprinkled mandārava flowers upon the Bhagavān andKolitas childhood friends then went to his parents and saidJust as an excellent pure precious jewel That is free of all impurities shinesThe beings who remember your name Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will have happinessNonbirth is purityThus he will become the great leaderno misunderstanding of the teaching of Dharmagreat loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasHaving attained this stainless samādhi of peace They have no longing for objects of desire no longing for formswould not demonstrate to sentient beings that all things are empty of inherent existenceThis was the ninth chapter on certainty and purity from The Tantra of the Vajra in the UnderworldThe one who has gone beyond the pains of existence You who have gone beyond the afflictionshomage to youSimilarly one should know the eight aspects of liberation and the nine serial steps of meditative absorption to be emptinessWhen he said the letter ṭa out came the statement Severing the round of rebirths vaṭṭopacchedanaThe Dharma is not a societyPlease accept good man this necklace of pearls out of compassion for me and give it to whomsoever you wishIf one were to ask why Venerable Lord it is because that man would be wasted by old age and illnessIn the northeast corner is green Tārā Making a boongranting gesture with her right handFree from the darkness of ignorance he destroys old age death and the afflictions He will become the selfarisen victor famous on earth and in heavenFor you have no intent That would match my merits Māra If you were interested in merit You would rather speak like thisThe strength of ten Kuberas is the same as the strength of one god from the Heaven of the ThirtythreeWhen they investigate

beautiful fine silken clothing Do you not see them my Lord Where will you goFrom the left side Brahmamati saidthe samādhi named Cuckoos SongBimbisāras father enrolled him in the eighteen guilds due to which he was named and became known as Bimbisāra of the GuildsIn the same vein all attributes up to and including enlightenment are nonarising Even the attributes of the buddhas are nonarisingIt neither bestows nor withholds the attributes of those who have entered the streamthose who bestow a mustard seedsize relic of the tathāgatas on others will have much greater meritAs they take such a perspective they will feel abundant sadness and with abundant sadness they will receive ordinationChanda where have you taken the virtuous BodhisattvaThey should always praise abstention from the killing of living creaturesHaving devoted themselves to teaching that sacred doctrinethe inconceivably numerous kinds of engagement concerning the kleśasI remember that countless eons ago In the past there appeared a supreme humanno abidingThey should not abide in feelings that are visually compounded and they should not abide in the other aspects of feelings up to and including feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compoundedIn the eastern direction this light encouraged the bodhisattva the great being Lalitavyūha who resided in the Vimala world in the ThusGone One

introspectivelyIf the reverend saṅgha can allow itAccordingly Subhūti those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas are skilled in meansNoble son a person who pays homage to this Dharma teaching and the words of this dhāraṇī mantraSenior āradvatīputra then asked the Blessed OneHis body is not subject to fear or hesitancyShe then told Tiṣya about her dreamWhoever has discipline also has absorptionThey all declaredSee the exhausted beings as those Who cannot break out through the eggshell of the kleśasand I shall gratify you with answers to each and every question you have askedTogether with my harem of queensHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the emptiness of conditioned phenomenaThe monk replied Who is this lad with you He is my sonThe attendants at

at the mere sight of us peoples hearts burstthe samādhi named LightningHaving digested this mixture one should drink milkneither mindful nor unmindfulThe real nature of all causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasSupreme man your compassion is such That it is a compassion unrivaled By all hearers and conditioned sages In all the infinite worldsMoreover āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings their unconfused minds endowed with omniscience should cultivate the four applications of mindfulness in order to terminate this cultivation and they do so without apprehending anythingshould recognize that sensation is ultimately nonsensationThe hairs on his body stand on end In dismay he yells and screams dreadful cries of distressHe is the one who is honored by the lord of the Brahma realm they expose doubts  they make views accurate  they shun the wrong paths  they are established on the true pathNonperception is

Bamboo Grove outside RājagṛhaTheir gait is that of a mighty elephantHe makes his abode there In a straw hut beside that residencemany hundred thousands of such beings many hundred thousand quintillions of such beingsand similarly that it enhances or diminishes feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessThe bodhisattva great beings magical and miraculous powers in this way are truly boundless inconceivable unparalleled and innumerableThe Bhagavān asked Monk what do you think Are not the dreaming mind and the waking mind nonexistent Stainless Light repliedWho pile up sand So as to create stūpas of the jinasBhagavān just as the bodhisattva mahāsattva the youth Candraprabha attained this samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenathe light shines differently at higher middling and lower degrees causing varied shadesVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is without obsessionIntrinsic entities do not abide in intrinsic entitiesVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is nonarisenEven the tathāgatas do not know it let alone the bodhisattvasThat is how bodhisattva great beings dedicate their generosity toward the perfection of four types of purificationBringing them to full maturation Is the heroes sphere of activityHis mind was serene his sense faculties were restrained his mind was temperate and he had attained the perfection of sublime tranquilityand word spread everywhere that the servant of this householder had gone forth and attained a store of qualitiesThe faculties based on name and form are the six sense sourcesHe engaged all beings equally and possessed an unimpeded analytical capacityThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of action concerning the compositeWithin this gathering the Blessed One was magnificent brilliant and resplendentWhat has already been said for the transcendent perfection of generosity should be fully applied here and also for the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationāradvatīputra the six extrasensory powers are merely conceptualizedwill attain the highest supreme enlightenmentyet equal to the ultimate reality of thingsMay this great earth shake six timesas well as the worlds of gods humans demigods garuḍas and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed OneA selfarisen one establishes beings In that in which he is himself established In that very same buddhahood In the strengths dhyānas liberations and powers nor with the level of the genuinely perfect buddhasMale and female garuḍas will wish to come to them so as to see them pay homage to them honor them and listen to the DharmaA state that cannot be expressed Father through having done bad actions Beings fall into dreadful hellIts members will be reverential with hands together in homage And they will listen to the immaculate DharmaHaving also heard the Dharma from them allFrom everywhere in this trichiliocosm Brahmā akra and many guardians appeared Bowing their heads to the Victorious One they saidand it does not produce excrementyet relatively they endeavor to tame the disturbing emotions of all beingsThen the asura king Bali with tears a darkened face choking with stuttering words and sighs told Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara his storyand in that way through meditation on the doorways to liberationemptiness the absence of attributes and the absence of aspirationthey bring an end to ignoranceJust as one meets ones death in distress Thinking that it is caused by poison Even when there is no poisonAśvajit consider the wanderers Upatiṣya and KolitaSimilarly owing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of the transcendent perfections from the transcendent perfection of generosity up to the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe strength of ten mighty strongmen is the same as the strength of one man of supreme mightTo destroy merchandiseThey create resentment and bring animosity among loved ones They torment everyone intensely like the sun in the skythey respectfully fold their handsyou should dedicate all these making common cause with all sentient beings and without apprehending anything toward the attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentSome after living one lifetime Will in another existence become omniscientDevelop trust and thinkMeanwhile the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thought to himselfMake offerings to stūpas of the sugatas And quickly attain this samādhi It rendered powerful demons powerless and eliminated opposing doctrinesDevoted prostrations to every one of the myriad Three Jewels and to the buddhas and bodhisattvas and their retinues who appear and dwell in the infinite endless worlds of existence of the ten directions and three timesConclusion of the thirtysixth chapter SupuṣpacandraAlas These sentient beings are endowed with noble conduct of body They are endowed with noble conduct of speech and they are endowed with noble conduct of mindHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the aggregates of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessThus they cannot be examined conceived of estimated or measuredIt was the stride of a lionThe Bodhisattva now rested evenly in the absorption known as playful arrayDuring that time there formed a communityyou will gradually attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentlikewise they neither associate it with the limit of future time or present events nor do they disassociate it therefromUnable to endure the strength of his merit A thousand monks became jealous of him  There is the meditative stability named Adamantine  There is the meditative stability named Seal of Entry into All PhenomenaThere is no agitation in enlightenment as it is utterly pure by natureextraordinarySo it is that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom are not attached to physical forms and similarly they are not attached to the other aggregates up to and including consciousnesslike the water of a mirageHe who is attached to anything even to liberation is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in the taint of desireAlas fine Kaṇṭhaka my husbands companion Where did you carry himHe went before the physician and pleadedThen Senior Subhūti addressed Senior āradvatīputra as followsMonks why has the monk nanda become pallid emaciated feeble withered thin and weakthe gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realm who have cultivated the mind of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment will arrive thereThe nature of physical forms is emptiness Emptiness is physical formshe is the One Who Has Attained the Confidence That Results from His Declaration of Realizing All Dharmas without Exception a Confidence That Outshines the Entire World including the Realm of Godsāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death constitute a bodhisattvaSage who accomplishes all aims and is honored in the three worlds we pay homage to youāriputra the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas have reached the perfection of great skill in methodsPadmaśrīgarbha there is one quality that if bodhisattva great beings possess it renders irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening andWhat are those ten They are maintaining pure conduct for a long time being expert about the discipline unimpaired sense faculties extensive learning power freedom from the fears of grasping at a self being like a deer maintaining physical distance aiming for solitude and staying clear of displeasurehave no confidence in his words have no confidence in othersVenerable Lord Through what modes through what indications and through what signsI served many spiritual friends and with weariness toward saṃsāraYou vowed I will be the protector of the world plagued by old age and death Light of the World in times past for many eons you have made this wishMay these seven constellations Renowned world protectors The gods that dwell in the east Fully protect youAn atom a phenomenon is not produced Although explanations use the term atomIt is the level of spiritual practice It is the scope of practice of the bodhisattvasāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousness as nonentitiesThe eye that perceives is outer formNoble ones in the past in a time gone by countless eons ago at that time in that eraAll corporal forms of any kind whatsoever are produced from or caused by the four great elementsThen Brahmā spoke these versesSimilarly they do not make assumptions about the sensory element of the eyesThe sixth sense field of mastery refers to the miraculous perceptual transformation that ensues when one who perceives inner formlessness regards white external forms white colors white appearances and white reflections such as the white form white color white appearance and white reflection of the morning star Venus or excellent white cloth from Vārāṇasī In the same way one who perceives inner formlessness regards white external forms white colors white appearances and white reflections and understands these forms having attained mastery over them and sees them having attained mastery over themSome who are fearless mindful and tamed Are endowed with the wisdom of subtle conductHouseholder why is your house empty Why have you no servantsMaster as

dualityAlways avoid sinful companions Be in the company of good companionsOn the seventh ground bodhisattvas accomplish the qualities of the buddhas and the true mastery of skillful means Thereby they attain the inconceivable bodyāradvatīputra it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena and to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities that physical forms are nonexistentand they will not be captivated by desire hatred delusion or by the mind with its five aspects of concomitance and its afflicted mental statesMoreover

wellproportioned limbs and thinksFrom their bodies many Dharma gates are heardAssemble all the local lords and gather the merchants householders ministers gatekeepers and all the local peopleNo one can comprehend the departure and arrival of the teacherforming an incalculably immense assembly of bodhisattvas were also staying thereThey will become conceited through their arrogant false words But how can there be enlightenment for someone whose conduct has gone astray Monks when the Bodhisattva bathed in the Nairañjanā River and enjoyed a meal his physical strength came back to himIn that time I empower myself And I similarly empower all beingsand all terms are false and deceptive phenomenaThe river Gaṅgā bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating

the flutes lutes reed pipes threestringed lutes bells and cymbals suddenly emitted wonderful music by themselves without being playedThey should not strive in any way toward the Dharma or dissociate themselves from nonDharmaSimilarly it does not enhance feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness nor does it diminish themIt is precisely because they neither know nor see that they come to be styled ordinary peopleYou aśiketu have been a peaceful king with fine teeth Loving and compassionate with a crown jewel shining like the moonThen nanda recited these verses The countless jinas are so wonderfulYou may be able to fill the world with poison And put ablaze the great trichiliocosmYou could soothe many tens of millions of creaturesThe beautiful three folds on our bellieshow do great bodhisattva beings attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment dependent on the transcendent perfection of wisdomIf you ask Subhūti how great bodhisattva beings act as an ally of the worlds in this regardWhy are you collecting them again There is the meditative stability named Seal of the King When I saw this bhikṣu who had perfect conduct And who had kindness like that of a fatherfor those severely tormented by the sickness of afflictions like a medicinal elixirSuch fools think they have grasped the only truthabandoned and let go of my eyesIn fact his hands and feet are prominently webbed unlike those of other human beingsabsence of uncertainty suspicion and doubt with regard to the qualities of the buddhas and the persons who embody such qualitiesThe youth Candraprabha then went down from Vulture Peak Mountainnanda you should remember this Dharma discourse as The Transfer of Consciousness You should also remember it as The Questions of BhadrapālaWhen it is retained this is called pūrakalet alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with many quintillions of bodhisattva followersSimilarly if they engage with the notion that the self exists in feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness or that the self does not exist thereinShould first give rise to the mind of awakening And completely perfect the two accumulationsThe earth element does not think I support the seedIf a bodhisattva has these eight qualities when he transmigrates at death away from the Sahā universe he will go safe and sound to a pure buddhafieldSimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle too is neither darkness nor lightand they may attract by wisdom and the other transcendent perfections those sentient beings who are attracted by ethical discipline who are attracted by tolerance who are attracted by perseverance who are attracted by meditative concentration and who are attracted by wisdombowed down to his feet circumambulated the Bhagavān three times and sat to one sideTherefore this Dharma teaching was named Turning the Wheel of DharmaBlessed One since the blessed buddhas do not smile in the absence of causes and conditions what are the causes for this smile and what are the conditionsthings are not apprehended because other realized beings up to and including genuinely perfect buddhas are nonapprehensiblethat time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana rose into the airIf you ask why Subhūti it is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom precedes all dedications of meritand says to him Hey you have been freed go wherever you want toso great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should dwell with respect to all thingsWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas skill in making others withdraw from objects consist inTo establish all beings in awakeningThe expression all phenomena designates all theseSubhūti when great bodhisattva beings abide in the ineffable transcendent perfection of wisdom and do not apprehend anything that may be arising ceasing afflicted purified or extraneous to that extentEach one of them acquired and possessed four great continents and was the king of themAt this the Blessed One spoke the verses of dependent arisingOnly then should they familiarize themselves with the idea that all phenomena are in essence inexpressible nonarising nonceasing not perceptible and not in the slightest way existingBlessed One I would like to go to that world called EnduranceSimilarly has it not been taught that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will take birth miraculouslyBodhisattvas should be as insatiable as the ocean in their onepointed desire to learnWhat are these tenAnd yet fill the world like a vesselthere fell a great rain of uragasāra sandalwoodWith my hair this long I cannot be a monk So he took his sword cut off his hair and then cast it into the airIt is

guidance of the Blessed Onethey should reflect in the same vein as beforeSubhūti in emptiness past physical forms are nonapprehensibleNo concept of villages and no concept of townsThus the attainment of the tolerance of the birthlessness of things is the entrance into nondualityThis is the medicine for performing enthrallmentThe second dedication prayer isvision knowledge intelligence prudence and insight and a light began to shineMañjughoṣa is present his palms together in homage He has been praised and extolled by all the buddhasWherever this sūtra So eloquently spoken happens to be Whether it be in villages homes or towns Children will not perishWith this thought in mind the companions left the Bodhisattva andjust as when the lineage of medical cure remains unbroken the physician is pleased and rejoicescircumambulated them three times proclaiming the following versesIf it has fallen on the arrow the student will be capable of performing the acts of enthrallmentI would correctly disregard that reason for contradicting me and so on in the same vein as beforeThose who knowing this dispense generosity and so forthAt that point a delightful breeze was feltHe disciplines the bodhisattvas only by means of perfumesand in that way he will satisfy beings with various kinds of Dharma teachingshis going forth should be allowed and he should be ordainedHis speech was uninterrupted captivating and pleasant to hear It was affectionate worthy to be remembered encouraging satisfying and delightfuleach goddess beautiful with the same characteristics as just describedNor does he speak trulyThen he will free them from old age death sickness pain lamentation suffering depression and distress andIgnorance and craving function as causes by having the nature of afflictionsadorned by cords of goldSeeing them he knows These beings because of their previous good actions have little anger and great desire while these have little desire and great anger some have little wisdom some are wise and some are ripened and pure and some hold wrong viewsand in the same vein they apprehend the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and develop a view of them in an apprehending mannerIndeed he set himself at the frontlines and destroyed the enemy hordes of the afflictions with the firm vajra weapon of supreme wisdomWith worldly goods and not through the Dharma They gave many things to the śrāvakas also Elder how many years have you passedAt that point one could hear all sorts of pleasant and cheerful sounds There were sounds that inspired love and made everyone serene There were inviting and refreshing sounds impossible to describe or imitate agreeable sounds that do not produce fearThey give up even their bodies and lives to preserve the sublime teachingsHe was skilled in analyzing phenomenalikewise they do not consider whether feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are with signs or signlessOn top of a lotus a moon and a sunThe strengths the dhyānas and likewise the liberations And numerous millions of samādhisBodhisattva Gaganagañja now came to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and sat before himall of them are transformed exclusively into yellownessIt teaches the sameness of the three times with regard to phenomena and is a gateway to the actual state of all phenomenaHowever Māra the evil one felt jealous and magically raised the edge of the pondSimilarly the real nature of the fruit of entering the stream and the real nature of the TathāgataSo it is Subhūti that this transcendent perfection of wisdom gives rise to the tathāgatas and instructs the worlds of sentient beingsLord in all the towns villages cities kingdoms and palaces wherever this formulation of the Dharma will be practiced upheld and correctly taughtThey are the inconceivably numerous families of wisdom concerning the compositebut afterward gave them all such great carts magnificent cartsThe mediocre are to do likewiseand his bodhisattva saṅgha will consist of six hundred million ordained bodhisattvasNoble son the windlike bodhisattvas similarly blow on the lofty mountains of the merit and wisdom of those sentient beings that have gathered the accumulations throughout many eons thus revealing their powers miracles and great emanationsThis is why you cultivated discipline ethical conduct love compassion and the power of forbearanceThe perfection of concentration is a gateway to the light of the DharmaVimukticandratheir heads flaming with the hair streaming upwardWith the soles of his feet making patterns on the ground The invited Bhagavān entered into the city However Bhagavān those newly following in the Bodhisattvayāna will have doubtsO garuḍa Swan Hey hey Move move SvāhāIn this way they avoid any form of observation of the body and any application of mindfulness to the body and they do not direct their minds to the bodyNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities have received abundant teachingThe days and the nights Pass fruitfully for themMonks this was the circumstance and the reason why the Bodhisattva projected light from his body in the quiet of the nightThe gods in the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River GangesIt is teaching to others through the five higher cognitions the Dharma teachings of the Buddha that are difficult to understandAt this supreme seat you have conquered with love the wicked army of demons Hero today you shall attain awakeningthinking With higher knowledge I should actualize the cessation of suffering that truth of noble beings vision aroseSimilarly the nonarising nonaffliction and nonpurification of the applications of mindfulness are without foundationthey think I have circled in saṃsāra for a hundred years an eon a hundred eons a thousand eonsHe will constantly be giving the teaching Of this way to buddhahood to humans and devasand the devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras rishis garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas kumbhāṇḍas pretas pūtanas humans and nonhumans who have great powerThen akra lord of the gods bowed down with palms joined in the direction of the ThusGone One andPadma and Mahāpadmaand possessed an altruistic mindset of compassion and benevolenceto make others hear a great Dharma teaching and has therefore created such an omenMañjuśrī how does the Thusgone One teach the ultimate truthHowever the precious gemstone that exists among the human beings of Jambudvīpa has few attributesDivine son the ultimate truth transcends everything up through the domain of omniscient wisdom that is endowed with the supreme of all aspectsThey resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that negative and nonvirtuous attributes which have previously arisen might be renouncedthe element of consciousness produces a bodySuch is the bodhisattvas excellent behaviorand they will listen to the sacred teachings from themAt all times they teach the sacred doctrinethat is to say the six transcendent perfectionsto sentient beingsThey also believe that yogurt butter mustard seeds barley magic strings dūrvā grass jewels gold silver and other such items are auspiciousOf all those who see this multitude of buddha emanations That many beings will be brought to supreme enlightenment Based on such excellent absorption they crush and scatter all bodies comprised of existence aggregates elements and sense sourcesThe physical activity of the Blissful One knows no bounds or bordersand what action has caused that rebirthThe arhat elder replied Venerable now is not the time to answer your questionAt this Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara bowed his head to the Bhagavats feet and departedHowever in the entire great trichiliocosm the Bodhisattva did not see anyone like himselfThe buddhas expound skillfulness in methods And they teach different kinds of yānas They also elucidate the single yānaIf you promise to be my slave I will enable you to hear itIt is for that purpose that I was born into this world And I shall teach here the highest enlightenment The one who paints the picture Should have reddish eyes As well as red hands and feet Eyes like those of a bird and the legs of a black antelope It is such a person who shall draw the SavioressI longed for the supreme peace of this samādhi And made many offerings to the guidesThey do not see them as bubbles of waterThe royal palace of King Subāhu who commands an army of brave warriors is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceivedThose who are intent on pratyekabuddhahood And the bhikṣus and likewise bhikṣunīsThe elder monks saidWell then is enlightenment attained by means of a path that is neither cultivated nor not cultivated they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed and unimpeded with respect to the pastBut the bodhisattva should neither destroy the compounded nor rest in the uncompoundedArisen from the gnosis of the syllable hūBecause of the way they afflict and since they afflict beings in the three realms in this way they are called afflictionsThey do not make assumptions about the sense field of sights and they do not make assumptions about the other sense fields starting from there and continuing up to the sense field of mental phenomenaFortyeight fingerwidths can be divided In this way at eight fingerwidths is located the secret chakra The other chakras located within forty fingerwidthsI hail from the Middle Country and I seek to serve at the feet of a masterlikewise they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with formative predispositions consciousness name and form the six sense fields sensory contact sensation craving grasping rebirth process actual birth and aging and deathYoung man it is in that way that an offering is made to the tathāgatasāradvatīputra it is far removed from the psychophysical aggregates the sensory elements and the sense fieldsTheir minds were perfectly free their insight perfectly liberatedBodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind obtain the samādhi that is like a vajraThis is the kind of dream that I have hadSuch is the bodhisattvas commitment to the vows of bodhisattva trainingcraving contributes to grasping grasping contributes to becomingand akra mighty king of the gods then exclusively requested this specific chapter of the transcendent perfection of wisdomand stuff it into the heart of a beeswax effigyThe earth is his seatAnd there is never pride when there are praises This is nature of the teaching that benefits the world What are those ten They are gentle speech a radiant smile without angry frowning speaking meaningfully speaking the Dharma teaching equally not showing off being flawless being unafflicted being free of hostility and possessing a diverse eloquencegreat serpentsTell us Mañjusvara the meaning of this sign And eliminate the doubts of the bodhisattvas What is their verbal purityThere are no more noble sonIt is the sameness of everything from self to liberationThose who wish to enter the great ocean or caves or to make use of the sacred essenceSimilarly they perfect the emptiness of internal phenomenaGrasses medicinal herbs and flowers grew in a timely mannerMonks in this way the Bodhisattva displayed true wonders to the worldly onesThe color of the uraga sandalwood was like the finest blue berylOn the relative level conceptuality is a gateway to disturbing emotionsHence even his reincarnation is like a liberationThe eye faculty when it sees attractive people moves toward themIt has not been revealed so that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness might be grasped or not graspedas the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confidentThe fixed rule is the definitive meaningIt is born of the concentrations the liberations the meditations and the absorptionsBlessed One please teach us that powerful dhāraṇī pleaded the bodhisattvsasThe bodhisattvas light of wisdom similarly pervades everywhere within a hundred leagues or a thousand leagues or one hundred thousand leaguestheir limbs are fleshyfor it leads to the sublime marks and signs to the complete purity of the buddha realms and to the thorough ripening of those sentient beings that are greedyDivine son such is the spiritual community of hearers belonging to the Blessed thusgone worthy perfect Buddha RatnaketuFrom that great bliss itselfWhile living alone in solitude diligent and persevering devoted to his resolveto believe in a self a sentient being a lifeforce or a personYou place in the deathless state those who indulge in the wrong pathWhen they have attained this stainless samādhi of peace They will have no kleśas and be undefiledthe samādhi named Kings PowersNow in verse formAt the time of the five degenerations When lowly people devoted themselves to nonDharmaon the fruitional attributes up to and including omniscienceThe accomplishments that emerge From these six aspects are extraordinary the support for miraculous ability combining the meditative stability of scrutiny with the formative force of exertionMañjuśrī Kumārabhūta descended from the lotus andIn the same way as in this analogy the unconditioned wisdom of the hearers and solitary buddhas who rely on reference points is as insignificant as the drop of butter that was extracted from that very tip of a hair split into one hundredthsWhen he arrived he went to the site created by Maitreya and having arrived there he sat upon the great lion throne that Maitreya had manifestedDivine being such bodhisattvas know all births to be devoid of birth and yet at the same time they know of the death and birth of all beingsthe great being BhadrapālaWhether they do not follow any path or practice the śrāvaka path or the pratyekabuddhas pathBy reciting the mantra continuously one will become unassailable by gods demigods humans and nāgasHe may follow the ways of false wisdom yet having reached the transcendence of wisdom he is expert in all mundane and transcendental sciencesThe arhat novice replied Elders Im busy at the moment Please wait a bit I shall give it to you laterNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with these ten qualities are feltwearersYou have seen the suffering of beings Who take joy in the perception of objectsThey attract by wisdom and so forth those sentient beings who are attracted by ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdomThe area around them is completely adorned by wishfulfilling trees that are divine coral trees hung with divine adornments hung with diadems and earringsand with the great wealth and power of a kingwhich is unchanging nonconceptual nondual and indivisibleThey do not maintain discipline based on the formless realmYou have no abode and no thoughtsOn the first day Karṇapiśācī will give a sign Later she will come and one will attain successSister it is as followsHe has Akṣobhya for his crest jewel He is of blue color and wears a jewel diademRight then the boy Sundarananda arrivedNoble son from being undaunted up to protecting the crops of virtue this is how bodhisattvas areHe thus received the entire recitation of the teaching But at that time he had not grasped the teaching The bodhisattva great beings asked himBecause of this root transgression all the wise ones will strongly criticize them and they will go to the lower realmsāradvatīputra those great bodhisattva beings will realize this transcendent perfection of wisdom in a signless nondual and nonfocussing manner genuinely and methodicallylike a generous personFor example Subhūti when a powerful man trained in archery fires an arrow far into the skyHow long have they practiced the transcendent perfection of generosity and similarly how long have they practiced the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomThey manifest their lives In all the species of the animal kingdom Teaching the Dharma everywhereIt is indeed good that you have thought of asking the Blessed One a question on this subjectThese things that I have told you are but a rough overview of the foundations of your trainingBy such truth and true words as followsdo not apprehend anything that is apprehensible apart from the expanse of reality andTaught according to the desires of the goddesss mindVenerable Lord How is the transcendent perfection of wisdom absolutely pure owing to the absolute purity of spaceOne went to greet him One approached him and held his robe and alms bowlSimilarly you should not have conviction in the transcendent perfection of generosity and you should not have conviction in the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomThey were children of the King of DharmaThe strength of ten men of incredibly supreme might is the same as the strength of one dominant manSince they do not condition anything at allJust as lazy people might think I shall be a physician and yet do not seriously observe the practices of physicians soThrough this arises a lesser bliss If the effort applied is smalland when you have trained therein you will attain the attributes of omniscienceWith wizened bodies long bodies And long hair well adorned With thin feet and necksdie among hell realm beings only to be reborn among spiritsAnd will be famous in all directions as DharmaprabhāsaVenerable Lord when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomFor the sake of this peaceful samādhiDid all of this arrive here in the Sahā world from the world of Sukhāvatī due to the power of the ThusGone One or due to the power of these bodhisattvasowing to the profundity of the limitless and infinite realitynot to mention worshiping the ThusGone One or having faith in this Dharma teachingone should pulverize intestinal worms into a fine powder andSimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle too is neither the maturation of past actionsAnd why Because it is completely pure and free of any stainStarting from the syllable ā One should instantly visualize Black Acalathe transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are not the expanse of realitySimilarly the transcendence of the applications of mindfulness is always without fearAnd if a second person who wishes for meritAll that is composite is known to be the same The entire world is like an illusion a mirage His senses are weak he is crippled and he breathes so heavilyfree of anxiety or apprehension Without any hesitation or wavering he reminded himself of his good motivations Because he had examined the minds of all sentient beings he now knew their thoughtsRecite this sūtra in the presence Of those children of the buddhas whom you seeNoble one if those beings who engage in the conduct of desire pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara they will become free from desireConclusion of the ninth chapter The Patience of the Profound DharmaThose who do not know this way Those who conceptualize are lostHis five hundred sons entered homelessness And also his harem and his daughtersso for him I shall make a speech relating to the Pratyekabuddha VehicleWithout any doubt during the rainy seasonSome arrive in bodies as big as the central mountainand peacocks And flocks of many other birds were heard The songs of parrots partridges and snipes Amazed he went quickly with his disciple And arrived at the gate of Kapilavastu the kings supreme cityIt is the seat of the aids to enlightenment because it eliminates the duality of the compounded and the uncompoundedand in the same vein so long will all those other attributes up to and including the promulgation of the doctrinal wheel emerge in the worldWhile seated among the saṅgha the arhat elder explained the situation at length to his fellow studentbrings utter joy to gods and humans With happy minds they are free of suffering and feel loving and blissfulWhat is having a mind like a mountain It is not abandoning the aspiration to enlightenmentbrahmāsVenerable Lord Just as the phantom emanations of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas do not think The level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas is far from me and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is nearEveryone in the whole world including the gods was amazed and burst into a great buzz and jubilationThe Blessed One spoke Where have you seen thatWhat is that dhāraṇī gateway of the inexhaustible gatewayWonderful dhāraṇīs and sūtras And ten million other sūtrasstill those tathāgatas would not be able to calculate the accumulation of merit from the sixsyllable mahāvidyā they have perfectly peaceful conduct  they maintain perfect selfrestraintSimilarly physical forms are pure and all other phenomena attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are pure owing to the purity of the transcendent perfection of generosityThere is no end to the suffering Of skandhas that are born and die nor do they come or gothey become fixated on all the causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasBy having abandoned those three fetters this individual will be known as one who has entered the streamAre you not a eunuchRemember your previous actions To those beings who are veiled by the darkness of delusion and ignorancethey are moistened by pleasure the man embraces the woman tightly and then emits his passionWho is devoted to his teacher and who is skilledOne should grind it put it in an iron pot And cook it in a lump of vṛddhadāraka doughSimilarly they discern that physical forms are imbued with suffering not a self empty signless lacking aspirations calm void purified nonarising unceasing and nonentitiesMañjuśrī this is because whoever trains in this Dharma discourse trains in the higher training of transcendent awareness      tTherefore I will definitely practice generosity by offering ornaments made of gold jewels pearls beryls conch shells moonstones and coral If a bodhisattva upholds this Dharmait may be known by the wise and by those skilled in subtle investigationWhat is the cause and what is the reason whyWe have no power over himmay contradict this and counterattack sayingand to engender great compassion toward all beingsThe correct efforts and the five powers and strengths That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind that āradvatīputra is the transcendent perfection of generosity possessed by great bodhisattva beingsit is the glorious lord Acala himselfand Green is windThey never develop the mindsets of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasOther beings noble son will develop faith when this teaching on the greatness of the thusgone ones is givenSubhūti innumerable denotes genuinely perfect buddhahood the nature of the tathāgatas selforigination and omnisciencewe will serve the wisest of philosophersSo come run outside and I will give each of you whatever you wantOne should blend the root of country mallow with water and drink itPlease allow him to stay and I will offer him all the provisions he needsMoreover āradvatīputra the spiritual mentors to great bodhisattva beings teach the doctrine so that bodhisattvas might cultivate omniscience andThere are devas and nāgas together with yakṣas and rākṣasas In many billions as numerous as the Ganges sandsIt is a wheel that never reverses and continuously bestows guidance and blessings on sentient beings that are deprived of freedomWhen he saw that the cremation fire of the Tathāgata had gone outHowever this is not the right time and not the occasion to leaveThe tathāgatas have attained parinirvāṇa Yet they liberate all beings through various practices such as zealously venerating relics having stūpas monasteries and images constructed giving up the household life for the sake of going forth as a renunciant and venerating the Saṅgha of monks as well as copying reading and reciting the noble Dharmahe placed the relics of the Tathāgata inside themWhy do I say soSimilarly it indicates to these worlds that the transcendent perfections from the transcendent perfection of generosity up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom are emptyThese are the abodes of the hungry spiritsThe forms the seals and the attributesFurthermore Maitreya if bodhisattvas possess ten qualities they will abandon all evil rebirths and not fall into the clutches of sinful associates but swiftly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaNoble son just as the gold in the Jambu River does not become stained someone who wears the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās on his body will have a body that is not polluted by desire anger or stupidityThis is the fivefold empowermentJust as King uddhodana has been his fatherThey can go anywhere have attained this samādhiand they thoughtone should bathe and while in the waterKnowing the various states of beings He teaches many kinds of accomplishmentsuch as what appearance they had the place where they lived and the cause for that rebirthHe does not go does not stayThose millions of buddhas Recite countless praisesO burn burn Cook cook Torment torment Send the fever send Make them burn do Dry up dry Seize seize Burn burn O Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hū phaṭ SvāhāIn his dream he further sees rivers overflowing And many billions of beings swept awaydeparts for nowhere in which case the Elder Subhūti is indeed the emulator of the TathāgataAll of Lumbinī Grove was sprinkled with droplets of perfumed water and strewn with celestial flowersand unwaveringly attend upon them serve them and venerate themLike the surrounding mountains it was truly elevatedThe anus quiveringThe meaning of tantra is threefoldOf noncessation and nonarisingThe concept of male the concept of female And all other concepts have ceasedand loaded it so that it is full of various merchandiseand similarly those who wish to abandon doubt the sense of moral and ascetic supremacyHis Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eonsWhy is that āriputra it is impossible that a bhikṣu

beings is as followsDiligently training in the instructions without error they adopt the qualities that accord with the DharmaThere are one billion Heavens of the ThirtyThreeEven if you were to die we would fight to keep you with usAnd in the presence of the buddhas They will always roar the lions roarSome are maintaining unimpaired correct conduct That is always as pure as a precious jewelThey will constantly have certainty in dhyāna and liberation Those bodhisattvas will be the sons of the buddhas As Virūḍhaka set out at the head of the four branches of the armed forcesIn time the lad went with a peer to a houseand how demonic forces along with their entourages should be disciplinedThere is nothing whatsoever in the world including the realms of gods and Brahma gods that is similar in color and shape to the jeweled structure that delighted the BodhisattvaThus they are called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha By this truth may there be wellbeing hereBy means of the procedures of

MaitreyaThen Brother āriputra said to the BhagavānVenerable Lord Why is it that those persons who follow the vehicles of the śrāvakas or the pratyekabuddhas cultivate the nature of things that is emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness butthe bodhisattva great beingsHe then thought Just as a thirsty man is freed from thirst When he drinks clear waterSubhūti all things have a modality

teaching of this sūtra O Venerable Lord It is wonderful that great bodhisattva beings have practiced the emptiness of inherent existence with respect to all things andhas crossed the four rivers is wellgrounded in his use of the four foundations of miraculous conductAccording to their dispositions they understand the three vehiclesand even for a single day offers gifts of the sacred doctrine and worldly giftsWhen from the expansive cloud of Dharma the rain of teachings fallsSeeing him there the minister was surprisedTo this day the gods in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree hold an annual Festival

with respect to the wildernessThen he said Upatiṣya join me in a pledgemultistoried buildings that were covered with goldSimilarly they have not trained in the applications of mindfulnessWhat is suffering It is the pain that accompanies birth growing old falling sick and dying It also includes the suffering of meeting the unpleasant and parting from the pleasant Not finding what is being sought is also suffering In short the five perpetuating aggregates are sufferingIf you ask why O child of enlightened heritage it is because omniscience and so forth are without desire and are not an object of desireSentient beings are stingy greedy covetous and avariciousThis āradvatīputra is the natural luminosity of the mind with which great bodhisattva beings are endowedThey will also

emanations from the Tathāgatas own bodythe Blessed One uttered the following verses in order to pass on his Dharma teaching more fullyOne could still not move the Bodhisattva from the seat of awakeningnot praising the Great Vehicle to praise the Hearers Vehicle not praising people who have faith in the Great Vehicle to praise people who have faith in the Hearers VehicleAre the three gateways to liberation also nonconceptualHowever Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata should be known to be nonarisen and nonceasingWhat you may wonder are the bodhisattvas eighteen unique qualitiesThose words will

seen hes so dark The mendicant Gautama has the color of the madgura fish Previously his complexion was so beautiful but now it has all changedA bodhisattvas mother father relative preceptor or master might speak and express themselves in a way that is derogatoryThat is called the emptiness of all thingsMonks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actionsWhat is the basis of this question that Senior āradvatīputra has askedHe bowedthough to the Blessed One onlyand with his palms together at his head sat there with his attention on the Blessed OneThe debarred nāga now disguised as a monk

also Make offerings with the incantatory substancesThe result of your practice of diligence Is that your body is beautiful like Mount MeruWe have never developed a longing For that which we teach to the progeny of the Jina That Dharma that we have taught to those Who are set upon supreme enlightenmentOne should give the target salt mixed with vajra water after incanting it  timesthe inconceivably numerous kinds of pertinent speech concerning teaching the compositeThe eloquence of bodhisattvas is free of delusionAll phenomena depend on the ultimate truthtears sweat adipose tissueBeing the best you shine here in the three worldsIf someone were to make offerings Of forms sounds tastes divine textures And divine perfumes to images of the BuddhaThrough the path of the previous victorious ones you eradicate all illnesses of beingsI should now describe the forms In which they frighten childrenquaked quaked strongly and quaked intenselyand are experiencing the result of those actionsor when the thusgone ones cause someone to hear it that person should immediately write it downTry to escape in a hasty manner You should confront him in such a way That no harm is done to himThat limit of

flowers and fruits Each one of those acquires its own individual namein order to behold and venerate the lord buddhas to develop the roots of virtue and also to bring sentient beings to maturationWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas expertise with regard to flaws consist inIn the past I made abundant offeringsThis concludes The Lifespan of the Tathāgata the fifteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaWho does she belong to The councilor repliedThey should also praise and rejoice in others who investigate the twelve links of dependent origination in their sequential and reverse modalitiesTheir true meaning is the true meaning that is inexpressibleThey do not attain enlightenment as other than formYoung man there are ten benefits for bodhisattva mahāsattvas from engaging in wisdom What are these tenAlas my most noble of men Alas you with excellent marks so stainless and splendidIf someone were a holder of the collection Of eightyfour thousand dharmasOne should visualize oneself as the syllable muḥ Then as it transforms one instantaneously becomes Vāgīśvara the sole hero who like a blazing fire illuminates the entire environmentWere to hear this sūtra just one time That one would obtain a greater wonderYou liberate many beings who are bound in the bondage of saṃsāraWhat is the attainment of mental retention It is teaching correctly and without impediment the Dharma just as it has been seenall things are like the reflection of the moon in water and like a mirrorimageSo would be the case with Yellow Acala and so forthYou would not be able to bend a single hair on his headFor example Subhūti space is neither included within the world system of desire nor is it included within the world system of form nor is it included within the world system of formlessnessI shall go to trade in another landThis body that is seen Beautified by characteristicsbut they will not be fascinated by those smells they will not be intoxicated by themAfter I have passed into final nirvāṇa in any event I shall entrust it to your hands twice or thrice so that not even a single syllable will vanishLike an image of someone who is carrying a vase filled with oil I looked ahead at a distance of six feetAt this the young brahmin Kolitas childhood friends went to him and saidturn toward solitude and depart from homeExcellent Excellent KāśyapaThis samādhi will not be difficult to obtain They are established in the Buddhas teaching The child would be a powerful universal monarch or a buddha supreme in the worldthey teach the perfection of meditationThe bees are humming and the cuckoos singingThe merit of writing down this sūtra correctly Of hearing it venerating it and upholding itSimilarly emptiness is not something other than the remaining sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousness nor are the sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousness something other than emptinessThe sound of celestial cymbals resoundedOne must never abandon a woman wherever one may be After hearing this teaching of the BuddhaThe bodhisattva can transform miraculously all the cries and noisessuperior mediocre and inferior of all living beings of the ten directions into the voice of the Buddha with the words of the Buddha the Dharma and the SaṅghaIndeed abiding on the level of nonduality they acquire as many corporeal forms as will facilitate their appropriate acts for the welfare of sentient beingsThat this sthavira Subhūti my śrāvaka Will in a future time become a buddhaMonks the Bodhisattva saw that Rudraka the son of Rāma was in charge of a group indeed a large groupundemonstrable uncompounded beyond the six sense fields inconceivable unimaginable and ineffable It is indescribable inexpressible and incapable of being illustrated It is unobstructed beyond all references a state of interruption through the path of tranquilityThough Upatiṣya ministered to the master with medicinal roots stalks leaves flowers and fruit the illness would not subsideLord Does this mind that is not the mind existand in the dress in which he arrived in the Blessed Ones presence returned homeYou should teach this sūtra directly To those who are diligent and always kind Who for a long time have meditated on kindness And who have no concern for body or lifeIf upon uttering these verses of the Buddha The moon were not releasedWhen he said the letter ga out came the statement Immersion in the profound Dharma of dependent origination gambhīradharmapratītyasamutpādāvatārato have comprehension of causesAll these children they do not listen to me Because their minds are fixated upon pleasuresAnd these existences were sinfulIf we rely on firmness and correct action victory will be oursThere are others who have been born hereHer thighs and calves are like the trunk of an elephantThe Indian preceptor rīlendrabodhipreviously in times past an inconceivable number of eons ago an endless number of eons ago at a time stretching further back than any number of eons a number of eons so great that the number of atoms found in  worldsall the limitless and inconceivable number of such atomswould not equal the number of eons there was a world called Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of HappinessSimilarly the transcendent perfection of generosity is nonapprehensible owing to its utter purityClad in the armor of Dharma They sat on fine thronesIf you ask why it is because all things have the modality of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness great bodhisattva beings too do not transgress this modalitythe lifespan was forty thousand yearsHe may follow the ways of the poor yet he holds in his hand a jewel of inexhaustible wealthThey do not hope to benefit from itHe has great compassion He has an untiring mind He wishes to benefit He is compassionateLikewise concisely they declare which teachings pertain to the grounds transcendences absorptions knowledges masteries retentions superknowledges liberations powers fearlessnesses correct understandings and the unique qualitiesSome looked at the Bodhisattva through halfclosed eyes and then quickly closed their eyesIn this analogy the mirror corresponds to the parents coming togetherThis is the perfection of skillful meansjust as it does with the various limbs and body parts of sentient beingsJust like the poor man who obtained wealth We are astonished that suddenly todayThey understand happiness to be like a dream And similarly impermanent empty and transientI did not have any stinginess for even a moment Throughout myriad existences I had no envythirtysix hells one hundred and twenty sensesIf someone writes out a sūtra like this In the dreadful future times When I have passed into nirvāṇaNoble one if they call out to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara when they are swept away by rivers those rivers will bring them to shallow watersThose wise ones will see everything From as far down as the Avīci hellsaying what is meaningful is the teaching of the truthStartled with fear and terror he fled in the ten directionsI then went forth into the perfectly awakened and blessed Buddha Kāśyapas teachings andPāpīyān you also appropriate karmic actionMonk as all phenomena are void they are unobscuredConclusion of the thirtyeighth chapter Yaśaḥprabha Chapter  Restraint of the Body Speech and Mind When attaining illumination within the world they are free from evilProficiency is the meaning of perfection They speak first  Their face is without frowns of angerThey also do not observe any outer marks nor do they apply mindfulness to or direct their minds toward any outer marksVictor best among the twofootedThose who teach it are also worthy of reverence and worshipHe had an excellent form and was handsome He came into the presence of that jina Similarly I say that they will purify the negativity of speech and mindand out of sightAnd will be renowned in the worlds in the ten directionsthose with excellent intent to those accepted by spiritual teachers to those of good characterWith a mind not attached to any object And with compassion and love for sentient beingsIn order to have food and clothes he travels in every direction in many other landsThat guide Amitāyus Is seated upon a lion throne On the center of a delightful stainless lotus And he is as beautiful as a sal treeGive me the opportunity of the Dharma Give me the pure body of perfectly established forms Give me a good reputation so that all beings say He has gained unwavering goodnessBy opposing the genuine view concerning the world they oppose the four applications of mindfulnessOnce as they were boiling medicinal herbs the monks spoke offensively to themand not a nonassemblageThey will not be poor And they maintain correct conduct I am going to go to the terrible Avīci hell And I have no protector who can save me from thatIn each of the mansions appeared  censers of incenseNor do aging and death think I am produced by birthHowever emptiness does not exist elsewhere apart from the impermanence of physical forms Nor does the impermanence of physical forms exist elsewhere apart from emptinessThere is no possibility for them to actualize the karma of falling into cyclic existence with its five classes of living beings by assuming any rebirth or actualizing any karmaThen the youth Candraprabha arrived together with a hundred thousand quintillion beingsSameness is the meaningThe bodhisattvas embrace it It is praised by all the buddhas It is indivisible from all the thusgone onesConsider noble son the analogy of the god Candras bodyOne should therefore focus ones mind On the pleasure arising from desireTo stop the target from moving aboutIt is owing to this transcendent perfection of wisdom that the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas are distinguished and similarly that the bodhisattvas the pratyekabuddhas the arhats andFree from all afflictionsand the expanse of reality is itself physical formsHaving permeated all directions with light they cause the world systems of the great trichiliocosm to shake to shake more intensely and to shake with utmost intensity and in six waysHe has true qualities a great ocean of qualities One should pay homage to Avalokiteśvaratheir view of the applications of mindfulnessYou must neigh now because here comes the supreme charioteer of beingsSimilarly they should not dwell on the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are permanent nor should they dwell on the notions that they are impermanentthe method of teachingHis eloquence is inexorable and no one can resist his imperturbable intellectThrough the merit of praising you O Victorious One replete with the resplendence of merit May we all immediately become like you O Moon among MenHaving reduced the bhikṣu to pieces I am at the furthest distance from buddhahood Brother Pilindavatsa Brother BakkulaThey are extraordinary humans They are stainless humansAnalyze the four applications of mindfulness The thorough relinquishments the bases of miraculous power The five faculties the five powers and the branches of awakening Such were the words that emerged from the instrumentsIf pratyekabuddhas who are without defilements Have sharp faculties and are in their last bodiesIn terms of the body when they walk they think May all beings walk with the gait of a great beingas pleasing to the eye as a finely drawn picturethe inconceivably numerous words of innumerability concerning the kleśasThose who pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and possess his name will obtain fruitful resultsThese consist of moral conduct and faith generosity and wealth and diligence and meditative absorptionThey who possess this supreme samādhi Have pure conduct and untroubled mindsUsing the method as previously describedThrough the magical power of the Buddhas teachings they gain swift superknowledgeand the rest of the one thousand two hundred Brahmakāyika devasThe trichiliocosm with all its animate and inanimate contents shookSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent power of meritIn the same way that fire is produced through a friction base a rubbing stick and human effortSo now please look upon those beings who are without a protector and turn the supreme wheelAs soon as he laid eyes on the Blessed One he felt pleased delighted and overjoyed In this state he touched the Blessed Ones feet circled him and then sat off to one sideAnd are mindful fearless and endowed with wisdom Have trained excellently for billions of eonsThey joined their palms together And reflected on the Bodhisattvas departureHe rid the land of brigands thieves famine and illness and brought a wealth of rice sugar cane cattle and buffaloand where exactly these defilements vanish and disappear without leaving any residueWhy say more about its other virtuesProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha King Whose Fragrance Is That of a Blossoming UtpalaHe then brought about the cessation of thoughts and analysisthe samādhi named Teaching the Six PerfectionsThey meditate on the path to enlightenment That has been taught by all the buddhasO Vasudharā svāhā O rīvasu svāhā O Vasuśrī svāhā O Vasumukhī svāhā O Vasumatiśrī svāhāThere are remedies for poison but there are no remedies for using the property of the saṅghaNevertheless the pervasive power and beauty of the polished jewel is absent in the unpolished jewelwho have no faith in the thusgone ones and lack insightO maṇipadme hūThere is no opportunity for aspirationlessness to impinge upon aspirationlessnessThose who know that supreme essence know liberationYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of sūtras What are the four kinds of sūtrasMañjuśrī what is an irreversible bodhisattvaWhy Because the bodhisattva Maitreya was the bodhisattva Liberator from Fear at that timeWhen their bodies have disintegrated such beings will take birth in the realms of hellI always have that kind of blessing Throughout countless billions of eonsSo they wonderembraces the ten paths of unwholesome action and engages in themA bodhisattvas retinue practices in accord with the bodhisattvaWhose are these feelingsgreat bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdomSeeing the ThusGone One approaching he came up to him and stood to one sideIt is through an appropriating cause that it is perceivedFurthermore āriputra the sentient beings born in this buddha realm are all pure bodhisattvas who will not regress and are bound by only one more birthHis torso is like that of a lionsome are made of silverAscertaining the basic virtuesThe Blessed One replied to Senior Subhūti as followsHowever because of these conditions it is termed soundI climbed to a mountain peak I moved through the sky aboveSimilarly they may experience themselves as visible and as invisibleSupreme doctor you put an end to birth decay sickness and death Immeasurable ocean of virtue we bow to youThey create billions of monasteries Made from jewels and likewise sandalwoodwho have abandoned jealousy and greedHe is the one with the ten powersAfter the Bhagavān had thus spoken the bhikṣus rejoiced and praised the Bhagavāns wordsEnlightenment is unconstructed because it is neither born nor destroyed neither abides nor undergoes any transformationFirst one should do ten thousand recitations of the mantra without the name as the preliminary practicetrees of fine fabricsWhat is the level of spiritual practice It is meditation on the qualities of the thirtyseven aspects of enlightenmentNo Blessed One Blessed One it is only when he himself goes there and enters the water that his heat and thirst will vanishIn this regard inconspicuous ankle bones means that he is well endowed with broad heels and thatand then saturating it with the water element will cause the sprout to be producedSpread his oral instructions or bandy them aboutWhat Will we be offered tributeI too should observe and abide by the abandonment of such phenomena and should observe freedom from desireHaving made great effort and being well established in virtue he soon produced the five superknowledges understood the incantations and obtained invincible eloquenceSome arrive like the guardians of the four directions Surrounded by gandharvas rākṣasas and kiṃnarasHence this is not a worthy place for the Bodhisattva to take birthNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña in that same way this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is supreme over all the sūtras taught by the tathāgatasThe palace temples gateways and doorways were decorated with tassels of jewels and gemsThey induce the unmistaken understanding of the Dharma in its ultimate senseThere were very few worthy recipients in Jambudvīpa And there were present many who were without selfcontrol If you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of these sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousnessThe novices thought It would seem we are too late and left dispirited with expressions of resignationThey should focus on the Dharma and give up all valuablesthe young man Candraprabha asked the BhagavānThey are nonentities They are the emptiness of inherent existenceWhen in a state of meditation There is no pride concerning any phenomenonThose who remember the name that is the sixsyllable vidyāmantra will be reborn in those poresMaitreya and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the excellent eonSister it is as follows an artist or an artists apprentice spreads various paints on a canvas that has been thoroughly cleaned He who for countless eons was always diligent Confidently meditated on the four dhyānasWhen you see wise people who are worthy vessels Bring them to the aspiration for enlightenmentAlong these walkways there are beautiful wishfulfilling trees that have red trunks and leaves made of silver and gold are adorned with divine adornmentsThose who have that kind of conduct Will neither hear me nor see mehe said to his parentsBhikṣus you are close to the wisdom of the Tathāgata Look and seeare strewn with scattered flowersThe Bhagavān said to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamīand think Even at the cost of my life I will never drink liquor again In this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom acquire the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineAfter his encounter with the group of six the shapeshifting nāga fled to the seashoreand similarly do you think that sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena constitute a bodhisattvaEach of those precious trees was five hundred yojanas high with branches leaves and petals in succession at their extremitiesThat being so what need is there to mention those who after abandoning jokes amusement pleasure and gamesAn endless rain of the Dharma will fall Which will please those who are established in the cause of enlightenment Sujātā fills a golden bowl with food and offers it to the Mindful Onein the same vein that the designations of the remaining links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death do not constitute a bodhisattvaNo Blessed One they will nottaking them across the ocean of cyclic existenceThe gods of the Heaven Free from Strife the Heaven of Joy and the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations And the gods of the Heaven of Making Use of Others Emanations all cameSimilarly when they engage in union with emptiness of suffering they are said to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdomgreat loving kindness great compassionāradvatīputra the four correct exertions are merely conceptualizedThus they embrace such beings with compassionthe Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and addressed me as followsMañjuśrī in the same way that from that great Dharma drumAlas this world will be plunged into the great darkness of ignoranceso should you view the hearers and solitary buddhas who rely on reference points and their attainment of the unconditionedHaving crossed over you liberate others Homage to you the BlissGone One Who Liberatesnd will never be separated from the six transcendent perfections until they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenmentoffering praiseSubhūti great bodhisattva beings are endowed with skill in means whereby they may take birth in the animal realms and mingle with assassinsThey were fearful and horrifyingSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom correctly perceive physical formsthrough which I will quickly achieve the highest complete enlightenment and be a samyaksaṃbuddhaIt is nonseeing aloneAvalokiteśvara if any one of the kings ministers bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas upāsikās brāhmaṇas kṣatriyas vaiśyas or śūdrasFreed from existence and nonexistenceDivine son ultimately they have the utterly unborn natureInside this beautiful palace the Bodhisattva woke up to the sound of conches kettledrums clay drums wood drums lutes harps tambourines cymbals and flutes that produced the most sweetsounding and melodious tunes to accompany their many sweet songsThe unproduced is the basisAt all times they are in the possession of strength There is no one who is their equal in the world It is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who seek to attain emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should cultivate these sacred doctrines and do so without apprehending anythingThen young man King Mahābala accompanied by eighty thousand brahmins and laypeopleNeither are they swayed by thoughts of anger dullness fury and ill will envy and stinginess pride the wish for fame the wish for mundane attainments nor the wish for wealth and honorI have renounced any thievish thoughts and given up attachment and arrogancethey were skilled in the knowledge of remaining in all bodhisattva samādhis and samāpattisSuch is the body of the Tathāgata and thus should he be seenSpace contains the earthāriputra when there is that turmoil of the degeneration of the era many defilements and beings have craving and few roots of meritnor not wisdomSupremely powerful one I am worn out by suffering I am destituteThrough your training in concentration and knowledge your time has comeInto the world of the living Chronically troubled with the disease of afflictions You have come O King of Physicians To cure the world of all illnessesWe see him they answeredThe Blessed One then addressed those great śrāvakas and those great bodhisattva beings as followsMay their purposethe goal for which they are practiced Be accomplishedThey are liberated from the three realms And they have no aspiration for them Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who train accordingly will never be born among the longlived godsVenerable Lord what are all those things on which great bodhisattva beings should not be fixatedYou will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handoutsit was freedom from desires their cessation their pacificationthey could apply the medicine of the Dharma appropriatelyMañjuśrī imagine that a bodhisattva great being were to fill the great trichiliocosm with seven precious substances andBodhisattva Nārāyaṇa then repliedWithin that space there are the terrible hells The horrible Tāpana and PratāpanaWhoever wants to accomplish my state of being should arrange great offerings in the three timesHas four arms and four facesIs it real or should we call it unrealIf there is no such thing as deliverance at all then what purpose would it serve to train on the pathVenerable Lord it is because space is unconditioned Therefore it is not endowed with any defining characteristic whatsoever nor is it thus endowedAt the end of the month one should offer extensive worship and recite for the entire nightThe entire land of the underground nāgas was filled with the horrible sound hūṃThen moreover the certainty of recitation Will be taught nowWhat troubles you young brahminsTheir lack of conditioned existence is boundlessTwelve finger joints is one thumb tip to one index fingertipAll the trees and the best of mountains All prostrate to the seat of awakeningthe samādhi named Carriage of Victorythat some have completed all tasks and pass completely beyond sufferingThis Subhūti is indeed the wonderful and marvelous doctrine of great bodhisattva beingslike the pregnancy of a barren womanAfter the son had appealed to the monk to serve in all of these capacitiesthen said to the BhagavānHere in the world they fearlessly behold Those who are masters to be servedShe was also surrounded by  women from King uddhodanas retinue who sang songs and played music bells and cymbalsamong the pretas the beings in the Avīci hell the beings in Kālasūtra and Raurava the beings in Hāhava Tāpana the great hell Pretāyana the great hell Agnighaṭa the great hell ālmali the great hell ītodaka and otherslike a third rebirth of a oncereturnerThen some go to their walkwaysWhoevers name is included in the mantra that person will become enthralledBodhisattvas should be easy to be with and gentleTo Bhaiṣajyarāja you offered a precious parasol and a throne to SiṃhaketuWill have a mind that is radiant And without attachment to namesandform Like the sphere of space you are without attachmentPreceptor I am unwellSuch is their physical puritySo it is Subhūti that when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom in that mannerwhereupon all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas will be overwhelmedEven the names of the immeasurable aspirations do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twobodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish to teach this Dharma teaching will be established in happinessAt that time the Bodhisattva with unhindered higher knowledge which he manifested due to the ripening of previous roots of virtueThere are others who practice living like an ox a deer a dog a pig a monkey or an elephantA tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world in order to reveal to beings the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomThe bodhisattva great beings askedThe bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa then asked Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūtaāriputra the gods of the Trayastriṃśa heaven all take their food from a single precious vesselvetā Fair One Mahāśvetā Great Fair One vetabhujā She Who Has Fair ArmsThe bodhisattvas who know The emptiness of phenomenananda I adhered to the qualities of meditation and so I quickly realized supreme perfect enlightenment and became a buddhaAnd through hundreds of causes and parables And in those ways I will please beings and was filled with a great multitude of human beingsWithin the Sugatas teaching we are without knowledge We were content with nirvāṇa aloneYou should confess once again all these errorsExcellent Blessed One said the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin and he listened as instructedSubhūti the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely pure because just like the resonance of the echo of an echo in space Subhūti space cannot be conventionally designatedThese emanations are the domain of omniscient wisdomHundredpetaled lotuses in full bloom arose in a flood of lightRight then billions of overjoyed gods spoke to ChandaAre praised by all the tathāgatas Extolled by the chiefs among humansand erect the forty kinds of right interestbecause they would not have trained in the six transcendent perfections and the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasRegarding this it is saidAnd from then on perfectly maintained correct conduct That was unimpaired pure unsullied and stainless let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with a thousand bodhisattva followersIt portends that after twice eight years he will have studied the Aindra school of grammar and will vanquish all opponentsDecorate them with beautiful flowers and use the best incense and perfume Adorn them with parasols banners and rows of palms treesand when they are absorbed in empathetic joy they also focus on all sentient beings thinking I should liberate all sentient beingsHow should they cultivate the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathHe benefited many millions of beings And afterward attained nirvāṇa like an extinguished flame cannot set out on a road or enter a hamlet town city or country without a guideThe cold season lasts four months springtime lasts four monthsAt once honest straightforward and free of guile his mind was invincible Free of pride conceit arrogance fear and timidity he was impartial toward all beingsBut Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to themthe cure for the illnesses of sentient beings was comprehendedunsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment never exists and is nonapprehensible This being the case how could they possibly come or goWith that he said A monk should not teach without first having been asked to do soones wishes will become fulfilled within six monthstThe seed phrase supreme a teaches how all phenomena are primordially nonoriginating   tTheir meanings teachings definitions and eloquence are all perfect and they have achieved true discerning knowledgeWith the greatest and most perfect inspirations they immediately proceed to attain the first ground by means of the intrinsic nature of their practiceone should write this mantra on a rag from a cemeteryLike mud plaster applied during the rains Or the sandy banks of the river They depend on conditions and have a feeble natureSaying this that person will be unhappy and depressedclouds that rained down divine garmentsand if you need it ask for it and I will give to youSon is he wiser than you Father he is not wiser than I It is rather that he is wealthierThere will be no returning or meeting again Just as fruits or leaves taken by the river never meet the tree againThey who desiring liberation possess this stainless samādhi Are admired by a hundred thousand devasThey have pure conduct conduct that is not impaired conduct that is free of faults conduct that is unshakableunderstanding all the sicknesses of passionsThe gods come to see me The nāgas yakṣas garuḍas gandharvas kinarasThen noble ones the two boys descended from the sky and went to where their birth mother wasBlissful One it is truly amazingSubhūti do you think that the real nature of the four applications of mindfulness and in the same vein the real nature of all other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas can be terminated or abandoned or does it ceasewe shall not harbor any attachment or craving with regard to the bodyA glorious mentally created mansion That is made of jewelstransforming it into a heap of ashSimilarly the purity of phenomena is profound due to the absolute purity of the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomThere is the meditative stability named Dispersalsolitary buddhasWithout any such observation bodhisattvas experience unobscured freedom and hence they can also act as akra Brahmā guardians of the world and so onthey perfect the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline which is without defining characteristicsnondegenerate faultless uncontaminated unsullied free from dogmatic assumptions abundant in splendor praised by the learned utterly perfect excellently adopted included in the sublime path free from contaminants and supramundanethe term internal phenomena comprisesBlessed One if this Dharma teaching should spread among beings of inferior meritAfter abandoning these five formless absorptions this individual is said to become an arhat Today I have understood the words of the Sage The desires of beings are harmful murderers One should not take up with a nonvirtuous friend even in dreamsTheir speech is pervasive in conformity with their assembly but it does not extend outside their assemblythe Sarvasārasaṃgrahaṇī script or the Sarvabhūtarutagrahaṇī scriptāradvatīputra bodhisattvas who train accordingly do not train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom andBhagavān it is likewise that the Tathāgata has previously taught the practice of bodhisattva conduct and the aspiration for omniscience butYoung man you should train by thinking I will engage in completely pure conduct of speech in that wayas liberated from existenceBodhisattvas should be gentle and welcoming to visitorsWhat you may ask is faithSimilarly consciousness and all the other aggregates are neither fettered nor liberated because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonexistentAccording to the practice of the completion stageThe grass was green soft and tender and as pleasing to the touch as silk wool cotton raw silk kācilindika cloth and linenThose connected with the wisdomgnosis initiation Have in common what was taught aboveKauṇḍinyagotra this śrāvaka of mine Will become a tathāgata a lord of the worldThat which exists is taught As this nonexistence of all that existsThen she will dripThe one who knows emptiness And that phenomena are without selfThey do not consider whether feelings are connected with perceptionsConclusion of the twentysecond chapter The Teaching on the BodyNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with these ten qualities are beings who wear refuse ragsdo not instinctively maintain the five obscurationshis going forth should be allowed and he should be ordainedWhat is turning away from conceptualization It is the rejection of errorYou will be venerating the buddhas With their thirtytwo major markswithout comparisonVenerable Lord How are the bodies of those who will be reborn in the inferior realms having defamed the sacred doctrine andEliminating only their own afflictions is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the other aggregates up to and including consciousness are nonentitiesOne should pulverize the root of cowitch together with goats urinerather than someone who fails to ripen othersbefore whom devas nāgas yakṣas mahoragas and humans had gatheredThen the Bhagavān taught the Dharma to the great assembly that was like an oceanlike the core of a plantain treethey see the Tathāgata as low middling or highThere are countless drops of water And it is the same for atoms Unable to open ones eyes One lies with face avertedO Amaraṇī Svāhā to JīvantīRecite  mantrasThen in order to establish the bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas and upāsikās who had gathered in that assembly in this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaRubbing this on ones feetThis group called out to the Bodhisattva and the five ascetic companions and invited them to sit down and participate in the feastThey had all attained unimpeded retention and absorptionMay the gods send rain And may the crops be excellentNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñaTo fulfill the six transcendences he does not rest in the uncompoundedthe sense field of infinite space has been completely transcended in all respectsDivine son when a bodhisattva great being without engendering has engendered the mindset that thinks I will fully understand all phenomena by means of momentary knowledge he will not rest under any circumstancesThrough the essential nature of giving they understand the essential nature of the limit of realityat that time he recited this verse to his parentsThen Brother Mahākāśyapa asked the BhagavānYes The eminent sages speak eloquently and truthfully The boy will surely leave home for the sake of awakeningHer waist is curved like a bow and her hips are ampleThe delightful divine music continued until the time of the great nirvāṇa of the BhagavānWhat is the completion Of the thirtysevenNot grasping at the nose andThe Bodhisattva also saw the four guardians of the world together with hordes of yakṣas demons gandharvas and nāgas They all wore solid

and serve the Buddha and to hear the Dharma from his own mouthOf the true bodhisattvasIt is that the nature of phenomena cannot be taken away from or added tothink I shall liberate all beings from sufferingthe devas threw down a great rain of flowers hundreds of thousands of divine musical instruments were played up in the skySubhūti when great bodhisattva beings dispense their giftsVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom offers protection to those who lack protection because it bestows all that is preciousPlaying a hundred thousand musical instruments and drums Came and made offerings there to the Lord of the World He is the single hero of the trichiliocosmIf you ask what is the understanding of omniscience it is the knowledge that the tathāgatas have without hesitation with regard to all things in all their aspects throughout all the three times That is called omniscienceThey the selfarisen ones will see that and no other being That is what these purified bodies will be likeWhen you practiced the sublime conduct There were no jewels or wealth that you did not give away Then after that bodhisattva passed away He pleased thousands of millions of buddhasThis great shower of flowers filled the whole great trichiliocosm to knee heightwould it involve some difficulty for that person to do soOf the equal accessibility of the Dharma teachings free of defilements I will not be teaching in future times That which is the highest Dharma in the three realms That precious structure that delighted the Bodhisattva was like a diamondsolid firm and

Others Emanations are inferior in comparison to themThey were astonished and amazed They asked their own tathāgatasThey will obtain perfect excellent Dharma robes Bedding invitations and hard and soft foodWe shall always speak truthfully And give up all liesThey should be expected to become a revealer of the sacred doctrine or some other revealer one who is worthy of veneration or one who is renunciate in conductThe strength of ten Nārāyaṇas is the same as the strength of one great NārāyaṇaHe thought This bodhisattva mahāsattva has attained great higher cognitionIt is not new and it is not old There is nothing to be proud ofThe merchant caravan was terrified Those who are freed from fear do not become frightened As there is no fear there is no instabilityeats of physical strength and wrestling demonstrating his superiority to all other beings in these areasYou may wonder noble son how bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to objectsone born into a royal family will obtain the kingdomSon of noble family in order to attain these two things should bodhisattvas practice generosityCuckoos swans and peacocks call out and flocks of birds fill the airThey say I have cut myself off from the Buddhayāna this is my last existence my nirvāṇaBodhisattva Maitreya askedBut if I go to the king of trees in order to awaken to omniscience under its branches While I am this emaciated that would not be kind toward beings in the futureKnowing their strengths and their diligence And through knowing their aspirations Third is the form of lightningAt that time the Bodhisattva who was aware of their arrival extended his right hand and pointed out their seatsAnd as well as having that indefatigable mind through the pristine awareness that does not rely on anything else to awaken quickly to supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaThe first assembly of his students Numbered eight hundred millionand the application of what has yet to comeThere is no duality between what constitutes the element of earth internally and what constitutes the earth element externally it should not be dualizedSo if bodhisattvas characterize something or habituate themselves to characteristics they disappoint the thusgone onesAll words are the Buddhas words As all words have no substanceWhere are all your past bodies and names now All things perish by nature there is no permanence in conditioned thingsThey will not turn back from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentnot over there not hereThe wind element opens the seedThe result will be exactly the sameThen the Lord knowing my thoughts Taught me nirvāṇa to free me from those views Have you not worked to harm the king Have you worked to harm the king or enlisted others to do soMeasuring two leagues in height And one in circumference It is majestic like Mount SumeruWhat need then to mention worldly gods The celebrated iva and so forthlet alone those who maintain it and read itGreat King Prince Sarvārthasiddha has even and wellplaced feetWhat merits enable one to accomplish the thusgone ones marks of one hundred meritsSimilarly they do not engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness cease or that they are unceasingthe purity of phenomena is illuminating due to the absolute purity of all attainments up to and including omniscienceWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas blazing diligence consist inYou may wonder noble son why this is soand the poor man thinks of the householder as being his fatherOne should place the soles of her feet On ones eyes ears and headadditionally retain and are attentive to them in the prescribed manner butTo those who are householders or renunciants And those who are not bodhisattvas in the later ageNoble one in the past in a time gone byAll the beings that are in those realms From Avīci up to the highest existenceBhagavān we too are resolved to teach this Dharma teaching and will do so in other world realmsfor twelve eons were provided with robes food bowls bedding seats necessary medicine and utensils they would still not be able to calculate the merit that comes from even one fourline verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets Display So it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by myself in TamondhakāraSince they possess noble qualities they will not fall destituteand provides visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they needWhen they stand up red lumps of their flesh will fall onto the ground and their bones will be exposedall phenomena have no existence have no essenceApproaching the Blessed One they prostrated with their heads toward the feet of the Blessed One and stood to one sideThe body of a tathāgata is born of the stores of merit and wisdom It is born of morality of concentration of wisdom of the liberations and of the knowledge and vision of liberationconsequently do bodhisattvas not consider all these things to be distinctHe enthusiastically engaged in all the activities of the bodhisattvas strived for the benefit and happiness of all beings and taught the DharmaOwing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of the other fruitional states up to and including omniscienceWhat are those ten They are possession of insight being accepted by

and they do not treat it as capitalSo Maudgalyāyana go and fetch itThey always have gratitude toward the buddhas They do not forsake the Dharma even for the sake of their lifeThey will not acquire anything that is inauthenticThere are vicious poisonous snakes With virulent great poison everywherebefore crying out The thief has been here He has killed my father and fledThey know where they lived in the past Those places where they previously livedWhen they do not think that thought Then all thoughts will cease to be Therefore nongrasping and nonrejection is the entrance into nondualitySubhūti it is because all things are unmoving for that reason they do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not even abide anywhereThen through the power of karma they will be come back to life and will be hurled into a mass of flamesConquering pride is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it leads to the perfection of wisdomThe householder then uses a skillful method in order to bring the poor man to himselfHe spoke with a single voice yet was heard in all languagesthe infantile do not recognize thatOne will distinctly see without heads all those who are going to die within

parasols banners standards and lampsHe replied āradvatīputra That which is unchanging and without conceptual notions regarding all things is called the nature of mind with which minds are endowedWhere have you gone abandoning this kingdomThose who have seen the activities of a tathāgata are good beingsAll phenomena are without going and thus without transferenceThe Blessed One then uttered these versesIf you turn away from the master in a gatheringDevelopment is said to be done By one who adheres to deity practiceYou should accept alms by not taking anythingWhen the king had heard this samādhi He abandoned his kingdom as if it were spittleAjita at that time on that occasion you were the lazy bodhisattva Yaśaskāmaand those who appear in dreams in the form of a womanWhat are the circumstances for itThe daughter listened to her fathers words And Jñānāvatī then addressed himJust as a man upon waking fleetingly remembers his dream the memory of the dead arises in a similar waySubhūti this constitutes the refinement of great bodhisattva beings who possess the extrasensory power that realizes divine clairvoyanceSo charnel grounddwelling bodhisattvas understand that if they adapt themselves to others seats they themselves will be free of any regrets and no one will blame themA yogin of black complexion Should meditate on Black AcalaThey were exalted in fame and glory like the lofty summit of Mount SumeruI am cultivating toleranceThere are no notions there are no concepts There is nothing to be graspedand their wisdom will not diminishhe was thinking about four aspiration prayers that he had formed in the past Arise Supuṣpa so that you may fulfillThe first is a sense of modesty which pertains to oneself another is a sense of propriety which pertains to

teaching of Dharma as they will now regard the bodhisattva as an agreeable personBlessed One I can indeed uphold this teachingAnd adorned with four archwaysUltimately they are not streamenterers yet in terms of the conventional truth of the world they are beyond all the lower realmsIf you ask why it is because great bodhisattva beings understand that the defining characteristics of those meditative stabilities have an essential nature of nonentityHe would never allow the line of uncountable victorious ones to be brokenMañjuśrī any practice related to any phenomenon constitutes bodhisattva practiceThese are the two obstructing forces The outer and the innerand is attentive to it in the correct manner and commits it to writing or has it committed to writing andDivine son in the unborn there is no birth or ending whatsoeverThe very old the very young The lame those with deformed lower parts those missing an eyeHowever if they did not hear this Dharma teaching of retention they would regress from the highest complete enlightenmentThey themselves should be equipoised in the meditative absorption of the sense field of infinite spaceBy their truth and their true words may countries regions cities towns villages houses abodes fields and this sick patient be guarded protected looked after and brought peace and wellbeingthere is a buddha realm called Jewel WorldGreat bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom after investigating conditioned phenomena through the twofold emptiness and having become established in this twofold emptiness then teach the sacred doctrine to ordinary peopleAfter we had made that agreement we hurried as quickly as we couldThen akra mighty lord of the gods said to the Blessed OneIn this regard the pointing upwards of his body hairs means thatBut even if they did not achieve it they would still draw near to the world of Brahmā Anger toward anyone does not arise in the mind Of the bodhisattva who has a mind without angerHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of external phenomena When Māra the evil one heard these words he felt even more miserable and unhappyThen I shall explain it to youNot even someone who can draw all the water in the oceans through a single strawWhy is that It is because at that time I was the dharmabhāṇaka rīgarbhaThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of external knowledge concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of external knowledge concerning teaching the compositeGreat being you glow with the roots of virtue You will be reborn wherever you wish Just as the notion of individual selves is entirely nonexistent in all respects and is nonapprehensibleWhen bodhisattvas see someone who has committed a deed with immediate consequences or some other unvirtuous actionsLet none of us offer a single word in response Having made this pact they remained where they wereThey make the vine of craving for existence growThose who hold these many views that involve reference points wander helplessly in all the various forms of existenceThe goddesses wearing loose gownsMay they teach the Dharma and continue to remain in this worldBhagavān why is the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara called AvalokiteśvaraThe monk officiant next performs an act of motion aloneVenerable Lord Those who are supreme among great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomHe is attended to by billions of beings And is always a favorite of the kingAt that time he saidProclaimed to many millions of beings The immaculate wisdom and peace of this buddhahoodwhen a householder of rāvastī came to the JetavanaThis incantation Which benefits all worlds was eloquently spokenWhat was my past existence and what will my future existence beliving within those pores until they reach the level of nirvāṇaIf one stands under a belleric myrobalan tree or under a banyan tree andIt is the seat of equanimity because it abandons affection and aversionThis is why you have practiced disciplined conduct and austeritiesMisunderstanding this absence produces concepts and thoughtsThe bandit turned monk replied This is my fatherAnd a thousand other yakṣa lords Came holding censers of incense Bhikṣus such is my wisdom The limitless wisdom of the Tathāgataāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom they should investigate and make their determination accordinglyWhy is it the diligent practice of those with a lions roarKeeping all the different discourses taught by the ThusGone One as their reference pointsAs a comparison if all the men women boys and girls in the four continents were to apply themselves to workIn the same way one may use the mantra to empower a wheel a scepter a trident an arrow a hammer a noose and so forthNārāyaṇa bodhisattvas will attain these four unending qualitiesWill not be able to have faith In the supreme samādhi of emptiness the ultimate truth They will be perfectly gentle kind and controlled Yet they will be the ones despised at that time King ubhavyūha attained the samādhi called the array of all adorning good qualitiesYet he was protected by his previous roots of virtue and saved only by the mind of awakening thus he was not reborn in the lower statesThey will never have an unfavorable existence They will be world rulers cakravartin kingsthey become free from doubt and hesitation and additionally retain themTherefore he teaches them with discourses appropriate for the disciplining of the wild and uncivilizedBy inscribing it on a kettle drum with chalk andThis is due to the power of his previous aspirations during his practice as a bodhisattva and also due to the power of all the roots of what is wholesome of the beginner bodhisattvas of those who set out on the vehicles of the hearers and the pratyekabuddhas as well as of all the immature ordinary peoplesights sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomenaKauśika you should listen carefully and keep this in mindFor those who are stuck in their attachment to the stain of doubt liberation is attachmentThis great king of sūtras which is equal to the ThusGone One is taught for the sake of beings like theseThey do not consider whether odors are connected with tastesThen praising the renowned mother of the Victorious OneVenerable Blessed One what is the queen of secret mantras called Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm the Dharma teaching that liberates from all grahas the seal of the buddhas as many perfectly awakened thusgone arhats as there are grains of sand in the river Gangesthey should recite the mantra until the image and the ground start to shake and until they experience a state of joyOh Oh When you see beings who are sick Afflicted with all kinds of illnessesHowever while consciousness is not visible in the body when consciousness disengages from itIf two brothers turn up as they are sure to saying We two shall go forth together at the same timeThey will be highly praised By all the lords of the worldyou will attain the fruit of one who has entered the stream andThey regarded phenomena as a magical display a mirage a dream the moon reflected in water an optical aberration empty space an echo a castle in the sky or a phantom and they were endowed with immeasurable assuranceSince neither is the case They do from the beginning not existThen Māyādevī due to the magnificence and strength of the Bodhisattva knew that it was time for her to give birthso that there is thus the attainment of merit and wisdomIt is excellent Bhaiṣajyarāja excellent that you protect guard and conceal through your compassion for beingsThey brought delight and satisfaction to the foolish but not to the wiseThese four deities of the Bodhi tree also wished to venerate the Bodhisattva and therefore they modeled the Bodhi tree to give it perfect roots trunk branches leaves flowers and fruits as well as a perfect height and circumferenceNoble son such is the bodhisattvas skill in worshiping and venerating the thusgone onesThe bhikṣus who possess such a sūtra as this will not be tormented by desireYou are expert in understanding which methodsin a world of rampant afflictionssome are made of precious sapphire jewelsQuick mobilize the four army divisionsIn what way you may wonder are bodhisattvas capable of containing the limitless rainclouds of Dharmaas soon as I teach the Dharmaconstitute the negativity of bodyOr speak harshly to the bhikṣus This is the result that ripens for them listen to meAt dawn as the sun rose the Bodhisattva entered the park known as Stainless ArrayThe trichiliocosm has become as indestructible and firm as a vajraWill succeed within a fortnightThe reason Blessed One is that ultimately there are so many beings who cling to reference pointswhy do you not go with himReverend I am one of the many sinister men who have bodily and forcibly violated nunsSimilarly the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom are nonapprehensible owing to their utter puritySenior āradvatīputra then asked the Blessed Onebeing committed to helping othersWhat is the utilization of the higher cognitionsHe is brimming with hundreds of qualities adorned by his own magnificenceVenerable Lord What are the physical actions that are tainted with the inadmissible transgressions which great bodhisattva beings might havehe picked up the preceptors begging bowl and on doing so saw that a single grain of rice had stuck to itChanda then askedThis is why it is called the transcendent perfection of wisdomAs bodhisattvas correctly comprehend Desire anger dullness and so on along with their associated factors are all unvirtuousto make ones mind pliableSimilarly the limit of the future and the present are nonapprehensible owing to their utter purityhandsome radiant with a golden complexion a head shaped well like a parasolAt that time all the worlds in this world realm of a billion worlds were filled with tathāgatasAnd how do they blow the destructive wind of wisdom which is unsurpassed and transfers beings to the realms where there are no physical bodiesthey should make this dedication in such a way that they do not engage with mind and do not engage with anything other than mindāradvatīputra so it is that when great bodhisattva beings have trained in the transcendent perfection of wisdom without apprehending anything they will attain emancipation in omniscienceFor a thousand eons you have nourished beings with your thunderous voiceWith perfect wisdom I have correct knowledge of this world and the next worldthey cannot be crushed by any of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas or even by the evil Mārananda if you ask how those who have obsessively

samādhiāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as imbued with happiness or suffering constitute a bodhisattvaThe Bodhisattva then pondered What is the prerequisite for formations to formThose sentient beings too are neither created nor conditionedNoble son there are beings to be trained by means of bodhisattvas renouncing everything and going forthIf one were to infuse a cloth of precious Benares silkThen I sat with my parents and told them everything that had happenedAs much power as that bodhisattva great being has before going to the seat of awakening it is one hundred thousand times greater once he or she goes there and through such power enters the seat of awakeningYoung man the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened BuddhaThe seed phrase supreme na teaches the comprehension of the name and form of all phenomenaIngest each one of the pills infused with the vajra drinkThen the girls mother told herIn the past for billions of eons You trained in knowledge that destroys the afflictionsTo the one who has entered the maṇḍala

Gold silver sons wives and your kingdom Defeating the wicked one and his army You attained unexcelled awakeningAre eclipsed by the splendor of the Blissful OneA person with magical powers may employ magic for some specific purpose and so also succeed in achieving that purposeThat is what the Bhagavān said and when the Tathāgata had spoken these words the Teacher added the following versesWhile there he the son of Yaśodharā was mistaken for a white ascetic and so was pulled into the pondHis chamberlain repliedall in order to put an end to cultivation and they do so without apprehending anythingNoble son in this way the thusgone ones are said to abide in great compassiona bodhisattva should regard all living beings as a wise man regards the reflection of the moon in water or as magicians regard men created by magicThink like this and your wishes will be fulfilledConsider noble son how the rising moon brings peace light and great joy so that all beings delight in beholding

practicing this transcendent perfection of wisdomYou wholly perfected the conduct of a buddhaThis was my skillful methodrub it out in the opposite direction Then a bound person will be freed from bondageThey do not depend on the favors of others and cannot be led astrayWhat are its benefits Sañjayin repliedMoreover āradvatīputra the Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beings understands the emptiness of internal phenomena without apprehending anythingJust as an arrow shot into the air is not impeded anywherenanda The sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage abide utterly in the emptiness of internal phenomenais not the noble eightfold path and the restHe is unshakable like an oceanWhat is the level of knowledge It is being free of stupiditySimilarly knowing

definitely practice generosity by giving away my ears and nosevisited the family without any ascetic attendants in his wake Prostrating at his feet the householder askedFrom the base of the secret vajraSimilarly Subhūti all things have the modality of the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship and individual enlightenment great bodhisattva beings too do not transgress this modalityThey obtain the Dharma of a worthy person And maintain a motivation of generosity He then exhorted them with discourse suitable for their development toward enlightenment and soon they conceived the spirit of enlightenmentAll that I have heard about this is true It is reality In this there is no deceptionseeking complete enlightenment

buddhasWhatever Dharma taught by the Buddha they hear They have no doubt about the Buddhas teachingsWhen the man sees his children have come outSimilarly the bodhisattva lion sees that there is no one like themselves and hence moves undaunted and without fearIt will be good to find its meaningAt that time some gods within the gathering wonderedThis is genuine visionto penetrate flawless realityAt that point the venerable āradvatīputra addressed youthful MañjuśrīThe teaching of the Sugata is a treasure that has been found Attaining homelessness is a second treasure Lord of men do you not remember even a littleWe pay homage with our heads bowed We witness at the seat of awakening The magnificent displays performed by the godsWe have on this day unexpectedly Heard the pleasant speech of the GuideNow I can see everythingO SageThe Bodhisattva possessed incredible qualities but how much more so the One Who Has Awakened to Perfect and Complete BuddhahoodNonetheless for the sake of foolish people who do not understand this I have explained the element of consciousness using analogiesA bodhisattvas buddhafield is the doctrine that eradicates the eight adversitiesGive up these unvirtuous actsThat is to say they attract them through their gifts through their pleasant speechWhat is conviction in the ripening of karmathe one who has reached dry land the one who attained peace the one who found fearlessness and the one who is unharmed by the thorns of disturbing emotionsAs I was always kind the garland of fame Of my compassion spread in the four directions O Sage having

nectar To be heard in this world of the deafAre all played melodiously and simultaneously But the Sugata with one word eclipses them allThough your head be tonsured and your body clad in robes It is more important that your senses be stilledThe ākyas were delighted and amazedThen the Blessed One addressed Senior Subhūti as followsYou must stop this hermaphrodite of yours from behaving like thisYour Majesty you are most fortunateThese twelve hundred who have no defilements Will all become buddhas in this world and cretins are also being allowedAnd having accomplished great benefit for

formless and invisible brings about the production of the realms of this worldcelestial realms mountains groves and so onConsider noble son the analogy of a fire that is lit on the summit of the Himalayas or the summit of the VindhyasIn the light of this advice the monks had taken to visiting the charnel groundThe four gates are the four foundations of mindfulness they live in an appropriate manner  they do not conceptualize the objects of perception  they remain detachedBhagavān we are honored by the world with its devas humans and asuras as the sons of the Bhagavān the attendants of the

surrounded by the seven syllablesThe milk and the water will both separateThese childish beings are contentI possess the applications of mindfulnessAs a result of their arrogance they believed that they had obtained roots of merit when they had not obtained themThe goddess Hatred Vajrī then asked the lordMañjuśrī how do bodhisattvas abide in lovewhere he shaved off his hair and beard donned saffron robes and settled downnanda you should know that the attainment of buddhahood occurs in whichever world system the transcendent perfection of wisdom prevailsSimilarly Mahauṣadhi consciousness is understood through the constituents of vision hearing smell taste and touch butThe way of the sacred teachings of the lord buddhas who appeared in the past was indeed this emptiness of inherent existenceThese gods then went to the gods in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree and told Māyādevī It seems that the young prince is about to pass awayAjita I declare this to you I make this known to youHe

demigods rejoiced andI have never before heard a teaching of the Dharma as remarkable as this instruction in the entrance into the method of inconceivable transformationsSuch a bodhisattvas quantity of merit defies any description in terms of number fraction quantity analogy or causalitybut if there is no face no reflection occursSubhūti the transcendent perfection of wisdom gives rise to the tathāgatas and instructs the worlds of sentient beingsthey would all become freed from that island of the rākṣasīsExtreme joy is imminenceDeveloping a loving mind They will listen to this sūtra Moreover five hundred children of noble family were bornGuide we will endure it We will bear it His hair is black  even  fragrant  soft  well kempt  well arranged and  curlyThe thusgone ones may teach

nonentitiesmental discomfort and agitation all ceaseFull of compassion for him I did accept the giftAll of them cried out loudly and wailedIf its grain that you seek I will shower down a rain of grainJust as it is so for those missing hands it is also so for those missing legsWe were going to Siṃhala Island bringing much merchandise in chariots in bags baskets and pots carried by camels oxen donkeys and so on so as to go to villages towns suburbs cities and markets I found an excellent ship that had been to Siṃhala Island many timesNever have yearning for possessions Do not be distressed if you do not obtain almsThey speak firstYou have cut through the bondage of the creepers of craving You are free of existence and are devoid of existence Please bless this Dharma robe as an upper robeBut when at another time that man digs out wet earth and mud dripping with water and sees that the bodies of men digging the well are covered in mud that manThe Blessed One also delivered a prophecy regarding their unexcelled and perfect awakening specifying their individual buddha realms and declaring their names as thusgone onesI teach according to their range And according to their strengthWhen the Jina placed his foot on the gateways threshold The entire ground shook in six ways Throughout the villages and towns as far as the oceansentient beings equal in number to the particles of dirt on the earthMaitreya there are two gestures of the bodhisattvas What are theyWhat is the matterSir I do not have any means to pay the crossing feeThis was the third chapter of The Tantra of the Vajra in the Underworld the chapter on VaiśravaṇaThey will not construe the notion that physical forms are aspirationless and that aspirationlessness is physical formsThus is outer

transcendent perfection of generosity  the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline  the transcendent perfection of tolerance  the transcendent perfection of perseverance  the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and  the transcendent perfection of wisdom These are called the six transcendent perfectionsThey have become possessors of immense wisdom And they are constantly giving rise to vast joyAll those shortcomings ensue from the monks teaching without being requested to do soAt dawn he dressed put on his mendicant robe and took his alms bowlMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see finite buddhafields they should reflectIf they abide in cognize and are intent on the applications of mindfulness and the other causal attributesI am birth and I am deathWhere all attachments cease that is nonarisingWho had compassion for him And said Take this medicine and similarly who practice in order that they might grasp or reject sights sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomenaThrough teaching with skillful methodsin the worlds you possess no attachment or angerEndowed with these they attract sentient

real natureamong these stocks of merit the stock of merit acquired through this transcendent perfection of wisdom is supreme foremost superior and unsurpassed in contrast to the aforementioned stock of merit acquired through making offerings to the tathāgatasBodhisattvas similarly do not frown in anger and due to their extremely bright senses they always have a smile on their faceIn that village which belonged to the supreme kingJewel garlands splendid beyond comparison beautified the throneBut please listen to what I have to say for I may be able to help youMañjuśrī how do bodhisattva great beings who are laypeople or renunciants acquire this absorption that encapsulates all meritAnd the rasanā with the nature of meansA hellbeing has died and undergone transfer away from this life These

of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sittingThe extrasensory powers of these bodhisattvas are perfected while the extrasensory powers of those ones are unperfectedYoung man that nature of the mind

time on that occasion were the sons of King ubhavyūhaSimilarly this refrain should be applied to the causal attributes starting from the applications of mindfulness and continuing up to the noble eightfold pathSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess those attributes indications and signs are revealed to be irreversibleHe surpasses all measureKātyāyana go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illnessThe supreme leaders the buddhas have these strengths and retentions And the strength of the ten strengths Similarly wherever bodhisattvas stay that place will be pervaded by the fragrance of disciplinehe will mount it at daybreak and travel throughout this great earth which is surrounded by oceansand to be assiduous in training on the pathwho lived and dwelt in the ṣipatana Deer Park near VārāṇasīMay bodhisattvas who have achieved this absorption come to acquire as well all the qualities and benefits that are not possessed by any śrāvakas and solitary buddhasHe

followsMañjuśrī how do bodhisattvas achieve these ways of living such that they become renunciants even while living as householders Although they think ultimately thought is not something that can be expressed as mind or mental phenomenaThey should be dedicated to the DharmaI repliedThe one whose mind Is liberated from existentsThey practice the discipline of the supreme medicine They are physicians who possess the supreme medicineWhat kind of birth does this prophecy concern MaitreyaAh This sacred doctrine has been eloquently explainedThey talk about the perfection of generosityThey become lords of generosity Who are constantly giving freelyThis supreme incomparable accumulation of merit Is the source of the immeasurable treasure of wisdomand rode out to meet the King of Aṅga in battlethey discern that physical forms are impermanentIn that case Venerable Lord are the minds of all ordinary persons also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existenceWe will impart the seal The sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm The seal that frightens all bhūtas When stampedMay they also perfect the attributes that naturally arise and may they also perfect the attributes that are free from contaminantsAnd therefore king of gods do not worship me with material objects but worship me with DharmaworshipBut only bring back worthless trinketsInstead they think Developing desire in relation to such insubstantial phenomena would be unbecoming for meBodhisattvas will go to the lower realms Through having doubts about this matterHis tongue is supple soft and copper coloredThe strengths liberations and dhyānas Are all also a single characteristic bowed down to the Bhagavāns feetsaying O child of

meritHe does not emulate anything other than omnisciencethe four formless absorptions the five extrasensory powersWhen having obtained the root of kanaka The yogin places it in the hair of someone Who suffers from the quartan fever That person will be relieved from his plaguesBhagavān even all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas with their higher wisdom could not conceive of calculate or determine their numberAs this boy had come to them from the lap of the godsSubhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist had conjured up a large gathering of people and then

path of the ten virtuous actionsThe yakṣa lords for their part are accompanied by the yakṣiṇīs mentionedSeeking this peace this supreme samādhi In the past I gave away many millionsThen Senior Subhūti

announced to the gods of the atmospherekinaras mahoragas pretas piśācasThey will also bring sentient beings to maturitythis āradvatīputra is the transcendent perfection of perseverance possessed by great bodhisattva beingswith their minds intent on the real natureYou have never moved your body Hands or feet or gone anywhereI who was blind can now seeDo you seek to squander the offerings of the faithful and invite misfortuneVenerable Lord I pay homage to the transcendent perfection of wisdomI am cultivating toleranceWhy is that so Because of the bodhisattvas perfect past aspirationsFor example Subhūti just as there are few who have undertaken actions fitting for a universal monarch while those who have undertaken actions fitting for a garrison commander are much more numerous in the same way Subhūti those sentient beings who have entered upon the path that leads to omniscience are few in number whereas those sentient beings who have entered upon the paths of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are much more numerousthey demonstrate the sacred doctrine accordingly to sentient beingsaccrue deeds that are destitute of the sacred doctrineWhat does it portend he askeddepositing

fear of even the smallest unwholesome actFor the sake of the wisdom of buddhahoodBlessed One if this bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya developed acceptance so long ago of the fact that all phenomena are unproducedThis is what is called the practiceMay I attain supreme awarenessMāra then said to meYet the seal itself was not transferred anywhereIf your enlightenment can be prophesied in such a way so can that of all living beingsif some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone else should say that I have not attained manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to these particular phenomena here I would correctly disregard that reason for contradicting me based on their worldly doctrinesIt should be chanted once each day The one who completely abandons the concept of self And the doctrine of an individual that these beings followThis is a vast inconceivable aggregation of merit Through which buddha wisdom will quickly be attained Monks the monk āriputra was at that time the princeThe kiṃnaras became free of physical ailments like divine daughtersThe city is filled with gardens groves and palacesestablishing Buddhahoods highest enlightenment Hearing that I had no doubt in the Dharma Not long after the merchants loaded the pack animals and set outThe four gateways are the four concentrationsnot abiding hither not abiding thitherand the utterly unborn on the

quickly attainedBeat the drum of the DharmaAs the grasping at a self is reversed both pleasure and pain will have been relinquished as wellāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousness as entities and nonentitiesWhy is it the satisfaction of those dedicated to

the Tathāgatas intended meaningIf when this is explained great bodhisattva beings are not discouraged and not utterly disheartenedNoble son because they possess ten qualities bodhisattvas have a mind that is like the oceanand then I will bring them to the highest complete enlightenmentHowever due to the formative factors there are various kinds of rebirthsFine bells made of gems hung from lattices as did hundreds of thousands of silk streamersWhether they hear praises or slander of the Saṅgha they have the intention to attain supreme perfect enlightenmentPadmaśrīgarbha once again the two beings addressed the blessed one in verseWhen one recalls this mantra in battle one will meet with victory By using the mantra for cleansing one will remove all diseasesThis was the eighth chapter on mantra from The Tantra of the Vajra in the UnderworldThese bhikṣus are tīrthikas Who teach what they have made upAll those who are born there are equal in fortune to the kinghe offspring of the Sugata filled with joy Praise him with thousands of verseswithout conception and without intellectualizationIt is having no attachment to phenomena It is having possession of the sacred Dharmaand when they have done so and understood the real nature of those phenomenaIf one pierces its heart it will quell his angerLeader bull of men we behold the revelation of your miraclenor have they trained in the

bodhisattvas each adorned with the thirtytwo marks on each of the palaces and pavilionsInstead they will thinkWhen for instance he attends to the begging bowl of a preceptor or instructorAll this bodhisattvas comprehend by the power of genuine insightSo that those beings may relinquish their carelessness the bodhisattva will show the way of deathOr teaching through a vast display of buddhahood according to the wishes of the world including its gods humans and demigods and satisfying themThey pacify all those torments by means of unsurpassable pure discipline along with unsurpassable

is utterly peaceful is utter pacificationIn order to bring offerings to the blessed ākyamuniMonks as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heardāriputra there are masses of parasites in womens brainsāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings train accordingly they do indeed train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom without apprehending anythingBhikṣus in the southeastern direction there is the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named Siṃhaghoṣa andAll the beautiful and excellent trees that grow and are venerated in all the different worlds in the ten directions including the worlds of gods and humans now manifested at the seat of awakeningThis completes the thirtieth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Inherent ExistenceThis offering is for him the master of good qualities who has gone to the Bodhi treeAct in that way The bodhisattva noble Avalokiteśvara then said to the Blessed OneThe king bowed down to the feet of the supreme human And sat down before the JinaSome reveal their bodies in a thousand colorsYour Majesty a brahmin dwarf has arrived hereSo that as the breeze blows It pervades these beings hereHere I reached the end of all crying Wailing anguish and lamentation Once I attained The absorption and qualities born of wisdomEveryone there had entered but a single vehicle they had entered the Great VehicleThe world arises dependentlyOne should take Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa for the object of ones absorptionSubhūti one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to be born as a pratyekabuddha or as a tathāgata arhat and genuine perfect buddhaThe false concept is its rootThose beings who were in extreme suffering Tormented by many kinds of miseriesTathatā being the same as tattva is called tathatvahis mind was unwavering calm and sereneThan that from offering to the guides Jewels filling buddha realms as numerous as the Ganges sands Noncessation and nonarisingSuch knowledge is not due to a wisdom of their own that has been attained through maturationthe dharmadhātu is stainlessAre never overcome by the arising of desires That cause the unrestrained to go to the lower realms Lord please listen to what is on my mindfor all things are empty of the essential nature and indeed they are empty of all thingsWhen the king saw only the horse Kaṇṭhaka and ChandaIn response youthful Mañjuśrī inquiredHe took seven steps and undistractedso they will be reborn within the world systems of the ten directionsSimilarly Subhūti even great bodhisattva beings who possess the uncontaminated pristine cognition of the sublime path mayThe prince should also be tested in terms of his strengthEvil one today you will be restrained by the Bodhisattva Like a snake by a spellBhagavān we will give a Dharma gift to the bodhisattva mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraBe without a companion like a rhinoceros And this supreme samādhi will soon be attained The Sage gave his consentand reversing their resolve induce them to enter and become established in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there is no residue of the psychophysical aggregatesSacred One you are very powerful Like Nārāyaṇa you are hard to tameThey are illegitimate by birth and their accomplishments have not resulted from the noble deeds of their parentsWithout afflictions demons have no ingressThey will be reborn as a householder within the householder or mercantile class like a mighty sāl treeHe will during that time practice celibacyHe is the essence that is the reality of consciousnessSubhūti if the thirtytwo major marks of a superior man that the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas possess were entities and not nonentitiesSimilarly since the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty are nonapprehensible it follows that socalled ears nose tongue body and mental faculty are nothing but mere names or conventional termsWhat is a superior person likethe devas of uddhāvāsa and the world with its devas humans asuras and gandharvasThe Bhagavān saidsuccumbing to sleep at nightThe nature of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas is indeed emptiness Emptiness is indeed the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThe incantation should be chantedWith my subtle and immaculate memory I know many hundreds of eonsThey will have blood and pus dripping from their bodiesacting in accord with the teachings of the thusgone onesTherefore Bhagavān I will give my blessing to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma so that through my blessing this Dharma teaching will continue to exist in JambudvīpaProstrations to the tathāgata Ratnārcis buddha of the westI have a few questions for the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddhaand similarly the radiance of their bodies originating through the ripening of the past actions of the gods of the Trayastriṃśa Yāma Tuṣita Nirmāṇarata and Paranirmitavaśavartin realmsYoung man at that time and in those daysMonks long ago in a sanctuary not very far from the city of Vārāṇasī there lived a sage who personified loving kindnessThe light of the ThusGone One illuminated hundreds of thousands of buddha realmsAll of the devas that dwell in Jambudvīpa Whether in hundreds of towns or in its forestsor made knownIf someone had to insert into their fingernail The entire element of earth And having done so go away And climb up to the world of BrahmāSince the gods at the peak of existence Are unable to see the crown of his headOne should blend the root of castoroil plant with sour gruel and rub it on the headThe one who sees with an eye free from evil and who possesses compassion will become king of the three worldsHumanity is being tormentedThen both Bhadrapāla and Mahauṣadhi prostrated themselves before the Blessed One and said to himGenerosity calmness collectedness discipline Forbearance diligence Concentration absorption Knowledge and means Such were the words that emergedOr are they without formSome scattered precious flowers And some scattered sandalwood powder and take their nourishment from one or three or five or seven housesalong with great bodhisattva beings and pratyekabuddhasIf one were to ask why it is because the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are empty of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and emptiness does not exist elsewhere apart from the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas Nor do the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas exist elsewhere apart from emptinessfalsehoodTo those humans who have attained vast power Who have reached it through merit and seeing the buddhas We and the world are in your carend with that he went into the wilds where a householder became his followerthey obstruct the omniscience of the lord buddhas of the past future and presentMeditating on this wisdom of the buddhas Contemplating it and observing it and kneeling on their right knees with palms placed together bowed toward the bhikṣuBhagavat in what time will they become recipients of offeringsthey were playing pleasant music endowed with the five qualities and were engaging in joyful play and entertainmentfreedom from doubts about the Dharma due to their own understandingSimilarly the indefatigability relentlessness and tenacity with which they persevere while practicing their generosity and so forth are called the armor of the transcendent perfection of perseveranceEven the roots of this tree are healing to sentient beings and so are its trunk branches leaves flowers and fruits Seeing grasping tasting and touching this tree are likewise healingand the world with its devas asuras and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the BhagavānThen the gods extolled the teachings of the Blessed OneBhagavān what kind of roots of merit has the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara created in the past and in the presence of which tathāgataThere is no place here for the heretics of other schoolsIt is a wheel of the effortless and ceaseless activity of the ThusGone One It is a wheel beyond activity and nonactivitycame before the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha Ghoṣadattait is because the Great Vehicle and the great armor are not distinct from one another The great armor itself is the Great Vehicle and the Great Vehicle itself is the great armoreven so reverend Mahākāśyapa one who is not himself a bodhisattva cannot harass a bodhisattvaThis concludes The Benefits of the Purity of the Six yatanas the eighteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaIf one cannot see the star Arundhatī one will die within six monthsAll their aspirations will be completely fulfilled And they will easily awaken to buddhahoodWe are close to the great island of jewels so you beings should go thereThen even the tiniest unwholesome deeds you have committed with your body speech and mind due to the afflictions will be purified and they will not come to maturationThe Buddha then said to the bodhisattva MaitreyaThose who engage in that which is unreal The fools who are always enjoying sensory pleasuresIt is dualistic to consider actions meritorious sinful or unmovingHis voice was like that of a cuckoo pleasant and sweet sounding as he addressed Māras daughters with these versesRenouncing the world for the sake of awakening is indeed meaningfulThe thirtyseven aspects of enlightenment have the defining characteristic of being conducive to emancipationIts staffs were of gems and jewels of inconceivable brillianceAs pure as if they were made of beryl And will always bring joy to the beings who see themIn a similar way consciousness assumes virtue and nonvirtue before undergoing transfer and migratingYet the form is not dependent on the eye Nor is the form transferred to the eyeThe rudiments of mantra should be recited as we doBecause it brings the accomplishment of the unobscured inconceivable knowledge of all phenomenaHe teaches the Dharma in the form of a yakṣa to those beings who are to be guided by a yakṣaBodhisattvas relax in those celestial palaces and discuss the DharmaIt is because they are disagreeableThey had attained the superknowledges and were adept in the practice of absorptionand all of them are uncompoundedIt would not be difficult in this world For someone in the inferno of the eons end To go into its center carrying a load Of straw without its burningThere were no other great mountains or mountainsReverend not without cause or condition do tathāgatas arhats perfectly awakened buddhas smileThrough such steadfast adherence to their commitments the outlook of bodhisattvas is excellent and hence they become humble and free of prideAnd so each king attributed the light to the birth of his own sonThe many beings afflicted by anger and blemished by hate Must be embraced by your love ThusGone OneOf profound interdependent origination When seeing the poor bringing them wealth When seeing those with bad conduct feeling compassionThe radiance of akra Brahmā jewels and lightningthe element of consciousness connects with the apprehending of virtue andSimilarly the real nature of the self and so on up to and including the real nature of the knower and the viewer and the real nature of the Tathāgata are one and the same real nature They are not two but indivisibleHomage to you heroic being Homage to you supreme being Paying homage with palms joined They vanished right thereWhat is their skill with respect to the means of attractionhow could past feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness be apprehended in emptinessThey would not abide on the irreversible levelsFor the real nature of mental consciousness and the restVenerable Lord Just as there are no changes and no conceptual notions regarding the actual mindexhibit endurance satisfaction and confidenceAt the beginning it precedes all virtuous dharmasHowever relatively the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings contains the ten powers the various types of fearlessness the unique qualities and omniscient wisdomWith the collected semen liquor and extracted large pillI am intoxicated there With sweet drink and pleasures Thus my attendants wander off And wreak havoc throughout the ten directionsThey give these gifts with a serene mind Intent upon the wisdom of the tathāgatas Similarly how could this illusory person attain emancipation in omniscience after training in the applications of mindfulnessWhat are those ten They are the displays of dying taking birth being born growing up and frolicking within the harem leaving home practicing austerities going to the seat of awakening taming the demons awakening to complete buddhahood turning the wheel of Dharma and passing into the great transcendence of sufferingAnd so having bowed their heads to the feet of the buddha who had instructed them in this wayEven the names of the recollections do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoIt is through the body that actualization takes placeThe Bodhisattva saw the mendicant and noticed that he was peacefulMañjuśrī the emptiness by which awakening is empty is also the emptiness by which all dharmas are emptyI give you my blessingthe term all things denotes the five psychophysical aggregates the twelve sense fields the eighteen sensory elements corporeal phenomena formless phenomena conditioned phenomena and unconditioned phenomenaNaked and with loose hairBhagavān the poor man sees his father seated among such wealth at the entrance of his own residence encircled by a great crowd of householders as his attendantsWater and fire and wind are my witnesses And so are Brahmā the lord of beings the moon the sun and the starsIt is the supreme wisdom of the highest beings That nirvāṇa is the supreme blissIt is being established in samādhi It is the knowledge of the thoughts of beingsKāśyapa the crops of the bodhisattva great beings roots of virtue they are the accumulations of merit and wisdom that in an unsurpassed manner embody the entire buddhadharma such as the six perfections by means of abiding without abiding within the relative and ultimate truthsAlways describe the qualities of the buddhas Correctly through their definitionsTherefore young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish for this samādhiFinally he fashioned a pen from one of his bones and then with his palms together addressed the godIn the same vein are the other nonexistent fruitional attributes up to and including the nonexistent eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas unattached to the nonexistent eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and the restAnd monks as I was practicing the allpervading absorption from my mouth and my nose all movement of breath ceased and within the openings of my ears an immense sound was heardEvil one today you will be scattered about Like a bird tossed around by the roaring windWhy is it known by the wise Because it is a great precious meaningIf one recites these verses Rāhu will release the moonHearing seeing and thus Subsequently remembering thisThen there will be many śrāvakas of that jina As numerous as the sands of ten billion Gangesand likewise when they engage in union with the emptiness of formative predispositions the emptiness of consciousness the emptiness of name and form the emptiness of the sense fields the emptiness of sensory contact the emptiness of sensation the emptiness of craving the emptiness of grasping the emptiness of the rebirth process the emptiness of actual birth and the emptiness of aging and deathin the case of all these links of dependent originationAssisted by his followers he now began to hurl various weapons upon the BodhisattvaTherefore divine being since bodhisattvas who base themselves on the inexpressible meaning emphasize their own mindswait seven or eight daysYou should not have conviction in individual enlightenmentthose reborn as animals and those in the realm of YamaThat are made from pearls and chrysoberylsand yet while action is something without formthe twelve links of dependent originationFor these reasons Senior āradvatīputra the imperishability of physical forms is not physical formsand jingling golden bells hanging from silver cordsWithin that trichiliocosm all the surrounding mountain ranges great mountain rangesThose sentient beings too will never be separated from the teachings of the sacred doctrine until they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenmentBlessed One it is wonderful that abundant wealth gold and desirable objects have not made this head merchant arrogantMuni this world realm Has been completely broken apart And in that way have emerged These fearless bodhisattvasEven though they teach for ten million eons Their confidence in speech will not declineWhy is that It is because their bodies will have become completely purifiedOne should surround this with the garland mantra and commence worship with offerings and praiseCultivate kindness and compassion And always aspire to rejoicing and equanimityOmniscient omnipresent allpervadingThey will die over and over Always dwelling in the realm of the māras Venerable Lord Bodhisattvas are also empty of bodhisattvasExcellent my son You should do just that for that is a brahmins dutyDesist from all other words That are harmful without exception it is because those who practice in such mundane ways do not move beyond and transcend the mundaneāriputra if you go from this buddha realm past  myriad buddha realms

as the son of a priestthe skies above them were each completely covered by a vast canopy of flowersComprehending that the second concentration is joyous but also sufferingHowever when tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas appear during the degeneration of an eonIt is like a boat for those in the middle of a river It is fame for those who wish for renownMoreover Subhūti when these sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage are attentive to mental images of all the roots of virtue possessed by past present and future tathāgatas from the time when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment until they establish the sacred doctrine and having been attentive in terms of mental images dedicate them to the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment making common cause with all sentient beingsone should write the four syllables ku ru ku llā in combination with the targets name onlyThey made offerings such thatIn order to help living beings They voluntarily descend Into the hells which are attached To all the inconceivable buddhafieldsYou should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the transcendent perfection of generositySimilarly this refrain should also be applied to the eighteen aspects of emptiness starting from the emptiness of internal phenomena and continuing up to the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesHe will become a buddha worthy of offerings in the three worldsTherefore it cannot be accomplished over three incalculable eonsin this regard Subhūti from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment great bodhisattva beings don their armorAt that point Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta and the ten thousand bodhisattvas descended from the skymeritThey will

vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhasKauśika great bodhisattva beings who have cultivated the mind endowed with omniscience should be attentive to the notion that physical forms are impermanenthaving eliminated all the instinctual traces of evil and being endowed with all goodness How could disease or discomfort affect such a bodyHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of degenerate moralityWith the exception of one personnamely venerable nandathey were all worthy ones who had exhausted the defilements and were without afflictionsWhat wrongdoing are you guilty of This frees the sick from their illness It is the wealth accomplished by bodhisattvasFor however long they speak They know those words have no basis There will be no attachment in their mind He replied This

great wisdom sees The entire dharmakāyaThey themselves at all times dispense the gift of the sacred doctrine and worldly gifts andWhoever recollects this sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm before someone who has been seized by a bhūta grahaTormented by the village children Who throw stones and clods at themBhikṣus the sixteen mendicants said to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha MahābhijñājñānābhibhūBlessed One the amount is unfathomableNot understanding oneself is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligenceUpananda thought No doubt this is one of our elder monks Going out to greet himand making common cause with all sentient beings they dedicate these acts for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment without apprehending anythingIn that way I know the thoughts and the conduct And the many aspirations of millions of beingsHe is neither blameworthy nor free from blameProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha King of Renowned Melodious SoundsEven yakṣas bhūtas and piśācas are fond of the truth they cherish it like it and enjoy itOverwhelmed by the powerful force of the ThusGone One he came here and he heard of the powerful strength of the ThusGone One and the bodhisattvasAlas you are my love with glory beyond limits Adorned with good qualities you delight the sagesWhoever applies himself correctly does not ultimately form superimpositions of a selfThereupon the Bhagavān to explain what this meant related an account of the past by chanting the following extensive verses to the youth CandraprabhaTo all of them I go for refugesome were made of crystalin the same vein when they have not turned away from all the causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThe bodhisattvas will have these qualities By remaining in samādhi just as they have been taught Having incanted water one should strike blood will flowElephantmāgadhikā with sweet flag Horsesmell and fresh buffalo butterHe is endowed with the thirtytwo marks of a great being He is called the supreme beingnor is it heard remembered or cognizedHe became joyful and happyHe revered the best of sages And is therefore honored now himselfEvery one of all those bodhisattva mahāsattvas was a dharmabhāṇakaSimilarly the purity of phenomena is profound due to the absolute purity of the applications of mindfulness due to the absolute purity of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and due to the absolute purity of the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasWith understanding one pursues the Dharma in the correct waythe vetālas Rāmadeva Kāmadeva and so forth made of human boneThat is the same as the inconceivable knowledge Of all the buddhas concerning states of existence Venerable Lord this transcendent perfection is ethical disciplinenandaSo I will teach to the śrāvakas this great extensive sūtra the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma which is an instruction for bodhisattvas and is possessed by all the buddhasWhy does it terrify the māras Because it accomplishes all the strengths and because it brings all the kleśas to an endOnce they are purified and illumined One should perceive that great numbers of buddhas Melt into light and enter the seedsyllableEven though our forces are powerful our task would be a difficult oneThe beings who are guided hear the teaching of the Dharma from the tathāgatas in accord with their individual natures and their individual aspirationsFor a hundred and eighty thousand million years I made excellent offerings to that buddha Noble son great caravan leaders can never gather enough wealthWhen the Bhagavān had thus spoken the Youthful Mañjuśrī the venerable nandaShe satisfied me with food that had perfect divine flavorsthat some achieve complete awakening that some achieve complete awakening and turn the wheel of DharmaNoble one stay a little while until you see an omenMay you worship revere and venerate it more and moreNext measuring the length of a shadowall of them formed a prayer to be reborn in the universe Abhiratiif assimilating the passions you do not attain purificationThe five faculties are a cause of purificationand the vajra hail ceasedSon I have placed a chamber pot there Urinate in thatThere are no forms whatsoeverbodhisattvas make the following aspirationThe one who crushes all the mārasSome who were upon the roofs Developed the sublimeI am speaking correctly I am not speaking otherwiseYoung man because those bodhisattva mahāsattva possess the accumulation of merit that comes from being skillful in methods they will quickly attain this samādhi andobserve disciplineAll songs nonsenseSave them from the sea of existenceThen the Bhagavān said to Brother Mahākāśyapa and the other great sthaviras It is unique knowledge the knowledge of births It is infinite knowledge completely perfect knowledgeis the noncultivation of the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousnesseven a particle the size of a fraction of the tip of a hairThey saw the Victorious One who was like the sun in a cloudless sky And whose face was like an autumn moonAs for those sentient beings who have entered the Great Vehicle they will become irreversible That too is why bodhisattvas and not hearers receive a prophecyIf you ask what is the emptiness of conditioned phenomenaNoble lady although you have an irreversible aspiration for enlightenment and immeasurable wisdom it will be difficult for you to attain enlightenmentYou should know that henceforth by putting an end to the accumulation of nonvirtuous actions Existing not existing and both are extremes Pure and impure are also extremesI will definitely practice generosity by offering foodWhat are those two functionsShe should have little attachment anger and ignoranceBlessed One when the ThusGone One has passed into nirvāṇa I will take hold of this sūtra which has been taught by the ThusGone One and grasp it read it understand it and teach it extensively to othersThey practice in order to know how the afflictions come about within them due to mistaken imputation how they come about due to error and how they remain once they have manifestedThey do not consider whether the eyes are calm or not calmAnd also for treating barrennessThis tīrthika tīrthikas name wishes to renounce this identity and go forthit is the case that they correctly perceive formative predispositions to resemble a plantain tree in which the actual core is nonapprehensible when the outer layers are peeled awaythe fruits manifest as the results of three types in the three realmsThey saw many millions of buddhas Those who numbered no fewer than five hundredthe bliss of the unsurpassed wisdom that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects becomes in a manner that is beyond reference points the sustenance of all beingsThey turn them away from the fourth meditative concentration and establish them in the formless absorption of the sense field of infinite spaceSo now please cast your gaze upon those who dwell In the lower realms those who have no freedomWe are born with perfect bodies for the sake of pleasureThough he lived purely his entire life he never attained any of the store of qualitiesThey do not maintain discipline out of fear of being a poor human beingthey cannot be separated they cannot be differentiated and they cannot be severedTheir embrace of saṃsāra is boundlessWhat is the nondissipation of the results of karma It is knowing that the results of karma do not dissipate like a dreamcommanded them Princes you must slay this bhikṣuThe blind who without a guide have fallen into ravines Cannot be led out by anyone else herebowed down to the Bhagavāns feetWhat is the knowledge of the skandhas It is perceiving the skandhas to be like miragesThese six thousand bhikṣunīs both bhikṣunīs in training and those who have passed beyond training will be bodhisattva dharmabhāṇakas with you under those tathāgatasWhen witnessing others who suffer greatlyThey are constantly hearing the DharmaAnd not falling from the level of increasing wisdom Are distinctive qualities of the first patience When born in the family of Buddha They become turners of the wheelWhat family is known to be pure And fitting for the Bodhisattva to take birth inThe kings the rulers however many there were Came from the cardinal and intermediate directionsowing to the fact that all those other attributes up to and including buddhahood are nonexistentThese are called the four assurances of the tathāgatasSubhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not let the mindsets of all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas even ariseThe gods demigods yakṣas gandharvas and nāgas Who supported him Made offerings to him day and night Because of seeing his qualitiesIt dispels all obscurity and darknessAh This world is prone to sufferingVenerable Lord If physical forms are not one thing and the expanse of reality another andHe became exhilarated and quickly went to the parkit is because the natural expression of those transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom though without entity is still the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the restYoung man those are the ten benefits for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who live by receiving alms in the austerity of the disciplines of mendicancyMay you open the gates to liberation May you explain the inalienable way of DharmaWe prostrate to you unrivaled perfect manNoble son this is how the accumulation of merit increases as the result of a single repetition of the sixsyllable mahāvidyāSubhūti great bodhisattva beings should train accordingly in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and they should maintain their skill in meansIt is the subjugation of adversaries through the DharmaNoble son having served the buddhas of this excellent eon the good Amartyā will attain perfect buddhahood within this very buddha realmNor is it the domain of the solitary buddhasapproached the Bodhisattva Singing songs and playing musical instruments of all types they made offerings to the BodhisattvaThings are not apprehended because the expanse of reality is nonapprehensibleAlas my man with thighs like the trunk of an elephant With fair hands and feet and with coppercolored nailsMati behind anddo not generate desire for the transcendent perfection of generosityTherefore Lord I am reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illnessNo striving or giving upSimilarly do not generate desire for the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship and individual enlightenmentSimilarly how could this illusory personThen with flowers and so forth Make pure offerings in the sky Offering them with joySimilarly the ten powers of the tathāgatas are empty of the ten powers of the tathāgatasthe inconceivably numerous designations concerning the kleśasI will even refine the buddhafields I will also bring sentient beings to maturity and so on in the same vein as before down to they will also approach omniscienceSimilarly they teach the doctrine that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are impermanentit is because owing to the emptiness of essential natureEven after departing thence they will once again be incinerated by an infernoA noble son or daughter may establish all beings in the trichiliocosm within the fruitions of a streamenterer oncereturner nonreturner and worthy oneWhen practicing generosity by offering the marrow of their bonesBhagavat be my protector refuge and support They cannot be harmed by weapons or by fire And in that way their bodies are ungraspableāradvatīputra do you think that anything other than the real nature of physical forms constitutes a bodhisattvaIndeed I say that liberation from suffering would also be nonexistentListen young man to these my words A bhikṣu should always dwell in solitudeThis is because beings lack skill in the true meaning and experience things dualisticallythey do not apprehend gifts they do not apprehend their transcendent perfection of generosity nor do they apprehend recipientsto others this king of samādhis the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaThey abide in the abode of all afflictionsdo not imagine consciousness to have been accumulated or heaped upSubhūti great bodhisattva beings of whom the level of irreversible pristine cognition has been foreordained are few in numberEverything appeared to be limitless boundless and ineffable like spaceWhy is that Because when sentient beings approach the thusgone ones through joy faith and appreciation they gain the capacity to receive the teaching of the DharmaYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of reasoning What are the four kinds of reasoningand someone to be our protector when we are deadI would correctly disregard that reason for contradicting me and so on in the same vein as beforeattains the fruit of entering the stream the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThe householder thought If I were to go forth they

are called the words that are supreme in the worldand the things that I was inspired to say commencing therefrom are also nonarisingSon of noble family after the ThusGone One Amitābha has passed into nirvāṇa there will come a night when the sacred Dharma disappears As soon as that happens at the break of dawn on the very next dayVenerable Lord if the notion of fundamental ignorance as a self is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of fundamental ignorance as a nonself become a bodhisattvaNothing lasts longer than a flash of lightning in the skyeightyfour thousand beings within that assembly developed the aspiration to attain the unequaled highest complete enlightenmentAt that point all the bodhisattvas addressed the blessed thusgone PadmanetraHow is wisdom integrated with liberative art a liberationhave turned away from the level of the pratyekabuddhas they are revealed to be irreversibleThis is what has been taught By the ākya lion the protectorThey will never forget any Dharma that they have been taughtRadiating light rays throughout the ten directionsO Passion Vajrī hū phaṭI will turn the wheel of Brahmā Ah God of gods you who are worthy of offerings Dharmabhāṇaka why do you continue to remain silentMissing hands hunchbacks dwarves Those with goiters the mute the deaf Those with mobility aids with elephantiasisThey lose their flesh and again have flesh See the inconceivable result of actions He did not consider it to be anything other than feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessSo how about those who actually listen to the Dharma And develop faith and joyThe light from all luminous beings From devas humans kings and asurasThis concludes the glorious Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma the great extensive sūtra the instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all the buddhasThey should learn the ripening of demons yetA domain where one realizes that all the buddhafields are indestructible and uncreatable having the nature of infinite space yet where one manifests the establishment of the qualities of the buddhafields in all their variety and magnitude such is the domain of the bodhisattvaAt this spectacle everyone present exclaimed Blessed One we now see the extent to which these two bodhisattva great beings are cared for by those blessed buddhasHaving a good conscience is a gateway to the light of the DharmaSimilarly bodhisattvas are the ground from which the seeds of all the virtuous qualities of all beings sproutIt is soothing auspicious and does not burnBhikṣus it is like thisHe came to the arranged seat and sat upon itand in the same vein as before all other fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are revealed thereinIt is nondeviation nonfluctuation and nondistraction from samenessThose who will possess this sūtra Because of their compassion for beingsAnd scatters upon it the petals of Royal jasmine blue lotuses and magnoliasTo bring all beings to maturation they take birth in the desire realmIn the same way even though these beginner bodhisattvas wish to cross the great ocean of the Mahāyānaand have no ignorance regarding any phenomenon that causes ignoranceIt does not think or ponderThey should not make assumptions on account of the transcendent perfection of generosity Similarly they should not make assumptions on account of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomneither concentration nor distractionYou are young and in the prime of life You have a beautiful complexion and you are strongWith your mind free of a point of referenceThe four legs of her bed break off and she ends up lying on the groundIt provides control over the abandonment of conceptuality And the dawn of nonconceptualitySimilarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the nonactualization of the understanding of all phenomena and the nonactualization of the understanding of the aspects of the path and of omniscienceWithout any conceited superiority over others it does not make proclamations regarding itselfVāsuki Takṣaka ManasvinIn the four directions should be placed four girls who have performed their ablutions They should be well adorned and hold weapons in their hands Each of them should also have a bell and a jewel vesselThe same refrain may also be applied in the case of each of the aforementioned terms from physical forms to omniscienceand he will have the same display of the qualities of his buddha realm as SāgaravaradharabuddhivikrīḍitābhijñaYet the group that is undetermined will understand the Dharma if I teach itMañjuśrī it is only in relative terms that a mind is said to be liberatedkaṭapūtanas and pāṃśukūla piśācas toowithout production and

man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of speech desist from killingThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of great learning concerning the compositeSimilarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely pure because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are unsulliedAnd do not develop a mind of malice or a mind of avarice That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind Because their mindstreams are onepointed they do not think or examineVenerable Lord How is this purity of phenomena not subject to rebirth in the world system

said between the devas In the realm of Brahmā In Akaniṣṭha and bhāsvaraI am freed from the notion of a selfO gods it is because all those things which one might emulate from which emulation might arise and into which emulation might subside are nonexistent and nonapprehensibleDivine son ultimately reality is unbornWe shall also abstain from Delighting in the ways of solitary buddhasThe strength of ten gods from the Heaven Entirely Free of Strife is the same as the strength of one god from the Joyous HeavenLike sap dripping From a cut tree branchsuch as rotten smells pleasant smells and unpleasant smellsNoble son do not create a cause for remorseHe is invisible to people When merged with the prāṇamindAfter rubbing into the hair the milky sap of common milk hedge and sesame oil

with feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness in a similar manner they engage in the conditioning of physical formsbring emptiness directly to mindDo not be discouraged nandaBy many hundred thousands of Brahmās As he stepped on the threshold of the citys gatewaySomewhere on the road between Rājagṛha and Gaya they met a group of people who were enjoying a feastSubhūti if you ask how great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom abiding in the six transcendent perfections which arise through the maturation of past actions and similarly established in the five extrasensory power and the four unhindered discernments attract by their generosity those sentient beings who are attracted by generosityLead me to obtain the skillful means and wisdom of the noble MahāyānaHaving spoken these words they should go back to bed to sleepdoes space abide in the mind or anywhere else up to the arising of the three feelings caused by the mind apprehending an objectUntil they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment their minds will not be distracted from attention to enlightenmentThen while his mindpurified and cleansed lucid free of basic and subsidiary afflictions supple flexible and immovablewas immersed in this wayThey bring to maturity sentient beings who are neither fettered nor liberatedand the great disciples descended from their thrones likewise and having bowed at the feet of the Buddha withdrew to one sideThen you will not endure hardships for long you will not suffer and you will not be distressednor is it an object of comprehensionIf you ask why Subhūti it is because the basis of the variety of false views never exists and is nonapprehensible This being the case how could they possibly come and goI am on my way to Vārāṇasī When I arrive in the city of Kāśi I shall turn the wheel of Dharma That has never been turned in this worldNoble son in this way the

unvirtuous qualities and as a result one will take rebirth in the lower realmsThe Licchavi Vimalakīrti created ninety million lionthrones exactly like those already there and the bodhisattvas were seatedHow could they be differently designatedIt neither has the mindsets of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas nor is it without themWhen it is exhaled this is known as recakabut the consciousness that

not go we must return swiftly and thusa hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in sixtyeight Ganges Rivers developed receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomenaI request that the Bhagavān explain perfectly the profound Dharma of the tathāgatas of which you have repeatedly spokenI rule as lord over the realms of the chiliocosmThe Blessed One answered the bodhisattva KṣitigarbhaThe eyes the ears and the nose are unreliable The tongue the body and the mind are unreliableLove and compassion are their daughtersWisdom integrated with liberative art consists of concentration on cultivation of the auspicious signs and marks on the adornment of the buddhafield and on the work of development of living beings all the while concentrating on deep investigation of voidness signlessness and wishlessnessand it is liberationand when night had fallenAs dazzling light streamed forth even the lower realms were pacifiedVenerable Blessed One such is the great power of this sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm thatand seeing him he is again astonishedThey correctly perceive minds that are not surpassed as minds that are not surpassed Yet they do not make assumptions on account of these observationsit is because they do not apprehend any doctrine or goal that could be actualizedYou are the one who cares for the world As it roams through the realms of painVimalakīrti repliedHaving attained enlightenment they will stand up And they will turn the immaculate wheelhe is the One Who Never Loses His Wisdomand utterly unrealThey can also emit smoke and flames of fire like a great conflagrationWhat is the renunciation of craving It is not fixating on any phenomena That is the renunciation of cravingWhat are those ten They are as follows Bodhisattvas depart from their households and receive ordinationWhat is the meditation of the path It is meditation on the nonperception of all phenomenaMoreover Subhūti if you ask what constitutes the supramundane doctrines of great bodhisattva beings that are not shared in common with ordinary peopleāradvatīputra do you think that anything other than the real nature of fundamental ignorance constitutes a bodhisattvaninetythree times a hundred thousand million obtained the transmission of the teaching of that patienceThen the whole billionfold world system shook in six ways and exhibited eighteen great signsLike a bee that settles onto a flower due to various things acting as conditions their consciousness takes rebirth among the denizens of hellThus arises the thusgone ones

such bodhisattva appears throughout This buddha realm of Jambudvīpathe samādhi named ApproachingWe supplicate you to explain why we the nāga kings and our retinues are unable to create obstacles for

is to that extent that Great bodhisattva beings are said to don the great armNoble son the field of the miraculous ear of the thusgone ones is infiniteHaving abandoned dangerous paths they possess visionNoble son bodhisattvas distinguish the various forms of generosity that were just explainedThus noble son the bodhisattvas produce the great rainclouds of Dharmathey are the same through a sameness that is beyond being the same or being not the same and as there is nothing whatsoever to be made the same or to be made not the sameKing Anantanemi thoughtFor the one to whom the skandhas arise There is nothing that arises They have brought to you all their airborne palaces And have praised you and again supplicated youThen the Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Viśiṣṭacāritrathe one who was foremost among the previously described multitudes great multitudes and masters of the multitudes of bodhisattva mahāsattvasIs it through his power That all these airborne palaces have been beautifiedMay you liberate all those afflicted with severe illnessāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness as entities and nonentitiesIt is best that I never say anything May I enter nirvāṇa peace on this very day Abducted from the buddhas the maidens of the highest gods are enjoyedHearing that the gods of the Heaven of Joy wept and embraced the feet of the BodhisattvaVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is unsullied by the three world systemsWhen her baby boy or girl is forming in her womb during the different stages of the pregnancyBhagavat Viśvabhū then began to teach upon the six perfections Noble sons listenThen three of Māras daughtersRati Arati and Tṛṣṇāspoke this verse to Māra the evil oneWhat is putting roots of merit first It is having a strong longing for enlightenment and also inspring that in othersAt that time out of this very skill in liberative art Vimalakīrti manifested himself as if sickIf a man sprinkles wine by means of the mantra The fire will die outand  they enter into the dhyānas samādhis and samāpattis of the buddhasEven if they become a humanSee young man look how that supreme king Gave up the entire world and entered homelessnessAnd so I seek to settle a matter in debate with an opponent in Your Majestys presenceThe skilled bodhisattvas on seeing Realms burning in a blazing infernoHowever long it may have been Since saṃsāras unknowable beginningThis kind of excellent superior cart Is what the man gives to all his childrenin the same way consciousness just after it has died and undergone transfer is gripped by a mental image of the gods and sees the gods and goddesses seated on thronesit abides in neither existence nor nirvāṇaIt is thus that they perfect the transcendent perfection of toleranceThe venerable Aśvajit spoke this verseIt is because the relics of the Tathāgata have all been combined into one within itfor it leads to the transcendence of the attachment of the desire form and formless realmsProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha Akṣobhyananda when I myself was formerly engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattvasome of sapphiresKing ūradatta had an executioner named Nandika who was cruel merciless and ferocious and he was not far from King ūradatta upon the kings roadDelighting in forbearance you had patience with the many harms sufferings Harsh words murders and imprisonments inflicted upon you by othersAnother steered clear of him like a crow does an archery rangethe samādhi named Elephants DelightHe knows the diseases related to the airs bile phlegm or a combination of the three and those related to blood indigestion tumors edema heart disease leprosy skin eruption abscesses and boils as well as poisoning inflammation and so onexpressions of veneration respect and praise are not important to themIn that way there is the cessation of the great mass of unalloyed sufferingand the outer form of his Dharma will remain for a further forty intermediate eonsBut since that which I am teaching you is genuine it is the word of the BuddhaAfter a full hundred eons you have appearedAll thoughts are eliminated And there is nonthought Why do you say that the designation of the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness as permanent or impermanent does not constitute a bodhisattvabut noble son I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the sixsyllable mahāvidyā onceAnd except for the invalids couch upon which Vimalakīrti himself was lying no bed or couch or seat could be seen anywhereThey will never say anything unpleasant to anyone They will never engage in disputes over viewand the notion that existence is pleasantWhen he was old enoughassume at will such corporeal forms by which they might bring to maturity any kind of sentient beings among the five classes of living beingsāriputra eyes are impermanent unstable and do not endureAs they arrive in space they cry like peacocksThis acceptance has nothing whatsoever that can be considered to do with the eyes ears nose tongue body or mindWhatever the reason might be that you came You should accomplish it O lamp for the world iiWith this in mind the Buddha said In all things there is neither male nor femaleHe teaches the Dharma in the form of akra to beings who are to be taught by akraTheir ears are like those of a goatHaving declared the shortcomings of the nonBuddhists bodhisattvas then inspire them to leave those communities and establish them in the DharmaVinaya of the thusgone onesTaking as ones abode a compound like the Palace of Victory or a mansion is not what is meant by dwelling in the abodesthe inconceivably numerous kinds of action concerning teaching the compositeYou offered earrings to Sūryānanda and a golden crown to SumatiThe ākyas looked into the matter and repliedWhatever skills there are in the world The bodhisattvas learn them allQuick establish beings in the virtuous actions of the victorious onesFormative factors do not truly existthe four elementsSitting crosslegged they will recollect themselves and without letting their minds wander they will think as followsWill not quickly attain the wisdom of buddhahood But having heard it they will quickly attain the wisdom of buddhahood Evil one today you will be abandoned Like a broken pot full of dustSimilarly when the sunlike bodhisattvas shine the lights of evil nonBuddhists and the light of evil nonBuddhist systems all disappearāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena as arising or ceasing constitute a bodhisattvaNext the deities are generated According to the four types of birthSuch is the bodhisattvas skill in genuinely encouraging inspiring and exhilaratingGuardians of the city of DharmaThose who maintain the aspiration to enlightenment in the time of degeneration Are continuously making an offering to all the buddhas the venerable nanda and the bodhisattva MaitreyaProstrations to all buddhas dwelling in the presentOr humans or nonhumansWithout ever tiring and without any fear they carry the great loadThey have a symmetrical aureole of light extending a full arm spanthis is the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline possessed by great bodhisattva beings who practice the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptionsThey do not associate with revere serve or become familiar with those who possess worldly mantras nor with Lokāyatasnever ceasing accumulation of the roots of virtueThese three patiences are taught to be the patience regarding what is spoken The patience that is beneficial for contemplation and meditationLord the noble sons and daughters who will teach and practice this exposition of the Dharma will be honored and served by me and my followersThey will know the devas and asuras And they will know the asura maidens And know the delights of the asurasRemember the sweetsounding and soft words Of Dīpankara when he gave his prophecyWhat are the conditions for their arising and what are the conditions for their ceasingNārāyaṇa bodhisattva great beings should have conviction in these four inconceivable thingsSeeing the many faults of saṃsāra They go toward nirvāṇa As soon as the mealtime ended the monastery reappeared as before while the monks also resumed their peaceful demeanorsThus concludes the chapter on prāṇa practices twentysecond in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole Heronanda strive in faithEach day every day he established ninetynine hundred thousand quintillion beings irreversibly in the DharmaThe nature of nonarising is indeed physical formsThey lead countless millions Of beings to the highest enlightenmentThose who are born in unfordable rivers take on a cloudy blue appearanceBecause of that prayer he has now been singled out by the Tathāgata as supreme among those who have attained discerning wisdomand Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara vanished into the skyA summary Killing an arhat causing a schism in the saṅghafor it leads to the perfection of all virtuous qualitiesand placed his hands together in the gesture of homage facing in the direction of Blessed One while asking the Blessed One as follows This samādhi of peace is taught by one Who has the strength of wisdom the qualities of the Dharmathey will proceed on the path to enlightenment and they will also enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas They cannot be overcome by anyoneLakṣaṇasamalakṛta Svaravyūha SvaraviśuddhiprabhaGreat bodhisattva beings always achieve and maintain this reality through undistracted attention endowed with omniscienceIf you were to then bring that entire amount of merit togetherthe sum total of the merit of all those beingsit would effectively be analogous to carrying out an extravagant offering ceremonyAnd also for the sake of buddhahoods wisdom Maintaining correct conductJust as the lion destroys the jackal You defeat the unwise tīrthikas Ah Come here and lead your saṅgha Ah Arise and go to that forest Supuṣpacandra who was like the king of mountains Adorned by the thirtytwo signsand so on down to I possess the transcendent perfection of wisdomRather it is painted by the peacocks own karmaThey cleaned polished and sanitized A jewel bowl called Moon Which cost one hundred thousand coins for just one ouncenot occurringBy the power of the Buddha Māra Pāpīyān then asked Mañjuśrīand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the sensory elements from the eyes to mental phenomena are emptyHe entered through his mothers right sideI give you the wisdom of the tathāgatas and the selfarisen wisdomThe young man stood up weeping And at that time spoke to the JinaIt is the buddha seal of as many perfectly awakened thusgone arhats as there are grains of sand in the river Gangesthe Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva SamantabhadraThen paying homage to the Blessed One Brahmā master of the world akra lord of the gods and the four great kings simultaneously with a single thought and in the same cadence said to the Blessed OneAll the grains of sand in the great ocean And of sand in the rivers ponds and pitsOffers discriminating gnosisthe four concentrations in order to master the entire desire realmThey are without conceptual elaborationBecause a bodhisattva is not born in an outlying continent nor is he born on the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha on the western continent of Aparagodānīya or on the northern continent of Uttarakuru Rather a bodhisattva is born on the southern continent of Jambudvīpaflirted with groped and tickled one anotherthe love that is contemplation because it refrains from indulgence in tastesbut the tathāgatas attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of their defining characteristicsand similarly the nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is omniscienceWithout being preoccupied or upset and by means of strong wishes and powerful faith a noble son or daughter may remain attentive to the greatness of the thusgone ones for a period of seven nightsif some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone else should say that these particular contaminants of mine have not ceased I would correctly disregard that reason for contradicting me and so on in the same vein as beforeIn their hundreds of thousands Came into his presence holding yakṣa flowers Thus emerges this great mass of nothing but sufferingOne part the lack of natureIt will be a great blessing for gods and humans To witness the newborn taking seven steps To see him received by akra and Brahmā And to see the Pure Being bathed with perfumed waterThis is a special quality of the Buddha We bow to you who command the force of leadership and the ten powersMoreover āradvatīputra demonic forces will transform themselves into the guise of a monastic preceptor or an authentic master and approach great bodhisattva beingsThe heart children of the sugatas were revealedSubhūti if all sentient beings were to approach those great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfections of tolerance and reprimand them with disingenuous negative words and even cut off their limbs and appendages they would thinkAs he travels the provincial kings of the eastern lands will come to greet him carrying silver vessels filled with gold dust and gold vessels filled with fragments of silver Welcome lord they will say Please comeHe had complete impartiality with regard to all beings and his weapon was generosityHe said that within the nature of the realm of phenomena there is neither affliction nor purificationOne should meditate on this goddess While focused on the innate AcalaBecause of the previous aspirations of the Bodhisattva his intentions were accomplishedYou should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest the nature of an ordinary person without abandoning your cultivated spiritual natureEncircled by their kindred and filled with joy Seeking the highest vast wisdomIt passes quickly like a cascading waterfallWhatever they observed howsoever they observed it they saw as emptyFor example Subhūti space is neither the maturation of past actions nor does it possess the attributes of maturationHas been taught many times in words with an implied meaning That those who are untrained could not understand They bathed the body of the Guide with pure clean and fragrant waterShe has great wisdom sharp faculties The actions of her body speech and mind are preceded by wisdomfor a hundred thousand yearssome goddesses were proffering vessels of all types of powdered flowers perfume incense flower garlands and ointmentsSon of noble family it is in this way that bodhisattvas connect to those who have interest in the practice that is the lack of essential nature of all practices the practice that has no ripening the practice that has no dwelling the practice that has no transference the practice that has no birthThen all of a suddenMaitreya how do such bodhisattvas have excellent compassionThe monks asked him Venerable what motivates such diligence in youand a rain of divine lotus flowers fell from the skyI have a few questions that I would like to bring before the Blessed One the thusgone worthy perfect Buddhaknelt on his right kneeAnd an endless multitude of human flowers A multitude of great herbs growBy focusing in the same way in the center of ones headSimilarly I must establish this many sentient beings in the ten powers of the tathāgatas and so on up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas but I must not establish that many in all these fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasBhagavat how can we obtain the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās so that we can dedicate ourselves to liberationThat is why the throats of women are flat unlike those of menWhen cranes peacocks parrots and myna birds were singingAnd with compassion for endless beings With no regard for your own life you came here viAs an analogy although fruit is produced from a floweralong with Senior Subhūti Senior āradvatīputra Senior Maudgalyāyana Senior Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra Senior Mahākāśyapa Senior Mahākauṣṭhila Senior Kātyāyana Senior nandaThey who know the peace that is the nature of phenomena Are heart children of the Sugata who do not abandon the trainingincreases wealth multiplies crops repels enemy armies quells the torments caused by famines and prolongs lifeThen the wise one did not die at that time And his life was empowered to be extremely longIs superior and beautiful Unique in all these worldsIn this Siṃhala Island you have a home with food a home with drink a home with clothesthey are protean Humans see the yakṣas In the form of lions tigers or horses Buffaloes cows asses camels Or elephants Bears leopards or jackals Dogs foxes or goats In the form of cats rats or monkeys In the form of rhinoceroses boars mongooses Fish or turtles Some are seen in the form of otters Others are seen in the form of crows owls or cuckoos Vultures falcons or timitimiṅgila fish Still others are seen In the form of peacocks or swans Swans curlews Or wild cockshe departed from this Sahā worldThey are girls who can grant true accomplishmentAll LuminousTheir generosity is not motivated by a wish for famethose I have placed outside at the entrance door of the house outside so that you can play with themThen one should cook it with one cup of sesame oilTherefore Maitreya do not fool and delude these deitiesDesire is terrifying like the wrath of the nāga girlsand in this land he suffered misfortuneand the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas have the defining characteristic of unsurpassibilityWith buddha wisdom they teach the Dharma To all of the beings who are in the worldSimilarly the ten powers of the tathāgatas have been taught without apprehending anythingYou may wonder how bodhisattvas illuminateSuch a kṣatriya will be deprived of all the happiness of the god and human realms and will go to the lower realmsYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of ignorance What are the four kinds of knowledge of ignoranceBy such causes conditions and bases they do not fall into a view of annihilationHis Dharma will remain during the time Of a full forty intermediate eonsThey will consolidate in the three vehicles sentient beings who are neither fettered nor liberatedAlas those who remain in the world are ablaze with the fire of desireAt the central channel where both vitality and exertion are constrictedwho prayed for the highest complete enlightenment and my mind never wavered from thatnot to give up great loveInside the city are various mansions Made of the seven types of precious substances With trees of various jewels And the symphonic warbling of birdsThis Dharma teaching is like the father and mother of all thusgone onesSubhūti Indeed there are irreversible great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomGo before the Peaceful One the One Who Is LiberatedHe replied This is owing to their uncrushability by all things andWho will become the following buddha And has completed the accumulation of merit and wisdom xxxiiiWe bow to you who having gone beyond stand on firm groundThat man then approached King Candraprabha and saidI shall liberate all sentient beings from the unbearable fears of the ocean of cyclic existenceThe Blessed One decreed Their going forth should not be allowed eitherAnd as all the words will have been subverted No understanding will be possible from speech This is the name empowermentThere is an inconceivable accumulation of meritThe lord buddhas are endowed with coppercolored nailsThus to ripen such beings and in order to defeat nonBuddhists bodhisattvas demonstrate the practice of austeritiesand one day in the form of a manfrom the bottom of their hearts they dedicate their studies to the buddhas and bodhisattvas with a supreme and superior intentAs for the stages of sprinkling and offering the oblation Offer them in orderAt the same time the victorious ones in the ten directions who tame gods and humansMonks knowing that it was time for the ThusGone One to eat at that very moment the four great kings appeared from the four directions carrying four golden alms bowlsThen the executioner named Nandika Cruel and malevolent followed himMay you rain down the waters of Dharma most sublimeThe mantra to recite for making vast offerings and offering the oblation to me and my retinue is thissupreme aspiration to enlightenment And they scattered divine flowers on the handsomeAfter a time he saw in a forest of śāla trees a monastery with a high gate skylights and latticed windowsSeated he asked Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraBlessed One what qualities should a bodhisattva great being possess in order to swiftly achieve acceptance that phenomena are unbornIn the emptiness of essential nature the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities is not discernedSubhūti because all these attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are not entitiesOne should visualize oneself in the form of Vāgīśvara surrounded by the four goddesses as described beforeSteady as you are this group is eager to hear The reason for your smile the extrasensory power realizing knowledge of the minds of others  the extrasensory power realizing knowledge of the recollection of past lives and  the extrasensory power realizing knowledge of the cessation of contaminantsSome said The sound is surely from Prince Sarvārthasiddha who has strung his grandfathers bowThey were skilled in comprehending the mental attitudes and interests of all sentient beings and the knowledge that engages in subtletydisplaying the form of a bodhisattva to sentient beings who are to be trained by the form of a bodhisattvaMay you rule in accord with the Dharmawhere he was revered by his fourfold retinue as well as by kings princes royal ministers vassal kings and attendants Likewise his followers among the military the priests the merchants the householders and the royal court revered him Both city dwellers and those who lived in the countryside as well as the adherents of extremist philosophies ascetics priests logicians and wandering hermits also revered him He was treated as their master and showed great respect Presented with offeringswere now also pervaded and illumined by the lightHomage to noble Mañjuśrī the youthful one Homage to the noble goddess TārāThey should be known to have seen the tathāgatasBrahmins skilled in interpreting omens and signs made this prophecyThe great sage then left Kapilavastu and returned to his hermitagethe bodhisattvas continue to practice the path of enlightenmentGiving these kinds of gifts That are of many different kindsWith superior insight dedicate merit as wellIf one cannot see the tip of ones nose one will die within five monthsThe devas and humans the yakṣas and nāgas The apsaras gandharvas and kinnarasslander of the Buddha have the intention to attain supreme perfect enlightenmentIt is the supreme wealth of conduct that is praised by the buddhas It is as undefiled as lightning in the sky the cessation of birth arrests aging and death and sorrow lamentation suffering unhappiness and strifeIn the West they stir divisionSister he replied my hands were cut off when I was still a householderHere after the element of consciousness has assumed the element of dharmas it develops divine visionIn whichever direction the Bodhisattva would extend his hand the mother of the Bodhisattva would turn to face that wayHe will honor them in many ways Andand inquired of the Blessed OneI will practice the transcendent perfection of perseverance by any means until such faults arising from the indolence of these sentient beings no longer occur and are nonexistent and until all sentient beings indeed begin striving for definitive excellence dependent on virtuous actions and attain final nirvāṇa through whichever of the three vehicles is appropriateignoring the lions display Find delight in fox affairsIn the crosslegged pose for seven daysAt that time the bodhisattva great being Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin rose from his seatCome on Let us advance with a great armyHe is seen in the world as a tathāgata adorned with hundreds of thousands of marks like a reflected image and he does not move from his placethe samādhi named Door of the Celestial PalaceSubhūti do you think that you should consider anything which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment but which is other than illusion or other than illusionlike mindIf the Blessed One encourages youthful Mañjuśrī to teach the DharmaThen the Blessed One addressed those gods inhabiting the world system of desire and those gods inhabiting the world system of form as followsDivine son similarly for bodhisattva great beings it is better to conduct themselves without reference points even if it involves transgressionWhy did you not tell us That our benefactor was leavingThis queen of all incantations Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm is a Dharma teaching that liberates from all grahas It is the seal of many buddhas as many perfectly awakened thusgone arhats as there are grains of sand in the river GangesWhen they practice patience they declare We have patience while those others bear harmful thoughtswhile doing so they consider how all these phenomena abide in the mind arise from the mind and are preceded by the mindmade paper of my own skin ink from my blood and a pen from my bone without concern for life and limb Thus through whatever truth and honest words may be in my devotion to the Dharma through such truth and honest words may all the great beings who teach and expound on the Dharma whether in this world or anotherSo will one revolve due to the maturation of karmaMahāghoṣasvararājaA few grams of which is worth the whole trichiliocosm filled with jewelsJust as the eyes are not the bodhisattva and therefore cannot receive any prophecyIn the court Of Kuberas fourth oldest son Whose name is Kalaśodarathe sound of the supreme leaderUltimately they have neither body nor mind yet in the relative truth of the world they have accomplished the bases of miraculous powerand in the same vein this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathI will definitely practice generosity by offering clothingHave forsaken their previous bad companions And have an unsurpassable inheritance of wealth Their Dharma also will remain for the same length of timeThe gods waved cloths and scattered a rain of flowersWhen bodhisattvas meet a master a preceptor a guru or a fellow studentA liberated one who liberates beingsrather all their sufferings will come to an endthey are unable to find their way home or to their bedBhagavān those world realms are numberless are innumerable and are beyond the capacity of the mindWithout needing direction it comprehends all needsPacifying enriching and enthrallingMañjuśrī a physician who has the ability to heal is rareThus bodhisattvas cannot be ignoredSupratiṣṭha Sāgara And the nāga king Manasvin The nāga king Anavatapta And the pair Nanda and Upanandaka Vajramati Vakṣunanda Gaṅgā Nanda Sindhu Sāgara And Suparṇī king of birds Who with millions And billions of nāgas Churn up the ocean They and their fortunate daughters Join their palmsMonks the Great TopKnotted Brahmā knew the nature of the ThusGone Ones thoughts and he was aware of the opinions among the people of MagadhaHis experience of taste is unexcelledSimilarly those great bodhisattva beings who wish to abandon the paths of the ten nonvirtuous actionsAnd the ḍākinī is the sunThey are not slain by fire or weapons They are not killed by poison or drowningHaving lived in such a terrible epoch nanda I have kindled great compassionsimilarly

delightthey will not be subdued by all those demonic forcesHere I have reached the city of fearlessness Where suffering born of craving by means of sensory experience And suffering based on the aggregates Will arise no moreThe beings in hell those who are animalsSometimes the gods in the heaven of the ThirtyThree become so intensely and continuously oblivious from playing with enjoying and delighting themselves with their divine pleasuresWith minds equal to space they do not perceive even the Buddha It is the absence of arising  It is the absence of continuationReverend Mahākāśyapa just

mendicants What is the knowledge of using examples It is having the knowledge of similarities and the knowledge of teachingYoung man I am omniscient I am allseeingAnd similarly patience toward abuse and threats Through patience they are established in the highest enlightenment Like the lord of elephants he slowly walked aboutWhen he said the letter ca out came the statement The path of the four noble truths caturāryasatyapathaThus my friends as this body is only a vessel of many sicknesses wise men do not rely on itWhat is no longer having frowns It is being without angerthe land was in all regards excellentSo they endeavor in the application of the remedies to desire anger and dullness so that they may all come to an endand for the sake of all sentient beings in common they exhibit endurance satisfaction and confidence with respect to all phenomena These attributes are called the armor of the transcendent perfection of toleranceSupreme enlightenment will not be difficult to attain For thoseand exhibit himself dispensing generosity or exhibit himself keeping the vows of ethical disciplinedo not accept that they are both practicing and not practicing and do not accept that

hereTheir friends are the aids to enlightenmentThose who delight in study discipline and generosity Are endowed with patience and gentlenessseated at the Focal Point of EnlightenmentUltimately they do not reify them either and they are not attached to themThey had no yearning no aspiration for a sūtra like this and opposed it and attacked itNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are endowed with skillful meansSimilarly they do not consider the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and likewise all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are permanent or that they are impermanent that they are imbued with happiness or that they are imbued with suffering that they are a self or that they are not a self or In the same vein that they are pure or that they are impure and so forthHe became the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha named JñānaśūraSeeing that it was now midnight the Bodhisattva called upon ChandaThe gods will all guard protect and preserve him and all of his purposes will be fulfilledThe inferior are to apply themselves to the eyes of the central figureAwakening Mañjuśrī is by nature luminous because the mind is by nature luminous that is why it is said to be luminous by natureabandoned and let go of my bones and marrowthe charioteer of those to be guided by the unexcelled being who possesses the four types of confidenceNoble son when bodhisattvas give up all such associations they must not become hostile to any of these peopleI will love others in the same way that I love myselfAnd no concept of view and no concept of no view imentally practice the three modes of excellent conductYou should make offerings to that sage as he practices to fulfill his aspirationsThe perishing of the decrepit aggregates is deathAs a sharp pain shot through his heart he began to schemeand causes the entire world with its devas humans and asuras to hear his speechnail it with a peg one finger long made of bone or ironMoreover if because of its unvirtuous actions a snake does bite the snake itself will diethey will all have great miraculous abilities great power the eight liberations and dhyānaYou may wonder how bodhisattvas bring the qualities of buddhahood to maturationWhen those sugatas have passed into nirvāṇathe deva śvara the deva MaheśvaraHe had complete knowledge of others previous lives And he had transcended the worldOne should visualize the syllables in reverse orderWhen faced with the pleasant and the unpleasant They always have a liberated mind I will definitely offer chariots palanquins horses elephants and shoesSpoke unpleasant things to me for an entire eonAfter all since the earth contains many gems its surface is covered with one beauty after anotherThe king was informed of this reply and thoughtDivine son understanding this utter wishlessness is awakeningThe goddess then saidFinally during the last part of the night he summoned the five excellent companions and saidin the same way the formless element of consciousness carried by formless merit is made to give rise to divine bodiesIf someone had to insert into their fingernail The entire element of earth And having done so go away And climb up to the world of BrahmāWho has meditated on this stainless samādhi of peace Blessed One may all beings achieve this absorption that encapsulates all meritThe deer and birds contemplate deeply in that wayWhen sentient beings see these forms they will long to have themThus the emptiness of omniscience is indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they cannot be bisectedSupramundane physical forms are neither fettered nor liberated and similarly supramundane feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberatedLike the coral tree or the kovidāra tree this was a tree that one could never tire of beholdingBhagavān the number of those world realms would be incalculableAccordingly Nārāyaṇa you should listen carefully and keep in mind what I am about to sayWhy Because gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas and demigods understand that before long the bodhisattva will sit at the seat of awakeningfor it leads to the pure teaching of the DharmaSubhūti reversible bodhisattvas may be called irreversibleSo she let the ornaments be thrown into the pondThe light from his burning right hand made that of the many quintillions of offering lamps seem darkand when they see one they will be delighted and rejoiceThen with his stainless hand radiating hundreds of light rays tender and smooth shining brighter than the rays of the sun adorned with the signs of past virtuous conduct as soft as the bulb of a lotus flower and whose palm had the design of a thousandspoked wheel the Blessed One stroked the heads of the Licchavi people and instructed themthen noble ones do you think that anyone could conceive of or calculate count or determine the number of those world realmsYou do not know do not hear the sounds of people speaking or the sounds of drums conches and so on which are five yojanas awayThis is the way that bodhisattvas apply the remedy for anger and give up the conditions for anger to ariseAlso they should reflect Alas This cyclic existence is limitless like space Alas This world system of sentient beings is limitless like space and yet apart from the conventional designations sentient being cyclic existence and liberation there are no sentient beings at all who are trapped within cyclic existence or who attain nirvāṇa There are no sentient beings at all who attain final liberationPerforming enlightened activity in the trichiliocosmBhaiṣajyarāja will take those sights as a signwho lived and dwelt in the ṣipatana Deer Park near VārāṇasīWill in accordance with Vajradharmas words Hereby experience the supreme accomplishmentFurthermore in this buddhafield he will teach them the Dharma called The Wheel of No ReturnThe wise are in accord with other wise people Like butter is with ghee the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhatThose who have not trained in pure conduct And who have no wisdom will not see them Therefore young man follow my teaching And maintain this restraint of the bodyThen the Bhagavat the tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha ākyamuni askedO Wonderful King of Dharma you turned the wheel of Dharma before men and gods With its threefold revolution its manifold aspects Its extreme peace and its purity of natureAfter Matīśvara there was a buddha A jina who was named Brahmeśvara they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed and unimpeded with respect to the futurenever separate from Dharma teachers of vast learningTo you Sage of the ākyas bull among men honored by gods and humans we pay homagenot to be seen or beheld hanging in the atmosphere beyond visible rangeOn the way he passed by the Nairañjanā Riverand contentment thatand red pearls so that all these are contained within spaceWithin that pore there are  mountainsVenerable Lord The sentient beings of Jambudvīpa are many let alone the sentient beings in this world system of the great trichiliocosmThere the Thusgone worthy perfect Buddha Ratnaketu at present lives and teaches the DharmaNoble one these bodhisattva mahāsattvas all have instant comprehensionI will pronounce their names So please listen to me Lord of the WorldThe bodhisattva Sunetra declared Their luminosity radiates as they walk  They satisfy whichever gods and humans encounter themOnce I have conquered him all the gods in the desire realm will also be restrainedthen once sentient beings have been favored with the power of the instructionsFalse and deceptive such phenomena fool childish beingsWith perfectly pure wisdom he was turning the wheel of DharmaBodhisattvas are generous because they desire enlightenment That is the uniqueness of this attainment of samādhi I was offered this because the benefactor knew of my discipline great learning and humble waysThat noble man or noble woman will be seated at the BodhimaṇḍaMāra Pāpīyān saidI am freed from blindnessCompared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consisting of the bodhisattvas acts of giving would not even amount to a hundredth partBlessed One how do bodhisattvas revel in superknowledgenanda think of this example Consider a man who is strong and wellregarded but has only one sonnanda the bodhisattva mahāsattvas of the past who were practicing infinite bodhisattva conductThat fruit is empty too It has no coming It has no going No one makes it arise It is not stopped by anybodythen great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom in that manner will have the good fortune to actualize manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenmentAnd followed that which was not the DharmaYou should not teach them austerity But instead you should praise generosity Devas asuras and nāgas upon seeing it Were astonished and cried out Ha ha ha xithe emptiness of nondispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all thingsThe vinaya of the hearers does not contain all the teachings of the Buddha and it also lacks skillful meansUntil one reaches unsurpassable complete and perfect awakening the state of truly perfect awakening ones actions will be conducive to itnothing was ever destroyed is destroyed or will ever be destroyedthe width of his body is proportionate to its length and its length is proportionate to its widthOh the suffering Oh the suffering Death is sufferingSubhūti do you think that the sentient beings inhabiting this world system of the great trichiliocosm are manyThey attain the enlightenment that is peace free of misery They perceive beings afflicted by illness and agingThere on the lion throne of the Dharma may they thoroughly trample on Māra in order to overcome himThey should also encourage others to acquire the maturity of the bodhisattvasThrough wisdom that realizes That phenomena are by nature empty And that nothing intrinsically arises You reached the other shore and wholly perfected the wisdom of a buddhaNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities access emptinessthe samādhi named UnadorningMañjuśrī he said you say that all phenomena are the nature of the realm of phenomenaand swiftly attain emancipation in omniscience without ever descending to the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasThe Blessed One then addressed akra mighty lord of the godsA follower of Mantra who has a pure bodyIn that kūṭāgāra appeared a throne spread with many hundreds of thousands of calico clothsand all those pratyekabuddhas of the present who abide in the innumerable countless world systems of the ten directionsDwell in lovingkindness and be compassionateThis light illuminated the entire great trichiliocosmHe who is involved in sights sounds categories and ideas is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in sights sounds categories and ideasthey do not become vindictiveThrough the karma we created in the past We have these brilliant beautiful airborne palaces Accept them out of compassion for us Knower of the world enjoy them in whatever way you wishIts king uddhodana descends from pure families on both his mothers and fathers side His wife as well is pureBodhisattvas will rest in meditation When their mind is focused upon that image Alas what shall I do god of gods I am helpless and go to you for refuge vafter training in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationThe ordinand prostrates to and kneels before himAnd attain the voice with sixty aspects That is what is called the purest restraint of the mind Even though they have this beauty they are not afflicted by the suffering of desireChanda for countless eons beyond measure I have enjoyed the many sense pleasures of humans and gods In the manner of forms sounds smells tastes and textures Yet I have failed to become satisfiedMāra will find no opportunity To cause harm to the oneThey sat crosslegged in the flowersnor that of which one is ignorant the ignorance or the one who is ignorantAnd make love to the motherYou are skilled in the nature of phenomena selfarisen one Therefore ocean of wisdom I have asked you my questions Reverend Maudgalyāyana that is not the way to teach the Dharma to the householders in their white clothesHaving made the offering they sat fanning the Blessed One with a chowriea core of emerald and flower anthers made of the light of Brahmās precious stonethe illusory absorption Moreover as soon as they attain that absorption they emanate whatever bodies in whatever way will perfect sentient beings roots of virtueOnce he has sat at the Bodhimaṇḍa The conceptions of Māra cease Thus bodhisattvas bring down a continuous and delightful flower rain of the true and indisputable Dharma from wishfulfilling trees upon the circles of their retinueName is empty of name In names there are no namesNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten such qualities have knowledge of the worldBodhisattvas are beyond all forms of fixation and so they engage with all aspects of the world without fixationSuch forms are of yourself as well All that has been explainedNoble son replied the Blessed OneO Jina you who teach the supreme Dharma You have the power of a lord of liberating wisdomFor example Subhūti space is not something that is seen nor is it heard remembered or cognizedrefraining from struggle about causes and conditionsIn whatever endeavor one may be involved one should offer an oblationWhoever understands nirvāṇa wellBhaiṣajyarāja I prophesy that all of them will attain the highest complete enlightenmentwho perceive that they are attractiveand performed such a miraculous feat that those bodhisattvas and those great disciples were enabled to see the universe called Sarvagandhasugandhā which is located in the direction of the zenith beyond as many buddhafields as there are sands in fortytwo Ganges riversSixteen paired Is concealed in the amount of eightWith vajra confidence you accomplish all samaya vowsIt is comparable to a reflection in a mirror or the imprint of a seal in clayIf I am to be a monk it would not be right to wear silken garments So it would be good if I could find some clothes suitable for living in the forestThis is an extremely profound questionHarboring the correct viewnor are going and abiding discernibleThey talk with each other about the sūtras the geyas the vyākaranas the gāthās the udānas the nidānas the avadānas the itivrttakas the jātakas the vaipulyas the adbhūtadharmas and the upadeśasWhy is it freedom from miseryI answered I havent seen anyIn the same vein it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena and to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities that the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are nonexistent HoweverThey will not memorize such Dharma teachings nor read them aloudHaving killed his mother he left trembling like a man who has committed a sināradvatīputra do you think that the designations of the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty as entities or nonentities constitute a bodhisattvathinking I should dwell in JambudvīpaYou will not know what to do or where to goMy five ascetic companions are pure and goodhearted They will make good teachers who are able to purify othersThey will travel

trillion yearsHe gathers together great herbs with excellent color aroma and taste and grinds them on a stoneso they came to me and saidReverend Pūrṇa without examining the spiritual faculties of living beings do not presume upon the onesidedness of their facultiesIt is in this way that they should train in the transcendent perfection of wisdomProtecting all sentient beings from the fears of afflictionOur births have been exhaustedThat restraint of the mind through which wise ones Do not act with pretense for even an instantIf by some rare chance one should be born as a human it will be as someone uncouth with red eyes ferocious and maliciousthe fruit of no longer being subject to rebirthBy uniting beings one will have ones say By outshining all voices one will have a voice like BrahmāAll those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing going forth without consulting the saṅghaEven their behavior was as if they had already been ordained for a hundred yearsmay then let go of the formative predispositions of his current lifespan having sent forth an emanationāradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who would cultivate the transcendent perfection of wisdom without attention endowed with omniscienceThrough this kind of giving of giftsThen invite the protector Vaiśravaṇa The central figure surrounded by a retinue of ten million yakṣas The recipient of the offerings of the eight nāga kingsThen the Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva SatatasamitābhiyuktaHe follows the ways of the dumb and the incoherent yet having acquired the power of retention he is adorned with a varied eloquenceIf you ask why Subhūti it is because physical forms are uncreated undestroyed and unconditionedTheir sixty thousand bronze cauldrons are filled with fine cooked rice and vegetables each with its own uniquely delicious aromaremoved his robe from one shoulder and kneeling on his right kneehe illuminated the entire area surrounding the fig tree with divine light beautiful in color and he approached the ThusGone One When he arrivedWhy does it not base itself in that very corpse The Blessed One answered in returnThe allseeing lords of the worlds See into the ten directions They open the door to deathlessness Andthe south sank and the north rosethe samādhi named Liberation from the SensesIt is difficult to approach their level They are without idlenessHe will not perceive them as his master For these reasons this Dharma teaching will vanishTherefore divine son ultimately all phenomena are the sameDrink the water of Akṣobhya O son Be my slave as well as my fatherEvil one today you will be depleted of life force by the Bodhisattva Like grass and trees by the fire at the end of an eonSo please listen for the sake of mundane accomplishmentsThis is life and that is liberationThe Bhagavān ākyamuni Tathāgata PrabhūtaratnaSo long as doubt remains going naked With matted hair smeared in mud a motley dietthe bodhisattvas of the final five hundred years will no longer give rise to desire for worldly affairs Therefore please do explain themleaves flowers fruit ropeWhen the monks measured the length of a shadow in steps it proved too difficultat that time in that era there appeared in the world the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddhabeautiful lion thrones that were five hundred yojanas in height and were made from divine jewelsSome laughed played and had fun trying to attract each others attentionDivine son ultimately all phenomena are discerned by knowledgeBhikṣus therefore on this day I declare That just this is not nirvāṇaAnd with an unafflicted mind Seek the Buddhas wisdom Consider noble son how water can make the web of the roots of trees and grass rotDo not generate desire for the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomBecause it brings defeat to all those who believe in objective reality and have wrong viewsTeach to me Lord a beneficial DharmaIt is indeed something to despise it is indeed disagreeable it is indeed not something worthy of being looked uponand five hundred yojanas wideāradvatīputra so it is that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom refine the path to enlightenment and also enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasdragged me up by the leg from among the denizens of hell animals and spiritsThe thorough cognition of the ear is to be ungraspableWhen she hears the request of the gods she brings milk porridge with honeyThis wheel is essential because it leads to the attainment of vajralike wisdomthe elephant the stainless one the one who has abandoned the three stainsNoble son you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas excellent power of an unbreakable commandWith four feet or two feet With feet above and face belowAt the seat of awakening there were sixteen gods who guarded the placeDivine princes it is for that reason that you should know great bodhisattva beings who practice this transcendent perfection of wisdom inseparably to be like the tathāgatasI renounced my family and it has not been long bhikṣus since I have attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodWe travel swiftly and without impediment Penetrating the supreme Mount Meru and likewise the surrounding rangesHere all the ninetyeight latent formations Down to the bottom of their roots And all their sprouting shoots Were burned up by the fire of my wisdomand the other ones with the title of great lord bowed their heads to the ThusGone Ones feetHowever thinking that it could not be true after all he again returnednor are

disintegration the intrinsic nature beyond accepting and discarding the intrinsic nature truly beyond the realm of words the intrinsic nature beyond speech the intrinsic nature beyond constructs the inexpressible intrinsic nature the peaceful intrinsic nature and the intrinsic nature of the noble onesBut that name cannot be found anywhere And that name did not come from anywhere In that regard

immaculate And therefore naturally allpervadingMaṇikaṇṭha and NikaṇṭhakaAlways becoming masters of these in this world āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who are unskilled in practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom apprehend physical forms and develop a view of physical forms in an apprehending mannerOn the eighth lunar day people of the four great kings should reflect on that sūtra in the presence of the four kingsgarlands unguents powdersVenerable Lord If irreversible great bodhisattva beings are endowed with such enlightened attributesSome are made of diamondsFinally one of the ministers saw the Bodhisattva seated crosslegged practicing concentration in the shade of a rose apple treethe samādhi of the torch of knowledgeTheir activities appeared inconceivable to me to the point that I was unable to think of them to judge them or even to imagine themāriputra this buddha realm is beautifully adorned by such displays of the excellences of buddha realmsEven then not one of them would understand the field of experience practice or liberation of a single oncereturnerof the store of all roots of virtue consummated in the abandonment of all afflictions obscurations and unvirtuous thingsāradvatīputra this is just as when the grain bins of a householder farmer have been placed on either side of his doorway filled with diverse grainsThe fourth great merit results in becoming the god Suyāmabut no sprout will emerge from a seed that is rottenThe Buddha the Lord of the three worlds Traveled on that road to the capital cityAll negative emotions had been cleared away along with his mental stainsAt that point the two bodhisattvas miraculously transformed this Sahā world so that it became as even as the palm of a handBeings are not perceived and there is no lifeWithin that space there are some who hear The Guide lives and he teaches the Dharma Those who are established in the wisdom of higher knowledgeAt this the prostitute thoughtThe bodhisattvas have asked me this How could buddhas who possess vajra bodies dharmadhātu bodies bodies of nonduality possibly die at some location on earthobserve a discipline that is perfectly free from subject object and actionOh Oh You awaken millions of beingsAnd establish them in the highest yāna xviiiWe bow to you who stand nowhere like infinite spaceAre you a male The postulant responds I am a maleand likewise they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path leading to the cessation of sufferingAt that time those who had listened to them All became the śrāvakas of those jinasThey are the inconceivably numerous accumulations of eloquence concerning the compositeOn a vast ocean of sorrow This sublime vessel has appearedthe monks did not allow others to go forth who cameThe youth Candraprabha placed his palms together bowed toward the Bhagavān and asked himThe great physician should be seen to be the Tathāgatathey think May the wishes of all sentient beings be fulfilled by means of this gift of the sacred doctrineThen the great disciples bowed down to the Tathāgata Merupradīparāja and they were seated upon the thronesOn hearing this verse the lad thought They know that existents are nonexistent And do not give rise to attachment to existentsKauśika it is dependent on these great bodhisattva beings that rebirths among the denizens of the hells will be cut offShall be one who associates with good peopleDelighted to some he gives bracelets And cords of silver and of goldHow could I accompany him when he uses his miraculous powers and great might to travel therea profusion of mango trees appears star jasmine flowers and magnolia trees appear ponds covered with flowers appear and precious trees appearYoung man you should apply yourself diligently as if your hair and clothes were on fire and listen to the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaThe nature is utterly luminousAlas these are Pāpīyāns attempts to ridicule meThe venerable Saṅgharakṣita thoughtThe numerous miracles manifested by the Sugata Could not easily be described in ten million eonsLater he went to the hermitage of a sagely priest called Raivata who offered the Bodhisattva hospitality in the same wayThey will obtain an adorned palanquin That will be carried by many menThis supremely wise one will surely Hurl the people who are bloated with the strength of pride Far beyond the city of saṃsāra Alone through the strength of his insightat that time you will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThen throughout an entire sixty intermediate eons That jina taught the supreme Dharma In the east one should draw A sword of white color marked with a wheelThen they will have no suffering And they will not go to the lower realms Thereby he generates the love that is firm its high resolve unbreakable like a diamondOnce this is done and the entire saṅgha has assembledThe sons for their part are patricides wholly intent on fornication and nothing but enemies One should therefore kill themThey appeared auspiciously where the Guide placed his wheelmarked feetWith a peaceful demeanor Saṅgharakṣita approached them but when he requested a place to stayMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see beings indulging in acquisitiveness and practicing the five negative actions which arise on account of itEach day it waxes until it is completely fullthe duration of their Dharma will also be the sameShould find a girl from his own spiritual family or that of another And meditate while holding herAfter prostrating to the shrines with them Saṅgharakṣita sat on the seat they had arranged at the center of the assembled nāgasas when the two great doors of a great citys gate separate after the bolt has been removedSubhūti you have said that if all things are empty of inherent existenceHe was like a conflagration raging atop a mountain peak in the middle of a dark night and brilliant and shining like a golden mountainfor it performs the activity of a thusgone oneswam to the shoreWhen youthful Mañjuśrī had given this teaching the Blessed One expressed his approvalHaving embraced her one should later Eat fish and meatAlways find themselves before the blissful oneBhikṣus you have not done what needs to be doneIts individual features all have an intended meaningWe make a firm commitmentWherever those heroes are present Those buddha realms are not emptyThe monks said Venerables though he has only newly gone forth he has such a kind heartBhagavān no it could notThese are all stains and flaws in relation to diligenceand makes one attain limitless discipline learning absorption knowledge liberationTherefore never act carelesslyI salute you supreme holder of all good qualitiesThey should also worshipAnd in their homes villages and cities there will be peaceIt is the joy of the eldest sons It is the completion of buddha wisdomAll the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of this Auspicious Eon will indeed come to this very place andSimilarly owing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of the ten powers of the tathāgatasVenerable Lord Are those great bodhisattva beings who undertake training in order to terminate the six transcendent perfections and become detached from them so that they cease and do not arise actually training in omnisciencehe will blow the conch of the DharmaIn this regard the tenderness and softness of his hands and feet means that unlike those of human beings they resemble tree cotton or shrub cottonThe names of those princes were Mati Sumati Anantamati Ratnamati Viśeṣamati Vimatisamuddhāṭin Ghoṣamati and DharmamatiThen the kleśas will arise once more As happened in the samādhi practice of Udraka Thereupon he recited these verses and thought Ah Those rogues have

born in his buddhafieldOne by one five hundred ākyas each came forth and saidLet us go and pay homage to him serve him respect him and praise himResplendent InvincibleThe meaning of nonduality is awakening in the sense of becoming awakemastery of karmic action as one displays the blessing of ripening karma at the appropriate timeAnd in addition another triangleSubhūti others apart from that maritime merchant who are skilled in means should know that for that reason this ship will not disintegrate in the ocean and will safely and securely reach the destination which that skilled merchant intendsAmong the beings in this world there does not seem to be anyone who rivals me in power or vigor so who could be superior to me I wonderNo sooner had he entered that samādhi than golden forms of tathāgatas endowed with the thirtytwo marks of a buddha emerged from his bodythey were full of astonishment and exclaimed Although we never got up from our seats we thought that we had traveled to the Jewel WorldOne cannot measure that which is immeasurable The qualities of the guides in their entirety are inconceivable Thus the Bodhisattva was first received by the gods rather than by any humansThere were no great oceansSubhūti it is because they have no doubt indecision or hesitation regarding the finality of existence and they do not conceive of the finality of existence as singular or dualThere are five types of instructors and two types of preceptorsDevelop diligence confidently and fearlessly Delight in dhyāna and delight in solitudemaintaining the five acquisitive psychophysical aggregates which are like an echo like an optical aberration like a magical display like a mirage and like a phantomImmense pride disrespect for the Dharma deprecating the spiritual guide and speaking falsehoodsYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of words of nonmovement What are the four kinds of words of nonmovementMay you course in the sky throughout the four directions like the moonno removalThey take such downfalls seriously and confess them extensivelyThe entire realm of the Sahā world was completely pervaded by that great lightThey served four hundred thousand million buddhasSuch was the miracle that they performedupon the threshold of the gate this universe of a thousand million worlds shook in six waysNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities provide supportIn this regard the expression long and slender tongue means thatBy offering beverages one will not thirstIt will be hard to find among a hundred a thousand One who has the power of patienceOne should practice the five pledges According to the fivefold family divisionAnd where are the father and mother with pure qualitiesSo sovereign master of men do not act lustfully because of attraction to mefolded his upper robeI shall also praise the abstention from killing living creatures andWhat is an instructor of novices He is one who grants refuge and the foundations of the

in the three periods of the day  homa offerings of saltPostulants name seeks to go forth and having shaven head and face to don the saffron robesThe Blessed One replied O gods It is soThose who do not know the good Dharma generate the black darkness of the kleśas and have the blindness of ignoranceSaṅgharakṣita then began to recite the BrāhmaṇavargaWe beauties with revealing garmentsThey do not dedicate these roots of virtue to the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas but exclusively to omniscienceIn that way the Bhagavat encouraged the repetition of the sixsyllable mahāvidyāHaving received their alms they return to their dwellingsThus bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to the wildernessthe inconceivably numerous kinds of meditation on the path concerning the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous kinds of meditation on the path concerning purification Those are the fourA third time the complete assembly of bodhisattvas requested the BhagavānThe Blessed One addressed Senior āradvatīputra as followsYourself beyond you liberate sentient beings And while free yourself you liberate beingsThus you show them boundless physical deeds Skillfully performed to tame infinite beingsI do not ridicule youKnowing that the night has passed King Bimbisāra surrounded by a large retinue Arrives at the root of Pāṇḍava the king of mountainsyet

One the accomplishment of this my mantra is excellentcomplete pure and wholesome He taught all these beings how to live a life of purityAs he entered he stayed only at the right side of the womb and never on the leftThe twenty streams of passion And the twentyeight fears of beingsTransforming into respectively Wind fire water and earthWe prostrate to you luminous leader of menBlessed One the wisdom of the thusgone ones is spontaneously accomplished and beyond formationSimilarly they will not understand even a fraction of the liberation of the tathāgatas or of their liberating pristine cognitionThey will not be distressed over their children or their spousesVenerable Lord What will be the modality of those great bodhisattva beings who have conviction and concur with this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomI shall encourage others to keep abstaining from killing living creaturesHaving understood that all phenomena are without reality they observe the body with the understanding that the mind that observes the body is also just like a magical illusion or an echoBefore the blessed worthy thusgone perfect buddhasattain the state of great equanimity and attain easeful examinationWherever Your Majestys foot may fall there shall we bow our headsNoble son in the past countless eons agothe luminosity of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas does pervade the world with its gods humans and antigods numerous as the sands of the River GangesWhat is the knowledge of discernment It is the wisdom that understands the truth exactly as it issuppose there are noble men or noble women bhikṣus or bhikṣunīs upāsakas or upāsikās wise adults boys or girls who listen to this Dharma teaching being given and having heard it rejoice And having listened to the Dharma they get up and leavesays to himall phenomena became immediately apparent to me the gates to the lower realms closed completelyāradvatīputra these six transcendent perfections of great bodhisattva beings are the Great Vehicle that is retained by skillful means originating from the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptionsall causal attributes up to and including enlightenment and all fruitional attributes up to and including omniscience are absolutely voidNor do they consider that they should attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentI have cut off my hands legs eyes and my head and given them to beggarswhile gustatory consciousness is inner formNoble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are expert in the pathevery kind of jewel and various kinds of beautiful flowersSo depart from home now While you are still young and in your primeall things Subhūti are unsupported and uncontainedone will bind the teeth of water animalsMañjuśrī replied Bhagavān it is with respect to all afflictions that I have attained patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as nonarisingHaving established them in the Dharma he passed into nirvāṇa He established countless innumerable beings in the state of arhathood without outflowsBlissful One it is indeed marvelousWith all desired thingsThey are not false and dishonest They do not create animosity and they do not compete with one anotherhe taught the Dharma conjoined with the four truths of the āryas and nirvāṇa as the ultimate goal as well as the process of dependent originationPlease let me take care of the princeNow where could there be another being who is pure and easy to train Who would have all these qualities and not react against the teaching of DharmaActions never waste away Not even after one hundred eonsand then apprehends defines and engages in ideation and scrutiny with respect to themall the profundities of the Buddha I teach within this Dharma teachingthey do not consider anything at all that is to be attracted or not attracted and they do not consider anything at all that is to be increased or diminishedIn the absence of afflictions the light of insight shinesThis sacred doctrine is compatible with the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplinethe bodhisattva mahāsattvas have short bodies alsoin each of the ten directionsAnd they can do the same with as many universes as there are grains of sand in two such rivers or three or four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty or an inexpressible number of inexpressibly many such rivers Those who make offerings to millions of jinas Are wise in the practice of generosity and correct conductSubhūti the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely pure because space cannot be graspedLater during a lunar eclipse or a solar eclipseThe venerable nanda then said to the Blessed OneVenerable Gautama your senses are calmLikewise syllables are neither internal nor external nor can they be apprehended anywhere elseThey have crushed the thorns They have not left the law behindThe inconceivable expanse is nonapprehensible owing to its utter purityVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom turns the wheel of the sacred doctrine repeating it in the three times and in its twelve aspects because it is neither subject to promulgation nor reversalWhen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Ascending Vajra Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named ScatteringAs it is difficult to find a tathāgata I also will become a renunciantThereupon Senior āradvatīputra asked the Blessed OneIn this way he recollected the previous lives of himself and other sentient beingsunderstands sees or performs it precisely as it has been taught and masteredand having formed aspirations commit it to writing have it committed to writingThey do not apprehend the emptiness of the unlimited as the emptiness of the unlimitedNo Bhagavān he would not replied nanda The Bhagavān continuedwhile visual consciousness is inner formThat which is not proliferated or elaborated is the true meaningThus noble son bodhisattvas never dwellFirstly in other tantras I taught about emptiness and so forthThey who know the peace that is the nature of phenomena Never have in mind the idea I am cutting through thingsbeautified by necklaces earrings garlands various jewelry and ointmentsSubhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have established any sentient beings in toleranceThe girls however could not bear the Bodhisattvas splendor and brilliance and as soon as they received the gifts they quickly departedYoung man the eighty thousand people who with King Mahābala came into the presence of the Bhagavān the Tathāgata Ghoṣadattaand the expanse of reality is itself physical formsOnce he had mastered lettersāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousness as entities and nonentitiesthey will descend to the levels of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhasnor any obvious record of allocations Come and account for themThey themselves should also cultivate the understanding through which the fruit of entering the stream is actualized but through which the finality of existence is not actualizedThe Blessed One then replied to Senior āradvatīputraIt neither bestows nor withholds the transcendent perfection of perseverancethey should dedicate this merit toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment andSome are greater due to pedigreeThis king of mantras when recited  times according to the procedure of the preliminary practice will bring successfor it enables one to nurture all sentient beingsphysical forms do not disrupt emptiness nor does emptiness disrupt physical formsIf he renounces his pleasures his kingdom and his palaceHere after triumphing through the power of love I drank the elixir of nectar For the sake of which Those with the ten powers had cultivated love for all beingsis that they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena and owing to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristicsWhen they heard the Victorious Ones prophecyThey will be completely freed from the sufferings of aging death and illnesshe surveyed the entire world with the unobscured eye of an awakened one and began to reflectThe ground of enlightenment is the ultimate realmsimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions andLikewise I was not separated from the applications of mindfulness and the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathThey have no attachment to the world and always their food is alms And they bring many beings to supreme enlightenment āradvatīputra do you think that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena as afflicted or purified constitute a bodhisattvaPerceiving in this way they know all things to be without obscuration and thenWhen there are no concepts of phenomena Then that is known as samādhi for they will behold in their dreams the body of the Tathāgata Arhat Genuinely Perfect Buddha excellently adorned with the thirtytwo major marks of a superior manAll of these steadfast ones Great rishis who have mindfulnessNoble son bodhisattvas play no tricks with scales and measures they do not harm those who are trusting and they do not acquire things by way of deceitSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom whenever they do not engage with physical formsBoundaries will be formedIn a later time there was the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha perfect in wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings the teacher of devas and humans the buddha the Bhagavat ViśvabhūBhagavān I am astonished and amazedO Jambhā Mohā SvāhāThen the bow was placed before the ākya Daṇḍapāṇi who mustered all his bodily strength and endurance and tried to string the bow but could notNamely the conditional relation in inner dependent arising is to be seen as due to the coming together of the elements of earth water fire wind space and consciousnessTheir realm is the same as the realm of all beingsWhat has happenedBhikṣus the Mahābrahmās in the presence of the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū fittingly praised him with those verses the level of bright insight  the level of buddha nature  the level of eightfold acceptance  the level of insight  the level of attenuated refinement  the level of dispassion  the level of an arhats spiritual achievement  the level of the pratyekabuddhas  the level of the bodhisattvas and  the actual level of the genuinely perfect buddhasrecite it to others promote it proclaim it chant itIt is not like seeing an amla fruit held in ones handThey will be paralyzed and crippled For many thousand trillions of eons As numerous as the sand grains in the GangesEverything is essentially like spacethere will also be monks who perform many negative deeds and leave aside their obligations as monksHaving interrupted the flow of ambrosia dripping From the nine orifices of the one with the bellOne should incant a crows wing holding it in ones handWhoever would transgress against her Will not attain accomplishmentWhen the morning had passedEven if we had billions of eons to speak of them We would be unable to exhaust the ocean of your qualitiesToday this place is still known as The Sewing of the Dusty RagsIf it is a boy he lies with his head to the right side of the wombWashed the friend of the world Who reached the culmination of qualities and the ten powersPhenomena are perceived when No phenomena can be foundWho will serve him until he demonstrates passing into great parinirvāṇa Who can keep him company with a kind affectionate friendly loving and noble attitudeWhatever perfect beings abide in the worlds of the ten directionsWhat they offer is pure and they offer it on a vast scalejust as I want no one to kill me order someone to kill me or rejoice in my killing I myself will never kill order someone to kill or rejoice in the killing of anyonethen praised him with these versesWhile the prince was being dressed with a slight smile and no hint of annoyance he spoke these pleasant words to his maternal auntThen he asked Venerable Lord What is the refined eye of wisdom possessed by great bodhisattva beingsOne should kill Akṣobhya the father With the sword and later eat himand in the same vein they do not accept that they are neither practicing nor not practicing and so forthThe mother is the transcendence of wisdomThose who take pleasure in this teaching of the Dharma will embrace all meritsjust as plainly as a man of ordinary vision sees a myrobalan nut on the palm of his handSince all fires have died outThus bodhisattvas move in a flow of virtuous qualitiesdie among gods only to be reborn among animalsthronging with hundreds of honest women and filled with upstanding men devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned menIn that merchants home was the merchants daughter Her body was shapely she was beautiful lovely to behold and she had not yet been bestowed upon a husbandthe defining characteristic of the truth of the origin of suffering is productionWill succeed by applying this secret disciplineYour words are mild gentle and pleasing Timely melodious appropriate and belovedan unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and menI salute you who reached the other shore and remain on dry groundWherever bodhisattvas are born that place is likewise clean due to the bodhisattvas discipline and purificatory ritesand similarly owing to its sameness with emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessnesswith respect to what are they equipoised in unionThe garlands of mantra as well Should be white for peaceful red for magnetizing Yellow for increasing and black for wrathful activityAjita it is impossible for the progress toward the highest complete enlightenment made by a noble man or noble woman who possesses such an accumulation of merit to be reversiblenever despised the poor or the base never oppressed those who are without protector repaired the broken memorials of the thusgone ones built memorials and removed fear from those plagued by anxiety Therefore he is the One with Proportions of a Perfect Circle like the Nyagrodha TreeOn the contrary having precisely established that formative predispositions resemble an illusion they always work for the benefit of sentient beingsnanda the point is thatTogether with costus kaṇa and cuminOne should carefully visualize The syllable hū burned by the light raysMañjuśrī do you comprehend the utterly unarisen on the ultimate levelBlessed One Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta led usSo come let us go and see him recollection of physicality andThey will remain in solitude in the forest And they will be maligning usAnd attained the ultimate buddhahoodand reflect and meditate on itHaving overcome pride from the beginning That is what the Jina the Lord of the Dharma teaches āriputra know that in this teaching there is no second yāna anywhere in any world in the ten directions so how could there be a thirdAnd he cut up the bhikṣu like cutting up a garland of flowers What is controlling the mind It is the knowledge of how not to lose good qualitiesWith such realization bodhisattvas take up the practice of the absence of marksRatnakūṭaEliminate all pride arrogance and hiding of your faults And attain this supreme samādhi Here I recollected my former livesAs high as seven tāla trees the wheel which is not made by a smith is round with a central hub and made entirely of goldThis is the meaning of dominationThe sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage should also perfume that locale with various kinds of incense as an offering to this book of the transcendent perfection of wisdomluminosity is nondisturbanceIn the same way the Bhagavān is like that young man While these numerous bodhisattvas who have knowledgeOne should draw this on a golden tablet and keep it in the upper part of the houseDo not be afraid noble son do not be afraidJust like space that has never been burned in the past Even though the fire burns for many hundreds of eons who brings true pleasureIt does not enhance physical forms nor does it diminish themThey will make deceptive promises and be brazen saying I am wealthy and I will give the wealth of the Dharma to the worldWhat about a revered monk of six yearsIt is the knowledge of skill in what is beneficial and what is not beneficialSome are frightened by the nine conditioned entities and instead relish the taste of the nine successive attainmentsIn that respect Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata without striving or giving anything up crossed the streamEven the names of the aspects of knowledge do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoThe entire multitude of rishis in the world Came in order to see the Lord of menOne hundred mudrābalas is called a sarvabalaI never need to be appeasedAt that time there lived in the great city of Vaiśālī a certain Licchavi Vimalakīrti by nameThe mind set on enlightenment is not associated with thoughts of dedicationHaving left behind their magical illusion of a buddha They remain in great bliss which is the palace of the victorious onesassemblies of bhūtas in the eastSimilarly one should know emptiness to be emptiness signlessness to be emptiness and aspirationlessness to be emptinessFor example Subhūti just as space is inconceivable and equal to the unequaledSeeking this peace this supreme samādhi I made offerings to countless buddhas in the pastthen in reverse order they become equipoised in the sense field of neither perception nor nonperceptionThen the god Vyūhamati volunteeredand gazed upon him with fixed attentionPreceptor this son of noble family seeks to go forth I ask that you allow his going forthAnd likewise all the others in the three realms arrive hereThey are not affected by any opponentMañjuśrī the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have this fourth quality and teach this Dharma teaching after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa will not be harmedThey are without refuge bound in heavy fettersProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha Amitāyusthe sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousnessIn this regard the expression seven prominent parts means thatand thus by the age of sixteen he had studied the Aindra school of grammar and could vanquish all opponentsI an arhat absorbed in the eight liberations have been freed from the two And with ones right hand one should Insert ones vajra into the lotusThis is how transference occurs for someone who once transferred will never need to do so againThose bodhisattva great beings happilySimilarly in the transcendent perfections of ethical discipline there are no such concepts and so they do not make assumptionsFor that young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas focus their minds upon all beingsLikewise you acquired physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness that are equal to the unequaledI cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras accumulation of meritThen noble ones the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha JaladharagarjitaghoṣasusvaranakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñaWith such traits he was born into a royal family of many qualities Now this Ocean of Qualities sits under the branches of the Bodhi treeWherever this army is found Dust and soot rain from the sky Yet at the seat of awakening a rain of flowers falls So heed my words and turn back Wherever this army is found The ground is uneven and filled with thorns and pricklesThere was also a terrifying quaking of the earth which caused the hairs on their bodies to stand on endRecollecting again and again I was in this very place beforeand to bring about the wellbeing of sentient beingsAfter he made that offer rāḍa Kālāma honored me with exquisite offeringsIn the same vein how could this illusory person attain emancipation in omniscience after training in the ten powers of the tathāgatasWhen the bhagavān tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuni had said thatāriputra what do you thinkthe gods Brahmā Viṣṇu Maheśvara Indra Kāmadeva and so forth made of deodar treeWise one with great realization do not leave Look at how beautiful are this charming forests treesHe then took seven steps toward the north and said I will be supreme among all sentient beingsIt is experientially realized by the noble onessuperior to the entire world a jewel among beings transmigrate from the divine realm of the Heaven of Joy and remain for ten months in the foulsmelling human body inside his mothers wombLooking in all four directions Always looking in through windowsJust as a bee whichever flower it settles onNondeliberation is nondivisionThey will swiftly attain the level of an irreversible bodhisattvaFather Mother this is excellentThis concludes The Appearance of the Stūpa the eleventh chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaAnd kings moreover with their fourdivision army become cakraruling kings with dominion over the four continentsInasmuch as the real nature of formative predispositions neither arises nor ceasesOppressed for so long For billions of countless eons On the road of cyclic existence Here I am revived my torment now quelledSimilarly there is no viewer of mirages magical displays or phantomsThis applies to the first second third and fourth concentration levelsFinally attaining peace by stopping everything from ignorance to old age death sorrow lamentation misery anxiety and trouble andThey are  it is difficult to approach their levelThe seed phrase supreme ka teaches the exhaustion of all phenomenaUnreal construction is the root of desireIn what sense are they physically pureThe bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha said Blessed One excellentIn that way Kāśyapa many hundred thousand quintillions of beings come to the Tathāgata in order to hear the Dharmaand his diligence never weakened throughout thousands of eonsI do not hold the emptiness of the essential nature with respect to any other nonarising attributes up to and including enlightenment to ariseWe could continue this wayUnder the sway of carelessness and overcome by delusion I was blind in the past covered with a veil of wrong views Such views made me grasp at the notion of a self And perpetuate the experience of sensations all due to not knowing the DharmaTheir nature is such that they can abide and withstand their longing for defilementsmay become equipoised in the meditative stabilities of the śrāvakas or the meditative stabilities of the pratyekabuddhas or in the meditative stabilities of the bodhisattvasin all of them except the meditative stabilities of the tathāgatasThey conceive of that which has no existence And thereby continue to extend saṃsāra they have never experienced the taste of the Dharma that is beyond the worldI will definitely practice generosity by giving away wealth grains and storesSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationMonks at that point some gods felt concern for meAnd they all in unison contemplated it They would still not understand the wisdom of the sugatas Who show great respect to the practitioners of celibacy They will attain the supreme highest enlightenment And similarly there are those who give giftsIt was sprinkled with the water of profound diligence and had skillful means as its centerThis position is called good in every respect Someone may be able to paint a picture on space Someone may be able to grasp space in his handThey who possess this supreme samādhi Will always dwell in forest bowersAnd they will understand the Dharma that you teach Therefore king and lord of humans I request that you clearly teach one should feed the target sap of common milk hedge seeds of giant milkweed and powdered woodworm with sugarAs a comparison a person builds a building that is a hundred yojanas highSimilarly the world indulges in notions of I and mine saying I identify with the applications of mindfulnessO great being your wisdom brings illuminationWhat is a voyeur One who becomes erect at the sight of others exertionSometimes I have a genderless formand it entails absorption in the ten sense fields of total consummation through acceptance of the nature of profound phenomenaYou are absorbed into freedom from multiplicityFind a girl like this for me O fatherThey do not apprehend the emptiness of nondispersal as the emptiness of nondispersalIn accordance with the aspirations known to the thusgone ones through this offering of my handsAs he stood there on the road with the weight of his upper body supported by his stick all his limbs were shaking and tremblingBeings born in those places had never even seen so far as their outstretched handsYou with teeth white like snow or conch shells this is excellent Homage to youBe wise in seeking the inconceivable Dharma of the BuddhaTake them outfrom the five make pellets the size of the fruit of spiritual attainmentThe lofty in the end will fall All meetings end in separation All life ends in deathsimilarly by practicing the applications of mindfulness the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment the noble eightfold path the three gateways to liberation and in the same vein the fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasthe translator bhikṣu ākya YeshKāminī is in the form of thunderthe emptiness of internal phenomenaHe cannot be explained as having any meaning whatsoeverBy doing this practice Great bliss is attainedIt is because the Buddha Bhagavān manifests because of the dharmakāya and does not manifest because of the rūpakāyaHe is the great leader of the trichiliocosm and is worshiped by gods and humansYou see the beings who are suffering Because they maintain the view of a selfHe has also stated There are two causes and circumstances for the correct view to arisePlacing their heads at the feet of the one with stainless brillianceNot even someone who can destroy the trichiliocosm and count its motes of dustVenerable Lord it is because these false imaginations do not exist in the expanse of realitysaying Come Child of enlightened heritage you should retain this transcendent perfection of wisdom and so forthWhich is like a dream or an illusion viiithey do not destabilize their superior aspirationso too does the element of consciousness appropriate a gods body in the heavensand the ability to conquer all traces of habitual tendencies in order to attain the meditative concentration of the heroic gaitand similarly have retained heldWhen he knows all that how could he not know the subject of scriptsThat is to say may you become skilled in the formation of a single syllableSimilarly it has not been revealed so that the emptiness of internal phenomena the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality the emptiness of conditioned phenomena emptiness of unconditioned phenomena the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end the emptiness of nondispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all things the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics the emptiness of nonapprehension the emptiness of nonentities the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities might be grasped or not graspedBodhisattvas should be spiritual benefactors giving liberallyIn the same way Kharakarṇa and Sūciromā The terrifying yakṣas of the forestsYou are as bright as gold from the Jambū River or the pericarp of the campaka flowerthey did not know how to do thatHaving pronounced those verses Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreyadid not regress if their eyes were gouged out or their heads were cut offpostulants name henceforth for as long as I live renounce killing and swear to refrain from killingAre your physical elements not disturbedThose bodies are inconceivable They are the manifestation of the dharmakāya Blessed One how does consciousness assume a body among the godsand in the same vein as before the same goes for all the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities They also venerate springs lakes and ponds The ocean rivers the sun and the moon Trees and mountain peaks Rocks and soilbeautified by a variety of rocks and stones and stainless watersuch as the Elder āriputraThe perfection of all his many qualities will be like hisThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are empty and yet sentient beings are attached to viewsUltimately they are not without disturbing emotionsOne should make generous offerings to the blessed noble lord AvalokiteśvaraYou obtained supreme awakening in one instantThe nāga king Girivalgu With a great entourage came before the TathāgataAnd will always be handsome And adorned by the primary signs of a great being The Blessed One replied Subhūti with their eye of the sacred doctrine great bodhisattva beings know thatThen simply through this song sung to the great vajra holderThe four elements of air and water Fire and earth may change into something elseSaturn Rāhu and KetuThen silver and copper should be infused And similarly iron five timesToday in this place a profound discourse Will undoubtedly be proclaimedOtherwise he may certainly leave his home behind Abandoning the kingdom and all his subjectsOne becomes filthy and malodorous One utters falsehoods and nonsenseOn the form of hūṃ and āḥ Like a moon reflected in water Meditate continually with an undistracted mindMoreover divine son on the relative level the incorrect conceptual workings of the mind are a gateway to saṃsāraAll things are peace unreal and without essenceInquiry and search for the nature of virtueAdorn your chests with necklaces of pearlsOh my friend Why are you undergoing this hardship seeking for food and clothingSo let me give that glorious mansion As an offering to the BodhisattvaIndeed this expanse of reality is not forgetful and it does not degenerateBillions upon billions of bodhisattvas surrounded it and billions upon billions of buddhas from the ten directions infinite in number focused their attention on itCandrakāntā She Who is Lovely Like the Moon Sūryakāntā She Who is Lovely Like the Sunthey will strive diligently to eliminate all such factors that still remainThroughout that time we will make vast offerings to the BlissGone OneThose living beings who understand correctly this teaching of the Dharma will obtain the treasury of the jewels of the DharmaPerfect Being in times past you were born as a holy sageWhen King uddhodana heard this message he became very elated and immediately he rose from his thronehe was given the name Tathāgata among gods and menThe wise ones avoid attachment and anger And attain the peace of enlightenment Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara began to teach the Dharma And that world system will be adorned with various sorts of divine jewelsThe goddesses so skilled in playing music Praised the qualities of the Bodhisattvananda Those gods present in the world systems of the great trichiliocosm extending from the Caturmahārājakāyika realmSimilarly he will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are past that they are future or that they are presentToday I heard these verses sung from the skywhich is at the crest of all Dharma teachings and which is known by the TathāgataOnly fools would call them happinessThese are the attributes of pratyekabuddhasBodhisattvas are similarly the universal sources of precious qualities andThen the Brahmā ikhin said to the venerable āriputrahe did not become regretfulHe teaches the Dharma in the form of Varuṇa to beings who are to be taught by Varuṇananda any monk nun layman or laywomanVenerable Lord To great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom nothing is pleasant or unpleasantMahāsthāmaprāpta that bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta revered venerated worshiped made offerings to praised and showed respect to many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of tathāgatasIn later times they became buddhas With infinite diligence all named Dṛḍhaśūraand distinctionsuncovered one shoulder knelt on their right kneesthe love that is tolerance because it protects both self and othersYou bring the culmination of all wishes Please dispel the doubts of gods and humansemptinessgenerosity that perfects gentleness calmness and tranquilityOne should make a beeswax effigy of the target four fingerwidths highSince they have developed the aspiration for enlightenment They have not had the view that there is a soul within They also succeed as practitionersthinking about how the monk Vīradatta had been with the girl again and again he decided to seize him and kill himand even experientially cultivated it and meditated upon it for a single day or for two days or for three four or five days but who were not captivated by this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and indeed subsequently succumbed to hesitationAlso if one wishes to cure leprosy one should by means of this very mantra neutralize a poison and then ingest it This will cure leprosyIn reply the Bhagavān answered those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were the principal figures among that great gathering of bodhisattvas that great aggregation of bodhisattvasAs this occurred Queen Māyā was sleeping on her pleasant bed and saw the following in her dreamThey will have the signs of inappropriate activity They will always desire the daughters of othersIllusionlike are all dharmaseminentInconceivably excellent gains come to anyone Who merely comes to hear or see youIt is in this way āradvatīputra that great bodhisattva beings have been accepted by spiritual mentors who are skilled in means and have abandoned evil associatesThese wonderful verses emerge from the beautiful sounds of the instrumentsTheir body hairs are bluish blackBy offering  homas of bdellium pills the size of a kernel of a cotton tree smeared with the three sweet substances orThey should regard the one who bestows the Dharma instructions as a doctora rākṣasasurrounded by his ladiesSimilarly is this mind of the bodhisattvas unattached to the applications of mindfulnessSome lifted their arms waving them in the air to reveal their armpitsWhen she returned Uttarā told her mistress what had happenedThese must be the two causes the two conditions that lead to the genuine view of the noble onesIf you wonder why we need to do so Father and Mother it is because the ThusGone One performs hardships in the world of gods and humans and being verbally and mentally at peace understand that discipline is at peaceāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as nonentitiesBecause of involving the poisonous faults of reference pointsNārāyaṇa even if all beings contained in the great billionfold universe had the same amount of merit as Great Brahmā their collected merit would still not match one hundredth of the amount of merit possessed by Layman Kṛṣṇa it would not even bear comparisonAnd did not think of any higher goalMeditating on that which possesses the first mantra it blazes for an instantVenerable Lord Since when they abide in the real nature they do not apprehend anything at all and there is nothing that existsTo this the Bodhisattva replied to the great retinue of gods The bodhisattva Maitreya will teach you the Dharmait is said I have the strength of wisdom the strength of miraculous powersBeautiful feet exquisite trunk and a pretty red head If it is true that this phenomenon Called Kṣemadatta does not existMañjuśrī I too have become inspired to speak about how bodhisattvas become thoroughly trainedSupreme leader of the ākyas we prostrate before your stainless moonlike facecomplete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood then you too should dedicate yourself to making offerings to servingis consequent on having reduced the desires and malice associated with the world system of desireBecause they do not accumulate they do not waste what was accumulated and since they do not waste what was gathered they do not experience any of the pains that are otherwise associated with thatIt is aspiring to the Dharma and seeking to hear it Does the Jina teach this samādhi All things are empty of inherent existenceI request you to guard protect look after and bring peace and wellbeing to the realms of the trichiliocosmThey will also go to pay homage service and respect to the BodhisattvaHaving gone to the place where the painting of the Blessed Lady is displayedand if they further rejoice thinking This monk who expounds attachment to me is useful to me in many ways Knowing the circumstances of this attachment I should train in all the three vehiclesBodhisattvas think as follows The vehicles are one the vehicle of the thusgone onesFirst one should train in the method of warding off the nāgasFather I will catch that mendicant this very day And blow him away like a handful of huskSister you are trying by every means to get me kicked outlikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are nonentitiesThe sunandmoon seat signifies being conceived in the wombAmazedIn the morning the novice put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and Dharma robesand the five

the level of buddhahood taught by the tathāgatasThey dispense the gift of the sacred doctrine and also worldly giftsHaving trained therein great bodhisattva beings will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentA dye placed on a white cloth Will stand out the mostSimilarly when the moonlike bodhisattvas rise they free everyone from all the agony of afflictions and gratify the bodies of all beings with joy faith delight and beautythey comprise  loving kindness  compassion  empathetic joy and  equanimitydedicating themselves to bestowing great gifts and honors by making offerings of worldly material goodsThe sentient beings of the four continents One must summon through light rays of the mindif you do not see the four noble truths yet are not one who has not seen the truthSince everything is only mind And its duration is only momentaryIn a clean and pure place Beautify the maṇḍala as is fittingOn the relative level upholding the sacred Dharma is a gateway to becoming a lord of all dharmasHaving mastered the formation of syllablesAs this was to be Saṅgharakṣitas last life as a sentient being a smile had already spread across his face andSo it is Subhūti that although great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomThey attain those four discernments Young man that is the restraint of the mindIt is neither wisdomand because of the six superknowledges of the buddhagnosis he does not destroy compounded thingsIndeed this tantra teaches that from the eighth to the fourteenthSenior āradvatīputra in ultimate reality there are no past actions no ripening no affliction and no purificationSubhūti go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illnessMonk as all phenomena are as immaculate as space they are stainlessshould not undertake any activity without first consulting a preceptor or instructorHaving received such accolades respect and reverenceSimilarly in the emptiness of internal phenomena the refinement of the buddhafields is nonapprehensible due to its utter purity andThese are the fiveHis mother asked him Son why are you cryingafter twelve years had passed the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana wrapped his body in divine cotton and soaked it with sesame oilCandraprabhaand they are consequently favored by the transcendent perfection of generosityand yet divine princes apart from engaging in the transcendent perfection of generosity the tathāgatas do not apprehend anything and apart from engaging in the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom the tathāgatas do not apprehend anythingAbsorbed in the mantra they drink and eat while purifying through the mantraMañjuśrī replied Divine being had I attained or relinquished something I might also reveal knowledgeAnd the Bhagavān who will be residing in other world realms will guard us protect us and hide usThere is the meditative stability named Illuminator of All WorldsMañjuśrī in what way are all of the buddha realms a single buddha realmThere is nothing at all that great bodhisattva beings see with their eye of wisdom nothing that they hear nothing that they recall and nothing of which they are consciousAnd spread over with the best white calicoEven their slightest joy will be joy in the Dharma through which they bring great benefitHaving examined these points he remained silentlearn what will be beneficial and what will notBlessed Akṣobhya the buddha of the vajra family was residing in the palace in Alakāvatī together

Joyfully Abiding Protector and othersI achieved this light of wisdom by undergoing countless forms of hardship and it is exactly as I have explained it For the one who practices this samādhi With diligent application having possession of itlikewise divine son the diligence of those who have the impoverished inferior and conceptual attitude of the hearers and solitary buddhas is unable to liberate even the beings here in Jambudvīpa let alone liberate all beingsA man who is blind from birth saysAre you tired Are you weary Noble son what work have you been doingA great gathering of bodhisattvas a great aggregation of bodhisattvas has emerged out from the ground andThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of modesty concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of modesty concerning teaching the compositeThey are unstained by desires and have no kleśas Thus they are free from the domain of MāraWhat are those ten They are extremely bright faculties completely pure faculties clear faculties stainless faculties trained faculties freedom from ill will freedom from latent tendencies freedom from blatant afflictions freedom from hardened and tiedup ways of grasping and freedom from angerThey are extraneous conditions They depend on extraneous conditions occur because of extraneous conditions and cease when separated from those conditions And in this sense they existTeach it to be our doctor and to bring us happinessThey will wear a clean Dharma robe That has been dyed an excellent colorHe was at that time given a

ordinand then displays his begging bowl in the following waythe samādhi named Vajra GarlandRenowned throughout the three worlds discoverer of the threefold knowledgeand also speak perfectly of the tīrthikas unworthinessThen they descend upon the bodies of those who have set forth on the Hearers VehicleThen he is called a perfectly awakened buddha the one who naturally manifests lord of Dharma the guide the perfect guide the complete guide the captainAlso sing out a word The inconceivable word dharma iNoble one the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara honored many buddhas generated roots of merit and trained under many hundreds of thousands of buddhasThe highest of beings had this thought I shall teach the Dharma to these who desire the Dharma So that they will all give up desire And enter into homelessness in my teaching āradvatīputra do you think that the designation of the eyes as entities or nonentities constitutes a bodhisattvaIn the eastern direction five hundred Thousand million worlds have been shakenand similarly maintain ethical discipline practice toleranceTherefore develop the aspiration The supreme aspiration to enlightenment Since they display the domains of buddhas and have forever passed beyond suffering they do not pass beyond sufferingthis is the time for the transcendent perfection of perseverance this is the time for the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationOnce they feel that it is the proper time and place to mature those around themand once his head was covered he used his tongue to cover his body as wellbut they make this dedication without apprehending anythingBlessed One we pray that you liberate us from birth old age disease death misery despair lamentation suffering unhappiness and distressThey taught this very Dharmavinaya to tame all beings andPlease teach it to illuminate all the enlightened activities of the Buddhaplaying musical instruments and cymbals and singing songsāradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly have minds that are equal to the unequaled and that are not shared in common with the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasthey will think I will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThere on a vajra seat In a mansion emanated by Brahmā he took his seatWe give up our sensual enjoyments and the perfect bliss of concentration In order to serve this sublime pure beingMahauṣadhi then askedengaged in actions to help the worldWill reach the highest supreme enlightenment And he will become the jina Vimalāṅganetra What you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent patience with respect to the Dharma consist inHe thinks to himself I have become old and decrepit I have much property grain treasure and storehousesHe sprinkles cold water on him and says nothing moreand the noble eightfold path They attain those thirtyseven aspects of enlightenment Young man that is the restraint of the mindThrough the disengagement of all phenomena they understand the disengagement of the limit of realityWhen engaging in all activities by means of great compassion they are free from evilThose within a bodhisattvas retinue do not fail in terms of discipline do not fail in terms of view do not fail in terms of propriety and do not fail in terms of livelihoodWhen the pilgrims saw him they saidWho then seeing such inconceivable things would believe the teaching of the discipleswith palms placed together bowed toward the Bhagavān and exclaimeddefinitively discern the nature of all things and are without fixation on all thingsāradvatīputra do you think that the earth element constitutes a bodhisattvaMoreover Subhūti bodhisattvas should grant instruction and admonition as follows to those beginner bodhisattvas who wish to train in the demonstration of this transcendent perfection of wisdomBy tying ashes to ones neck one will put an end to vomitingyou should see that the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not attain manifestly perfect buddhahoodthe other bodhisattvas manifested many such displays at the seat of awakeninglike an extinguished flame he passed away into perfect nirvāṇaThey have not entered into the maturity of the bodhisattvasand consciousness are themselves omniscienceIn the same vein if they engage in the same manner with the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas then they are merely engaging with mental imagesThe moon and the sun represent semen and menstrual bloodHence with the thought of impermanence they will be carefulTheir emptiness is boundlessAnd with delight they scattered flower petalsBut since ordinary people do not know this for the sake of ordinary people great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of generosity and in the same vein they practice the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including omniscienceāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomLord these bodhisattvas the great beings who reside in the ten directions of the world would like to hear from you in person in order to learn how you turn the wheel of Dharmathe armor which great bodhisattva beings don and the sentient beings for whose sake they actually don their armor are both nonapprehensibleSimilarly O child of enlightened heritage when you practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomJust as a necklace made of gold from the Jambū Riverit is difficult to find a king of the Dharma such as this in the present timeHow should they train in compassionI do desire it SugataWhat other god is there who is superior to me Who my mother takes me to worship todayThe purified faculty of the eye the ordinary physical eyes that have come from the father and mother will see the outside and inside of the world realm of a thousand million worlds with its mountains and forests seeing all as far down as the Avīci hell and as far upward as the summit of existenceOne must not scold a womannanda the humans of that realm will experience enjoyments comparable to those of the gods in the Heaven of Delighting in EmanationsYou should seek alms for the sake of eliminating the materialism of othersnone of them would even be able to look angrily at someone who possesses the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraThe known nature of form That is the characteristic of formSimilarly they cannot cultivate the ten powers of the tathāgatas and in the same vein they cannot cultivate the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasAll things are luminous unfettered and free Peaceful nonabiding beyond miseryand  the Dharma they teach while remaining in the austerity of the disciplines of mendicancy will be rememberedacting in meaningful ways is to bring beings out of unvirtuous situations and into virtuous onesthey have reached genuine perfection through the extrasensory powers of the bodhisattvas andNoble son such is the bodhisattvas excellent wisdom that transcends the world He explained to beings the Dharma That is profound peaceful and difficult to seeSubhūti omniscience is neither created not is it conditionedThen the venerable āriputra said to the goddessFinally the last sage said To those afflicted with old age and sickness The best of doctors has comeOnce he has gone forth if he says Venerables I confess my transgressionAlas to separate from those we love Is like watching a playnothing enduresTherefore I shall begin to eat solid food again That way I can regain my physical strengthSon even I dont know the meaning of this statementor with the emptiness of the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousnessIt quivered trembled and quaked and it boomed thundered and roaredBeing devoted to giving they possess untaught generosityāriputra all those tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas will teach the Dharma to beings through a single yānaprofound and reliableWhy do you say that the designation of sights as permanent or impermanent does not constitute a bodhisattvaWhen the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class wishes to examine the precious horse he will mount it at daybreak and travel throughout this great earth which is surrounded by oceansThere is no gift for the Tathāgata like these the gift of disciplesWith liking and disliking their minds grow dullIt is full of all kinds of filth fat pus and brains It constantly leaks excrement and it stinksI will always uninterruptedly guard protect and offer sanctuaryHere with the plowshare of trenchant insight I uprooted all the root afflictions Along with their latent formations Which yield suffering and anguishthe suchness of phenomena became knownAll the townspeople became agitated and asked one another where the sound came fromO child of enlightened heritage You should dwell in accordance with the abiding state of emptiness the abiding state of signlessness and the abiding state of aspirationlessnessThe practice of conduct is twofold For superior and beginner personsThat is why I now get out of the crosslegged postureMoreover nanda you have revered me with benevolent actions of body benevolent actions of speech and benevolent actions of mindHowever when compared to the body of a thusgone one a bodhisattvas body is not as bright clear and resplendentHis friend was someone who was very wealthyMay I also quickly become one who has attainedshe cried out A thief A thief The lad scared and frightenedin the same way their other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty are without foundationKing may fortune always be with you I do not seek desirable objectsHe has beautified the statues of the thusgone ones with the most exquisite pleasing things and adorned them with heaps of milkywhite jewelsthe bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana was pleased and delighted joyous and happywill based on that foundation give rise to a much greater amount of meritYoung man those are the ten benefits for the bodhisattva mahāsattvas from engaging in wisdomand terrorizing desist from desire and greed desist from wild hand movementsThe winds became still and ceased to blowAt that time those devas recited these versesThe mental suffering accompanied by attention is despairSimilarly O gods this doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of the eyesThey should only be referred to as renunciantsand also various fruits and flowersIs there not another mode of worship even better and more noble than thisThey will delight in wordsMonk while all phenomena are luminous in this way childish ordinary beings construct unreal phenomena construct erroneous qualities and have constructed all phenomena which are in fact insignificant and worthlessAt that moment the Blessed One quieted the divine music because the humans in Jambudvīpa would all go insane merely from hearing such musicaversion will disappear and aversion will not ariseIn that way Yamarāja praised Avalokiteśvara with a particularly sacred praiseNoble son in infinite ways such as these the bodhisattvas employ their expertise in retentions such as that of the lotus array to arrange the displays of the DharmaSimilarly they discern that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are not a self and do not focus on themin a pair of vessels of unbaked clayconsidering the aids to enlightenment to be servantsI give the teaching of nirvāṇa to those Who lack wisdom who are attracted to inferior paths Who do not practice the way of the many millions of buddhas Who are clinging to saṃsāra and suffer deeply She saw the Bodhisattva in her womb Like the moon in the sky encircled by starsThey all benefited the world And reached supreme enlightenment within the three existencesEight hundred million devas and nāgas And seven hundred billion yakṣasHe has sought the presence of all spiritual teachers and being so predisposed he has transformed himself into a collection of everything auspicious Therefore he is said to have eyelashes like a cowO Vajrapāṇi buddhas neither exist nor do they not existAnything that is empty of phenomena extraneous to these attributes may be called an extraneous entity that is empty of extraneous entitiesand proceeded to capture the whole of his cavalry charioteer corps and infantrythose are the circumstances for itThis mode this nature does not dwell anywherehe saw on the road a dead man who had reached his end The corpse was lying on a stretcher covered by a cotton clothconsciousness makes it manifestThey will not be liberated from rebirth

Blessed OneShe holds in her left and right hands A moon and an aśoka twigIt is inconceivable free from what can be conceived and free from mind mentality and consciousnessI should cultivate toleranceall things are nonabidingSimilarly since sights are nonapprehensible it follows that socalled sights are nothing but a mere name or conventional termFor the welfare and happiness of all beings I request you to teach the sūtra called The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualitiesāriputra a tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha comes into the world in order to perform one deed one action a great deed and a great actionHow then would I find satisfaction now by indulging in inferior pleasures This is out of the questionIndeed they abide in a nonabiding mannernanda it is because those fruits up to and including individual enlightenment are distinguished through this transcendent perfection of wisdomHe employs its inexhaustible power ThereforeThe crown chakra is concealed at the crownwere to see anything apart from the expanse of realityHaving meditated on that path They become unsurpassable buddhas A bodhisattva in his final existence must be conceived in the womb of a woman known by all and steadfast in conductAnikṣiptadhuraThose are his special qualitiesYou should also view the transfer it undergoes as like that of the sun a crystal and fuelKneeling down on their right knees they joined their palmsThis activity of Rāhula is not known But I know the prayers he has madeLord we also would like to go to that universe Sahā to see honor and serve the Buddha ākyamuni and to see Vimalakīrti and those bodhisattvasSome become pungent in flavor others sour and others again sweetThe escort turned back as the caravan of traders continued reduced in numbersand then through that insight into the knowledge of liberation will forsake the three fetters If you ask what are these three formless absorptionsHe recited these mournful verses that praised

been bestowedThat which neither arises nor ceases is the same as nirvāṇaThe brahmin answeredThen continue by imagining that those beings all progressively become hearers solitary buddhas and bodhisattvas who have attained the great grounds become empowered by the great cloud of light rays and attained the ten masteriesI should cultivate wisdomI have many treasuries so not to speak of my own sons alone I should give all beings this kind of great carthaving perfected the highest of all mental facultiesThey think as follows The wilderness refers to the residence of those who experience

the eight branches of the holy path will be born in his buddhafieldAnd their path is the eightfold peaceFrom whom did you learn these rudiments of mantraAnd bodhisattvas abide in equanimity when they think I shall free all beings from worldly concernsBhikṣus when the bhagavān  the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū attained the highest complete enlightenment

sentient beingsyou may also accept that provided you take the proper amountVenerable Lord In what have those great bodhisattva beings who train in the expanse of reality actually trainedWhen they know that all phenomena are uncompounded and have no regret about what they have done or confusion about what they have not done those bodhisattvas have become trained in these profound teachingsAgain they

wisdomThey reject this kind of Dharma That brings the cessation of suffering āradvatīputra the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the nonactualization of physical formsIf noble disciples observe and dwell on its repeated arising and destructionhis Dharma had ceased to exist and the outer form of his Dharma was coming to an endReverend Subhūti take this food if you understand the sameness of all things through the sameness of material objects and if you understand the sameness of the qualities of the Buddha through the sameness of all thingsIf he articulates it and teaches it to others he is upholding the sublime Dharmait is because the appropriation of all things which are empty of their own defining characteristics did not arisewith a great array of

answer them all in a single instantBut those who work with the sun in all its splendor Will when they obtain that illumination be divest of darknessIt was with such words spoken in verse that the Bodhisattva addressed the grass seller SvastikaAlternatively on a golden plate one should engrave Vasudharā surrounded by the yakṣiṇīs and on a second plate Lord Jambhala surrounded by the yakṣasThen Senior Subhūti asked the Blessed OneEnchanting in appearance like a magical emanationThat which is well known as nagasala Generates when mixed with milk The male organs power to produce plentiful offspringIn that way all those buddhas Have reached the perfection of qualities Such were the effects of their miraculous activitiesIn the past you approached the sage yāma at his place by the tree He asked you how many leaves were on the treeand divine lights and fragrances manifested everywhereDid the Bhagavān quickly accept the jewel that I offered to the Bhagavān or notDivine son if one travels east of this buddha realm and passes beyond  other buddha realmsSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent patience granted by the Buddhathe samādhi named SubduingThey protect sentient beingsActing for

regarding emanations consist ofWhat sets the errant gods and humans aflame Are their misconceptionsLotuses thrive in filthy swampsIn this way he will never renounce his concentration absorption and states of equilibrium which are fabricated defiled and perpetuatingand similarly if they perfect the emptiness of internal phenomena exclusively by way of signlessnessIn the same vein Subhūti those great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom do not engage with any attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceOn the head of the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha the pearl necklace took the form of a pavilion decorated with strings of pearls resting on four bases with four columns symmetrical well constructed and lovely to beholdBhagavat where did these great light rays come fromThe ones who have become teachers for the world guides Buddhas selfarisen having great compassionBhikṣus at that time the airborne palaces of the Brahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds in the south became very beautiful bright radiant glorious and majesticAnd each one of them thought The Bodhisattva is speaking directly to me to me alone

formless meditative absorptionsWhoever will circumambulate that stūpa or bow down to it will manifest the supreme result of arhathoodThe buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in eighty Ganges Rivers who were in those world realms exclaimedThe Bhagavān is going to exhort us to teach this Dharma teachingBlessed One we will work for the sake of those beingsHis saṅgha of hearers was also endless Right now the ThusGone Amitābhas saṅgha of hearers is said to be boundlessSimilarly they will hear the voices of many hundred billion trillions of buddhas from the southern western northern and intermediate directionsAs an offering to the Bhagavān he cleared a great wide roadwayshould knowjust as when someone sees the reflection of their face in a mirror but does not become

There were the songs of avadavats peacocks and parrotsMaintaining a gentle frame of mindThey live in the form aggregate He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the seven branches of enlightenmentThwarted they relinquished pride and conceit And all of them were drawn to investigatewhat then is the distinction between great bodhisattva beings and the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhasThey will revere them venerate them admire them make offerings to them praise them and show them respectUninjured and unharmed they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThen as the bodhisattvas and many millions of gods nāgas and yakṣas assembled around himDivine princes the transcendent perfection of generosity too is like a dream like a magical displayThere are hundreds of thousands of agarwood treesThey practice them while in meditation Yet have no attachment to those samādhisYoung brahmins allow me to explainNow I will teach another meditation on CaṇḍamahāroṣaṇaSo he summoned Chanda and told himAdorned by the constellations of one hundred thousand godsMonks these are the circumstances and causes related to the Bodhisattvas equanimity as he was brought to the templethe teacher should continue as followsHe did not defecate nor did he urinateSubhūti when with respect to all things great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of toleranceI chat with them We delight one another And I always keep their companyit is because these six transcendent perfections subsume all virtuous attributesFor so long he has exerted himself in preparing his own hands and his own body by rubbing them with ghee and sesame oil and then using his hands for bathing and anointing the bodies of parents monks priests spiritual teachers and worthy people as part of his devoted service to them soThen the prince Candracchattra went to the Lord Bhaiṣajyarāja the arhat the Tathāgata the unexcelled perfectly enlightened one and having approached himThey cannot be fathomed even by the wisest of menThe nāga disguised as a brahmin thought I cannot live on the things humans eatThese many verses can be heard in all their diversityIn giving they give exclusively for the sake of all sentient beings and the same is the case with observing discipline cultivating patience mustering diligence practicing concentration cultivating insight and accomplishing even the stage of omniscienceWhether I teach the Dharma or not this group that is sure to be wrong will not understand the DharmaAlternatively Blue Acala is the very pure wisdom of the sphere of phenomena considering all elements to be present in consciousnessImmature minds have become dim and afraidThis engendered among them the intention set on unexcelled perfect and complete awakeningIf they were thinking of AvalokiteśvaraNot even a pore would be harmedPracticing this transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly they dispense their gifts whatever they may be from food or drink up to those things that are useful to humankind to those who need them butO Senior āradvatīputra The tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of the past have foreordained that great bodhisattva beings who abide in these abovementioned meditative stabilities will attain unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenmentOne sees

Dharmabring happiness to many peoplethe inconceivably numerous words of limitlessness concerning teaching the compositeAnd unceasingly commended by bodhisattvas As he is visualized prostrate at the practitioners feet all that one wants from him can be accomplishedIf you ask what is the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationWhen examined from within lust cannot be foundThose who remember his name will have happiness in this world and will completely leave behind every suffering in saṃsāraThus noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are like a lotusAlthough the world may be full of worthy ones and solitary buddhas My force will remain unharmed when they pass beyond sufferingThen through further development on the path of cultivation this same individual will abandon attachment to the world system of desire and to malice in their entiretyVenerable Lord if the notion of the sensory element of the eyes as with signs is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes as signless become a bodhisattvaVenerable Lord When the Blessed One said that great bodhisattva beings should not actualize the notion that all things are emptySimilarly wherever a bodhisattva lion resides no meek nonBuddhist deer will consume the crops of virtuous qualitiesAccepting it from him The teacher removed the poison and ate the almsand likewise all other elements of form be they of attention feeling or dharmas follow after itones voice will become like that of a loveintoxicated cuckoo and ones speech will be distinct and

he did not consider anything which could engender that understanding any understanding that could be engendered or anything from which that understanding could be engenderedWith that he went to

offerings to itWhen they are lying down they are fully aware that they are lying downAs an analogy when a mans and a womans sexual organs meetāradvatīputra the seven branches of enlightenment are merely conceptualizedHomage to Tathāgata SaumyākarṣaṇaśrīThe follower of Mantra with his mind wholly focused on this practiceWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent compassionate patience consist inEven all of them together would still not know The extent of my limitless buddha wisdom Imputations are a gateway to all dharmas because imputations do not ariseI have taught many dharmas

Blessed One from behindHe joined his palms in the direction of the Blessed One bowed and addressed these words to himNow placing his palms together in homage toward the Bhagavān in his mind he addressed him with these versesAs the teacher of the four truths you delight in emancipationWith that perception they bring about the three types of karma corporeal verbal and mentalI will have sent to that human existence In order to accomplish the tasks of the TathāgataThose who have thus made offerings to all the tathāgatasPeople here have profited well Since such a being has appeared in the worldWhen he had said thisIts terrace crumbling The bases of its pillars rottenand explain its symbolismThose who do not intend to attain Merit for buddhahood or to attain dhyānaThe simultaneous sound of a thousand instruments Does not equal a fraction of the Sugatas speech You are the light of Dharma that has arisen from relinquishing the three stainsand about which he has not become completely enlightenedone does not run toward smellsThis āradvatīputra is the transcendent perfection of generosity possessed by great bodhisattva beings who practice the four immeasurable aspirationsThey dedicated the roots of virtue toward taking birth in the world of Sukhāvatī as well as toward unsurpassed and completely perfect awakeningOne hundred sarvasaṃjñas is called a vibhūtaṃgamāIn the language of IndiaThey were like an ocean of good qualities there was no end to their being praised Their learning was vast they were wise and endowed with knowledge He came to him for teaching and for discussions on the DharmaStill mother I will follow worldly customs When beings see my miraculous displays they will be pleased It will inspire them with great respectBhadrapāla consider all these things to be consciousnesss to commandWherever on the earth they may be practicing this absorption how fortunate they areAs sāl trees blossom And the earth is even Certainly he will become omniscient The recipient of offerings of all the worldMaitreya in the future there will be noble sons and daughters devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas and asuras who having planted the roots of virtueIn this way the king who is appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class will conquer the eastAlthough that is a mistaken and corrupt imputation The eye consciousness arises from itHe manifests as being in the state of parinirvāṇaAgain it is said Once called by the Tathāgata to come forthbedding healing medicines and remedies and other appropriate necessitiesBodhisattvas gather numerous roots of virtue within the Great VehicleBy offering music one will have good hearingWhen he said the letter ka out came the statement Immersion in the full ripening of actions karmavipākāvatārathe ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernmentsexamine this book of the transcendent perfection of wisdom hold and master itIt was thus that he consecrated his buddha realmShe however was lacking in fortune because of her former bad deedslike a disciplined personand similarly anything that enhances or diminishes feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessSo it is Subhūti that this transcendent perfection of wisdom gives rise to the tathāgatasand approach great bodhisattva beings saying O child of enlightened heritage ComeHe visited the fashionable outsider teachers yet always kept unswerving loyalty to the Buddhaall things have a modality free from sentient beings free from living creatures free from living organisms free from lives free from individuals free from humankind free from human beings free from petitioners free from instigators free from actors free from agents free from knowers and free from viewersThe forms of these bodhisattvas then sang this verseThe entire ākya clan gathered and everyone called out with delight practiced generosity engaged in merit and satisfied the needs of  priests each dayGlorious one with a beautiful and marvelous nose this is excellentThat one knows the nature Of the entire three realms Has no bondage is liberated And knows nirvāṇaSir We have seen and heard of all those other countries but have neither seen nor heard of the Middle Countrywill also come here to examine this book of the transcendent perfection of wisdom and to hold retain venerate make offerings to and respect it Their body is well formed  Their body is well proportioned  Their senses are completely purifiedAlso sing out a word The unsurpassable word saṅgha iitand declared We will strive to preserve this absorption that encapsulates all meritI possess such meditative concentrationsThey achieve the power of akra Brahmā and the world protectors and are empowered as objects of veneration by all beingsand those who wish to comprehend others sorts of feelings up to and including the feelings conditioned by sensory contact that is mentally compoundedall of these should train exclusively in the transcendent perfection of wisdomI have an old cloth sirYou attended upon the masters and caused no harm to anyoneAlas Sentient beings are never content No matter how much wealth respect or praise they receive they never feel that it is enoughThus the entrance into this principle of uniqueness is the entrance into nondualitywhenever they do not engage with the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness have aspirations or that they are without aspirationsThe jinas who are present and those who have passed away Have come to be buddhas through the true nature Teach perfectly with your beautiful voiceKāśyapa it is like thisAt that time when they ask them questions They will again teach with the appropriate meaningthat they do not cognize the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom as the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the restThey are sunk in saṃsāra enveloped in misery And immersed in a continuum of suffering I pay homage to you the Lord who has the highest compassionAt an arrowshot distance from the foot of all the precious trees there were precious high platformsthen the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas would not overpower and grace the world with its gods humans and antigods with their magnificence and glory HoweverBrahmā Forefather of the World Had thus praised the Light of the WorldThe beings who enjoy this realm Will all be stainlessOn the other hand Mañjuśrī the appearance of the Tathāgata satisfies and entertains this world including the godsNoble children teaching the Dharma among such sentient beings is indeed a tremendous feat displayed by that thusgone onein order to bring about the maturity of inferior living beingsthe awakening of a buddhaEnlightenment is merely a name and even that name is motionlessthe samādhi named Hundred Light Raysshould fast for an entire day and night on the eighth day of the waxing moonHe was there together with a great saṅgha of monks as well as a great saṅgha of bodhisattvasthe emptiness of ultimate reality the emptiness of conditioned phenomenaSome wore good clothes yet let them hang improperlyAnd do not have the diligence to attain liberationNext the ordinand petitions the preceptor in the following waythey incessantly eat womens mouthsIf someone were to count them for eons As numerous as the Ganges sandsYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of truth What are the four kinds of knowledge of truthAlso we are old and decrepitwould any doctrine be revealed by any sentient beingAnything that enhances or diminishes physical formsThey establish in irreversibility Countless multitudes of beingsProstrations to the tathāgata nandaśrī buddha of the zenithBring joy and happiness to beingsreads it aloud and inspires faith in it will generate much more meritand turpeth Together with yellow myrobalanThey may search in all directions Yet never find the origin of sound or its destinationNoble son no one knows the sixsyllable mahāvidyāThe gods of the Pure Abodes namely those of the Avṛha Atapa Sudṛśa Sudarśana and Akaniṣṭha realms also will arrive thereThrough the power of the buddhas and through the blessings of the buddhasAnd leads beings to the state without aging or deathThey experience patience and awakening sentient beings and thusgone ones all in a nondualistic waynot to pay homage to other godsKnower of the World you have attained today The state of sublime immaculate peacethe bodhisattva kāśagarbha will manifest birth in different places for the benefit of those beingsAs the fruition of that karma we have been born as denizens of an ephemeral hellLike an old stable for horses or elephants where the two sides have caved in and made the inside rafters visibleThe powerful army of demons came forthI am the most excellent in the worldBhikṣus the Bhagavān gave his assent by saying nothing to the MahābrahmāsAfter him there was a buddha A supreme man named JñāneśvaraIn this regard long toes and fingers means that the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet are exceedingly longDo the bodhisattvas not regard all sentient beings affectionately do they not naturally give rise to altruismāriputra a person who touches such a beauty of the land with even just his toe is despicable unlike the one who embraces shakes and enjoys himself with that dogs corpseI will have compassion for many beings I will see beings suffering without a protectorHe embraces a buddhafield to the same extent that through entrance into a buddhafield living beings are introduced to the buddhagnosisThey are tamed and follow those who are perfectly tamed They have pacified sensesperfectly pacifiedThe gods sent timely rainsNoble son you have seen only a little of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras prowessI have taught this practiceInstead he projected an allpervading light from his heart center that embraced all sentient beings with loveWhen a man is intoxicated from alcohol He perceives the ground to be spinningThe bodhisattvas who realize The highest wisdom of buddhahoodGod how is it that any practice related to training to nontraining or to any solitary buddha constitutes bodhisattva practiceSuch is the bodhisattvas perfect giving of respectFor what reason is this son of the jinas Called AvalokiteśvaraThose guides of the world Will have infinite skill in methods Father and Mother come here We must go to the thusgone worthy perfect buddha Arisen from Flowers in order to behold him to pay homage and make offerings to serve him and to receive Dharma teachings from himThat the earconsciousness does not perceive is signlessnessat that time I was a bodhisattvaThe remaining part of the ritual is as beforeVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline acquire the transcendent perfection of generosity and similarly the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and how do they acquire the transcendent perfection of wisdomWhen craving ceases there is the cessation of graspingWith the hairs of tiger bear and jackal One will be free from vicious onesSeven days passed in this way while he was at the foot of the Bodhi tree experiencing bliss from the sustenance of concentration and joyCandragarbhaordinary people through their fixations due to fundamental ignorance and craving become fixated and impute that which is nonexistent as existentThrough many ways they also turn some sentient beings away from the meditative concentrations and the fruit of the meditative concentrationsIf you who conquers emotions abandons this palace tonightAnd all the water that is in springs Lakes ponds and the ocean or cause another who feels sorrow toward my preceptor or instructor to dispel that sorrowIt is the knowledge of discernment It is the realization of wisdomIn space the fruit of entering the stream is not discernedto perfect the gnosis of omniscience he does not destroy compounded thingsFor such people there is neither Old age nor disease nor deathThat monk caretaker was a shapeshifter and yet this was soMañjuśrī the Tathāgata is in the realm of nonarisingāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the gateways to liberation and in the same vein all the other attainments up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities as entities and nonentitiesAt that time Brahmā master of the Sahā world with the gods of the Brahmā realmAs the Lord declares It is not possible for one who is himself bound to deliver others from their bondageHe delighted in giving and sharingTherefore young man when the princess had heard this Dharma of the bodhisattva which is marvelous wonderful and very difficult to practiceWhen this caravan of merchants approached the Bodhi tree a goddess who lived in a forest of milk trees enchanted all the carriages thus rendering them motionlessāriputra what is defilement and what is ones own doingHere I realized The dependently arisen world to be empty Reoccurring in each moment of cognition Like a mirage or a city of gandharvasit is because all things are nonapprehensible in terms of those who would be discouraged the agent of their discouragement or the object of their discouragementThey will always be reborn in worlds where the word Buddha is unheard where the word Dharma is unheard and where the word Saṅgha is unheardThey do not consider whether sights are imbued with happiness or suffering and the same goes for the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomenaBhikṣus at that time on that occasion this Devadatta was that rishiHis relatives despise him and no one looks after himAt that very moment the brahmin boy Bhadraśuddha obtained the knowledge of the divine eye knowledge of the divine ear knowledge of the thoughts of others and knowledge recollecting his past lives and also accomplished miraculous powerswhile engaging in the conduct of a bodhisattva they will realize the intrinsic characteristics of all phenomena just as they are and therefore be indefatigable in saṃsāraSubhūti it is because the essential nature of dreams is empty of the essential nature of dreams andand himself endowed with every virtuous quality undergone hardship by teaching the Dharma to such sentient beingsthis transcendent perfection of wisdom is instructive because consciousness and the other aggregates are unseennot perceived inside outside or in betweenThe bodhisattva mahāsattva should continually read this sūtraThis buddha appeared surrounded by akra Brahmā and many quadrillions of the guardians of the worldOf what form is Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa And of what kind is his accomplishmentThere were the yakṣa general Pāñcika accompanied by his sons the yakṣa general Vajrapāṇi with his retinue of yakṣas and the great bhūta Hārītī with her retinue of female yakṣasO Great Sage how could you be surpassedBlessed One this great knowledge completely purifies all karmaFriends Even though the ThusGone One has awakened to unsurpassable perfect and complete buddhahood he is set on keeping the Dharma to himself without teaching itWhether he wears clothes made of kuśa grass Poor quality clothes or his body is emaciatedWhy is it realized by those with few desires Because they give rise to reverenceIf you ask what is the emptiness of ultimate realityhey do not apprehend this transcendent perfection of generosityThey consist of the elements of earth water fire air space and consciousnessThis monk who reveals to me a counterfeit path which will not actualize the fruit of entering the stream and will not actualize the other fruits up to and including the fruit of arhatship and which will not even actualize the fruit of individual enlightenment is useful to me in many waysWill become the eyes for the world With its humans and marutsHe taught her the virtuous qualities extolled them delighted in them and made her develop themAnd so also with a noose made of copper and so onhe is the One Who Does Not Lose His Vision of Liberated WisdomDivine son in the same way the noble ones view without viewing all disturbing emotions on the ultimate levelIn the past when I practiced the conduct of a bodhisattvaFormerly nanda in times gone byone will obtain mastery of speechIf one uses dhvajāgravatī as the basic unit of calculation it is possible to solve the calculation for all the grains of sand in the river GangesWith a mind like the sky he is just fineWhoever knows her name and familythey will not be able to fully awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahoodThose who have faith in the supreme wisdom of the Buddha They are called the jewellike families in Jambudvīpathe merit accumulated by completing the five perfections during eight hundred thousand quintillion eonsOne should place a sword made of iron or the like in the disciples right hand andIt is without coming and going for it never stands stillThey must not dwell in ignoranceThus bodhisattvas make the web of the roots of affliction rotAll of them were worthy ones who had brought the defilements to exhaustion
