All phenomena arise in dependence
When the ThusGone One reaches awakening May he partake of our food And turn the wheel of Dharma
Noble one in that way the merit from possessing the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is immeasurable
Moreover āradvatīputra the spiritual mentors to great bodhisattva beings teach the doctrines that
In what way you may wonder do bodhisattvas absorb the great rain of Dharma

This is how the petition is made while seated the monk says Reverend saṅgha please heed me
Bhagavān if the Bhagavān will permit us after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa

Giving away dear sons food and drink And even your head and eyes
The Great Sage who is well trained in thousands of virtues
Kāśyapa the Tathāgata presents all dharmas correctly
Some had just one arm while others had up to one hundred thousand
It is because that place should be perceived as being the Bodhimaṇḍa of all the tathāgatas
Among these sensation is threefold
Venerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of inconceivable deeds and innumerable deeds
Having taught that Dharma he became silent
They had destroyed the bonds of existence and
Just as they do not apprehend this transcendent perfection of wisdom while practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom
It then occurred to him Birth happens when there is existence
the nonhuman spirits would themselves swiftly depart because they would be unable to stand the brilliance of this precious gemstone
offered my own body eyes flesh Fb marrow bones and skinnot to mention all the outer material things
The nonpresence is through the word presence Its nature is that there is nothing to be found 
the term ultimate reality denotes nirvāṇa in the context of the emptiness of ultimate reality
Any practice of any solitary buddha constitutes bodhisattva practice
It is being adept in the āyatanas and in the dhātus Does the Jina teach this samādhi 
and similarly if they perfect the eight aspects of liberation exclusively by way of signlessness
any thought of agitation any thought of indolence
One should visualize oneself
Accordingly āradvatīputra I say that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will purify the negativity of body
Bodhisattvas without being infatuated by their conscientiousness should be entirely free of carelessness
Those who do not instigate contemplation will not dwell on any concerns
They must have great stores of treasure and grain
You have been empowered by a hundred thousand buddhas
in the same way āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings perceive all things distinctly but do not become fixated on them
Love is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
who practice the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom
So I ought to dwell silently in the forest With a mind stilled by the bliss of concentrated absorption

The prophecy declares that all phenomena are unborn
How are they mentally pure
For then will your body be swathed in the Buddhas mind
Recite spreading secret mantras Perform the projection and reabsorption
Noble son you should understand these four to be deeds of Māra
Today my life has borne fruit
they are adorned with a glorious body speech and mind
and similarly when they do not make assumptions based on feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness

Were all able to see and hear 
Mañjuśrī it is because this Dharma teaching has been blessed by all the buddhas
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings will be stable in the community of the genuinely perfect buddhas
The saṅgha of bhikṣus asked the king
Through wearing the strong armor of forbearance For many tens of millions of eons
Why is that so Monk as all phenomena are at all times unafflicted they are perfectly pure by nature
Since this spontaneously manifests as infinite statements in accord with all perspectives it satisfies all beings and is understood throughout all realms of the world
Purity in discipline purity in view purity in mind and purity in insight
In that way you will be worshipping the blessed buddhas of the past the future and the present
and remember the kindness of others They must be physically strong with great power and strength indeed supreme strength
 being content with ones spouse and  undermining the interest of those who study the Dharma
Bhagavān no it could not The Bhagavān asked Monk what do you think Could something nonarising arise or cease
or an act of suspension for refusal to give up deviant views

And said in the voice of a cuckoos call
Having put an end to suffering they will go to pleasant forms of existence until they become fully and perfectly awakened buddhas within unsurpassable complete and perfect awakening
lessed One how does consciousness controlled by the circumstance of its lack of form accomplish the creation of forms
They do not see a tathāgata as other than consciousness
āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should train accordingly in those things which are conceptualized as names and symbols
All things move and change and are impermanent like clouds They may be likened to a flash of lightning
that they all had the power of bodhisattvas
Son have you actualized arhatship he asked No preceptor I have not
and there are no sentient beings and no other posited subject up to and including knowers and viewers
He did not consider that understanding to be anything other than physical forms
In that universe even the names disciple and solitary sage do not exist
Others had no arms
Similarly apart from engaging in the emptiness of internal phenomena and apart from engaging in the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities the tathāgatas do not apprehend anything
How should they investigate the meditative stability of signlessness
What is this word Buddha which brings such joy to all beings
What is the knowledge of distinguishing between the words for phenomena
When I enter into houses earth is thrown at me
As he went he vanquished one opponent after another in villages cities towns marketplaces and hamlets until he reached Rājagṛha
reprimand or rebuke them striking them with clods of earth clubs or weapons or cutting off all their limbs and appendages
Friends please listen to the gateways to the light of the Dharma that delight the gods which these bodhisattvas teach the gods by the way in which they pass away
They enter the assembly Fearlessly and confidently
There is no lust hatred and ignorance
And that they are the same as poisonous plants or fires or like angry vipers
Blessed One how do bodhisattvas remain constantly in equipoise without any interruption
The sounds of divine instruments constantly arose without being played
And the concept of happiness was lost
Noble one stay a little while gain some ascertainment of the Dharma with my bodhisattva mahāsattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta
They may speak of form yet ultimately form is not observed and they cannot be attached to it
Noble son Dharmaworship is that worship rendered to the discourses taught by the Tathāgata These discourses are deep and profound in illumination
forming what is known as the light of universal illumination
possessed by all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas
The suffering of birth and saṃsāra Is the conceptualization of foolish understanding
Venerable Lord Great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly and seek emancipation in unsurpassed completely perfect enlightenment should always train in the manner of an illusory person
Subhūti it is because those sentient beings will know that with respect to the real nature of phenomena there is nothing at all that exists
nanda if a person is willing to travel for hundreds of miles just to receive news of a friend and is delighted to hear that news
yakṣas and rākṣasas will perform activities for them like slaves
You possessed fortitude determination unshakable resolve and diligence
Some bring the four oceans on top of their heads
in order to fulfill the great compassion he does not destroy compounded things
With a fourpetaled lotus in the center
Satatasamitābhiyukta the bodhisattva mahāsattvas will acquire that kind of sense of hearing but will not yet at that time have attained divine hearing

Kneeling on the cap of his left knee
This is the Dharma of saviors For millions upon billions of eons

They will not become old or die They will have no desire anger or stupidity
Physical restraint is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for with it the three physical faults are purified
By skillfully created pleasant music And the constant dancing of adept maidens ii
What is faultless is the destruction of joys
The aggregates sense fields and elements Are empty within and empty without
Elders I will comply How long must I keep records Twelve years
He said It is excellent excellent Bhagavān ākyamuni that you have taught well the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma
What they speak is in accord with the truth These are distinctive qualities of the first patience 
It has no simile
This was the fourth chapter
With qualities of austerity and discipline honored by the three worlds
pain in the extremities tumors blood disorders jaundice hemorrhoids
Always having the characteristic of a hallucination That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind 
Goodness Where is the harm in waiting seven or eight days
Noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are beings of noble birth
For this reason Senior Subhūti it is clear that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is extremely hard to bring forth and it is hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment
Whoever possesses such a sūtra as this reads it studies it teaches it and teaches it extensively to others will have the desirable result ripening from that
Before you relinquished treasuries of jewels gold silver and ornaments
Those who are practicing the supreme conduct Who are adept in causes reasons and discipline
Similarly the transcendence of the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty is always without fear
Instead the mind remains dull and oppressed by torpor
If you ask what are the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise they are as follows
They abide in the transcendent perfection of generosity that is neither fettered nor liberated They abide in the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom which are neither fettered nor liberated
Holy Man dont eat solid food
One should allow six months for this practice of each In combination with the respective previously described gaze
Developing aversion to everything that is composite they might enter the faultlessness of the śrāvakas
And his eyes are red
and others incur transgressions in their maturity
Venerable Lord Are the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomena free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existence
and  bodhisattvas
Those who accomplish this stainless samādhi
He is called the one who perceives everything with the great light of wisdom
They will experience many misfortunes in that very life and will burn in the hell realms in their future rebirths
It is better to die in battle Than live defeated by the enemy
they inclined their bodies they bowed their bodies they bowed well bowed perfectly
He mastered the three gateways to liberation
Buddhahood the state of Vajrasattva Is perfectly accomplished in terms of the relative
But bodhisattvas are overjoyed and thrilled To have obtained this stainless samādhi 
Seated we talked among ourselves asking each other what we should do
Similarly they know the modalities of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and yet they are without fixation on them
Those who wept when they saw the bhikṣu Afflicted by the agony of his illness
Subhūti it is because the eyes are empty of the eyes and in the same vein
They are the inconceivably numerous designations concerning the composite
Whatever he says is thus tathā undistorted thus and not otherwise Therefore
His left knee is on the ground
This will give you longlasting meaning benefit and happiness
of the great joy consummated in the awareness of the supreme happiness of all living beings
Those who possess one verse Of this precious sūtra
Wind is the essence of Tārā
The bodhisattva kāśagarbha in turn presented the Bhagavān with all of these offerings
shouting Hapless fool Where is this sweatchamber of yours
If you allow going forth and grant ordination without asking this a serious breach occurs
Monks in this way all the ākya youths were defeated and
and in the same vein do you think that other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death constitute a bodhisattva
In this way they delight all beings
Excellent Viśiṣṭacāritra excellent
They should perceive every buddha and bodhisattva as the teacher
like the perception of color in one blind from birth
and asked Has the Blessed One a body
and who commit this transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing or have it committed to writing
Those who cause music to be played for them With the pleasant sounds of ḍamarus conches and bherī drums
extended his goldencolored right hand and to the delight of akra lord of the gods and the gods of the Heaven of the ThirtyThree pointed out their seats
She was not agreeable to Mahākāla and so he did not stay with her did not love her and did not protect the Teachings either
without excess
I postulants name petition you master to serve as preceptor Master please act as my preceptor
At that time there are rishis who have the five higher knowledges divine sight divine hearing the knowledge of others minds memory of previous lives and mastery of miraculous powers
Blessed One these gods all really wish to build a stūpa
You should dedicate whatever gifts you have offered to all sentient beings making common cause with all sentient beings and without apprehending anything toward the attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
Venerable Lord if the eyes are invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the eyes become a bodhisattva
and came down from Vulture Peak Mountain together with  monks
Noble ones at that time King ubhavyūha together with his harem numbering eightyfour thousand became recipients for the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma
Welcome O Kauśika
Noble son this is how bodhisattva great beings abandon slander
āriputra I cause the acquisition of the vision of the tathāgatas wisdom
There fell a rain of divine flowers and coral tree flowers There was the sound of drums without drums being beaten
or with a leapmonth to make a year of thirteen months it were to rain day and night noble son I could count each drop of rain but
The bodhisattva Prabhāketu declared
Will have many endless benefits Mañjughoṣa it will always be like that for them
In the same vein they will have fewer ideas about everyday necessities
Color and shape are the demon of the aggregates
They do not apprehend all the fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of tolerance
Venerable Lord
In accordance with the aspirations of the buddhas through this offering of perfumes fragrant powders and ointments may I anoint all sentient beings with the fragrances of discipline erudition and absorption
At which point the novice says It is excellent
I too will worship those who listen to it write it down read it aloud memorize it Fb and disseminate it
and the experience of all divine and human perfections
Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata is the dharmakāya
If you ask why
In what way you may wonder are bodhisattvas the ground for the seeds of virtuous qualities
 It is the attainment of the perfection of sharp wisdom It is being as unwavering and unshakable as a mountain
Subhūti it is because the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of generosity is empty of the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of generosity and similarly Subhūti the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom are empty of the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of wisdom and so forth
Who are the bodhisattvas who have received abundant teachings
they would give drinks to those who need drink and
Of those who have served the buddhas The lords of the world in the past 
the words arisen from nonexistence
Bodhisattvas are similarly there for all sentient beings equally
They have perfectly attained liberation through knowledge and wisdom And they dispense the medicine of the good Dharma
He wonders Oh no will the ākya lineage of such fortune now be destroyed
those who engage in unvirtuous acts and those who attack me seeking enemies and animosity
In this way they keep their distance having turned toward complete solitude
Then his nature was described The multicolored banner Akṣayamati Asked for the cause of this names meaning
There are however mantras specific to each of them
whenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are void or that they are not void
Why is it the seal upon all phenomena Because it brings the realization of this side from the other side
They are those who cultivate meditation But without abiding and independent
He established many countless billions Of bodhisattvas in wisdom 
for the sake of showing compassion to us enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās
Now noble son what do you think
Those four bodhisattvas then spoke these verses to the Bhagavān
always maintain the transcendent perfection of generosity
A white cloth becomes black
Eight divided into right and left parts Is concealed in the amount of sixteen
The bodhisattvas while in this world will know
Venerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as imbued with happiness or suffering is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattva
Some arrive with heavenly trees in bloom With fruits flowers and perfect scents
They will never experience decline 
and their body will have the aroma of sandalwood
They fled like birds seeing a forest fire
It is attending upon wise beings It is rejecting those who are not wise beings
After I was liberated from all those views I realized the emptiness of phenomena
to be ignorant about the key points of practice to disregard the minor points of training
should perfect omniscience
Noble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara first comes when a being is ripened
where it fully partakes of its roots of virtue
Desiring beauty that is pleasing to all
A streamenterers fruition No preceptor I have not
And who elucidates the aspects of enlightenment The strengths the powers and the eightfold path
The birds that are peacocks Avadavats and partridges
They will know a lord of the world through his aroma
Look upon us you tathāgatas in the ten directions Who have peaceful minds and compassionate loving eyes
May his many sons wise and mighty
with which he will accomplish the buddhawork in the universe called Sahā
Then the Venerable Lord congratulated Senior Subhūti
Yes divine son it is
There are beings who were born in this worldly realm of afflictions and five impurities because they conducted themselves in evil ways in the past
But again after a few days the two of them began to misbehave and nanda asked Mahāmaudgalyāyana
While being here in this world they will smell the scents of the devas namely the scents of the divine nightflowering jasmine orchid tree coral tree great coral tree spider lily and great spider lily flowers
so it is that they correctly perceive the cessation of feelings
then sentient beings will become less desiring angry and ignorant and keep to the path of the ten virtuous actions
Though they worship buddhas by the millions With every conceivable offering They never dwell upon the least difference Between the buddhas and themselves
Mañjuśrī it is in order to attain the aggregates the elements and sense sources that acceptance is attained
This completes the seventeenth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Advantages
Not grasping at the mind and
nanda I realized the teaching of signlessness and wishlessness and so I quickly realized supreme perfect enlightenment and became a buddha
Subhūti it is because physical forms are empty of physical forms Similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty of consciousness and so forth
His eyes are pristine
Then one will be able to perform all the rites already mentioned
One may be able to count after many millions of eons
Thus with the exception of the tathāgatas all gods and humans śrāvakas and bodhisattvas
The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya replied to the Bhagavān
Bhikṣus the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha sees that the great jungle of kleśas is to be left behind departed from and abandoned But if these beings hear only of the wisdom of the buddhas they will be afraid and turn back thinking The accomplishment of the wisdom of the buddhas involves many hardships and they will not set out toward it
They will not end up in danger related to the sacred Dharma
Or nothing
Similarly owing to the fact that physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are void
He can take all the masses of fire of all the supernovas that ultimately consume all the universes of all the buddhafields into his stomach without interfering with their functions
Time after time she gathers in and again emanates the triple world
While observing the practices the one who desires a son Should drink milk with the flowers of the baka tree
you should perfect the transcendent perfection of generosity
Those who are based upon maliciousness Maintain their desires and attachments 
They are the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of existents concerning the composite
Bhagavān I go to the Sahā world realm through the Tathāgatas blessing through the Tathāgatas development of power the Tathāgatas display the Tathāgatas arrays and the Tathāgatas superior wisdom
My refuse rags are uncomfortable and make me sweat
Ignorance can never cause them harm Wisdom eliminates ignorance and stupidity
and after attaining enlightenment they will be praised by all the lord buddhas who reside in the world systems of the ten directions
Mistresses are there no gods in either of these palaces
Thereupon akra mighty lord of the gods addressed Senior Subhūti as follows
Tie it with five strings of various colors Then summon your target with the hook at the heart center
unfold wisdom illusions and project emanations that joyfully revel in all phenomena thus ripening sentient beings
To illustrate that if one applies purifying medicines of different typessuch as pungent bitter or astringentto the body one cures all illness and the body takes on a sublime vigorous appearance
Mañjuśrī you must by all means bless this Dharma teaching so that in future times it will be widely practiced in Jambudvīpa
His body was unshakable
Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdom a corresponding sense of tolerance arises
Similarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the nonactualization of the emptiness of internal phenomena and in the same vein of the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities as well as the applications of mindfulness and the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
This concludes the chapter on the nature of the body twentyfourth in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole Hero
When the stable ones do not entertain the notion of woman And do not have the concept of man
They should not dwell on the individual enlightenment of the pratyekabuddhas and they should not dwell on the other levels of attainment up to and including genuinely perfect enlightenment
then the luminosity of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas would not pervade the world with its gods humans and antigods numerous as the sands of the River Ganges However
for it clears away all displeasure
to perceive all buddhas while having no fixation with regard to the physical eye
Just like that formless great divine spirit partaking in divine enjoyments
They prostrated with their heads at the feet of the Blessed One the thusgone the worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni and circumambulated him three times before standing off to one side
In the past I enjoyed the most sacred and superb objects Among the gods of emanations
when he is born
But they do not consider the fact that they are practicing it
This is sin and that rises above sin
On that night such a person will then behold the thusgone ones
One should take a wisdomconsort from ones own spiritual family Or any other spiritual family keeping a focused mind
Noble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are experts with respect to the realm of phenomena
and then said this meaningful verse
Similarly they are fixated on the eyes and in the same manner they are fixated on the other sense organs including the mental faculty
It teaches the unchanging nature of phenomena and is a gateway to nondoing with regard to all phenomena
In order to teach the retinue of consorts
You should know those who do not entertain genuine realization to be the evil associates of great bodhisattva beings
and also bring sentient beings to maturation refine the buddhafields attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine
Thinking I am the buddha Acala A perfected being and my beloved is Prajñāpāramitā
Noble son how do bodhisattva great beings exert themselves in those ten perfections
Young men renounce the world in the light of this clear teaching
He has no interest in these aggregates or in the elements or in the sensemedia
He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena
He is neither this nor that
However he had not had his meal and therefore fasting for a second day
Seeking this peace this supreme samādhi I have in the past given to those who requested them Heaps of jewels as large as Sumeru And a similar amount of clothes and adornments 
You will attain the state of concentration the cultivation of peace
We do not have any doubt or uncertainty Thinking We will not become supreme humans
This is the Jewel of the Buddha
Attaining the strengths and the aspects of enlightenment Is not difficult for those who have obtained and recited this samādhi
of the essential nature of nonentity and empty of intrinsic defining characteristics
When noble disciples experience feelings of pain
He is exceedingly attractive
Great bodhisattva beings who practice it will not regress from omniscience
Overwhelmed with compassion they cried out Distressed unhappy wailing and collapsing
Their pool consists of the eight liberations
There were also six thousand caraka parivrājaka and nirgrantha nonBuddhists as well as the seven lords of the garuḍas
Through that wind after seven days have passed the consciousness produces an earringed young god immaculate and vibrant
and will be bound for the lower realms
He had all his limbs intact and his full faculties
When we were outside the town and had sat down
He pleased the priests by offering them delicious food and drink When they were all full he entertained them and presented them with gifts before they departed
After sixty eons had passed He became a jina named Padmottara 
He is neither compounded nor uncompounded
The four brahmavihāras the methods of attracting disciples And whatever else has been taught Has been taught by the supreme rishis For the purpose of guiding beings
āriputra that being the case once monks have seen the shortcomings of the sense pleasures they are disenchanted and free from desire
Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows the meaning
but there will be no trouble of indigestion during that time
Resembling the ocean he was deep and hard to fathom a source of jewels
While in this world through their nasal faculty They will smell the aromas of the airborne palaces The greater the medium and the lesser And whatever kinds of forms they have
The miraculous power of the buddhas is inconceivable
Next is the second secret
Mañjuśrī bodhisattva mahāsattvas do not practice within any phenomenon whatsoever

Bhagavat what root would that be
the thirtytwo major marks and eighty minor marks of a superior man
a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata one who knew the world

Likewise they should be attentive to the notions that the eyes the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty are impermanent

Those who have the vast inclinations to be within its scope
May negative actions be attenuated through confessing and acknowledging faults

Always speak gently and pleasantly And obtain the speech of the worlds teacher 
Similarly they include knowledge of contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena
and likewise when they engage in union with the emptiness of the origin of suffering the emptiness of the cessation of suffering and the emptiness of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering
And do so continuously with veneration 
similarly do you think that anything other than feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness constitutes a bodhisattva
Rather they dispense their generosity having established the notion that all sentient beings are undifferentiated
when I myself gain that state I will be known as a perfect buddha
As such this body comprises the hairs of the head the hairs of the body and in the same vein all the aforementioned things up to and including the brain tissue and cerebral secretions
nor has it anything that makes it cease

Noble sons with a tongue like this the thusgone ones do not tell lies
All who are lamps for the world Come from the ten directions
You should confess once again all your rejoicing in the roots of virtue of the past future and present tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas and their śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas from the time when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment until they became established in the sacred doctrine
Even though they may have become equipoised in meditative concentration they have not conceptualized it Even though they may have cultivated wisdom they have not conceptualized it
We are amazed and astonished And overjoyed to have heard your words
The Bhagavān now brought about a miracle such that through that miracle the fourfold assembly thought those eons were just one afternoon
Subhūti it is because past time is empty of the past
Are never deceitful or dishonest Are always gentle and always delight in liberation 
One should fill its mouth with ash and bury it
how could great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom acquire the notion of an entity or the notion of genuine origination or the notion of something that is authentic
It is the expression of truth for those who have fearlessness It is the correct search for the strengths
If when the evil Māra says such words the minds of those great bodhisattva beings are not alienated and frightened
in the same way the expanse of reality does not consider any other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of consciousness
And gods and humans will know that I am the God of Gods
The real nature of phenomena is indeed emptiness and emptiness indeed is the real nature of phenomena
he will practice celibacy throughout that time and attain enlightenment

With the physical eyes That have come from their parents
Then the multitude of divine princes inhabiting the world system of desire thought
Bhagavān how should one view the five faculties
One should fashion a pair of shoes out of deerskin and fill them with the seeds of midnight horror
In that way the body of a buddha Is inconceivable and immeasurable 
he manifested incalculable innumerable buddha emanations and guided countless beings
Similarly the windlike bodhisattvas produce bring forth and establish all the heaps of virtue of sentient beings that have been accomplished throughout the ten directions
They are skilled in the words of answering questions And thus they know the ultimate truth 
even now teaching the sacred doctrine
They make their home in a straw hut beside the wealthy mans house
In the same way they came and arrived from the ten directions and were seated in the eight directions
Those who were starving had their stomachs filled
it is the case that they correctly perceive perceptions to resemble for example a mirage which deceives those who crave water despite the fact that in a mirage actual water is nonapprehensible
Everyone in the entire assembly was filled with wonder each perceiving himself seated on a throne of jeweled lotuses
Grabbing Meru the foremost mountain and the adamantine mountain ranges And all other mountains throughout the ten directions He could reduce them all to powder
After being completely freed from results such as suffering and a contemptible body may I never again experience them
realizing that living beings know no end to their views concerning these twelve links of dependent originationthen
similarly that these remaining designations made with respect to the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty up to and including their designation as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattva
Similarly they discern that physical forms are imbued with suffering not a self
No Venerable Lord
Subhūti such is the refined eye of the sacred doctrine possessed by great bodhisattva beings
Monks the perfect and completely awakened ThusGone One thus sat for the first seven days on that very seat thinking Here I have reached unexcelled perfect and complete awakening Here I have brought an end to the sufferings of beginningless birth old age and death

However such thinking involves conceptual marks
The buddhas praise neither desire Nor having intercourse with women
I will be absorbed in meditation
The Bhagavān replied to Candraprabha
I bring satiation to all beings who have withered bodies And are attached to the three existences
What you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent patience that is not temporary consist in
It is a recitation of the pure wisdom of the tathāgatas
does not cease
they will experience suffering
the eyes ears and nose as well as taste and sound
You have said Venerable Lord that that mind which is omniscient is not included within the three world systems since it is without contaminants
You should also remember it as The Question of Maitreya
Merely to remember it using incanted ashes can stop snow falling or make it fall wherever one wishes
Bhikṣus this great śrāvaka of mine the sthavira Subhūti will serve three hundred thousand million buddhas will venerate them honor them make offerings to them praise them and respect them And

they dispense their generosity as follows
Mahākātyāyana
Alas Right here in my presence you should put an end to suffering and
they view it free of desirous attachment they view its cessation and view and rest in its utter abandonment
On the relative level doubt is a gateway to obscuration
and similarly they think that the other aggregates up to and including consciousness are distinct things and the emptiness of inherent existence another
Knowing all latencies and inclinations There is nothing you are not aware of

and they do not engage with feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness

Indeed I have and that is our signal the lad replied
Dāntottara Dānta Sudāntacitta Sudānta āntendriya āntamānasa

They are the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of the result concerning the composite
samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena

My younger sister and my daughterinlaw
Similarly are the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas also nonconceptual
a tree that after it has developed its leaves and foliage will then with time evolve so that finally they wither and fall
Noble son thus bodhisattvas cause their virtuous environment which has been accumulated throughout incalculable eons and contains an ocean of absorptions liberations and retentions as well as a central mountain light moon sun Dharma ways forests houses and virtuous surrounding mountains to manifest within the environment of sentient beings who cycle in existence In this way they guide them mature them and transfer them to the unsurpassable state beyond a body This is how they blow the wind of destructive wisdom Noble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are similar to wind
Likewise the windlike bodhisattvas delight sentient beings with their cloudbanks of numerous bodies

What is the root of desire and attachment
Subhūti if all things were not empty of inherent existence
Those who ultimately are not attached to any phenomenon will gain conviction

the samādhi named Vajra Armor

The brahmin Tiṣya thought
With that thought he prostrated at the pratyekabuddhas feet and made this prayer

beautifully adorned with a variety of jewels
Monks in this way the Bodhisattva proceeded on his way
Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings with overweening conceit
These disciples are not expert in discerning the superiority and inferiority of the spiritual faculties of living beings

 The markings on their palms and soles blaze with splendor
Similarly physical forms and the other aggregates up to and including consciousness are neither fettered nor liberated because they are void because they are nonarising and unceasing and because they are not fettered and not bound

I shall go elsewhere So pack up our household
The tathāgatas know all dharmas They know what those dharmas are

The learned brethren will ask the same questions I have just now asked you but in front of the saṅgha community

As another analogy Mahauṣadhi the great globe of the sun shines forth clearly constantly radiant and vivid

This is why I grieve so strongly The form that we manifested to destroy Gautama Would have broken his heart Had he only seen it

They are dedicated to the teachings of the Tathāgata in order to realize the four truths of the āryas as the cause of attaining nirvāṇa for themselves
If they find that their mind is involved in virtue they will feel joy appreciation and inspiration
So it is that this vehicle is said to be equal to space

Saying this the Guide of Men smiled
You previously made an aspiration To become their protector and refuge As well as their supreme supporter and defender
who extinguishes Avīci
As there are methods for bringing the womans mind to the state of enthrallment
Thus they think When I experience feelings of pleasure if the body should perish that will be the end of suffering
while the nadir is empty of the nadir
Persons who have reached twenty years of age on the other hand can accept all they may be subjected to
One should then nail the mouth with a thorn
Having lost his confidence he disappeared
I would not run out of things to say
āradvatīputra the noble eightfold path is merely conceptualized
So I will also offer you my homage
uddhipaṃthaka
As we have set out upon the state of awakening you have made us vigilant
Subhūti it is because they possess and manifest the attributes indications and signs of the irreversible great bodhisattva beings

In a world tormented by the fire of afflictions This lake has appeared

The king then sent messengers on horseback into the four directions with the order
He will teach the Dharma to eradicate the pride conceit and arrogance of an unfathomable countless number of beings
Blessed One we would like to see Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta and those bodhisattva great beings
After Brahmānana there was a buddha A jina who was named Brahmaśrava
Hence I have left the gathering The two hundred monks concurred
That is called the emptiness of nonapprehension
Some arrive proffering ponds with blooming lotuses They bring blue and white lotuses that have opened At the center of each of the flowers there are beings endowed with the thirtytwo marks

āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of generosity
The prince is to pray in the temple Ornament him well
and to the memorials of the thusgone ones he has offered fragrant oils banners of delicate cloth flags and threads of silk Therefore
I request it Bhagavat that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara may come
rest in concentration
I will establish them on the auspicious dry land without old age or death
A bodhisattvas buddhafield is a field of wisdom
 In the past hundreds of thousands of buddhas Have taught the Dharma hundreds of thousands of times
They experience intense suffering from unbearable heat and go through very unpleasant experiences In this way they suffer greatly
Oṃ nīlāmbaradhara vajrapāṇi hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ The root mantra of the Blessed One accomplishes all activities This is the secret of the awakened mind of all buddhas
Its branches were long and spread out spaciously The ground where the fig tree stood was smooth like the palm of a hand beautiful and open and it was full of dark blue grass the color of a peacocks neck
Alternatively the transfer it undergoes is like a seed
Subhūti do you think that with regard to the reality of all things there exists the description of anything
these marks cause the earth with its mountains and forests to tremble
but if I had no method and instructed these beings to attain a tathāgatas wisdom strengths and fearlessnesses
They must not be moved by ambition anger ignorance or fear
the other sensory attributes are empty of feelings due to sensory contact that is visually compounded and so forth similarly feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compounded and so forth are empty of feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compounded
You should remain consciously aware in the midst of the pleasures of desire
it with flowers incense perfumes and flower garlands or by offering even just a single karṣāpaṇa to it
Then Ajita that man introduces those beings to the Dharmas guidance that has been taught by the Tathāgata
I will completely ripen those beings
without a soul or a person
three million two hundred thousand gods gave rise to the intention to attain unexcelled perfect and complete awakening
he is the One Who Does Not Perceive Differences
The ākya girl Gopā heard this rumor and in front of all the folk of the inner quarters she said these verses
He went to the king and said
Upāli asked the Blessed Buddha
those who wish to abandon attachment to the world system of form
Through this transcendent perfection of wisdom and skill in means they do not regress to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas
it is because the doctrine of the Great Vehicle and the doctrine which is omniscience are neither conjoined nor disjoined
The nature of the noble truths is emptiness Emptiness is the noble truths
He will teach so that those engaged in yogic practices will achieve their fruition
bodhisattva mahāsattvas who obtain this samādhi
Subhūti there are two ways in which great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom attract sentient beings with the gift of the sacred doctrine
Situated optionally on a sun disk
It is said that his power consists of the ten strengths and that he has a body like that of Nārāyaṇa
likewise they do not consider whether feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness arise or cease
And then due to the ripening of previous karma of beginner bodhisattvas and immature ordinary people who are guided by means of nirvāṇa
It is done without seeing the tathāgatas without focusing on the self and without any desire for the ripening of karma
Eighty bodhisattvas attained patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as nonarising
There are no unworthy beings present here xxvii
Noble son in the past when I was a bodhisattva named Siṃhalarāja I was going to the island of Siṃhala with five hundred merchants
One with a pure mind clear and unblemished Practices the peace of this samādhi 
One should keep all ones practice very secret So that nobody knows
he unsurpassed guide who tames beings the teacher to gods and men the Blessed Buddha ākyamuni
 Just as you have realized the Dharma And practiced the Buddhas instructions in the world
The strength of ten gods dwelling in the immeasurable palace is the same as the strength of one ṣādhāra god
āradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the ten powers of the tathāgatas and in the same vein all the other aforementioned fruitional attributes up to and including omniscience as nonentities
That is why they are called bodhisattva mahāsattvas
Passing quickly into nirvāṇa they do not bring forth the fragrance of the buddhas discipline
It neither bestows nor withholds the maturity of the bodhisattvas
Can never be accomplished by religious austerities
Knowing this the goddesses approached the seat of awakening and praised the ThusGone One with these verses
The Bhagavān replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Noble Avalokiteśvaras inquiry with the following words
I pay homage to you who possess the power of truth and the ten strengths
Having completed the procedure of the preliminary practice as before
In accordance with the aspirations made by the thusgone ones through the gift of my flesh and blood
That is called the emptiness of external and internal phenomena
Those of noble family who engage in this practice must maintain ritual purity make ablutions and change their clothes three times a day
Similarly they teach the doctrine that the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty are impermanent
When day broke he had arrived six leagues away from the town of Anumaineya in the country of Maineya
The strength of correct conduct the strength of samādhi And the strength of the Dharma and therefore was a superior bhikṣu 
Seeing them they make offerings to them with faith Those are the benefits of being without avarice 
All are invincible strong and powerful
Similarly they apprehend the eyes and develop a view of the eyes in an apprehending manner
And so generously provide them With the gifts that consist of the seven jewels
Who would give these shavenheaded ascetics alms or think to help them
Reflecting on the bliss of the spirit of enlightenment circulating
Some who have gathered the accumulation of merit Arrive at the seat of awakening bright as rainbows
However the Bodhisattva wanted to demonstrate the conduct of a renunciant so he did not give the cloth to akra Instead he washed it himself
In your past lives you gave away your wealth jewels and gold Your beloved wife and children your land cities and villages And even your own head eyes hands and feet
the nāgas Vāsuki and so forth also the nāginīs made of nāgakesara wood
Now that you have surely reached the other shore
Through that they make offerings to me
There is no eye no man no woman and no self There is no ear no nose no tongue and no body
You must develop a powerful diligence In order to attain omniscient wisdom
When I claim to have attained genuinely perfect buddhahood
Maitreya here today the Bhagavān gazing at a rice seedling spoke this aphorism to the bhikṣus
What is meant by seat of enlightenment
As soon as the Bhagavān entered that state there fell a rain of coral tree flowers
Likewise the flower does not think I form the fruit Nor does the fruit think I am formed by the flower
nanda those who retain hold and so forth this transcendent perfection of wisdom and
continuously patient and accepting
In this case if the stars the planets the sun and the moon are not visible
Those who remain in equanimity Are always free of arrogance and depression
millions of silken banners fluttered in the wind
as a physical feeling
Then he saw two gods the Sun and Moon standing on his right and left sides
There are some who wear one two three four five six seven or more pieces of clothing while others go naked
Those who maintain perfectly pure correct conduct Who remain always in inconceivable dhyāna
Thus with this insight bodhisattvas understand correctly that although sentient beings do not exist the ripening of virtuous and unvirtuous karma nevertheless does manifest
Physician Kumārabhṛta What illness is this Please have a look
Measure with a splint just four finger widths tall A splint of exactly that length shall be called a bar 
I will also bring sentient beings to maturity
 It is speaking gently  It is not remaining anywhere in the three realms
I will destroy it with knowledge Just as water destroys a vessel of unbaked clay
Mañjuśrī it is likewise that the Tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha creates through the might of his arms and his merit the three realms of a Dharma king within the three realms which is trampled on by evil Māra
Having completely given up all their possessions
Monks at that point the ThusGone One decided My five ascetic companions will be the ones to whom I shall teach the Dharma for the first time
I am the one who first established them on the level of being a bodhisattva I am the one who has ripened and developed them
I see others Mañjughoṣa following the teachings Of sugatas who have passed into nirvāṇa
The bodhisattva mahāsattvas who see in that way are engaging in the discernment of phenomena
then āriputra the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas with skill in methods teach that single Buddhayāna as a teaching of three yānas
The yogins do not conceptualize things But live always detached 
And seeking this highest enlightenment They give their hands and feet when requested 
They will not deviate whatsoever from the mind of complete awakening
I took the bowl and went to the door of the mansion of a great brahmin family
She will by her own actions Certainly maintain her pregnant womb
For conjunctivitis relief will come after wiping the eyes
Evil one the earth here is my witness
and whose knowledge had rent open the shell
Subhūti There is a distinct way in which bodhisattvas might undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from it
Sarvabodhisattvaśrī Glory of All Bodhisattvas
up to those who are attentive to the notion that the eyes are the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities and at the same time apprehend those modes of emptiness
In my threepetaled lotus Endowed with a fleshy circle
They build the strong ship of the Dharma
Divine son I base myself on the acts with immediate consequence and
Padmaśrīgarbha tell me are there many displays of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha Amitābha
Thus for one hundred thousand years they will venerate these tathāgatas with the divine and manifest offerings meant for a tathāgata
Divine son whoever is an irreversible bodhisattva great being has no chance and no opportunity not to attain awakening
and their father said to Koṣṭhila
They could not perceive their bodies their features or shape nor did they have a sense of touch
At this the Bhagavān congratulated the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja saying
He teaches this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma sometimes in the form of Brahmā sometimes in the form of akra sometimes in the form of śvara sometimes in the form of Maheśvara sometimes in the form of a general sometimes in the form of Vaiśravaṇa sometimes in the form of a cakravartin sometimes in the form of a king of a region sometimes in the form of a head merchant sometimes in the form of a householder sometimes in the form of a townsman and sometimes in the form of a brahmin
Bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas upāsikās kings princes the kings prime ministers the kings counselors the people of the city the people of the country the brahmins and the householders will honor them respect them revere them and make offerings to them
I dwelled extensively with a mind free from error
Likewise bodhisattvas are vessels of all sorts of precious qualities and all manner of such qualities can be found within them
When he had said that the Bhagavān commended āriputra
And Kṣemadattas body became Adorned by the primary signs 
Later the person to whom one gives flowers incense unguents fragrant powders or betel will become enthralled
they will arise and cease according to karmic causes and conditions
who is a splendor of jewels
One should place the soles of ones feet on the ground Each in the same way parallel
Then once again the Blessed One addressed Senior āradvatīputra in the following words
Some have one clairvoyance
before presenting him with a girl who is young and beautiful and dear to his heart
Like the selfarisen Brahmā pure in body and mind
to take hold of the mind
It had been sprinkled with water swept clean made symmetrical and made fragrant with smoke rising from incense burners
Mañjuśrī said Divine son this is how it is
Immeasurable is the ocean of your virtues the accumulation of your good deeds
To turn people away from the Individual Vehicle and to engage them in the Mahāyāna he appeared among listeners and teachers of the Dharma
Present there were the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife such as Suyāma
any son or daughter of noble family who immersed in faith and full of interest develops the mind of awakening based on a sūtra that the ThusGone One has taught like this one and takes hold of the sūtra remembers it reads it understands it and teaches it extensively to others
the twentyeight great yakṣa generals
During the short eons of swords They meditate on love Introducing to nonviolence Hundreds of millions of living beings
 It is the constant avoidance of unrestrained practitioners It is the level of buddhahood taught by tathāgatas
Well then why do you not go forth
The vinaya of the hearers is like escaping from being burned by a fire
How can the aggregate of correct conduct be flawless
brahmins royalty townspeople or country dwellers
Noble son do not fall from a bodhisattva bhūmi to be reborn in the lower existences
At the same time as the blessed Bodhisattva was born
From there they endeavor to let thought and discernment disappear
Then visualize it burning like camphor
You gave away your body while the priest kept his
This concludes Sadāparibhūta the nineteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma
What kind of actions they do And the ripening of their karma 
the inconceivably numerous words of incomparability concerning teaching the composite the inconceivably numerous words of incomparability concerning the kleśas
They will attain the conduct that is within the supreme samādhi And an endless multitude of other benefits
Why is it the elimination of ignorance Because it brings freedom from all inappropriate mental engagement
Their bodies shine like the purest gold And have the thirtytwo primary signs of a great being 
The Buddha then said to the merchants son Sudatta
Young man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of poverty What are the four kinds of knowledge of poverty
 In this very city of Rājagṛha in the past He has seen ten thousand million buddhas
Refreshed in body and mind
Pramodabhāgyalolā She Who Longs for Delight and Happiness
similarly do you think that anything other than the real nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness constitutes a bodhisattva
Offer the burned substances of dough Mustard seeds sweets and so forth in sequence
Among the  women the ākya girl Gopā was consecrated as the foremost wife
never abandoning the realms of sentient beings through assuming a body that can tolerate any amount of suffering
It indicates to these worlds that omniscience is empty
This was the second chapter of The Tantra of the Vajra in the Underworld The Oblation
contains the rainclouds oceans four great continents Mount Sumeru Mucilinda Mountains Mahāmucilinda Mountains snow mountains circular mountains great circular mountains gandhamādana Mountains and all towns streams forests and palaces
