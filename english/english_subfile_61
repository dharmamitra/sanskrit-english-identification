Avalokiteśvara is immeasurableMoreover āradvatīputra the spiritual mentors to great bodhisattva beings teach the doctrines thatIn what way you may wonder do bodhisattvas absorb the great rain of DharmaAt this nanda prostrated himself before the Blessed One and askedThe domain of the six transcendences where one attains the transcendence of the thoughts and actions of all living beings such is the domain of the bodhisattvaThey will not attract men women boys or girls with miraculous fortune telling claiming You will have a son You will have a daughter Your family line will be broken You will have a long life You will have a short lifeView refers to equipoise Subsequent attainment is explained as conductThis is how the petition is made while seated the monk says Reverend saṅgha please heed meBhagavān if the Bhagavān will permit us after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇait is so because of the understanding of the aspects of the pathThe superb and radiant fields of the sugatas

committing the acts with immediate consequencesettled into the state of concentration known as the garlands of the buddhas andit is impossible to fathom the multitude of forms the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha takes in order to bring sentient beings to spiritual maturityGiving away dear sons food and drink And even your head and eyesThe Great Sage who is well trained in thousands of virtuesKāśyapa the Tathāgata presents all dharmas correctlySome had just one arm while others had up to one hundred thousandIt is because that place should be perceived as being the Bodhimaṇḍa of all the tathāgatasAmong these sensation is threefoldVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of inconceivable deeds and innumerable deedsHaving taught that Dharma he became silentThey had destroyed the bonds of existence andJust as they do not apprehend this transcendent perfection of wisdom while practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdomIt then occurred to him Birth happens when there is existencethe nonhuman spirits would themselves swiftly depart because they would be unable to stand the brilliance of this precious gemstoneoffered my own body eyes flesh Fb marrow bones and skinnot to mention all the outer material thingsThe nonpresence is through the word presence Its nature is that there is nothing to be found the term ultimate reality denotes nirvāṇa in the context of the emptiness of ultimate realityAny practice of any solitary buddha constitutes bodhisattva practiceIt is being adept in the āyatanas and in the dhātus Does the Jina teach this samādhi and similarly if they perfect the eight aspects of liberation exclusively by way of signlessnessany thought of agitation any thought of indolenceOne should visualize oneselfAccordingly āradvatīputra I say that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will purify the negativity of bodyBodhisattvas without being infatuated by their conscientiousness should be entirely free of carelessnessThose who do not instigate contemplation will not dwell on any concernsThey must have great stores of treasure and grainYou have been empowered by a hundred thousand buddhasin the same way āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings perceive all things distinctly but do not become fixated on themLove is a gateway to the light of the Dharmawho practice the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomSo I ought to dwell silently in the forest With a mind stilled by the bliss of concentrated absorptionIn that sense a bodhisattva is called a great beingThe prophecy declares that all phenomena are unbornHow are they mentally pureFor then will your body be swathed in the Buddhas mindRecite spreading secret mantras Perform the projection and reabsorptionNoble son you should understand these four to be deeds of MāraToday my life has borne fruitthey are adorned with a glorious body speech and mindand similarly when they do not make assumptions based on feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessand similarly they fully perfect the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationWere all able to see and hear Mañjuśrī it is because this Dharma teaching has been blessed by all the buddhasSubhūti great bodhisattva beings will be stable in the community of the genuinely perfect buddhasThe saṅgha of bhikṣus asked the kingThrough wearing the strong armor of forbearance For many tens of millions of eonsWhy is that so Monk as all phenomena are at all times unafflicted they are perfectly pure by natureSince this spontaneously manifests as infinite statements in accord with all perspectives it satisfies all beings and is understood throughout all realms of the worldPurity in discipline purity in view purity in mind and purity in insightIn that way you will be worshipping the blessed buddhas of the past the future and the presentand remember the kindness of others They must be physically strong with great power and strength indeed supreme strength being content with ones spouse and  undermining the interest of those who study the DharmaBhagavān no it could not The Bhagavān asked Monk what do you think Could something nonarising arise or ceaseor an act of suspension for refusal to give up deviant viewsThe one who writes this king of mantras Makes a spell of it and wears it on the upper armAnd said in the voice of a cuckoos callHaving put an end to suffering they will go to pleasant forms of existence until they become fully and perfectly awakened buddhas within unsurpassable complete and perfect awakeninglessed One how does consciousness controlled by the circumstance of its lack of form accomplish the creation of formsThey do not see a tathāgata as other than consciousnessāradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should train accordingly in those things which are conceptualized as names and symbolsAll things move and change and are impermanent like clouds They may be likened to a flash of lightningthat they all had the power of bodhisattvasSon have you actualized arhatship he asked No preceptor I have notand there are no sentient beings and no other posited subject up to and including knowers and viewersHe did not consider that understanding to be anything other than physical formsIn that universe even the names disciple and solitary sage do not existOthers had no armsSimilarly apart from engaging in the emptiness of internal phenomena and apart from engaging in the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities the tathāgatas do not apprehend anythingHow should they investigate the meditative stability of signlessnessWhat is this word Buddha which brings such joy to all beingsWhat is the knowledge of distinguishing between the words for phenomenaWhen I enter into houses earth is thrown at meAs he went he vanquished one opponent after another in villages cities towns marketplaces and hamlets until he reached Rājagṛhareprimand or rebuke them striking them with clods of earth clubs or weapons or cutting off all their limbs and appendagesFriends please listen to the gateways to the light of the Dharma that delight the gods which these bodhisattvas teach the gods by the way in which they pass awayThey enter the assembly Fearlessly and confidentlyThere is no lust hatred and ignoranceAnd that they are the same as poisonous plants or fires or like angry vipersBlessed One how do bodhisattvas remain constantly in equipoise without any interruptionThe sounds of divine instruments constantly arose without being playedAnd the concept of happiness was lostNoble one stay a little while gain some ascertainment of the Dharma with my bodhisattva mahāsattva Mañjuśrī KumārabhūtaThey may speak of form yet ultimately form is not observed and they cannot be attached to itNoble son Dharmaworship is that worship rendered to the discourses taught by the Tathāgata These discourses are deep and profound in illuminationforming what is known as the light of universal illuminationpossessed by all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasThe suffering of birth and saṃsāra Is the conceptualization of foolish understandingVenerable Lord Great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly and seek emancipation in unsurpassed completely perfect enlightenment should always train in the manner of an illusory personSubhūti it is because those sentient beings will know that with respect to the real nature of phenomena there is nothing at all that existsnanda if a person is willing to travel for hundreds of miles just to receive news of a friend and is delighted to hear that newsyakṣas and rākṣasas will perform activities for them like slavesYou possessed fortitude determination unshakable resolve and diligenceSome bring the four oceans on top of their headsin order to fulfill the great compassion he does not destroy compounded thingsWith a fourpetaled lotus in the centerSatatasamitābhiyukta the bodhisattva mahāsattvas will acquire that kind of sense of hearing but will not yet at that time have attained divine hearingIn that case I shall cut from myself the remedy and as instructed will give him the fresh blood and fresh fleshAnd their teaching of the Dharma knows no end When practicing the development stageCould not move or sway you from the trunk of the sublime Bodhi treeTaking care of this treasure of the Dharma And teaching it to the sons of the JinaThe young nāga thought What suffering could be worse than my present sufferingThe sum total of the merit of all those beings with as much merit as akra would then match the merit of BrahmāThey falsely present the symptoms Of all diseasesit cannot be scrutinized it is not within the range of sophistryKneeling on the cap of his left kneeThis is the Dharma of saviors For millions upon billions

disorders jaundice hemorrhoidsAlways having the characteristic of a hallucination That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind Goodness Where is the harm in waiting seven or eight daysNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are beings of noble birthFor this reason Senior Subhūti it is clear that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is extremely hard to bring forth and it is hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenmentWhoever possesses such a sūtra as this reads it studies it teaches it and teaches it extensively to others will have the desirable result ripening from thatBefore you relinquished treasuries of jewels gold silver and ornamentsThose who are practicing the supreme conduct Who are adept in causes reasons and disciplineSimilarly the transcendence of the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty is always without fearInstead the mind remains dull and oppressed by torporIf you ask what are the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise they are as followsThey abide in the transcendent perfection of generosity that is neither fettered nor liberated They abide in the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom which are neither fettered nor liberatedHoly Man dont eat solid foodOne should allow six months for this practice of each In combination with the respective previously described gazeDeveloping aversion to everything that is composite they might enter the faultlessness of the śrāvakasAnd his eyes are redand others incur transgressions in their maturityVenerable Lord Are the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomena free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existenceand  bodhisattvasThose who accomplish this stainless samādhiHe is called the one who perceives everything with the great light of wisdomThey will experience many misfortunes in that very life and will burn in the hell realms in their future rebirthsIt is better to die in battle Than live defeated by the enemythey inclined their bodies they bowed their bodies they bowed well bowed perfectlyHe mastered the three gateways to liberationBuddhahood the state of Vajrasattva Is perfectly accomplished in terms of the relativeBut bodhisattvas are overjoyed and thrilled To have obtained this stainless samādhi Seated we talked among ourselves asking each other what we should doSimilarly they know the modalities of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and yet they are without fixation on themThose who wept when they saw the bhikṣu Afflicted by the agony of his illnessSubhūti it is because the eyes are empty of the eyes and in the same veinThey are the inconceivably numerous designations concerning the compositeWhatever he says is thus tathā undistorted thus and not otherwise ThereforeHis left knee is on the groundThis will give you longlasting

this a serious breach occursMonks in this way all the ākya youths were defeated andand in the same vein do you think that other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death constitute a bodhisattvaIn this way they delight all beingsExcellent Viśiṣṭacāritra excellentThey should perceive every buddha and bodhisattva as the teacherlike the perception of color in one blind from birthand asked Has the Blessed One a bodyand who commit this transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing or have it committed to writingThose who cause music to be played for them With the pleasant sounds of ḍamarus conches and bherī drumsextended his goldencolored right hand and to the delight of akra lord of the gods and the gods of the Heaven of the ThirtyThree pointed out their

mastery of miraculous powersBlessed One these gods all really wish to build a stūpaYou should dedicate whatever gifts you have offered to all sentient beings making common cause with all sentient beings and without apprehending anything toward the attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentVenerable Lord if the eyes are invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the eyes become a bodhisattvaand came down from Vulture Peak Mountain together with  monksNoble ones at that time King ubhavyūha together with his harem numbering eightyfour thousand became recipients for the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaWelcome O KauśikaNoble son this is how bodhisattva great beings abandon slanderāriputra I cause the acquisition of the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomThere fell a rain of divine flowers and coral tree flowers There was the sound of drums without drums being beatenor with a leapmonth to make a year of thirteen months it were to rain day and night noble son I could count each drop of rain butThe bodhisattva Prabhāketu declaredWill have many endless benefits Mañjughoṣa it will always be like that for themIn the same vein they will have fewer ideas about everyday necessitiesColor and shape are the demon of the aggregatesThey do not apprehend all the fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceSubhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of toleranceVenerable LordIn accordance with the aspirations of the buddhas through this offering of perfumes fragrant powders and ointments may I anoint all sentient beings with the fragrances of discipline erudition and absorptionAt which point the novice says It is excellentI too will worship those who listen to it write it down read it aloud memorize it Fb and disseminate itand the experience of all divine and human perfectionsMañjuśrī the Tathāgata is the dharmakāyaIf you ask whyIn what way you may wonder are bodhisattvas the ground for the seeds of virtuous qualities It is the attainment of the perfection of sharp wisdom It is being as unwavering and unshakable as a mountainSubhūti it is because the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of generosity is empty of the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of generosity and similarly Subhūti the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom are empty of the essential nature of the transcendent perfection of wisdom and so forthWho are the bodhisattvas who have received abundant teachingsthey would give drinks to those who need drink andOf those who have served the buddhas The lords of the world in the past the words arisen from nonexistenceBodhisattvas are similarly there for all sentient beings equallyThey have perfectly attained liberation through knowledge and wisdom And they dispense the medicine of the good DharmaHe wonders Oh no will the ākya lineage of such fortune now be destroyedthose who engage in unvirtuous acts and those who attack me seeking enemies and animosityIn this way they keep their distance having turned toward complete solitudeThen his nature was described The multicolored banner Akṣayamati Asked for the cause of this names meaningThere are however mantras specific to each of themwhenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are void or that they are not voidWhy is it the seal upon all phenomena Because it brings the realization of this side from the other sideThey are those who cultivate meditation But without abiding and independentHe established many countless billions Of bodhisattvas in wisdom for the sake of showing compassion to us enjoy these airborne palaces of the BrahmāsNow noble son what do you thinkThose four bodhisattvas then spoke these verses to the Bhagavānalways maintain the transcendent perfection of generosityA white cloth becomes blackEight divided into right and left parts Is concealed in the amount of sixteenThe bodhisattvas while in this world will knowVenerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as imbued with happiness or suffering is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattvaSome arrive with heavenly trees in bloom With fruits flowers and perfect scentsThey will never experience decline and their body will have the aroma of sandalwoodThey fled like birds seeing a forest fireIt is attending upon wise beings It is rejecting those who are not wise beingsAfter I was liberated from all those views I realized the emptiness of phenomenato be ignorant about the key points of practice to disregard the minor points of trainingshould perfect omniscienceNoble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara first comes when a being is ripenedwhere it fully partakes of its roots of virtueDesiring beauty that is pleasing to allA streamenterers fruition No preceptor I have notAnd who elucidates the aspects of enlightenment The strengths the powers and the eightfold pathThe birds that are peacocks Avadavats and partridgesThey will know a lord of the world through his aromaLook upon us you tathāgatas in the ten directions Who have peaceful minds and compassionate loving eyesMay his many sons wise and mightywith which he will accomplish the buddhawork in the universe called SahāThen the Venerable Lord congratulated Senior SubhūtiYes divine son it isThere are beings who were born in this worldly realm of afflictions and five impurities because they conducted themselves in evil ways in the pastBut again after a few days the two of them began to misbehave and nanda asked MahāmaudgalyāyanaWhile being here in this world they will smell the scents of the devas namely the scents of the divine nightflowering jasmine orchid tree coral tree great coral tree spider lily and great spider lily flowersso it is that they correctly perceive the cessation of feelingsthen sentient beings will become less desiring angry and ignorant and keep to the path of the ten virtuous actionsThough they worship buddhas by the millions With every conceivable offering They never dwell upon the least difference Between the buddhas and themselvesMañjuśrī it is in order to attain the aggregates the elements and sense sources that acceptance is attainedThis completes the seventeenth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled AdvantagesNot grasping at the mind andnanda I realized the teaching of signlessness and wishlessness and so I quickly realized supreme perfect enlightenment and became a buddhaSubhūti it is because physical forms are empty of physical forms Similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty of consciousness and so forthHis eyes are pristineThen one will be able to perform all the rites already mentionedOne may be able to count after many millions of eonsThus with the exception of the tathāgatas all gods and humans śrāvakas and bodhisattvasThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya replied to the BhagavānBhikṣus the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha sees that the great jungle of kleśas is to be left behind departed from and abandoned But if these beings hear only of the wisdom of the buddhas they will be afraid and turn back thinking The accomplishment of the wisdom of the buddhas involves many hardships and they will not set out toward itThey will not end up in danger related to the sacred DharmaOr nothingSimilarly owing to the fact that physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are voidHe can take all the masses of fire of all the supernovas that ultimately consume all the universes of all the buddhafields into his stomach without interfering with their functionsTime after time she gathers in and again emanates the triple worldWhile observing the practices the one who desires a son Should drink milk with the flowers of the baka treeyou should perfect the transcendent perfection of generosityThose who are based upon maliciousness Maintain their desires and attachments They are the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of existents concerning the compositeBhagavān I go to the Sahā world realm through the Tathāgatas blessing through the Tathāgatas development of power the Tathāgatas display the Tathāgatas arrays and the Tathāgatas superior wisdomMy refuse rags are uncomfortable and make me sweatIgnorance can never cause them harm Wisdom eliminates ignorance and stupidityand after attaining enlightenment they will be praised by all the lord buddhas who reside in the world systems of the ten directionsMistresses are there no gods in either of these palacesThereupon akra mighty lord of the gods addressed Senior Subhūti as followsTie it with five strings of various colors Then summon your target with the hook at the heart centerunfold wisdom illusions and project emanations that joyfully revel in all phenomena thus ripening sentient beingsTo illustrate that if one applies purifying medicines of different typessuch as pungent bitter or astringentto the body one cures all illness and the body takes on a sublime vigorous appearanceMañjuśrī you must by all means bless this Dharma teaching so that in future times it will be widely practiced in JambudvīpaHis body was unshakableSubhūti when great bodhisattva beings abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdom a corresponding sense of tolerance arisesSimilarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the nonactualization of the emptiness of internal phenomena and in the same vein of the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities as well as the applications of mindfulness and the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThis concludes the chapter on the nature of the body twentyfourth in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole HeroWhen the stable ones do not entertain the notion of woman And do not have the concept of manThey should not dwell on the individual enlightenment of the pratyekabuddhas and they should not dwell on the other levels of attainment up to and including genuinely perfect enlightenmentthen the luminosity of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas would not pervade the world with its gods humans and antigods numerous as the sands of the River Ganges Howeverfor it clears away all displeasureto perceive all buddhas while having no fixation with regard to the physical eyeJust like that formless great divine spirit partaking in divine enjoymentsThey prostrated with their heads at the feet of the Blessed One the thusgone the worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni and circumambulated him three times before standing off to one sideIn the past I enjoyed the most sacred and superb objects Among the gods of emanationswhen he is bornBut they do not consider the fact that they are practicing itThis is sin and that rises above sinOn that night such a person will then behold the thusgone onesOne should take a wisdomconsort from ones own spiritual family Or any other spiritual family keeping a focused mindNoble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are experts with respect to the realm of phenomenaand then said this meaningful verseSimilarly they are fixated on the eyes and in the same manner they are fixated on the other sense organs including the mental facultyIt teaches the unchanging nature of phenomena and is a gateway to nondoing with regard to all phenomenaIn order to teach the retinue of consortsYou should know those who do not entertain genuine realization to be the evil associates of great bodhisattva beingsand also bring sentient beings to maturation refine the buddhafields attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment turn the wheel of the sacred doctrineThinking I am the buddha Acala A perfected being and my beloved is PrajñāpāramitāNoble son how do bodhisattva great beings exert themselves in those ten perfectionsYoung men renounce the world in the light of this clear teachingHe has no interest in these aggregates or in the elements or in the sensemediaHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenaHe is neither this nor thatHowever he had not had his meal and therefore fasting for a second daySeeking this peace this supreme samādhi I have in the past given to those who requested them Heaps of jewels as large as Sumeru And a similar amount of clothes and adornments You will attain the state of concentration the cultivation of peaceWe do not have any doubt or uncertainty Thinking We will not become supreme humansThis is the Jewel of the BuddhaAttaining the strengths and the aspects of enlightenment Is not difficult for those who have obtained and recited this samādhiof the essential nature of nonentity and empty of intrinsic defining characteristicsWhen noble disciples experience feelings of painHe is exceedingly attractiveGreat bodhisattva beings who practice it will not regress from omniscienceOverwhelmed with compassion they cried out Distressed unhappy wailing and collapsingTheir pool consists of the eight liberationsThere were also six thousand caraka parivrājaka and nirgrantha nonBuddhists as well as the seven lords of the garuḍasThrough that wind after seven days have passed the consciousness produces an earringed young god immaculate and vibrantand will be bound for the lower realmsHe had all his limbs intact and his full facultiesWhen we were

sixty eons had passed He became a jina named Padmottara He is neither compounded nor uncompoundedThe four brahmavihāras the methods of attracting disciples And whatever else has been taught Has been taught by the supreme rishis For the purpose of guiding beingsāriputra that being the case once monks have seen the shortcomings of the sense pleasures they are disenchanted and free from desireMañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows the meaningbut there will be no trouble of indigestion during that timeResembling the ocean he was deep and hard to fathom a source of jewelsWhile in this world through their nasal faculty They will smell the aromas of the airborne palaces The greater the medium and the lesser And whatever kinds of forms they haveThe miraculous power of the buddhas is inconceivableNext is the second secretMañjuśrī bodhisattva mahāsattvas do not practice within any phenomenon whatsoeverFoolish beings always unceasingly Have strong attachment to the putrid bodyBlessed One I do not grasp the reason for your questionnanda if you wonder whether Prince Puṣpa was then at that time someone elseBy whatever merit accrues from worshipping the Victor May we become a great sage like youthis purity of phenomena is neither attained nor manifestly realized due to the emptiness of all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceAlas Sentient beings are constantly obsessed with their homes although they are containers of suffering and intense afflictions Seeing such beings the thusgone ones wish to teach them the Dharma so that they may emerge from their homes and truly go beyond the three realmsThey themselves should perfect the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasbowing down at the feet of the Buddha placed their palms together in reverence and withdrew to one sideAre not soiled by faultsand is beyond all similesWhen this singleminded inspiration pervades them they complete the respective level and remain within itwhether they are dying or being born good or bad of a good color or a bad color in the higher existences or the lower existences dwelling on the Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla

for a long time And at this time she said to the sovereign king Owing to the fact that sentient beings are emptiness you should see that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is emptinessThe fourth aspect of liberation ensues when the perceptions of physical forms have been completely transcended in all respects when the perceptions of obstructed phenomena have subsided and the mind does not

actualized the cessation of suffering that truth of noble beings vision aroseMounted on this vehicle they proceed to the buddhafields in order to benefit sentient beings and in order to behold the buddhas but in addition they are without the notion of a buddhafield they are without the notion of sentient beings and they are even without the notion of a buddhananda just as the shade of the trees of Jambudvīpa with their different foliage different flowers and different fruitsTo the image of a sugata in a mural They will eventually see millions of buddhas They see that phenomena have no self

that sounds the lions roar because it is free of fear and tremblingin a world named SaṃbhavāThere are great bodhisattva beings who can indeed see with their eyes of flesh as far as two hundred

establish innumerable and countless sentient beings in the applications of mindfulness and so on up to and including omnisciencethe beings who are on this and that level higher middling and lower like the plants bushes herbs and forest treesBecause it is the abiding nature of phenomenaSimilarly Subhūti the past limits of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberatedSimilarly the tathāgatas do not apprehend anything apart from engaging in the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThose tathāgatas arhats and genuinely perfect buddhas who reside in the innumerable world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges and who are alive at presentVenerable Lord It is as you have saidand dedicated himself to making offerings of all the most pleasing necessities to those bodhisattvasEating yellow myrobalan with sugarThere was nothing that I had not previously offered Heads hands legs wives and likewise sons An abundance of riches and similarly food to eat It does not apprehend the transcendence of the world system of form or the transcendence of the world system of formlessnessThe entourages of the guardians of the world Have not received the instructionThey are fighting and yowling That is the kind of terrifying house it ishe sees that his followers are pure with deep dedication and realization of the Dharma of emptiness and have acquired dhyāna and great dhyānaBut those men forcibly bring back the poor man wailingthe Lord of the Heaven of the ThirtyThree the thousandeyed blazing vajraThey will lead to inexhaustible accumulations of merit and wisdom to the abandonment of all types of views and even to the realization of all the qualities of awakeningThey have discovered the unconditioned and are unconditioned and formation is therefore not relevant to themExistence is the causal condition of birthEven if there were no old age sickness or deathWhy did you not tell meas well as eight hundred female servants and five hundred male servants headed by ChandaIf that were the case there would be no changes and no conceptual notions regarding all attributes and attainments up to and including enlightenmentThose who want to have the lord buddhas and great bodhisattva beings as a spiritual mentor listen to the sacred doctrine and thenheard how the King of Aṅga had been killed prompting him to close the gates and take cover within the walls of the fortressOn the ultimate level the

pureit is their cognition and exertion that will be greater not the cognition and exertion of those who have become followers through faith those who have become pratyekabuddhas and so forthAlas This world is doomedWhat is abiding It is the realization of the truths of the noble onesHe possesses unobstructed knowledge and is free from conceptual thinkingNoble son bodhisattvas do so by reflecting in this wayThey engage with the real nature of phenomena absolutely nonconceptuallyProtector in that way throughout day and night I contemplated this over and overThey are the medicines for the tendencies of mundane lifeThere was a bhikṣu connected with his family Who taught to him this samādhi of peace Yet you Protector awaken them Homage to you the friend of beingsIn dreams they believe in the forms that they seeAnd until he passes into cool and peaceful nirvāṇaThus I too should venture out to the big city of VaiśālīThere is absolutely no killing them no making to kill themIt is so Great SageI also was one among them And you all have listened to methe great beingSo instead I then went on to think that the prince Rāhulabhadra would become a king of real commandAt a certain point his sister Sūkṣmā grew into a woman and at the time beset by disturbing emotions saidTherefore young man those bodhisattvas Who wish to meditate on this samādhiThis place where the Bodhisattva was to take his seat with the intention of attaining full and complete awakening had become the essence of indestructible diamond harder than any diamond in the great trichiliocosmExcellent excellent noble sonsThe four activities are perfectly accomplished With superior diligence they are fully accomplishedThe seed phrase supreme sa teaches transcendence of all phenomenaNoble son it is actualized with insight beyond the world and comprehended in ones personal awareness replied the Blessed OneMoreover Subhūti the bodies of great bodhisattva beings who are irreversibleand his consciousness of working for the welfare of living beingsThey themselves do not become fixated on anything at allOffering provisions represents the complete acquisition of the provisions for awakeningMoreover Chanda I see that this world is suffering It is caught in the midst of cyclic existence It is a wilderness of misery full of afflictions and evil Where beings are constantly swept away Without refuge or purposeWho recite it and teach it They all become supreme men Venerable Lord Great bodhisattva beings from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenmentand will safely and securely stand upon the ocean shore uninjured and unharmedand to apply the medicine of the Dharma appropriately he does not destroy compounded thingsThe sage repliedTheir reflections empower countless worldly rulers throughout inexpressibly many universesThe lines of their palms are extendedSimilarly they understand that the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth the fruit of arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment are neither with attachment nor are they without attachmentThat king who followed the path Of the ten good actionsThe body Mañjuśrī is inert motionless and insentientThe fact of the nonduality of self and selflessness is the meaning of selflessnessyou will understand that it is consequently not easy for all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to repay the favors of those great bodhisattva beingsBecause his positive thought is pure he does not rest in the uncompoundedand because of his instinctive enthusiasm for these roots of virtue he does not destroy compounded thingsConsequently having brought sentient beings to maturation and refined the buddhafields they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment by means of instantaneous wisdomI remember countless eons ago In the pastand they abide utterly in the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesWhat is dependent arising What is the Dharma What is the Buddha How does one see the Dharma by seeing dependent arising How does one see the Buddha by seeing the DharmaTo associate with the practitioners of the Vehicle of Solitary BuddhasShe bowed her head to the feet of the BhagavānThey were engaged in conversationso that whoever seeks to harm them and seeks such an opportunity will not be able to find such an opportunitBhagavān I will continually guard and protect those dharmabhāṇakasIn that way there is a vast amount of merit That is limitless that is beyond measure For one who hears one verse that has been passed on Let alone someone who has heard it directly from meand they should also be attentive to the other notions up to and including the notion that these are calamitousThis is ultimate truth that is not the same as saying Ultimate truth is like thisAs a living being you can do thatHe is the one who the lord of the gandharvas praises in songThrough practicing discipline vows and austerities For many tens of millions of eons While seeking awakeningFor that young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have

Brahma realmāriputra I wish to make you remember and understand your past conduct prayers and wisdomThere are those who meditate on the field of experience of those with the ten strengthsAlthough the snake will experience happiness and suffering it does not think about its skinYou should view consciousness in the same wayYoung man I heard from those tathāgatas extensively the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaand the utterly unborn on the ultimate level is also ultimately the same as the dharmas of ordinary beingsIts true nature is a single equality Which is liberation and nirvāṇaAnd in the northwest green Envy VajrīRather bodhisattvas minds are a continuity of roots of virtueAnd so the boy was named BimbisāraIn your mind do you desire and scheme while

rest and once he recovered from the fatigue of the road they led him into the monasterySo Brother nanda having received the Bhagavāns permission sat upon a seat before the Bhagavān and asked himit quivered it quivered strongly and it quivered intenselySubhūti it is because the things by which the precious transcendent perfection might be sullied are nonapprehensibleand there will no aging or premature deathIn the world system called Excellent Attainment abides the Tathāgata called Pacifier of All Negative Forms of ExistenceIt cannot be investigated and it is not within the range of sophistryhundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of shock and cries of joythey know the absorptions and associated spheres that the bodhisattvas engage inThe ThusGone One has accepted themIs equal to Vajrasattva andThe staffwielding guard at the gates who had thick calves and red eyes became kind and said I should not be performing this dutyI shall

give them to me you will have power over meHe brings all those beings to nirvāṇa through the great nirvāṇa the tathāgatas nirvāṇaIf you ask why āradvatīputra it is because all those phenomena which enlightenment denotes and which the meaning of the term bodhisattva denotes are neither conjoined nor disjoinedTheir terrifying bodies had many colors such as brown blue red black and blazing yellowTherefore young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas should entertain no misgivings about all the teachings on the root of merits the training and the qualitiesThey aspire to the bliss of dhyāna And know

they suffer ailments of the ears nor will they suffer ailments of the noseThe evil kinsman then conferred with all of themand what ground to stand uponNoble son if the ultimate were nonexistent their practice of pure conduct would be pointlessLikewise the socalled ten powers of the tathāgatas are nothing but mere names or conventional terms and the same goes for the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas Since these are all nonapprehensible it follows that all fruitional attributes up to and including the socalled eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are nothing but mere names or conventional termsThey appear for the welfare and happiness of sentient beings for the sake of benefiting sentient beings and for the sake of accomplishing the aims of sentient beingsHundreds of fine instruments resound from the empty sky without being playedI have a few questions for the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly

correct exertions the four supports for miraculous ability the five faculties the five powers the seven branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold pathYou should not have conviction in the understanding of all phenomenaOne should visualize oneself as the youthful lord MañjuvajraOne of the young gods former wards an elder in the saṅgha and an arhat was seated in the meal rowLikewise having obtained the bananalike Fruit of the banyan treeIn order that these views might be abandoned great bodhisattva beings who are adroit and skilled in practicing the transcendent perfection of

possessed by those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who espouse the vehicle of the bodhisattvas have been eloquently explained by the Tathāgata Arhat Genuinely Perfect BuddhaSimilarly if they engage with the notion that physical forms are imbued with happiness or that these are imbued with sufferingthe samādhi named Immersion in the OceanWhen I was a sovereign over this world And saw the suffering of the populationThus their omniscient mind expresses itself to other sentient beings and to other personsThey themselves should be regarded as thusgone onesThe Lord

not teaching the Dharma and thus keeping it to himselfAre not the dreaming mind and the waking mind nonexistentThey will before long attain This level of peace and meditation There is no need to say much but if for example a million tathāgatas like me were to be in one place for an eon provided with all requirements with robes food bowls bedding seats necessary medicine and utensilsKing wherever they go they cast no shadowSeven thousand monks freed their minds from defilements without further clingingWhen the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha looked toward the east with the unobscured divine eye of a bodhisattvaThese fools because of their desires Have intercourse with putrid womenWhen they thus succeed in increasing enriching or expanding a virtuous factor they will feel happy faithful and delightednanda this does not yet exhaust the miraculous displays and supernormal powers of the brahmin boy BhadraśuddhaBecause it brings the development of knowing all that is necessary both mundane and supramundaneDharaṇī came from his feet Existing and not existing are in conflict Pure and impure are also in conflictthe present Tathāgata Ratnārcis was at that time in that epoch the universal monarch RatnacchattraThese are called the sublime attributes of great bodhisattva beingsThey do not see beings born or dying But see all phenomena as remaining in the true nature You fully comprehend conduct and wisdomThis woman is meritorious learned and naturally wiseWhen a bodhisattva obtains a sizable entourage He leads trillions of sentient beings to the deathless stateIt should be perceived as the place where all the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas attain the highest complete enlightenment of complete buddhahoodWith their minds liberated they now returned to youthful Mañjuśrīthey wore the armor of great love and great compassionEven during the passing of a quintillion eons It is difficult to find a jina a great rishi When he attains enlightenment living

chariotWhich eventually land one in hell I have removed here So that they are certain never to arise againāradvatīputra The purity of phenomena is not subject to rebirth in the world system of form because the essential nature of the world system of form is nonapprehensibleI then thinking he was akra the king of the gods said to himWhen he cut into the body and limbs Instead of blood a thousand light rays were emittedO Inconceivable Buddha The Guide for the whole world When the beings of this world make offerings to you They advance toward supreme nirvāṇa ivIn the same way too the element of

assented to King uddhodanawill not be separated from the transcendent perfection of generosityThe wise ones will know by their aromaBecause this mind of the bodhisattvas is nonperceptual it does not make assumptions and it does not become fixatedWho said Kill those two dharmabhāṇakas  cImpressedIt is far removed from the six classes of living beingsSeparating from thought and discernment their minds become detached and they attain an inner brightness that forms a single mental continuumAs soon as Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin had obtained the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās he offered the four continents completely filled with the seven jewels as payment to that upādhyāyaSarvadevatābhimukhaśrī Glory in the Presence of All GodsBhagavān I shall give the dharmabhāṇakas

not suddenly walk slowly keeping their vision within the range of a yoke and maintain an air of weariness and freedom from obscurationThen the gods inhabiting the world system of desire and the gods

transferred to feeling is transferred there toowhich of these two has the greater meritIndra Soma and VaruṇaYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish for this samādhiThe eon will be named RatnāvabhāsaBut not knowing this approach They are far from buddhahoods enlightenment What you may wonder does the bodhisattvas limitless aspiration consist innanda Those sons of enlightened heritage

wheel of the sacred doctrine which is without apprehensionSons of noble family you will be liberated from all sufferings all births old age disease death misery unhappiness and great distressSenior Subhūti why is it that great bodhisattva beings when skillfully practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not accept anything at allAbove each tathāgata bodhisattva mahāsattvas in the sky held a tier of precious parasols that reached up to the realm of BrahmāAbiding in this transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationWhere there are those who seek this And bestow on them what you have taughtHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of exhalation and inhalationthe hearers and solitary buddhas appear through reliance on this very Dharma the bodhisattvas appear through reliance on this very Dharma and the thusgone ones will manifest in the world through reliance on this very Dharmathen may those tathāgatas assemble together all the emanations from their own bodies that are in the form of tathāgatas in the ten directions each in their own buddha realm each with their own name and teaching the Dharma in those buddha realmsThe sense pleasures are like an open woundāradvatīputra the maturity of a great bodhisattva being also entails the observance of the noble eightfold pathIf it is a present birth it does not abideYou will guide all the asurasInformed noble disciples scrutinize the third position in this wayThey turn them away from the third meditative concentration and establish them in the fourth meditative concentrationSubhūti if the world

perfect Buddha called ikhinand creates a body without flesh and bloodIt was then that the head merchant named Bhadrapāla and his entourage of sixty thousand merchants approached the Blessed Onehad correctly followed the Mahāyāna and who was dedicated to great compassionThe mendicants knowing that the Guide Was seated in the temple and was not coming outWhy is it the birth of knowledge Because it brings the accomplishment of all appropriate mental engagementhow should one view form How is it appropriatedBhikṣus those Brahmās wonderedthere arrived a god from the Heaven of Joy by the name Hṛīdeva on a visit concerning the Bodhisattvas unexcelled and perfect awakeningWho were engaged in offering to the Sugata Were revealed to also be offering in those realms Subhūti those great bodhisattva beings magnanimously think I will not forsake all sentient beings I alone should release all those sentient beings who maintain inauthentic doctrinesāradvatīputra it is in such ways that great bodhisattva beings who are diligent alert and mindful after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehending anythingtheir aspirations will become honest and they will follow an honest spiritual friendSubhūti That is the distinct way in which bodhisattvas might undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from the transcendent perfection of wisdomAfter they allowed his going forth he saidAs he walked he gazed just ahead he gazed to his left and rightBhikṣus this Pūrna my śrāvaka Has practiced under billions of past buddhas Has been a holder of their

this sūtra fearlesslyGems are pierced by vajra Firewood is burned by fire Clouds are scattered by wind And forests are dried up by the sunhe placed a full army division at each of the junctions by the four city gates to keep watch day and nightThis samādhi is attained through practicing Its practice has been taught in many formsnot the maturation of karmaWelcome back noble Saṅgharakṣita welcome backHowever the tathāgata Prabhūtaratna who passed into nirvāṇa many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons agountil the end of time they are free from concepts having gained the illumination that is the power of spontaneously accomplished joyI venerated them respectfully As if they were benefactors of the world āriputra tīrthikasSubhūti all things have the basis of desire the basis of hatred and the basis of delusion great bodhisattva beings too do not transgress this modalityYou will never be bereft of mindfulness and intelligenceSpeak perfectly of the tīrthikas unworthinessthey do not understand are not aware are not troubled and do not wish to leavethere fell a great rain of divine incenseIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of the limit of past time the limit of future time and present eventsWhen the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja attained ultimate liberation Candracchattra on the strength of his superknowledges and by the power of his retention made the wheel of the Dharma turn just as the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja had done and continued to do so for ten short eonsHis sons are in distress from the suffering caused by that poison or venomnote the four joysWhen they did the same with his nostrils the grass and cotton would emerge from his earsI have described just a few of themShe illuminates the endless and limitless world sphere with thousands of flashing light raysMonks until I had achieved the vision knowledge apprehension understanding and realization of these four truths of noble beings that are turned in three phases and comprise twelve aspectsAll negative actions are subjugatedSince all the previous thusgone ones in succession had accepted this wheel it possessed the unbroken blessings of all the buddhasThrough the essential nature of the limit of reality they understand the essential nature of all phenomenathese beings will obtain all forms of happiness up to the happiness of abiding in the worlds of the higher realms It is for this reason that no one can fathom the magnitude of all of the manifestations of kāśagarbhathe Dharma teaching of the great extensive sūtra called The White Lotus of the Good Dharma which is an instruction for bodhisattvasat that time those great bodhisattva beings are established in the four immeasurable aspirations and they perfect the six transcendent perfectionsThus bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to the mindEach of the mansions was surrounded by seven rows of jewel treesBecause to never let go of or cast away any sentient being or any of the buddha qualities on the relative level is the miserliness of the bodhisattva great beingsRather syllables are based on convention superimposition and the relative which give names to nameless phenomenaWe prostrate to your unrivaled splendor your mass of qualitiesThe two sons of the venerable nandas younger sister were left orphanedthese great bodhisattva beings would thinkAll of them will liberate millions of beings And they will make many become bodhisattvas One should serve to a woman false black pepper crape jasmine and costus together with wineWhen they arrived Vimalakīrti taught them the Dharma beginning his discourse from the actuality of the four main elementsThrough physical perseverance they will bring sentient beings to maturation encourage them to unite with the three vehicles and establish them thereonThose who have no clinging to conduct Will not be dependent on conducthe elucidated and expounded extensively on this absorption that encapsulates all meritHe is the manifestation of a treasure of meritSister when there are formative factors for remaining static consciousness will reincarnate amongst the beings of the formless realmsShould sit in the sattvaparyaṅka postureThe thorough cognition of the mind is to be ungraspableNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas are limpid free of murk and clearI placed my palms together before himVenerable Lord if the notion of the sensory element of the eyes as having aspirations is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes as lacking aspirations become a bodhisattvaThe Blessed One is endowed with calves resembling those of an antelopeVenerable Lord What are the things that are not attainedWhy is it the accomplishment of omniscient wisdomthe bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana said to those bodhisattva mahāsattvas great śrāvakas and devasVenerable Lord how is it that these things are nonexistent in the ways that ordinary people are fixated on themBhagavat where can I go to obtain this mahāvidyāYou have thus thought I have attained nirvāṇaCompared to the merit of a noble son or daughter who for millions of eons is greatly generous to all beings of this trichiliocosmwithout such grasping they will employ all that they have for the benefit of sentient beingsIn this way without any concern for material thingsSon of noble family there are four qualities that a bodhisattva great being should possess to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unbornHe respectfully honored the bhikṣu And then Puṇyamatin said to himMaitreya to list them in an elaborate manner the ThusGone One would need an eon or more And still that would not be enough to list them allWith his pride vanished Māra said Son listen to meSimilarly it offers the fruit of entering the streamSome of the bodhi trees were made of flowers and were one hundred thousand leagues highNoble son you may wonder why that is It is of course not that bodhisattvas are stingy with the DharmaVenerable Lord Are the nonexistent ten powers of the tathāgatas unattached to the nonexistent ten powers of the tathāgatasOne should not however live with a nonvirtuous spiritual friend a nonvirtuous companion a nonvirtuous supportnonspecific physical actions nonspecific verbal actions nonspecific mental actionsāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings engage in union accordingly they are said to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdomin his last life he will appear in the world as the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha the one with perfect wisdom and conduct the sugata the one who knows the world the unsurpassable guide who tames beings the teacher of devas and humans the buddha the bhagavān named aśiketuhe continued to get worseThey live without anguish Their senses hidden and boundAnd in time as a result of that many ethical monks gathered there who then proceeded to evict usShould recite this sūtra And teach it with full confidence who shows his own faceGreat bodhisattva beings who are not separated from this meditative stability will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenmenthe is the One with the Power to Know the Capacities of All Sentient Beings and Their Levels of Diligencelikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are unceasingTo the infinity of names and appellations That I have previously taught Son if he should come here you should share your learning but you mustnt go to himWhen combined with these six ignorance sees and so forth as explained previouslyHe is perfectly pure in his aspirations of a bodhisattva and joins in the five spiritual faculties of all sentient beingsIt is rather that those conditions cause the scent to be transferred and migrateSimilarly they are not attached to the world system of desire they are not attached to the world system of form and they are not attached to the world system of formlessnessand solitary buddhas who rely on reference pointsVenerable Lord The inexpiable crimes are five in numberVenerable Blessed One you have instructed that these sūtras should be upheld by those who refrain from the five kinds of impure foodThey should not keep any possession unless they are willing to give it awayhe began his departure from the sublime realm of the Heaven of JoyThe uncompounded is infinite spaceTaking the venerable Saṅgharakṣita the nāgas returned to the land of the nāgasAnd teach the enlightenment of buddhahood Without their confidence in speech ever declining they comprise  the sense field of sights  the sense field of sounds  the sense field of odors  the sense field of tastes  the sense field of tangibles and  the sense field of mental phenomenaSome do not take food from vases Others reject offerings near doors and pillarsHouseholder where are your father and mother your children your wife your servants your maids your laborers and your attendantsJust as the bright sun in the sky In all worldly realms of the cardinal and intermediate directionsIn that analogy Mahauṣadhi a form reflected in water even though it possesses shapely limbsand esteem and were revered honored and praised by Indra and the gods who attend himI exist essentially as mindHe praised the Blessed One with these fitting versesthe four fearlessnesses and the eighteen distinct qualities of a buddhaSimilarly they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are permanent or that they are impermanentBecause of that prayer āriputra has now been singled out by the TathāgataMy son you have not yet had the joys of a universal monarchs splendorsLike a rocky stone rough to the touch they are hard inside Being with them is like caressing a vipers headMoreover Tritas wells manifested with flowing waters and three ponds of scented oil sprang forthThey were of noble origin and like great elephants Their work was done their deeds were done they had laid down their burden they had accomplished their own welfare and their ties to existence were exhaustedThey have no forgetting and thus achieve retentionand cakravartins of the four continents together with their retinues who were gathered in that assemblyAnd have abandoned all the evils in the three realms  The eighteen distinct qualities of a buddha In which the jinas are established Are not difficult to attain for someone Who has trained in this restraint of the body Lord from this time forth I will avoid all such errors andāradvatīputra whenever a bodhisattva considers which of those things constitute mundane virtuous phenomena they include the followingSubhūti omniscience is itself neither created nor conditioned because its creator is nonapprehensibleHe did not practice for himself Neither for pleasure nor to feel the taste of absorptionOr did you reject the teaching and express your displeasure in wordsFurthermore through this ethical disciplineIs it past Is it future Or is it presentSubhūti if you ask in which interim state those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas suffer a decline with respect to the doctrineEight fingerwidths is the location of Secret Guardian of Blissbeing without attachment to anything and thus acquiring the behavior of a buddhaBhagavān that gives me confidence to speak Sugata it gives me confidence to speakHe will become a pure faithful son or daughter of noble familyHe replied This is owing to the attainment of manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all things in all their finest aspectsSubhūti the essential nature of the minds of those great bodhisattva beings who have conviction in and concur with this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom will be disciplined with respect to desire hatred and delusionFrom the left side Anupaśānta saidHe teaches the Dharma that is supremeHowever there was a magnolia tree beside the iron fortress and so I climbed up itPlease elaborate on this questionHe teaches the Dharma in the form of Agni to beings who are to be taught by AgniSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who train accordingly will train in omniscienceand the samādhi named Teaching the PathI should now practice the allpervading absorption He who for countless eons practiced generosity Maintained faultless unwavering conductI promised to share any such attainment with him so I must do soHe replied This is owing to the nondisintegration of all thingswho had miraculous powers and the five superknowledges were flying through the sky toward the north Yet as they flew above this grove they suddenly could not go any farther and it felt as if they were being pushed backpromulgated it and made it widely known to othersand owing to its sameness with nonarising noncessation nonaffliction and nonpurificationThey have transcended all unique qualities Bow your heads to the realm of the Buddhas merit The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed OneAfter a time the saṅgha elder lifted his cup of water It felt extremely cold to the touch of the tip of his fingersLike seeing a fire blazing on a mountain peak Or the moon present amid a cluster of starsEven if one were to speak for an eon That would not suffice to describe the Buddhas qualitiesI also will have enjoyed that place Where those bodhisattvas residedWhat is transcending the existences It is not focusing the mind upon or engaging the mind with the three realmsThen at that time a light ray shone from the ūrṇā hair between the Bhagavāns eyebrowsāradvatīputra The purity of phenomena has not been actualized due to absolute purityIt then occurred to him Consciousness emerges when there are formationsWhen I have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafieldOne whose mind is dedicated to enlightenment Is one who pleases the Buddhaāriputra Aniruddha and Kolita And the other śrāvakas of the SugataThe divisions of the supreme eightfold path of the noble ones Tranquility insight impermanence Suffering lack of self and repulsiveness Such were the words that emerged from the instrumentsI have taught enough of this Dharma This wisdom is subtle and cannot be analyzedThe moon and sun with their great miraculous power their great might and their great brilliance could not with their light illuminate theminstructed themThus they engage in the works and activities of sentient beingsthose who have not yet crossed can be deliveredHe is also called the one who turns the wheel of Dharma the liberal provider of the gift of Dharma lord of the offeringsNoble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are great caravan leadersWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas pure diligence consist inInasmuch as the real nature of perceptions is neither afflicted nor purified and is neither enhanced nor diminishedBowing before the Blessed One with palms joined the bodhisattvas and great listeners then made the following requestIf the Blessed One who is beneficent and compassionate toward all beings would allow me may I please ask some questions on a few subjectsRather Subhūti it is the sublime individuals who are endowed with the path to nirvāṇaThe Blessed One replied A shapeshifter is one who will not flourish in the Dharma and Vinaya thereforeSimilarly the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and so forth do not apprehend the limit of future time nor the presentThe twentyeight great yakṣa generals also teach itBodhisattvas of great renown and gods Equal in fortune to himself gathered around the SageThey will become inconceivable yoginsThe young brahmin Maudgalyāyana then taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite the brahminic mantrasWe pay homage to you supreme beingIt is similarly that consciousness arises from this bodyThey roam within cyclic existence and they do not perfect the transcendent perfection of wisdomNoble son from being the source of jewels through to inexhaustibility this is how bodhisattvas areThus they provide for sentient beings and meditate on the truths through being skilled in meansWhich is the Buddhayāna praised by the sugatas The lad scared and frightened fled back to his own house and laid his knife at the doorstepWith a joyful and elated mind she was blissfulHe has withdrawn into seclusionYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of words concerning clarification What are the four kinds of words concerning clarificationIn doubt the monks went to him who severs all doubts the Blessed Buddha and askedThey should always abstain From association with kings and princesCarrying offerings here together we have arrived To worship this jewel tree that bears infinite branchesO Nandinī You who grant boons Kiṇi kiṇi Khiṇi khiṇi Give me splendor Vauṣaṭāradvatīputra just as the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas the lords and teachers neither dwell nor do they not dwellA woman of any mixed casteFor example they should give up living happily in solitude solitary places and forestsNo it is not answered the monksVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is the emptiness of internal phenomenaTheir conduct is never sullied And it is never corruptedThe words that I said Before Māra and his army were I will not get out of the crosslegged position Until I bring an end to old age and deathHe gave them all carts that were better than any other that were made of the seven precious materials adorned by all adornments of the same color and magnificentthey give rise to attachment to the joyful bliss of meditation and thinkThat is to say the negative ripening of negative past actionsdo you think Subhūti that this illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist would have established any sentient beings in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationMañjuka Mṛgarāja Skanda Apasmāra Muṣṭikā Mātṛkā Jāmika Kāminī and Revatī Pūtanā Mātṛnandā akuni Kaṇṭhapāṇinī Mukhamaṇḍiti and Kālambā All of them course on the earthThereupon those bodhisattva mahāsattvas together spoke these verses to the Bhagavānor similarly exhibit himself reborn among the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realmThat is to say have the vehicle of the śrāvakas the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas and the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddhas not been extensively taughtWhat are their stagesThere were no other great mountains or mountainsguard protect look after and bring peace and wellbeingYou dispense the medicine of the Dharma and know the lives of sentient beingsNoble sons it is like thisBut today sitting here on this seat I will attain stainless awakening I will defeat you Māra and repel your army and soldiersThere when the people of Rājagṛha saw that members of Sañjayins tīrthika community had renounced itIt is all the attributes and attainments up to and including unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentHe lived the holy life for the rest of his days but he did not attain any store of qualities With mastery in skill and wisdom one should be without pride and reified conceptions of ITherefore I too must by all means also fully awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahoodthese actualize the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirthIllusion itself is the noble eightfold path and the noble eightfold path itself is illusionThose who have become unsurpassable Become shrines in the worldThey always delight in dhyāna and have a subtle mind What will you achieve through the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineNoble son the prince then rose up into the sky to the height of seven palm trees by means of his miraculous ability and showered upon the blessed Arisen from Flowers a rain of jewels flowers and incenseNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities crush prideAlways remain in the solitude of forests Forsaking the joys of villages and townsSon of noble family bodhisattvas carry out the practices toward awakening out of compassion for all beingsWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas inalienable diligence consist inSenior āradvatīputra likewise the transcendent perfection of generosity being empty of inherent existenceAbiding in this mind set on enlightenmentthis is the transcendent perfection of perseverance possessed by great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineYoung man there are ten benefits for bodhisattva mahāsattvas from taking up diligence What are the ten benefitsJoining their palms and bowing to the Blessed One they all proclaimed togethercarefully guarding her limbs eyes and mindThey do not approach enlightenment as other than formThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to some beings in the form of a pratyekabuddhaThey will stand up and state That is not the Buddhas teaching they do not dedicate it to the world systems of form and formlessnessThe learned are not attached to themor shows itself as a halfmoon or waning or waxing or as a full moonHer head ears and nose are perfectly symmetricalwhich is the Buddhayāna ultimate omnisciencewhile his eyes indicated the utter purity of tranquility and insightAccompanied by the sounds of partridge peacocks and cuckoosHomage to Tathāgata Dhārmavikurvaṇadhvajavegaśrīand in front of the Bhagavān with hands placed together in homageHe guarded his senses well andSubhūti formerly when I engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattvaMerely hearing or reflecting is not sufficient for comprehending the Dharma in a way that is understood personallyWhen they see sick beings Afflicted by many illnessesHe teaches the Dharma in the form of a bodhisattva to beings who are to be taught by a bodhisattvaShe should not lust after other men even in dreamsHe is the one whose physical verbal and mental activity is beyond blameAround him gods are always appearing in the fleshThe Lord of the World will know their thoughtsnot to abandon life in solitudeVenerable please listen Human bodies are subject to diseases that manifest on the body in these waysāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena as permanent or impermanent constitute a bodhisattvaSimilarly the transcendence of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is not consciousness and the other aggregatesYoung man in that way the body of the tathāgata is pure It cannot be conceived of through attributes and so it is taught to be inconceivableand the mind does not engage with diverse perceptionspraising themselves instead Out of jealousy they say I possess supreme qualitiesSince the path that you walk on today has been swept by the godsMonks at that point I thought to myself I must apply myself to eating even less than thisWhen I gave birth to you my son in the Lumbinī Grove Without support like a lion you took seven steps on your ownHis bile and phlegm ligaments and bones and flesh and blood were completely consumed by firesimilarly the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity are all absolutely voidThey abide in joy when they think I shall establish all beings in the qualities of awakeningGentlemen where is the teacher SañjayinThey should regard the merit of one buddha or that of all buddhas as being similarthe Licchavi Vimalakīrti came along and said to meThe nature of the applications of mindfulness is indeed emptiness Emptiness is indeed the applications of mindfulnessWhite is formholdThe buddhas do not gain supreme realizationThis concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra entitled The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualitiesyou should see that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is inconceivableIn connection with the wisdomgnosisNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities have a loving natureSimilarly they will not construe the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonarisingHe abides in ultimate reality yet there is no relationship between it and himāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the noble truths and in the same vein all the other aforementioned phenomena up to and including the dependent link of aging and death as nonentitiesThereupon the Bhagavān gave a detailed teaching on that account of the past by chanting the following extensive verses to the youth CandraprabhaFor those who make a living by weaving garlands he is like a flowerWhat will happen as they move from one life to the nextBillions of beings will be in his presenceacquire the transcendent perfection of generosityand having perfectly beautified his own home after the night was overO lord is this means of accomplishment exclusively for humans orAvalokiteśvara came to that deva in the form of the brahmin and said to himA loose vagina will become firmWhen the foolish think about The summit of nothingnessthe teacher and the one who has perfected the eighteen unique qualities of a buddhaWhen they are inhaling a long breath they are fully aware that they are inhaling a long breathIt can be known by the wise and by those skilled in examining its subtletyThen noble son if the combined heaps of merit of all those beings present in this way throughout infinite universes in the ten directions and extending as far as space throughout the three timesAs you move stand or lie downThis body is a combination of aggregates elements and sensemedia which are comparable to murderers poisonous snakes and an empty town respectivelythey will discern those phenomena exactly as they areWhile the Bodhisattva remained in the absorption known as the great array He emanated inconceivable magical displays Which perfectly fulfilled the wishes of all the godsWhy is that Bhagavān it is because I have never heard this kind of Dharma from the BhagavānOh Oh Puṣpacandra arise here today Like the rising moon xivNo Bhagavān they answered No SugataWhat are those ten They are as follows Bodhisattvas do not remain in tents so as to torment the body nor do they do so for the sake of any mental penanceYou rescued the men in distress and brought them to safetyRed is for enthralling and attractingWe should cause them to delight in the six transcendent perfectionsThey know the futureThereupon the Bhagavān taught on this topic in detail speaking these versesOne should emanate Yellow Acala in the southThey are not worthy to be in the saṅghahaving clarity and no clarity being valid and being invalidYour reality as prophesied is not born and does not cease nor will it be born nor will it ceaseThus monks sure enough during the final station of night just at the break of dawn right at the time for the beating of the morning drum the BodhisattvaMañjuśrī in that wide earth of beryl there would of course be no abode of the ThirtyThree and neither would there be a Palace of Victory or akra lord of the godsI myself will have walked there And I myself will have sat thereThe Bhagavāns maternal aunt Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and six thousand bhikṣunīs both bhikṣunīs in training and those who had passed beyond training now arose from their seats at the same timeSubhūti just as the expanse of reality neither comes to rest nor does it not come to restThere is the meditative stability named Establishing the Sameness of All LettersSubhūti the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathBecause they seek gain and honor they act jealously and become upset when others are appreciated and respected Just as the fragrant aroma of the incense Of yellow sandalwood and red sandalwoodtJust as they cannot be grasped and just as they are unborn that is how I engendered themWhy is it devoid of the kleśa of desire Because it brings the accomplishment of the deathless stateIn accordance with the aspirations purified by the thusgone ones through this offering of my eyesGentlemen will no one be put into these two No they repliedWith discipline you must perform austerities and hardshipThe wise ones will know from their scents The multitudes of blossomed sandalwood trees In the various declivities of mountains And the various beings that dwell among themand even to this day that lake is called the Lake of the OrnamentsNext one should visualize that Sarasvatī offers this substance to oneself with her handIf one does not succeed even then due to previously committed evil actsthe knowledge of phenomenaBodhisattvas who do not apprehend their skill in the physical verbal and mental accumulations too have become trainedIt is precisely in the sense that they are void that they are to be relied onI postulants name petition the saṅgha to allow my going forth and grant ordination into the monkhoodin the same way they may also act on behalf of sentient beings without apprehending sentient beings or even the designation of sentient beingsAll the ones who were parched were relieved of their thirstVenerable Lord Although something which is void cannot attain manifestly perfect buddhahood which is also void great bodhisattva beings who practice the sacred doctrine and its profundities do indeed attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentTo destroy any poisonThen noble ones Queen Vimaladattā said to the boys perform some miracle so that your father King ubhavyūha will be sympathetic toward you It is possible that he will be favorably inclined toward youI cannot protect this teaching While maintaining the concept of a selfMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom perceive sentient beings under the sway of evil associates they thinkthe characteristics those dharmas have and the nature of those dharmasOne should not kill living beings Or take anothers propertyThey could not be goaded by a whip but only by handfuls of lotus flowers or garlands of jasmine flowersHow can you say that you see everythingYoung man as numerous as are the names for nirvāṇa the tathāgata has that many appellationsThe mind in the past is not perceivedSubhūti if you ask what is the meditative stability known as the yawning lion which great bodhisattva beings may experience at this pointAnd billions of Brahmās have arrived hereand will remain in that realm until Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras powerful commitment is fulfilled and all beings have been brought to liberationtogether with a great saṅgha of twelve hundred bhikṣus all of whom were solely arhats whose defilements had ceasedIt is an infinitely vast teaching Ever equal to space Luminous and nonconceptual So is the wheel of Dharma describedwhich contains an ocean of gateways to absorptions liberations and retentions as well as a central mountain light moon sun Dharma ways forests houses and surrounding mountains of virtue to tame and ripen their retinues of many beingsConsider noble son the analogy of water that makes grass bushes herbs and forests sprout and growThat noble son is the Dharmasacrifice The bodhisattva who lives by this Dharmasacrifice is the best of sacrificers and through his extreme sacrifice is himself worthy of offerings from all people including the godsWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas trust in the profound tune of the thusgone ones voice consist inIt has no basisThese lights filled the universe with an infinite limitless radiance that eclipsed that of the sun and moon and reached even the Brahmā realm before returning to dissolve into the crown of the Blessed Ones headgave the youth Candraprabha the teaching that had been given in the past in detail in the form of the following versesand You two retired devotees Bring me thatOne of them had a placid nature but the other was quicktemperedSome children of the jinas are maintaining diligence Forsaking completely all sleepthey are also without thoughts of hostility toward all sentient beingsThey are dedicated to proclaiming the Dharma And are in the domain of samādhi and wisdom the sense field of infinite consciousness has been completely transcended in all respectsAlas The transcendent perfection of wisdom is vacuousThousands of light rays shining from your limbs Illuminate many world spheresIn the same way a stupid person without correct conduct May try to escape from composite phenomenaBut they cannot know the nature of the body Of someone who has trained in the restraint of the body arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentor prepare your pyre and shroud for I myself will comea buddha being the supreme head of the herdThrough the strength and intensity of his valor Over many tens of millions of eonsFor so long he has encouraged others to make liberal offerings of all sorts and admonished them to follow the teachings of all spiritual friendsThrough the power of the Bodhisattva and for his enjoyment a bodhi tree grew at the center of the four billion regions while a sandalwoodtree forest grew at the inner regionthe inconceivably numerous kinds of external knowledge concerning the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous kinds of external knowledge concerning purification Those are the fourThe strength of ten elephants in rut is the same as the strength of one great elephant in rutTo him who now has arrived at the seat of awakening I bowI met the Licchavi Vimalakīrti coming inhe thought I shall attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodThe transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom also are both mundane and supramundaneHaving attained this peace this stainless samādhifor with it gods and humans are not deceivedWhen Kālika the king of the nāgas saw how the light illumined his own abode he spoke these verses in front of his retinueAny conceptualization of that state is a form of disturbing emotionDivine being as much as one understands that all phenomena are beyond explanation engagement reflection thinking conception and expression and as much as one does not pass beyond suffering in order not to abandon sentient beingsthat much one is free from evil and irreproachableFor these reasons Subhūti you should know that all things are signlessnessexcellent patience with respect to the DharmaAfter the three months of monsoon had passed the Blessed One donned his Dharma robethe fruit of arhatship are well distinguished by conditioned phenomena nor should they dwell on the notions that these fruits are well distinguished by unconditioned phenomenaSummon the bodhisattva kāśagarbha who is endowed with great compassion with these my wordsAt that very moment the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha manifested this buddhafield the Sahā world as being made entirely of seven precious materialsAnd such is also the case at present for I too teach itHe was free from attachment and aversionHe cannot be discovered by consciousnessthey remember one previous life or two or three or four or fiveThrough the cessation of name and form the six sense fields ceaseAs they considered this Ah You are as unshakable as Meru Ah You for whom buddhas and beings are equalMaitreya if bodhisattvas possess these six qualitiesthey do so without apprehending any other phenomena attributes or attainments up to and including omniscienceYou have attained perfect delight and excellent equanimity BlissGone One Great Being homage be to youand seats of the senses of the one who performed them forBhikṣus the ultimate conclusion of the discipline of the Dharma is the transcendence of birth aging sickness and death the goal of nirvāṇa being absorbed in nirvāṇaOne should eat a cats paw of the root of red uccaṭā together with clarified butter and honeyWithin a single instant They know all lifetimesSo those buddha bhagavāns accompanied by either one or two of their own attendants came to this Sahā world realmto whom he delivered teachings on the practices related to the sense field of utter absenceMonks although the Bodhisattva had now been born his mothers right side was not torn or damaged but had returned to its usual statenanda his roots of virtue here will come to maturation in buddhahoodbowed their heads to the Bhagavāns feetno additionAt that time nanda this woman was my motherMāyādevī then left her palace and went to the door of the king When she arrived the divisions of horses elephants chariots and foot soldiers All called out with a deafening roar As loud as the waves on a great turbulent oceanIn the form of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa O belovedThey will always know the interconnection of the sūtras And the intention of the guides when they taughtThey turn the wheel of Dharma and are thus exalted by a plenitude of meritWhy is it the single teachingknow that their superior motivation has these characteristicsHaving killed his father he left trembling like a man who has committed a sinThey were knowledgeable great elephants who had accomplished what needed to be doneand many hundreds of thousands of gods scattered divine māndārava flowers on the Blessed One and the bodhisattva great beingsIn their ignorance they continuously circle among these five existences Like the spinning of a potters wheelEither of the two types of prostrationbowing prostrate with all four limbs and head or a kneeling bowis permissibleBy offering a homa of incanted sesame and ghee one will pacify all ailmentsand the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of the result concerning purification Those are the fourI am giving a giftIt is the seat of wisdom because it sees everything directlySimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle is also neither included within the world system of desire They have no desire or passion no anger or rage They have no ignorance or dullness and are always honestSubhūti great bodhisattva beings after perfecting the six transcendent perfectionsI myself will sleep on a cot by the doorThat I the Buddha taught itIt teaches the absence of difference among phenomena and is a gateway to the sameness of all phenomenaI am liberated from all suffering what more is there for me to do I am an arhatEventually when the great sage Supreme One passed awaylover of lotusesHe will not have faith in itThe bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha implored the Blessed OneSimilarly the emptiness of the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousness is not the sensory element of tactile consciousness and the aforementioned sensory elementsSon of a selfimmolator as this body is composed of gross form and arises from the four great elementsTo say this is impure and that is immaculate makes for dualityWith their expertise about the mind bodhisattvas conceive of phenomena as illusionlike dreamlike virtuous unvirtuous occurring or nonoccurringSenior Subhūti replied and listened to the Blessed One who saidthis teaching will also appear to beings yet to come So it is for the sake of the welfare and happiness of many beings that I request the ThusGone One to explainThus thinking This is infinite space they perfect the sense source of infinite space and remain within itYou send down the nectar of the rain of the Dharma That extinguishes the fire of the kleśas of beingsGreat bodhisattva beings who train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom will never grasp these great acquisitions but there is never any excellence that they will not attainThey will be young men Whose bad behavior is incessantThey who desiring liberation possess this stainless samādhi Speak perfectly pleasantly with gentle wordsHave the fifty aspects of speech and have a sound that brings joy And have a resounding voice a proclaiming voice a perfect voice In his dream four whiteandblack animals lick his feetIf you ask what constitutes great loving kindnessTherefore young man you should train by thinking I shall be endowed with the restraint of the mindKāśyapa as another analogy imagine a city that contains hundreds of thousands of semiprecious trinketsare taught to be inconceivably numerous as it is not easy to state that there is an end to them To understandhe benefits beingsor the form of a boyBhikṣus those sixteen noble sons taught again and again this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma within the teaching of that bhagavānSubhūti it is because things that are without defining characteristics do not attain emancipation will not attain emancipation and have not attained emancipationFour fingerwidths is the location of HayagrīvaTo cognize past destruction is purityThis is known as vajra postureAs an analogyFrom the expanse of pure space the sound of thunder rang outLord I am indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illnessThus they are called leadersand receivingEven if as many worlds throughout the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā became engulfed by the great flames of the Hell of Incessant PainThis is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived This is not a worthy place either others repliedthe ten recollectionsI am undertaking perseverancethe inconceivably numerous words of unquantifiability concerning teaching the compositeThe Blessed One replied to the venerable MahāmaudgalyāyanaWhy is that āriputra at the time after the Tathāgatas nirvāṇaAfter my time came and I died I was born into a brahmin family dedicated to the six dutiesthey are wise in the level of buddhahood they are skilled in teaching the dharmas of the TathāgataAccordingly Blessed One please take the bodhisattva great beings under your careand in his presence they praised him with these fitting versesThey preserve unbroken the heritage of the holy Dharma contain the treasury of the Dharma and represent the summit of DharmaworshipVenerable Lord As I understand the meaning of the teachings spoken by the Lord great bodhisattva beings do not at all achieve something difficultThese childish beings exhaust their roots of virtue like a gambler losing his wealthit quaked it quaked strongly and it quaked intenselyabiding in the ways of the ten virtuous actionsNo one will attain emancipation through this transcendent perfection of wisdomabandon this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomBlessed One it is amazing Blissful One it is truly amazingWhat are these thirtytwo features They are as followsI have taught with great higher knowledgeone billion realms of the Heaven of Perfected VirtueSarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin then said to the BhagavatThe bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin now addressed the Blessed OneShe is your delightful supporterIt entails absorption in the nine contemplations of impurity by engaging with all things as if they were a mirageYet Mañjuśrī due to the distinction of higher middling and lower places on the earthMay I never lean toward nor accumulate the causes of karma and defilementsAnd have inquired supreme human with just that intention Guide tell us the result of that today One should view the deceased persons consciousness as resembling a rider mounted on a horseThese things have the nature of inactivityif one holds the view and argues that some selves endure while other selves do not endureSimilarly sentient beings should be regarded as emptiness because space itself is emptiness andFurthermore the habitual dispositions of consciousness should be viewed as deriving from a mind inclined toward virtue or toward nonvirtueThe ones who are established in this samādhi Have become unshakable bodhisattvasāriputra the ThusGone One has taught that there are eightyfour thousand sections of the Dharmaone hundred and eightstring and sixtyfourstring necklaces for covering the shouldersPadmaśrīgarbha continued the Blessed OneI am dedicated and diligent I have insight as wellI too will emulate their meritsThey called out in divine melodious tones offering words of praisethe samādhi named Moon on HighHe will remain for twelve intermediate eonsthat the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirthHe is a teacher of nirvāṇa to those reborn in AvīciGreat love is an impartial attitude toward all beingsWhy has this girl become so weak and illThe flowers and likewise the light the incense The perfumes and the food With these five offerings One should worship the maṇḍalaRecollection of the divine is a gateway to the light of the DharmaLike a lotus you are untainted by the three worldsLord when I see the Tathāgata I view him by not seeing any Tathāgatawho avoid desire as if it were a pit of fire Who abandon craving for children and wives And frightened and terrified leave their homes  Those beings who are seized by wicked ones Should skillfully craft an image Of an animal in pure copper And fill its interior with silver and the likeIn order to make offerings to the BhagavānKnowing this even after they have passed away they will not generate thoughts on the levels of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhasThen for the benefit of those who wish to attain worldly accomplishment the Blessed OneAnd have given up our excellent airborne palacesNoble son possessing these ten qualities bodhisattvas are endowed with pure eloquenceThe host of women and the multitude of kṣatriyas The leading citizens the generals and the ministersThen when practicing generosity by offering vehiclesIf in thinking of his preceptor or instructor he feels sorrowIf the buddhafield is pure only to the extent that the mind of the bodhisattva is pureHe developed the supreme intention for the highest complete enlightenment andKāśyapa the Tathāgata is the Lord of the Dharma He is the principal King of All the DharmasSimilarly they beheld the thousand buddhas in each of all the world systems of the south west north nadir and zenith along with the four intermediate directionsIn this way they perfect the sense source of infinite consciousness and remain within itTherefore the wise bodhisattvas Who have heard these kinds of benefitsand drink to those who were thirstyVenerable Lord This purity of phenomena is not subject to rebirth in the world system of desireYou sat on the seat of awakening by virtue of your vajrahard position when you saidDig a suitable spherical fire pit in three levels It should be one cubit wide And half a cubit deepA word is like an echo Like the space of the sky Just as mud and dust cannot be found in the heavensthe four great kings left their residencesThey should not dwell on the notion that I should transcend the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas and abide on the levels of the bodhisattvasThe sage Asita saw his beautiful feet ornamented by the mark of wheelsThe Bhagavān was residing on Vulture Peak mountain in Rājagṛha with a large saṅgha of  bhikṣus and with a great many bodhisattva mahāsattvasWhen the Dharma is taught in a vast way The qualities attained will be vast Owing to the fact that sentient beings are inconceivableSo it is that this vehicle is said to be equal to spaceBlessed One it is like thisWho among you has the fortitude To teach this sūtra In the dreadful future time When the Dharma is ruined there is no perfection to be seen Apart from buddhahood and all the accomplishmentsDue to these causes and conditions when their bodies have decayed and died they will be reborn as gods and humans within the blissful and exalted world realmsThose who have the qualities of greatness who are unequaledThere are others who wash and eat the leftovers that swans and pigeons throw awayIf a pala can be transformed with māṣā It should be known that the mercury has been perfected This bhikṣu has appeared in the worldThe reason for this is that were you to do so and someone were to become confused you would then have created confusion about the Tathāgatathey think This is suffering and so they rest in equanimityThat Mañjuśrī is the way a sick bodhisattva should concentrate his mind he should live neither in control of his mind nor in indulgence of his mindand they will be reborn there seeking the wisdom of the tathāgatasWhen the king heard these words from the best among men He diminished his longing let go of his attachment for his son and saidattained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment dependent on this transcendent perfection of wisdomIn sweet and melodious songs and music Arrived from Gandhamādana to make offerings to the supreme Jina will appear in the world as the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha the one with perfect wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tames beings

wellbeing to ordinary beings gods and menOffering delicacies represents the attainment of the mark of a great being who has the finest sense of taste ThereforeThe one who imagines that he is present Will also see the buddhas miracles He comes down holding a basket And wearing dirty clothesMay we also become like the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddhaand neither is it a self nor is it not a selfWhen a black cloth becomes white that is like the accumulation of the DharmaSince you have been brought up by meWith that he went to JetavanaBraid together three white cords And make twentyone knotsInforming him of what he must do to fully understand his unspoken commitmentsāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as with signs or signless constitute a bodhisattvaSome are to be converted by BrahmāWith a smiling face he looks on with eyes like lotus petalsYou should dedicate whatever gifts you have offered to all sentient beings making common cause with all sentient beings and without apprehending anything toward the attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentthe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of the individual concerning teaching the compositeOn seeing that he thinks The water is still far downHave you completely ripened beingsO kālumelu kālumelu stop the hailstorm and snowfall stop stop SvāhāThe birds that are parrots geese Ducks shelducks and swansThose characteristics of the skandhas Are the characteristics of all phenomenaNārāyaṇa even if in this way they finished all the seed pieces they still would not reach the total number of world systems in the eastern directionWhen the tathāgatas cease to consecrate them in this waythe gvedathere is the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named MerukūṭaIt is for this reason that he is called AcalaMonks out of affection for the sage Asita the Bodhisattva now showed signs of having awakenedWhen he arrived he concealed his magical powers and entered the city on footAt this question the Bhagavān replied to Youthful MañjuśrīVenerable Lord it is similarly because dependent on those great bodhisattva beings the ways of the ten virtuous actions will emerge in the worldThey know well about the illness of affliction its causes and its cureOn the eighth fourteenth and fifteenth lunar days they should perform elaborate worship at a reliquary and recite the incantation thereattain the inconceivable unimpeded buddhas speech which has sixty aspectsWho is that blessed one the son of MāyādevīSound is like an echo Know phenomena to be like that How should they train in the maturation of sentient beingshe was distressed sorrowful and remorseful He became crazed and wailed loudly I will gain the attainment of enlightenment And when I am established in buddhahoodYoung man in that way the bodhisattva mahāsattvas obtain the treasure of the DharmaThey should cultivate an attitude

conditional cause of their parents coming togetherThat persons body leaks pus and bloodshould that state of affairs be despiseddo not applaud those who practice itMoreover those beings are not following and have not understood this Dharma teaching    tMañjuśrī bodhisattvas who endeavor in bodhisattva practicewho are conscientious in practice vows training and diligenceare capable of fully awakening to unexcelled and perfectly complete buddhahoodUltimately it is not about generating delusion nor is it about bringing delusion to an endGoing to the Three Jewels for refuge is a gateway to the light of the Dharmaare free of afflictionsOne should then visualize oneself instantaneously arisen upon a white lotus and a moon disk one is white in color holding a book and a swordThey lack even the slightest essenceSubhūti great bodhisattva beings have been well trained in the emptiness of internal phenomenaIn this way they swiftly come to manifestly and completely awaken to unsurpassable perfectly complete enlightenmentthey will not be discouraged andAnd keep it and read it Will all be honoring me What is the basis of correct conduct It is the restraint of the body and the pratimokṣa vowsDhṛtarāṣṭra was in the east Virūḍhaka in the south Virūpākṣa in the west And Kubera in the northVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is without conceptual elaborationVisualizing her like this will bring fulfillment of ones wishesTheir minds will partake of whatever they wish for without exceptionCompared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance would not even amount to a hundredth partWe were born beautiful and with perfect curvesall eye diseases will be curedJust as the wind element is flimsy and incorporeal so consciousness even though it is weak and incorporeal engenders bodies great and smallEmbodiment of Enchanting Splendorthey teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beingsThere are so many causes for happiness and the precious qualities found in that buddha realm but son of noble family let me just give you a brief illustration of their numberAnd all others with impaired faculties Regained their full senses And obtained beautiful limbsThe same refrain should also be applied to the sensory elements and sense fields exactly as indicated here in the context of the psychophysical aggregatesSimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle too is endowed with neither the level of the śrāvakasIn the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end the emptiness of nondispersal is not discernedForsaking all desires they will enter homelessness And they will go to where the Bodhimaṇḍa isAfter their sporting lovemakingPadmaśrīgarbha therefore listen well and pay attentionWhen seeing that sensual enjoyments are without good qualitiesChapter The other girls told her mother what she had saidThe wise have praised going forth so if going forth makes him happy then at least you will see him aliveAnd illuminated and beautified all the worlds In the entirety of eighteen thousand realmsand some were made of flowers of various colors multiple colors hundreds of thousands of colors beautiful pure and shiningUpon reading this chapter called Repeating Like a Wheel the two boys asked MahāmaudgalyāyanaIn that way what is seen heard thought or known All of this is unreal like a dreamThose who paint their representations in murals Their entire bodies with a hundred signs of merit Whether they paint them themselves or have others do soHere no dharma whatsoever arises or ceasesBeginners have both outer and innerIn response to these words from Brother āriputra the Bhagavān said to himBecause of this when the sun of the tathāgata has risen these beings will be filled with the light rays of primordial wisdom and will actualize the inconceivably excellent qualities of a buddhaAs they pursue personal associations with spiritual practitioners their conduct is excellentThus bodhisattvas pacify the dust of afflictionLord the bodhisattva Vimalakīrti bowing down at the feet of the Lord greets the Lord saying Do you have little trouble little discomfort and little unrest Are you strong well without complaint and living in touch with the supreme happiness He then requestsand if they engage in the gateways of mnemonic incantation and the gateways of meditative stability they will engage in the conditioning of the gateways of mnemonic incantation and the gateways of meditative stabilityThe kings of the devas asuras nāgas and yakṣas Could not get their fill of looking at him Their merit and majesty and splendor will increase Their majesty will outshine even that of the devas In terms of worldly conventions they abandon all their habitual tendencies toward the disturbing emotionsHe teaches the Dharma in the form of Vaiśravaṇa to those beings who are to be guided by VaiśravaṇaIt is unending it is complete peace It is effortless and it cannot be shownMañjuśrī ultimately there is nothing truly established in that which is emanated by the Thusgone OneNow that they are present in this entouragebegan to wander on the earthor some river godA person who develops the aspiration to enlightenment Wishing to become a selfarisen jina a lord of Dharma Will have merit that will be vastly greater Through remembering one verse of this meditation You possess a mind that rejects rebirth and pacifies afflictive emotionsThen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara went to the place where the Bhagavān was paid homage at the Bhagavāns feet and remained at one side One hears unpleasant words from those Who without restraint act inappropriatelyInstead they eat vegetables and grain Lotus roots and garḍula seedsSome among them staggered about like a plantain tree shaken by the wind and sobbedFurthermore they act in accord with their wordsconstitute the path of great bodhisattva beingsAt a certain point the householder insulted his servant prompting the servant to thinkAnd having bestowed fearlessness upon them They develop them toward enlightenmentThese sentient beings will easily be freed from grasping at that which does not existKing Bimbisāra gives the Bodhisattva some alms And tells his men Find out where he goes Seeing that he returns to the best of mountains they report back Your Majesty he is staying on the face of the mountainIn this way all the ākya boys met their match while the Bodhisattva remained undefeatedthey will not be reborn by the power of those meditative concentrationshe brings the realization of omniscience and he presents the wisdom of omniscienceAt the same time the sound of Dharma teachings rang out from all the branches leaves flowers and fruits in the forestThey will proceed from one field to another fieldDuring the fight he falls to the ground from his fine horseEven the word tīrthika will be unknownto be frightened by the profound discoursesOnly in this way Elder Mahākāśyapa is the practice of eating by alms meaningfulbeings with no legs with two legs with four legs or with many legsan entire multitude of beings that are included within that realm of beings that have entered that realm of beingsIf we had stayed when the Bhagavān was teaching the excellent Dharma commencing with the highest complete enlightenmentfor those facing opposition like a lionBhikṣus however I will be dwelling in other worlds under other namesFurthermore Subhūti all thingsdoes not scatterthe concept of consciousnessVenerable Lord All these phenomena are unconditionedJaimini Vāmana and Vaiśampāyana Jamadagni and supreme rishi VālmīkiThis indeed āradvatīputra is the Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beingsthey showered forth the rain of ambrosia that is released by the light rays of the jewel of the Dharma which shines everywhereThat is to say have the transcendent perfection of generosity and the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom not been taughtAnd he will possess the seven treasuresThis prince will be a buddha revered by the world who will teach the genuine doctrineWhen it rains the plants and bushes The mediumsized herbs The trees and big trees In all ten directions are beautifiedThe monk Vīradatta also became completely free of fetters andHe did not appropriate physical forms nor did he appropriate feelings perceptions formative predispositions or consciousness in the manner of indicationsWhen he knew that many bhikṣus had wickedness in mind He became a protector for his teacher Incanting ones sword will bring victory if one goes into battleThe going forth of the fathers brothersinlaw husbands brothers and sons of some ākya women has also been allowedAnd who wore various kinds of diadems and jewelry As if the devas who were lords of Trāyastriṃśa had come Therefore young man listen well and rememberomniscience is pure owing to the purity of knowers viewers and so forthThey will not migrate to states in buddhafields where no buddha dwellsOn the relative level method is a gateway to becoming learned regarding the correct and the incorrectthis applies extensively also to all the world systems of the ten directionsnanda with the knowledge that ninetyfour eons after that good eon had passed I would realize supreme perfect enlightenmentThen the Bodhisattva thought What is the prerequisite for craving to take placethat the ripened fruit of his action has led to him being the most powerful and the greatest miracle workerFor people who have mastered the meaning That all phenomena are selflessIn the center one should draw Acala of black colorvery well doneThey were all turned toward omniscience pursuing omniscience approaching omniscience and reaching omniscienceWhile wondering thus blessed buddhas look upon them by turning to the right as an elephant wouldThe maid offered the food mixed with poison to the girls suitor the merchants son ate the food mixed with poison and he diedcannot be ignored by the world of gods humans and demigodsA double vajra should be drawn below Surrounded by the vajraenclosureand then practiced the applications of mindfulnessYou should earnestly apply this transcendent perfection of wisdom as it has been taughtSome are to be converted by the Tathāgatas complete nirvāṇahe saw many amazing miraculous displays and he perceived many gods who joyfully hovered in the sky waving banners and calling out Buddhathey will possess this Dharma teaching and they will teach itHaving seen those sentient beings engaging in grasping at that which does not existthe one who shines the radiant one the one who dispels darkness the torchbearerWhat are the sections of the DharmaYet the bodhisattva will let that being receive vows and confess their misdeedsYes it is the Blessed One agreedOn that occasion he was neither affectionate Nor even angryAs many women as there areTheir signlessness is boundless the total consummation of the space elementThey retain what they have heard for the sake of keeping the lineage of the Three Jewels unbroken and not for the sake of honoror those bodhisattvas who rely on reference pointsPrincess Jñānāvatī also dreamed that kind of dream When she awoke she went into the harem and described the dream to her circle of mothersThe affliction of sentient beings has nothing to do with causes and conditionsPraise those lords of the worlds with hundreds of versesthe sight of them purifies the eye faculty listening to them purifies the ear faculty sensing the fragrance of their discipline and qualities purifies the nose faculty touching and venerating them purifies the body faculty and expressing their qualities and contemplating them purifies the mind facultyIn the same vein I should induce them and establish them in the four immeasurable aspirations the four formless absorptions and so forth Conclusion of the thirtyfifth chapter JñānāvatīThe Bodhisattva accepted this gift and the following morning he put on these fabrics arranged them into a monks robes and went to the nearby villageOh friends beyond countless innumerable hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realmsYet Ratnākara a bodhisattvas buddhafield is a field of positive thoughtYou have had an excellent ideaHe will purify the eye of Dharma of all sentient beings and annihilate all his opponents together with their doctrinesMañjuśrī there are many sentient beings to be found in the great trichiliocosm whether born from an eggBlessed One the quantity of merit associated with the love of Brahmā lord of the millionfold universe would be much greater Forget about the merit from the giftIf you ask what is signlessness as a gateway to liberationUpatiṣya saw the Dharma heard the DharmaOne will not dig where one cannot pull out the rootthe divine princes of the Tuṣita realmWhy is that Some wise individuals will understand through parables the meaning of what has been saidthe offspring of the victorious ones from the ten directions Arrive to pay homage to the benefactor who has attained awakeningshe wandered from tree to tree and from grove to groveOne who knows this practice attains In this very birth the level of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa They are without fear among thieves Swindlers criminals and poisonous snakesāriputra the Sukhāvatī world is surrounded on all sides by seven layers of terraces seven rows of palm trees and filigrees of chimes It is radiantly beautifulThen Nārāyaṇa took me my queens and my retinue and placed us in the underworldYamas servants will replyThey will be like burned tree trunks like standing skeletons covered with hair with stomachs the size of mountains and mouths the size of a needles eye They will experience that kind of physical sufferingThey perched upon the verandas turrets doorways pavilions and upper terraces of King uddhodanas sublime residencenot to be beheld not trueSubhūti do you think that son of enlightened heritage or daughter of enlightened heritage who followed the vehicle of the bodhisattvas would on that basis have generated much meritMonks this person is a convert to a tīrthika orderSuch are the two gestures of the bodhisattvasso that those dharmas lead to the state of omnisciencethere appeared in the worldthey go to their own quartersWell at the time bodhisattvas dedicate that root of merit to all sentient beings the nonbirth of all those sentient beings is actualizedMy skill in methods is supreme And that of all the guides of the worldand does not clingThe Sage with his golden complexion Is replete with sublime characteristicsThey will be degenerate and behave badly Yet they will say I am going to be a buddha Avalokiteśvara having completely liberated those beings departed from the city of the pretasVenerable Lord if the notion of fundamental ignorance as with signs is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of fundamental ignorance as signless become a bodhisattvanor are their lives ever exhaustedsuch as geese cranes ruddy shelducks swans partridges peacocks rollers parrots mynas cuckoos avadavats and snipeto demonstrate the power and strength of the bodyMañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in bodhicittathey have the view of karma have overcome pride and their desire is for the DharmaAt the time of death twelve tathāgatas will come andThey circumambulated him three times then praised him with these fitting versesThe bodhisattva practices voidness but he does not realize voidnessThe lifespan of that sugata Will be a full sixty thousand eonsThey will not end up in the intermediate eon of diseaseI have crossed the ocean of cyclic existence plagued as it is by the wild monsters of abundant and manifold thoughtsHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the emptiness of emptinessAgain he sat for a bit before saying Mother open the doorSensations occur precisely according to the type of contact that occurs This is what is meant by contact causes sensationthe piṭaka of the pratyekabuddhas and the piṭaka of the bodhisattvasAnd you supreme among men know all Therefore for the benefit of beings I ask this question It is through their special power that accompanied by musicOut of skill in liberative art he does not rest in the uncompounded andYou should always worship and venerate the tathāgatas and correctly grasp their teachingsOne should pulverize and blend together bhūmividārī the three spices and sulphur One should place the mixture in the center of a wickSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomBhikṣus in the southwestern direction there is the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named Indradhvaja andMoving from the great hells to the great hellsBhikṣus you should aspire to this and comprehend itThey adorn this realm The highest buddha realmThe disciples who do not know the thoughts or the inclinations of others are not able to teach the Dharma to anyoneBlessed One rare are the beings who have faith in this Dharma teaching worship it memorize it read it aloud and master itMay you rise O Victor in Battle May you shine the light of insight in this dark world Beings will become knowledgeableThe Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Nārāyaṇaform the utpala mudrā As one recites it suddenly bursts into flamesdo not cultivate the noble eightfold path andQuell the torment of gods and humansWill succeed in an instantit has the nature of spaceAll of them were thinking the same thoughtThus we wasted what had been given in faith and as the fruition of that karma have been born as denizens of an ephemeral hellBhadrapāla you went on to ask how the element of consciousness abandons the body and then undergoes transferHis waist is slight like the curve of a bowSamṛddhi Great ProsperityAll of this was surrounded with seven threads made of precious materials that formed the outer ringBe a parasol for those burned by the sunSenior āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomWhat they have learned will never diminish And they give many other Dharma teachingsTherefore Subhūti it is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom is void and all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are void thatChanda heard the gods and told the horse KaṇṭhakaHaving failed to avoid the distressful you would certainly die and fall into hellBut we have never before Heard a dharma of this kindBound by the five fetters They were all instantly summonedThe emptiness of formative predispositions does not generate formative predispositionsThe beings who lived in Sukhāvatī includingRemember your previous actions Charioteer do not forget to bring this noble wealth To those who are depressed poor and sufferingThe light that shines from that thusgone one pervades that realm and illuminates itVenerable Lord if the notion of the sensory element of the eyes as empty is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes as not empty become a bodhisattvaThey will not disclose the actions of their demonic forces that seek to separate a bodhisattva from the six transcendent perfections and they will not mention the defects of those demonic forcesAll ordinary individuals Are ignorant of this natureBhaiṣajyarāja what is the residence of the TathāgataFirst there is the one named endowed with all colors and tastesthink I should teach the sacred doctrine to all sentient beings in order that they might abandon all afflicted mental statesTo say this is happiness and that is misery is dualismAnd thereby the Three Jewels were revealedThere will be many billions of bodhisattvas Who have great higher knowledge and are supremely skilledFor trillions of eons I have trained in discipline and patience Delighting in diligence the powers concentration and knowledgeIt is for them that the Bhagavān Taught the characteristics of the suchness of phenomenaThis renunciant is tired so I shall return during the night watch She returned during the night watchReverend Mahāmaudgalyāyana how could there be a teaching in regard to such a DharmaJust as a person with perfect sight can see the face of another person only a fathom away without any strainThey should be sought in the liberation of the tathāgatasreplete with thrones upon his right hand andSixtyfour thousand yakṣas With terrible secret mantras Dwell in the north And perpetrate harm in the northBhagavān it was thus in this training that the Bhagavān trained for a long timeAs I have violated my moral conduct I am no longer worthy to partake of faithful peoples offerings I shall fall into the great hell realmsThe first meditative absorption ensues when one achieves and maintains the first meditative concentration that is to say when there is freedom from desires and freedom from negative and nonvirtuous attributes while ideation and scrutiny are present alongside the joy and bliss that arise from freedomThe Sugatas body is like a blossomed flower With the various adornments of all the special signsnor is he inherent in consciousnessBreathing through the left nostril This is called the maṇḍala of windQuickly one man runs to the palace And joyfully relates the story to King Bimbisāra They deny karma they deny ripening Those imposters teach that there are no skandhasNoble son when bodhisattvas are thus endowed with the transcendencesIt is the root of all afflictioncame from all ten directions within the sacred abode of the Heaven of Joy also approaching the Bodhisattva in order to make offerings to himProstrations to the bodhisattva of the south Aśokadattaāriputra it is difficult to know the true meaning of the teachings given by the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhasWe will read it write it and make offerings to it We shall be dedicated to this Dharma teachingTherefore noble ones the Tathāgata using skillful method states Bhikṣus it is very difficult to find the appearance of the tathāgatasfor whom filth was equal to goldDefilement and purification are twoThey all live in great fear Since they lack permanence and cannot endureTheir supreme realms will be the same Their śrāvaka and bodhisattva assemblies will be the samethey have no letters they have no birthMonks at that point the ThusGone Ones body began to emit light rays that filled this trichiliocosm with bright lightIt quells the afflictions of attachment anger and delusionNo beings with various bad bodies or bad colorAs being without self without a soul unmoving Arising through conditions and as deceptive as a dream In that realm there will be innumerable Countless multitudes of bodhisattvas and śrāvakasI bring benefit to beings And my body is not visible and unceasingIf they were to ask such a question how should I respondHe who adheres to compounded things and uncompounded things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in adhering to compounded things and uncompounded thingsThe moment the monk went into her home lustful intentions were aroused in the prostitute who thought I will not let this monk go without sleeping with him If I fail I will dienanda there are fourteen great rākṣasīsBefore when he practiced austerities he never managed to manifest any deep wisdom derived from the teachings of superior humanshis remembrance of suffering experienced from beginningless timeone should make an effigy from beeswax four fingers in sizeto be oppressed by drowsiness and sleepAnd why is that Because of the nature of their means and insightIf you ask Subhūti how bodhisattvas embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the benefit of the worlds in this regardThe five fleshes transform into the five seatsāradvatīputra do you think that that which is without arising ceasing affliction and purification can train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscienceand in the same vein anything that strengthens or weakens all those other attributes up to and including buddhahood cannot be an outcome of the transcendent perfection of wisdomLater after the monks of the saṅgha gathered and were seatedMedicine robes turning cloth into robesBy calling him by his name and worshipping him one will be liberated from negative forms of existenceOr like the sun and its rays wherever the sun may goWith kissing embrace and the like One should regularly worship Vajrayoginīknowledge of game animals knowledge of bird soundsThus if he wanted to acquire merit he could still take up and follow a meritorious path which in turn would become a cause for taking birth in the higher realmstaking pleasure in solitude without being attached to itIn the same vein they discern that the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and other fruitional attributes are empty of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasAwakening is characterized by an absence of desire for attainmentāradvatīputra does this nature of mind with which minds are endowed exist or not exist Does it have being or nonbeing In terms of apprehensibility is it in fact apprehensiblehe will know The water is still farther down than thisMay they protect you With health and wellbeingThis teaching should be regarded as a great shrine and you should think Herein resides our TeacherAs this light touched them all the sentient beings within that trichiliocosm who had the body of a being in hellMañjuśrī a bodhisattva who is terrified by fear of life should resort to the magnanimity of the BuddhaI too have penetrated these teachings with the eye of wisdom and will never be of two minds about them againThe domain of the world yet not the domain of the afflictions such is the domain of the bodhisattvathere is no need to mention those who apply themselves to the yoga of meditation upon itin the open in charnel grounds in jungles at the foot of mountains and and at the edges of forestsHis power was compassion and his strength was courage He did not turn backThey should also encourage

deceitwho is adorned by the splendor of wisdomby the Blessed One the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly complete Buddha ākyamuniThe field of activity of all the buddhas Is the completely pure summit of the truth The buddhas are devoid of attributes They are the manifestation of the dharmakāyaWhen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrived there he transformed himself into the form of a bee that made a buzzing sound that was heard by the insects as the wordsConsider noble son how the time when the light of the sun disappears is referred to as the sunsetFor example when the power of alchemy Is applied to a copper objectThey should also praise and encourage others to investigate the twelve links of dependent origination in their sequential and reverse modalitiesBorn into the family of King Ikṣvāku he has come to the world of humansLeaving anyone uncared for is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeSimilarly physical forms are all neither fettered nor liberated because physical forms are nonarising Similarly consciousness and all the other aggregates are neither fettered nor liberated because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonarisingBeing without connection to future existences is not what bodhisattvas minds are like Rather bodhisattvas minds know the way to take birthHe teaches the Dharma in the form of a king to beings who are to be taught by a king The Blessed One is endowed with a protuberance on the crown of his headHe possesses all the oceanlike qualities of a buddha has no doubt and is a wise person who does not need to depend on

establish all proofs correctlyWhile tightly embracing the wisdomAll phenomena have arisen from nonexistenceNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities have a pure livelihoodBodhisattvas similarly pacify the torments of the afflictions with the water of Dharma throughout the realms of sentient beingsare subject to consummation and disintegrationexcellent patience granted by the BuddhaWith the vajra fists you accomplish the binding of all mudrāsSimilarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and in the same vein all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are not actualized because they do not arise because they are nonapprehensible and because they do not disintegrateBut there must be another path to awakening that can eradicate the future suffering of birth old age and deathhow could they possibly apprehend or consider an essencedo not

is a supreme treasure and is there no imputation of the fruit of entering the streamthen Subhūti other great bodhisattva beings should know that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have been favored by the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and similarly by the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity and in the same vein that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have

any great bodhisattva beings through their attention endowed with omniscience constantly dedicate all the roots of their virtuous actions for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment making common cause with all sentient beings and then exhibit indefatigability and relentlessnessOn account of their form fire does not appear inside the sticks but without the sticks no fire is observedthat some pass beyond suffering by means of the Solitary Buddhas VehicleIt teaches the immutability of all phenomena and is a gateway to the baseless nature of all phenomenaIf any beings know

Within the nature of the realm of phenomena there is neither affliction nor purificationTheir passage cannot be found Like that of a bird through the skyHaving become mendicants in this teaching of the Buddha They become attached to their robes and alms bowlsUltimately they are not nonreturners yet relatively from all phenomena there is no returnit is because the transcendent perfections and physical forms are indivisible and without dualityshe will be among the class of those who are determinedWhat is being pleasant It is being good companya monk ward or apprentice should do so with great vigor thinkingWhat is being free of doubt concerning the ripening of karma It is rejecting eternalism and nihilismNor is the absence of defining characteristics perceived by means of defining

not remain indifferentcopperSymbolizing the power of the antidote fully developed Trees are continuously arranged in sequencethey themselves will not degenerate in their commitments andIn future time there will be many bhikṣus Who will be covetous malicious and without restraintthey may feel that the only way to tame such beings is to emanate a fine and lovely girlthe most beautiful girl of allright next to that desirous manThereupon they turn some sentient beings away from generosity and the fruit of generosityDevelop veneration for those with the highest qualities The Buddha the Dharma and the SaṅghaSimilarly why do you say that the designation of physical forms as imbued with happiness or suffering their designation as a self or not a selfI would exclude shapeshifters from this Dharma and VinayaThen the crown prince Mañjuśrī said to the Licchavi VimalakīrtiOne will see Vāgīśvara right in front of oneself and remember everything one has heardthe name of that Blessed One was

arrogant proud or conceited based on such phenomenaBodhisattvas should be fields of merit in their concern for all beingsMoreover once absorbed into the dharma chakra at the heartBy doing this for three monthsIt is teaching correctly and without impediment the Dharma just as it has been seenThey will not degenerate from the four meditative concentrations the four formless concentrations the four applications of mindfulness and so onThose who argue that such things exist are all vainly debating what is empty and hollowHe is the essence that is the reality of matterAs his instructor you must quiz him you must instruct himNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities revel in superknowledge the power of faithMonks I then began a complete fastnanda even the requisites for the happiness of Indra the lord of the gods do not compare in the slightest with those of CandrabhūtiWhen the Bodhisattva was practicing the conduct of a bodhisattva for extended periods in the pastafter which he was born into a brahmin family dedicated to the six duties and in time he grew up under their nurture and care Conclusion of the seventeenth chapter The Entranceway to the Samādhi That Is Taught by Many Buddhasthey had accumulated merits by teaching the sacred doctrinemany trillions of goddesses resting in the center of the sky showered divine flowers incense garlands scented oils

nonpurification and the defining characteristic of nonentityBodhisattvas may encounter beings who are unfit for and incapable of comprehending the DharmaVinaya of the noble onesBecause ultimately they are utterly unbornThe wisdom consort should undress and lying on her back point to her secret placethey will not be emancipated from the world system of desireThis is why it is called the transcendent perfection of wisdomemptiness does not hanker and there is no one who hankers for emptinessThen King ūradatta thoughtThose humans who know the immaculate Dharma AndThe Pure Being is unstained by pleasurable objectsEven so flower and fruit cannot be separated into two things Similarly although action occurs because of the body and the body occurs because of actionWe will forever eliminate Even the quarters of those Who are wicked And do the world no goodand thus the wise are not attached to words nor do they fear themits abodes of devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas and asuras bounded by its Cakravāḍa mountainsSubhūti the four applications of mindfulness are neither fettered nor liberatedUnstained by the world They have no attachment to worldly phenomenaSimilarly the transcendence of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is always without fear Those who are terrified of the three realms Will not develop desire for sensual gratificationseparating them from the applications of mindfulness and in the same veinWhere did those roots of virtue gogreat loving kindness they meditate on love toward those on whom their minds are focused and  they attain happiness in this lifewith words that are soft gentle dependable and altogether beyond reproach Her voice is like that of the cuckoo she is demure and speaks only sweet and pleasant wordsIn this way Mañjuśrī purity the stainless and nondisturbance are collected within a single basisIt should also be applied To the wings of birds that circulate through villagesWhen there is conflict suffering cannot be ended When there is no conflict suffering ceases āradvatīputra it is to that extent that great bodhisattva beings are said to abide in the Great VehicleThus the learned will also be able to remedy the perpetuation of afflictionsThe wise do not think of real and unreal But see the true nature of all things as peace Unarisen and ungraspablencense of a priceless value In billions of precious censersGreat Muni turn the wheel of the DharmaThen insert the finger into the vagina and excite the nerve of VajradhātvīśvarīOne should offer an oblation with the oblation mantraPlease arouse the bodhisattva great beings roots of goodnessYou are a receptacle of virtue rich in qualities treading the path of virtueAll dharmas are namelessWhen he knows such invisible and formless things Why mention the visible forms of scriptsMonk as all phenomena are like nirvāṇa they are blissfulAt this sight the Bodhisattva left the roadThose jinas supreme lords of the world They will also teach these methods Maitreya if bodhisattvas possess eight qualities they will become irreversibly set on supreme and perfect enlightenment without regressing without regressing in the slightestWhen one is powerful with the best of wealth grains and possessions One is liked and desired and acts like a childAnd with the miraculous power of a buddha he emerged through Rājagṛhas gate of the hot springsThat shall now be explained correctlyemerge through the threefold combination of happiness suffering and neutralityWhat is destroyed is ultimately destroyedThrough attaining this samādhi of peace That is the range of activity of all the buddhas Yes Venerable Lord they may do soThe ponds resounded with the calls of ducks storks swans geese cranes and peacocksIn the North they speak roughlyThey placed their fingers together in homage Recited these verses and cast toward himEven if you were to count them for a quintillion eons You would not reach the end of themshould hear from them the Dharma teaching of entering great compassionand the inconceivably numerous kinds of great learning concerning purification Those are the fourfor whom filth was equal to gold for whom space was equal to the palm of his handGentlemen in the Middle Country the philosophers are such that our teacher could not even look them in the face O Teacher you have crossed The great river of suffering And ferry beings across itI accurately understood the identity of ignorance the source of ignorance the cessation of ignorance and the path leading to its cessationHe made offerings to that Jina And with his hands in homage sat before him You should not teach such a sūtra as this In the presence of foolish beingsBhikṣus in the western direction there is the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named Amitāyus andWhat is the knowledge of the intended meaning of words It is the knowledge of the intended meaning of the Tathāgatas wordsHis acts of generosity were done well as were his previous endeavors and his superior deedsBy applying this lampblack incanted  times to ones eyes one will be adored by everyoneāradvatīputra fixation denotes the views that bodhisattvas might adopt with regard

of justice in a later life I will go to hellHomage to the bodhisattvas Those sages with the divine eye And to the śrāvakas tooMoreover Subhūti the tathāgatas have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood knowing that the sacred doctrines are uncreated because there is no agentThey remember an eon of dissolution and an eon of originationon birchbark or cloth using saffron bovine orpiment resin etcThe Blessed One replied at length Son of a selfimmolator you are like and akin to most peopleSimilarly Senior āradvatīputra feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are without the nature of consciousness and the other aggregates andToday this grass will be very meaningful to meThey do not see the tathāgata as other than consciousness as other than the nature of consciousnessIf you ask for the sake of which doctrine great bodhisattva beings relinquish even their livesthe doctrine that they will not relinquishWith diligence you will unfold all good qualities Your concentration and knowledge will have no equal in the three realmsshould engage in union in that manner at all times without abandoning their engagement with the transcendent perfection of wisdomNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities know intentions and latent tendenciesThere is no reason for me to be here I shall go to the street where the poor people liveMañjuśrī it is like this just as the wheelturning emperor outshines all regional kings likewiserolls back and forth on the golden sandWith these words Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta caused this trichiliocosm to appear precisely without any difference like the Jewel World of the Blessed Thusgone RatnaketuAnd like the roar of kettledrums and thunderSon reject your ignoble wish to be among themThen the novice spoke this verse And will be beautifying that buddha realmBurns like a lampthrough this The best semen is caused to flowThe divine sage Asita who lived on the mountain slopes was filled with joyMay the name power sovereignty and might of the ThusGone One bring me wellbeingāradvatīputra the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized because physical forms are not actualized because they do not arise because they are nonapprehensible and because they do not disintegrateThe great disciples shook the flowers and even tried to use their magical powers but still the flowers would not shake offSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness have been taught without apprehending anythingJust as we attained awakening you too have reached the pristine statethe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of modesty concerning teaching the compositeThis is how I was thinking Lord of Jinas All the time throughout day and nightAs in all these cases āradvatīputra the meaning of the term bodhisattva as a great bodhisattva being abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom is nonexistentFor this reason the meaning of the term bodhisattva is a meaningless termGive their protection to me who have done such evil things I go to those bodhisattvas for refuge viWill listen to the Dharma and having heard it teach an assembly Those are the kinds of dreams that they will dreamThen Senior Subhūti said to the Blessed OneMay the stūpa that contains my bodyToward such a body you should turn your aspirationsSo long will the transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration emerge in the worldI know its origin I know its cessation I know its pathMaheśvara the deva śvara akra and similarly other devas A multitude of devas will come to themTherefore in doing so they become incapable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is superior to any human teachingShe dreams that Meru the king of mountains is shaken in its foundationDo not be afraid Noble ones do not be afraidI salute you whose glory rises up like Meruto lead others into the roots of virtueThen kidney stones will be passedyou will become the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly awakened BuddhaThe bodhisattvas the heroes Always remain in this enlightenmentThen the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna together with a following of two hundred thousand bodhisattvas facing the Bhagavān saidif each of these demonic forces were also to emanate again just as many malign and demonic forcesSuch desire aversion and delusion toward objects are the formations caused by ignoranceThe Lord of the World having appeared teaches Expounding the true practice to beingsNor does light think I function as the visibility for the eye consciousnessthe ten sense fields of total consummationWhere did you pledge to pass the rainy season And so the Blessed One asked Upasena these very questionsI have attained nothing reverend āriputraSubhūti the transcendent perfection of wisdom is empty of the transcendent perfection of wisdomOf endless eons of vast generosityThe Blessed One the thusgone worthy perfect buddha Amartyā was teaching the Dharma to all these bodhisattvasThat are as numerous as the Ganges sands Filled with precious jewelsBoth human and divine Mañjuśrī discipline awakening and sentient beings and on the other hand the Tathāgata these are nondual they are not divided into two Practicing in this way a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattvaI will be born where all the magical incarnations of the Tathāgata are bornAs they follow these teachers they muster diligence to abandon all unvirtuous qualities and perfect all virtuous qualitiesMy mother father relatives and kinsmen did not do those actsTheir tall houses are made fair and beautiful in distinctive ways they are embellished with gems pearls beryl and jewelsHe will sit on this earth on the seat of the previous awakened oneslike a crystal orbthe

Maudgalyāyana donewhen I was taking a walk the great Brahmā named ubhavyūha and the ten thousand other Brahmās who accompanied him illuminated the place with their radiance andthey discern through their minds endowed with omniscience that physical forms are imbued with suffering and do not focus on themIt was a graceful stride a stainless stride a beautiful strideThe gods praised the prince saying He is free from the darkness of disturbing emotions He is full of qualities and is able to see things just as they areWhat is engagement in activity It is not giving up because of suffering arising from diligenceIndeed what could the entire host of māras ever do to one who is devoted to this inconceivable liberationWhen they had thus assembled Before the Lord of the World King Vaiśravaṇa then said this To the Lord of the WorldThen the Blessed One the Vajra Holder taught this chapter on mantra for the sake of living beingsIt is the domain of all buddhas the garden of pratyekabuddhas

nature with respect to nonentities and the rest never exist and are nonapprehensible This being the case how could they possibly come or go Young man before the end of the day on which he attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodNow the time has comedo not let it slip awayWhen he said the letter ha out came the statement Destroying the afflictions and parting from desire

immaterial generosity Because it destroys all the kleśasAnd have bodies that possess the thirtytwo signsNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities are not fixated on their aspirationsfrom the limits of past time have not grasped physical formsThe buddha realms with their grounds made of crystal beautified by trees made of precious materials adorned by wreaths of calico and silk filled with many hundred thousands of bodhisattvas overspread with canopies and covered with a network of gold and the seven precious materials were revealedSimilarly Subhūti the ten powers of the tathāgatas do not apprehend the limit of past timeMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings abide in the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineThe Bodhisattva also had four goddesses named Utkhalī Samutkhalī Dhvajavatī and Prabhāvatī serve himand a retinue of thirty thousand devasThey do not dedicate these roots of virtue to the level of the śrāvakas or to the level of the pratyekabuddhas

discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are all indeed like a dream like a magical displaydoes not stay there but runs far awayHere the mighty sugatas Lead with the sublime DharmaNoble son similarly the bodhisattvas body is called a body just as the thusgone ones body is called a bodyMañjuśrī the echo the voice of many sounds comes

venerating this is transcendent diligence the total consummation of the water elementTake noble son the analogy of the sun and moon that illuminate the four continents benefiting sentient beingsThere were no Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla mountain rangesAs Māra heard this he fell to the groundThe king made a seat for the sage and said Go and bring him herethinking This is the origin of suffering this

wishes and individual levels of training it cuts through the doubts of all of them matures them and properly trains themthe north sank and the south roseBecause monks I give kin exceptions to kin It is the teaching of love to end bad actions It is the level of compassions equanimitySimilarly this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to the eyesI renounce all anger aggression stupidity and

GemsArising and disintegration are not the bodhisattva and hence arising and disintegration cannot receive any prophecyYour many deeds and disciplines tame beingsOut of devotion they then gave the ThusGone One a refreshing and cleansing bath in a lotus pond with lotuses of many different colorsAfter returning to the royal palace he will fondly resume his governance The seven limbs of enlightenment of the great sages And their discernments and bases of miraculous powers Are not difficult to attain for someone Who has trained in this restraint of the body It is because they see those phenomena to which ignorant ordinary beings become attached averse and perplexed as unproduced and because they see them as falsely imagined and fabricatedThen the Bodhisattva said Enough of this quarrel You should now all join up and confront me in wrestlingone should recite three times the mantra He has taught the knowledge of the past knowledge of the future The equality of the three times in the teaching of the sugatasWhile everywhere is the suffering of birth old age and deathThey should not dwell on the notion that physical forms have aspirations nor should they dwell on the

Bodhisattvas gatherand having assumed these incarnations they act for the benefit of sentient beingsThus they think What is the basis for these feelingsSimilarly this sacred doctrine is compatible with the ten powers of the tathāgatasor in an empty building should learn well the followingHaving subdued the four māras They raise their standard on the field of enlightenmentAnd why monks did the Bodhisattva examine the continent of his birthThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of comprehension of humans concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of comprehension of humans

signless constitute a bodhisattvaJust as clothes arisen from ones own merit are soft hard or rough so too one adopts the body that one takes on according to ones state of lifethe samādhi of the stainless giftSubhūti these great bodhisattva beings should know that great bodhisattva beings who have precisely investigated the six transcendent perfections on the irreversible level will not regress to the level of attenuated refinement of the śrāvakasThere was no one whether god nāga yakṣa human or nonhuman who was ever able to greet the Bodhisattva first with a delightful salutationHe

numberSubhūti all things have a modality that does not arise great bodhisattva beings too do not transgress this modalityso I will teach him the Hearers VehicleThat ray of light shone into the eastNoble son at that time when the prophecy concerning that bodhisattva great being was made eightyfour thousand beings gained acceptance that phenomena are unbornIt was undisturbed by wind and free from soot and dustWhile the Bodhisattva was dwelling in the Abode of Tuṣitathe bad that befalls themThat bhagavān made a prayerSubhūti what are the interim states with which those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have degenerated from those superior attributes due to their inappropriate actions are only associatedReverend Saṅgharakṣita once you have returned to Jambudvīpa

reflected imageAs for his lifespan it will be  trillion eonsAlso present were the four mahārājas and their retinue of thirty thousand devasindividuals endowed with enlightened attributes who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvasThe purity of all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience is the purity of physical formsThey are distinguished in name though in fact there is no real distinctionWhoever hears this will engender the excellent mind of awakening And thus delight all gods and humansthe bodhisattva will not be angry or hostileSimilarly consciousness and all the other aggregates are neither fettered nor liberated because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are unceasingwhen they do not make assumptions based on all other

craving not to occur and what must cease for craving to ceaseAnd all of them are thusgone onesthere is no one among them who fully awakened in any other wayIn his mind he has the thoughts of a poor person Thinking I do not own any of this propertySeeing such beings the thusgone ones wish to establish them in the wealth of the noble ones faith discipline learning generosity insight integrity and modesty Thus arises their great compassion for sentient beingsThen the sage stood up joined his palms and prostrated to the princes feetthe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of ignorance concerning teaching the compositeAnd so does the solid core of great treesThey know what has happenedAt that point there were five ascetic companions who were learning religious practices under the guidance of Rudraka the son of RāmaEver since the Bodhisattva had begun his practice of austerities ten young girls from the village had served him as a way to see him venerate him and assist himHow is it not permanentIt is the seat of the triple world because it is free of involvementCandraprabha in order to attain the ten strengthsThe vase is the four aspects of the dharma bodyand says

and are free from obstructing forcesMañjuśrī it is like this Just as a physician does not forsake even a few sentient beings whether they are a king a merchant a householder or a mendicantOtherwise

would not emit such a wonderful and beautiful light without causes or circumstancesWhen they wash their hands they think I shall clear away the stench of affliction for all beingsThis king of mantras will remove all fear in all those who constantly recite it even before it is fully masteredThe sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who would benefit those bodhisattvas

karmaAnd easeful examination and analysis Are not difficult to attain for one established in restraint Monks I then thoughtSimilarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that I having enacted the deeds of the buddhas should bring innumerable countless sentient beings to attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the psychophysical aggregates is left behindin order that they might abandonInasmuch as feelings neither arise from anywhere nor do they go anywhere butfloated through the sky to Vulture Peak Mountain into the presence of the

kṣatriyasIt is rare to find freedom from the eight unfortunate statesSenior āradvatīputra I am inspired to say that things are nonarising that things are indeed nonarisingthese five things are in no way displeasing to the eyeKing uddhodana then asked for the bell to be sounded in the city of Kapilavastu and announcedNoble son the thusgone ones see every single being within all world realmsutterly beyond number and ideasEnlightenment which is not shown by any example is incomparableNevertheless compared to the jewel of a thusgone ones body the jewel of a bodhisattvas body is not pureIt does not cause one to know the world system of form and the world system of formlessnessIts magical powers enable it to fly through the sky and transform itselfbecome equipoised in the meditative

birth motherand which is the sūtra that teaches the ultimate accomplishmentharsh speechBhikṣus then those Mahābrahmās each offered to the Bhagavān their own airborne palace andListen as I shall proclaim the names Of these invincible tathāgatas Sage You shed tears you cryVenerable Lord Turning away from what are great bodhisattva beings reckoned to be irreversibleWhen one sees that all phenomena are naturally at peace and naturally in a state of union that is genuine seeingThat is the fifth strange and wonderful thingIlluminating Jeta Grove with their splendor They joyfully approached meomniscience are all neither fettered nor liberatedwhen they do not apprehend a doer or someone who experiencesand the element of dharmas is accompanied by attentionThis mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to physical formsand poises it for the supreme city of nirvāṇaBy meditating thus within six months the practitioner will become equal to Vāgīśvara andThen he adorned the horses jasminecolored hoofs with goldNoble sons you must all have faith Noble sons you must all have complete faithThen the hair and so forth will fall out and grow againtheir speech will be purified and their minds will be purifiedSenior nanda then said to the Blessed OneWithout moving from one given buddha realm they pose questions to the thusgone ones in numerous buddha realmselling those tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas to dwell happily by sayingBecause he has made others develop the mind of awakeningsince it involves reference pointsnanda this head merchant who

contorted their bodies in various ways and wept Meditation on the path through this doorway of correct conduct Excellent practice instruction and conductWhat are those threeit follows that those great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will refine the path to enlightenment and correctly enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasAs they ardently seek to obtain the five superknowledges they become vastly superior to those around themBhagavān from where did these countless innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvas comeWho have fallen into the great ocean And into the rivers of saṃsārathey comprise  attachment to the world system of form  attachment to the world system of formlessness  fundamental ignorance  pride and  mental agitationMaheśvara Nandathey do not dedicate the merit to placesThere is the meditative stability named Dispelling the Misery of CorporealityWhat is the rejection of living in a home It is leaving home for physical and mental solitudeYet if he alone becomes a victorious one and a Dharma kingIn the same way Nārāyaṇa bodhisattvas do not dwell in any particular conductYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who with a higher motivation seek kalyāṇamitrasVenerables your great and dauntless selfconfidence is noble It is excellent It is excellentthey decided to venerate the Bodhisattva by adorning a hundred thousand buddha realms in the same wayHow sad that the life of a wise man does not last longand similarly the real nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessSimilarly Subhūti feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered by nor liberated from their past limitsThey addressed each other agreeably And the king sat down before themAlas my gentle love with a voice as sweet as Brahmās And as soft as the sound of a nightingaleSimilarly the attributes which the tathāgatas possess are innumerableDharmarājaśrī Glory of the Dharma KingTherefore Bhagavān they will accrue the karma of rejecting the DharmaThose who follow the eightfold path are good beingsāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of physical forms as with signs or signless constitutes a bodhisattvaSo it is that the purity of the transcendent perfection of wisdom andIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of mental phenomena and the aforementioned sense objectsAjita the one who after my passing into nirvāṇa possesses this Dharma teaching and reads it writes it out and teaches itLooking behind him he saw the novice and askedJust as a lotus will be unstained By water soiled with mudBy opposing omniscience they oppose the sacred doctrinewould not all ordinary people attain the fruit of entering the stream and they do not criticize the wise  they do not waver from their vowstheir sense faculties become keener unlike the sense faculties of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhasIn the same vein are the other nonexistent sensory elements up to and including the nonexistent sensory element of mental consciousness unattached to the nonexistent sensory element of mental consciousness and the restUnderstanding how his own mind is governed by feelings the demon Pāpīyān will then immediately hide and disappearThe fool lives alone in the hut Outside of that residenceBut it is not so easy to know the extent of the mind of someone Who has meditated on this stainless samādhi of peace have no words are empty are primordial peace and are pure by natureAll the gods marvel over The royal palace of AḍakavatīIs the goddess Calumny VajrīLikewise did he make the forty kinds of correct aspirationrī Mahādevī generated roots of virtue in his presence and in the presence of many other tathāgatas tooSimilarly I identify with the ten powers of the tathāgatasvarious kinds of turmeric flowersThey will not construe the notion that conditioned elements are aspirationless and that aspirationlessness is the conditioned elementsI will turn the wheel of Brahmā which has not previously been turned in the world in conformity with the sacred doctrine by any virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone elseFor all that occurred occurred because of the Bodhisattvahe taught the Dharma to the entire assemblynot giving up the great compassion You must kill those two dharmabhāṇakas They are tīrthikas who are teaching nihilismThey should dwell there through dwelling in loveHe is not a construct not a concept inconceivable not a mental placementWill attain even greater meritwith regard to inner feelings outer feelings and combined inner and outer feelings continue to observe feelings without generating any apperceptions dependent on feelingsAbiding in the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineA yogin of red complexion Should meditate on Red AcalaBlessed One how does the feeble element of consciousness split hard and solid forms into pieces and then undergo transfer from them to dieThey have obtained such a treasure as infinite realms That are as numerous as the Ganges sandssounded from the leaves of all the trees from all the grass bushes and forests and from the summits of all the mountainswho are continuously beheld by the blessed buddhasWhen the Blessed One looked at Bhadrapāla light streamed out from his bodyFrom now onward nanda you should remember this Dharma discourse as The Former Prayer that is Truly NobleThey are endowed with all the aids to enlightenment and embody the seven factors of enlightenmentBhikṣus what do you thinkWithin that pore there are many hundreds of thousands of ninetyninestory palaces made of divine gold and jewelsto some undershirts to some begging bowls and to some small platesThey were without afflictions and controllednor do I hold that the tathāgatas turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine thereinNoble son you may wonder what the bodhisattvas excellent inner patience consists inhe approached the Bhagavān and bowed his head down to the Bhagavāns feetNoble son when bodhisattvas see sentient beings engaged in unvirtuous activity they attract them with material thingsThus those living beings with inferior aspirations will be inspired with lofty aspirationsAnd if all of the various beings there are Made this offering to them for endless eonsAll phenomena are without location They have no location that can be knownthe love that is wisdom because it causes attainment at the proper timeHe taught the Dharma that is good in the beginning good in the middle good in the endand went to the land of silverThey have wisdom They have meritSubhūti when great bodhisattva beings dispense their gifts to recipients with an attitude free from hostilityto vanquish negative and hostile influences andThe domain of the four right efforts where the duality of good and evil is not apprehended such is the domain of the bodhisattvaFriends the unsurpassable and perfect awakening that I have accomplished through limitless billions of eons I now place in your handsDo no harm to any personTeaches the Dharma in various ways And reveals this highest enlightenmentFor if he himself saw forms in other lands with the divine eye and heard pleasant sounds with the divine earGrasping at life and for the sake of happiness The unwise always commit bad actions iYour Majesty please speak When we hear what you saw in your dream we will explainAll phenomena are entirely bereft of all going and thus without goingMoreover Subhūti there are great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and who are absolutely intent on this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom butHow you may wonder do they not acquire things through covert urgingand Green is formationYoung man those are the buddha qualities of a tathāgatathere was not a single spot that was not perfectly illumined by that great lightIf a demotion or a repeat demotion has already been imposed on a preceptor or an instructorWith his miraculous powers and great might he must have gone far ahead of us and be waiting there nowBodhisattvas should be unflagging in persistence in their own objectives in not forsaking any being and in distinguishing the circumstances of all beingsHe will discover the Dharma That will soothe beingsthe attributes of those who have entered the stream the attributes of those who are tied to one more rebirthWhen those beings you saw who were shaped like mortars and pestles were monksThey cause conceptions to increase And they will not be free from conceptions Dwelling in emptinessThey should engage in conduct related to delusion and be free of delusionThe bodhisattva Animiṣa declared emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor endHave gained the pacific state pleasing to saints And crossed over the seas of sufferingand in the same vein those who wish to comprehend sensory contact that is mentally compoundedAnd your merit of generosity will be faultlessI have faith I am also diligent I am mindful and I can practice absorption I also have knowledge So therefore in order to master and actualize that teaching I will practice on my own in a solitary place without getting distractedIt is the buddhadharma taught by the supreme being And it is the teaching that compassionately benefits the world the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of apprehensions concerning the kleśasThey will be patient even with the children of outcastsThe most seductive and sweet girls Tṛṣṇā Rati and Arati These three graceful ones hastily arrived sent by MāraMonks from everywhere such as the east the south the west the northIt is a wheel of entering the way of the ultimate truth which assumes nondualitySince everyone agreed with this suggestionThe great attainment the splendor of the tathāgatas is grantedEmit water from their bodies Extinguishing the fire of millions of realms iOne should arrange all these signs In position above the sun and the moonSimilarly the emptiness of the truth of suffering is not the truth of sufferingMake an effigy out of beeswax Of the targetthose hostile toward the teachingsHe teaches them the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets DisplayWhen King ūradatta saw him he rejoiced and was happy joyful hopeful and comforted thinkingbodyconsciousnessHave attained complete nirvāṇa Without any remainderThen once the seven days had passedHis body speech and mind are pristineSo what is so amazing about a human body with no substancefor as long as I live renounce and swear to refrain from stealing sexual misconductand in the cold season any location in which this precious gemstone is placed would become warmshould determine that all things are empty of inherent existenceHe went to the Jetavana Monastery arrived thereit is because nothing at all is expressed or revealed thereinMany hundreds of thousands of upāsakas and upāsikās had gathered thereIf they were able to hear this Dharma teaching of retention they would proceed irreversibly to the highest complete enlightenmenthe should subsequently emerge from there In the complete form of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇatogether with ū and the binduMaintaining these attributes they adopt the precepts and maintain the conventional ethical disciplinesYou saw beings tormented by suffering Constantly overpowered by desire and angerthe animate and inanimate the three worldsYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of eloquence What are the four kinds of eloquenceThose who have attained this samādhi of peace Will never again have attachment to the three existences offering grilled fish and so onI pay homage to the splendorous Buddha The king of Dharma the illuminator Who first taught the incantation In the world And for another ninetyfour eons And for a thousand quintillion eonsnanda since even now I honor venerate respect make offerings to and rely upon this same transcendent perfection of wisdomPlease ensure that they have the bravery with which to eradicate their afflictions and that they have the fortitude to be free of anxiety in the midst of any assemblyHe then set out to travel the realm with a small entourage who carried with them their begging bowls and dharma robesIn the world of Sukhāvatī the assembled bodhisattva great beings and great hearers saw the Sahā world and were amazedThis Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta has served previous jinasand they were then all reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī as bodhisattvas named SugandhamukhaHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of stupiditynanda replied the Blessed One not only will there be those who reject the sūtras and speak poorly of themIt is certain to reverse all obstaclesthey fill Jambudvīpa with diverse precious things emanated through the power of their miraculous abilitiesdelighted themNārāyaṇa came from his heartThe earth appears even and stainless like the palm of a handThey wanted to know how the birth had gone and whether she was feeling wearyWhich forms a vast deep triangleAs soon as the Tathāgata had said these words the Teacher added these versesOne will then be able to protect any house one wishesHow do they practice what they preachMany with ugly misshapen bodies Many kinds of bodies destitute of adornmentIf you ask how they correctly perceive the four noble truthsFirst you should know your students And if they are known to be pureSo Subhūti it is because all things are empty of inherent existenceEveryone in the gathering at the house of Vimalakīrti was able to see distinctly this universe wherein the Tathāgata Gandhottamakūṭa and his bodhisattvas were taking their mealgathered the roots of virtueYoure a brahmin they saidAnd establish them in the higher knowledgesHe thought It is not easy to practice the unsurpassable Dharma and attain its goal while living in a homeProstrations to all rupakāyas in infinite worldsThey also conceptualize the aggregates of sensation perception formation and consciousness ButVenerable nanda monks who conceitedly consider themselves pure because of their pure aggregate of discipline are excessively proudelders the middleaged and the youngafter drinking a handful of water incanted seven timesOr else one should visualize him with a focused mind Without the wisdomconsortIn this sacred doctrine is there no imputation of entering the streamBali offered a bejeweled throne to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara andThey will all come to possess These supreme qualitiesDo you then think venerable ones that a mind that is not real and not established can nevertheless be liberatedOn those days a girl of royal caste who has been well cleansed well adorned and who has fasted for a day and taken the five precepts should wind four red strings into a cordto notice it stabilize it ensure that it is not lost ensure that there is no distraction from it and ensure that it is not forgottenevil or goodThis position is called holding the kneesBlessed One at which times do bodhisattvas attain the intrinsic nature of the thusgone ones body in this manner The Dharma that the jinas have taught Is unceasing and therefore is not seenIn some other realms you manifest in the form of spaceBodhisattvas with similar conduct to the Bodhisattva gathered from throughout the ten directionsThose who engage in diligence Are in the care of the jinasThey have correct conduct They have knowledgeThose who long for this samādhi of peace Will never have fear arise in their mindIf he discards his joy in the Dharma and delights in desireThe cloud then resounded with this versehad not dedicated the roots of virtue andas many gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realm as there are throughout the world systems of the great trichiliocosm all congregated there in that same assembly along with their divine princesten million one hundred billion many hundred thousands in numberThen the dharmabhāṇaka Supuṣpacandra mindfully and knowingly arose from that samādhi and went to the great assembly of bodhisattvasThey will also smell the scents of the bodies of the deva boysand the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Anikṣiptadhurathe mindconsciousnessbase do not swerve from the tathatāāriputra all the beings who now hear that Dharma from me will also attain the highest supreme enlightenmentThat is how you should practiceThey should have no association either With those who are the kings courtiersamong all possible beingsthose without feet with two feet with four feet or with many feet those with form or without form those with perception without perception or neither with nor without perceptionthe ThusGone One is called supremethis is the time to be among priests and householdersNoble ones who is your teacher Whose students are youwho delights in wisdomthe bhikṣus who are holders of this Dharma teaching will not have cravingsAs numerous as the Ganges sands Will be emitted from the pores of their bodies Since the existence of self cannot be perceived what is there to be made selfless Thus the nondual vision of their nature is the entrance into nondualityThe mere sound of his name will cause those of incomparable poison to flee And even those as brilliant as the leader of the hooded will become just like a fishNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities have equal concern for all sentient beingsand yet they do not rest in the levels of the śrāvakas and the levels of the pratyekabuddhas Nor are they attached to any attributes through which manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment would be attainedEstablishing them all as witnesses he addressed akra mighty lord of the godsThe bhagavān asks Bhagavān do you have that which you must be patient withBy applying two drops of this errhine regularlyThe transcendent perfection of ethical discipline has the defining characteristic of noninvolvementIt is the seat of the strengths the fearlessnesses and all the special qualities of the Buddha because it is irreproachable in all respectsThey are the inconceivably numerous sūtras concerning the compositeWhat were they doing thereThey become cakravartins in this world They come to Jambudvīpa as the sovereign of humanswhich is endowed with the supreme of all aspects engage in without engaging in the level of faithful practiceand thereby outshine the hearers and solitary buddhas who rely on reference pointsThe perfect and unimpeded practice of the Dharma of complete peace The empty nature that is constant stainless peacefulness But they would not be able to know the extent Of the fields of activity of such a persons mind or body At that very moment the gods hit the ground with their handsWhen I said Why dont the ākya boys come to attend upon the boyIn order to guard the princeYou nanda in a future timeHow are the bodhisattvas who have trained wellso eloquently do they speak so wise are theyThe buddhas have explained That they are by nature empty and they do not see optical aberrations and they are not viewers of optical aberrationsBut since he is trained in physical prowessāriputra how should monks develop the perception of the faults of the bodySimilarly the purity of phenomena is profound due to the absolute purity of enlightenment and due to the absolute purity of omniscience and genuinely perfect buddhahoodhe should abandon the conception of himself as a personality and produce the conception of himself as a thing thinkingWere one to spend hundreds of thousands of millions of eons it would be impossible to measure the limit of the mass of meritsAlas my son so talented in playing music and singing songsmade outer inner and secret offerings and asked the followingIn what mothers womb will he be conceivedWhy is it the path of the wisdom of the buddhas Because it brings the attainment of all good qualitiesThis āradvatīputra is the absence of dogmatic assumptions with regard to the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline of great bodhisattva beings when they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomSimilarly the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas being empty of inherent existenceLord you know the right time the right moment and the right occasionMany hundreds of millions of gods and maidens scattered flowers from the sky above and played cymbalsin that very instant that very moment commands some people who can run quicklySimilarly is this mind of the bodhisattvas unattached to the sensory element of the eyesThose great heroes with great strength Wear the armor of the great DharmaI remember that  billion previous buddhas Turned the sublime wheel in that supreme grove named after the sagesIt is thus that they perfect the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationThen akra mighty lord of the gods of Trayastriṃśa andHe has many elephants horses carriages cattle and sheepIt is the knowledge of successive levels It is always maintaining mindfulnessAnd squeeze their throats menacing them And delighting in injuring themMonks then akra lord of the gods spoke to the gods in the Heaven of the ThirtyThreeWhen the Tathāgata will be in ultimate liberation I wish to defend his holy Dharma to protect it and to worship itAll these beautiful attributes were formed by your merit And delighted the kingYes they are SubhūtiBodhisattvas should be free of enmity impartial toward both friends and enemiesMental placement does not occur in the presentFully supported by incantations Imagine that they crush them into dustHe is neither name nor signWhat are the seven They are as followsAt that moment there was not a single being anywhere that felt hostile frightened or anxiousFirst the postulant prostrates to the TeacherIt is you who will remove the worlds cataracts Bestowing upon it unexcelled eyesThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of ascension concerning the compositeWith his unique divine beloved

the form of yakṣas Will condemn usThis was the fourth chapter on the wheel of suppression from The Tantra of the Vajra in the UnderworldRightward gaze known as one that pulls in Should be combined with pūrakaIt is like a flash of lightning being unstable and decaying every momentMañjuśrī when the teaching of the Dharma is taken as a point of reference for an unreal tathāgata who has not arisen nor ceased and who is nonexistent and primordially unbornwill be completely liberated from the suffering of saṃsāra and be completely liberated from birth aging sickness death misery lamentation suffering unhappiness and conflictneither speechThey completely conquer the māras And allow them no chance to prevailNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities are joyfulThey were possessed of good bodies alluring beauty sublime excellent complexions and perfect limbsin the same way the Blessed One is endowed with feet that are well positionedIf he has petitioned the saṅgha to give consent

way he has carefully guarded his speech actions and mind and so he is the One with Broad ShouldersEach bodhisattva everywhere within the ten directions would then see as many buddhas as many bhagavats as there are atomic particles in inexpressibly numerous tens of quintillions of buddhafieldsWhy should we observe celibacyPreviously my complexion had been beautiful and smooth but now this radiance had disappeared because of exerting myself in extreme austeritiesA bodhisattva lion similarly is naturally inclined to places of solitude and thus lives in forestsThey will also wish to see the bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs and the upāsakas and upāsikāsBhagavān let us return to our own buddha realmbecause it generates a bodyāradvatīputra just as the notion of the physical forms of a tathāgata arhat and completely perfect buddha is without foundationIt abides at the realitylimit for it is utterly without fluctuation It is immovable because it is independent of the six objects of senseThose beings will be those who have planted roots of merit under many buddhasIn my past lives I have honored Seven hundred and thirty million buddhasThe music of the devas and the music of the nāgas And also the melodious music of the kiṃnarasThe term bodhisattva designates one who is simply an enlightened beingAlas For those disciples who live a great distance away the journey can be arduousWithout having perfected the causal attributes from the four applications of mindfulness up to the noble eightfold path and the fruitional attributes from the ten powers of the tathāgatas up to the eighteen distinct

Similarly they include knowledge of contaminated and uncontaminated phenomenaand likewise when they engage in union with the emptiness of the origin of suffering the emptiness of the cessation of suffering and the emptiness of the path that leads to the cessation of sufferingAnd do so continuously with veneration similarly do you think that anything other than feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness constitutes a bodhisattvaRather they dispense their generosity having established the notion that all sentient beings are undifferentiatedwhen I myself gain that state I will be known as a perfect buddhaAs such this body comprises the hairs of the head the hairs of the body and in the same vein all the aforementioned things up to and including the brain tissue and cerebral secretionsnor has it anything that makes it ceaseSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness constitute apprehension for great bodhisattva beingssimilarly

now brought about a miracle such that through that miracle the fourfold assembly thought those eons were just one afternoonSubhūti it is because past time is empty of the pastAre never deceitful or dishonest Are always gentle and always delight in liberation One should fill its mouth with ash and bury ithow could great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom acquire the notion of an entity or the notion of genuine origination or the notion of something that is authenticIt is the expression of truth for those who have fearlessness It is the correct search for the strengthsIf when the evil Māra says such words the minds of those great bodhisattva beings are not alienated and frightenedin the same way the expanse of reality does not consider any other sensory

ultimate truth even now teaching the sacred doctrineThey make their home in a straw hut beside the wealthy mans houseIn the same way they came and arrived from the ten directions and were seated in the eight directionsThose who were starving had their stomachs filledit is the case that they correctly perceive perceptions to resemble for example a mirage which deceives those who crave water

such sentient beings this son of noble family will manifest in a form corresponding to their respective fortunesMonks it seems to me he is behaving like a dog wracked by hunger but refusing fine food and fare and eating excrement insteadand similarly why would they have a view concerning the sensory element of the eyes and in the same vein why would they have a view concerning the other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousnessWe will fill the entire city of Kapilavastu With blossoms of māndārava flowers beautiful jasmine and hibiscus In order to make offerings to him Who appears due to virtuous activitiesWith your merit and wisdom virtue pervades your bodythey dispense their generosity as followsMahākātyāyanaAlas Right here in my presence you should put an end to suffering andthey view it free of desirous attachment they view its cessation and view and rest in its utter abandonmentOn the relative level doubt is a gateway to obscurationand similarly they think that the other aggregates up to and including consciousness are distinct things and the emptiness of inherent existence anotherKnowing all latencies and inclinations There is nothing you are not aware ofThose with hands of webbed fingers With no lips whose bodies are markedand they do not engage with feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessIn all

āradvatīputra in the same veinVenerable Lord Similarly it is dependent on these great bodhisattva beings that the maturation of all sentient beings is discernedThen at that time by the power of the Buddha venerable nanda said to the Blessed Oneneither name nor no nameand so on up to Due to these causes and conditions when their bodies have decayed they will be reborn among the gods and humans

this waySimilarly noble son continued the Blessed One the thusgone ones are the unsurpassable great kings of physiciansNoble son such then is the bodhisattvas practice of excellent patienceThey do not know selflessness Within which there is no suffering When he entered their dwelling Upatiṣya askedperceive it as being devoid of self like a dream perceive it as being devoid of a soul like a dreamBhagavān the poor mans father is at the entrance to his homein fact in an ineffable manner in possession of the supreme patienceThese are the rebirths with crippled facultiesNot giving rise to ignorance means not giving rise to the twelve limbs of existencein a natural mannerimmediately an identical bodhisattva appeared with his body beautifully adorned with all the excellent marks and representations sitting upon each of the lion thrones at the root of each of the bodhi treescircumambulated him clockwise seven timesMoreover through the blazing fire of the ultimate they ripen beings and thereby transform them without relying on reference points into the omniscient wisdom that is endowed with all supreme aspectsIt is adorned with the yakṣiṇī Vidhvaṃsaṇī And with song and musicNo Mañjuśrī I do notDivine son since ultimately even the Thusgone One does not have faithYet the real nature of the Tathāgata is without real nature in which case too the Elder Subhūti is the emulator of the TathāgataWhen he said the letter ī out came the statement The world is riddled with plague ītibahulaṃ jagatWear flower ornaments halfmoon ornaments and chains Adorn yourselves with belts rings and earringsNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities ensure that the mind of awakening is not lostReflecting thus he wondered Is there anyone who can liberate me from this miseryVenerable Lord if the notion of sights as a self is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of sights as a nonself become a bodhisattvaSimilarly their cultivation of the applications of mindfulness will not be interruptedThe girls then went before their father and saidWhoever understands emptiness well understands nirvāṇa wellThey are teaching this Buddhadharma Through trillions of parables and reasons not presentone should know that these great bodhisattva beings will never be separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe preceptor himself then sanctions the begging

hell beings a protectorIn his last lifetime he will become A lord of the world an unequaled great rishinanda so it iscontinuing in the same vein as far as the designation of the sensory element of mental consciousness as void or not void constitute a bodhisattvaSimilarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the nonactualization of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessLike a golden mountain glowing with purity the Guide was bornHūṃ hūṃ resounds like thunder They are thoroughly suppressed by his voiceit were not a nonentity then this supreme Great Vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its gods humans and antigodsWhat is a person who is sexually impaired One whose sex organ has been rendered impotent by disease or one who has been castratedKāśyapa repliednanda Physical forms are empty of physical formsSimilarly it is because dependent on these bodhisattvas the emptiness of internal phenomena will emerge in the worldIntrinsic entities do not abide in intrinsic entities nor do extraneous entities abide in extraneous entitiesAnd why is that Because the thusgone ones have abandoned

and on their diligent conductThey will experience the sensation of great suffering in the hellsOnly by the arising of a particular kind of bliss Can it be reached not otherwiseThey reject the Buddhas teaching And teach numerous other doctrinesThis was his prayerBe it the compassion or the protectivenessdivine princes it is because in this transcendent perfection of wisdom the three vehiclesAlthough they appear as beings ultimately their bodies are devoid of true existenceThey are learned in the categories of letters and words They know many different kinds of sounds And they are skilled in meanings and lettersThen through the blessings of the Bodhisattva the entire assembly of gods saw all these bodhisattvasThe Blessed One then embraced those guhyaka lords with love and induced them to take up the bases of trainingThey were in a dreadful awful house That was filled with many terrifying beingsThey have been anointed with the unguent of disciplineTake us and this world

It is conduct without errorThat is what Jetavana Monastery looked likeWhen this sūtra has not been heard Or meditated on repeatedlyWhy is it not the level of ignorance Because it brings the accomplishment of seeing phenomena as they truly areYou simply perceive psychophysical aggregates when there are no psychophysical aggregatesTogether with Queen Vimaladattā and her courtiers the two sons of King ubhavyūhaHowever they should do so without apprehending anythingcloudy formWander in the world like rhinoceroses And roam like the wind through the air The Mindful One eats as much as necessary and then throws the bowl in the riverMay I and all my nāga wives and children become free from this existenceThis Maitreya is how the bodhisattva mahāsattvas have emancipation in the

anywhere that cannot be contained in the oceanRasanā is positioned on the rightEight dwelling in each of the four directionsit is because when they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomIt is a wheel free from the two extreme views in the understanding of interdependenceThey do not see a tathāgata as other than form They see a tathāgata in this way The Tathāgata is the fearlessness that is the nature of formthey had perfectly adorned bodies speech and mindsIn front of him he should confess his sinsOverjoyed with the Lords perfect qualities the king of the nāgas joined his palmsFirst

phenomenonāradvatīputra In the same vein do you think that the real nature of the other sensory elements up to and including the real nature of the sensory element of mental consciousness constitutes a bodhisattvaand Brahmā also was amazed to hear this teaching from that good man Having bowed to him he saidThe leaders of the demigods and the leaders of the garuḍasThen the former accumulation of

should wear these ornaments that we have made for seven days and nightsThen having killed White Acalajust as an echo an optical aberration the reflection of the moon in water and a phantom emanation

perseverance and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration nor does it diminish themHis left is holding a noose The sons of King ūradatta His retinue and so onNoble sons when they had

awakening the bodhisattva will teach him the DharmaThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are devoid of arising and yet sentient beings believe they are subject to arisingExaltation Then the gods from the pure realms circumambulated the ThusGone One who sat at the seat of awakeningTherefore I would exclude from this Dharma and Vinaya those persons who are converts to a tīrthika orderFurthermore they also encourage others to acquire generosity inducing and establishing them thereinVenerable Lord if all phenomena are merely conceptualized and merely nominalSubhūti it is because the emptiness of internal phenomena is empty of the essential nature of internal phenomena and In the same vein the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities are empty of the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities and so forththrough ones own extrasensory powers one has actualized achieved and

the first meditative concentration and the others up to and including the fourth meditative concentration and abide in these meditative concentrations without permitting the cultivation of other mindsets that is to say those of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasthe samādhi named Completely PresentIf the Blessed One was about to foretell actions of the past the rays of light would fade into the space behind the Blessed OneNext the great king Dhṛtarāṣṭra arose from his seatBy opposing it they defame and oppose the enlightenment of the lord buddhasgreat bodhisattva beings who have carried out their duties toward the conquerors of the past and cultivated the roots of virtuous action under many tens of millions of buddhasexplaining their meaning and etymologiesteachingHe was a peerless great

consciousness are calm and do not focus on themNo one shall steal in my landsBodhisattvas who act in this way are carrying out bodhisattva practiceThey have left the trench barrier behind They have crossed over the trench barrier They have extracted the splintersin the same way Venerable Lord although great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom they do not think I am far from the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas and I am approaching unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThey are uncivilized wild and impetuous without any heed for the consequences of their actions Hence this is not an appropriate place for the Bodhisattva to be conceivedHe is like a chariotSon though we have done much for this king he has not taken care of usThose who repair dilapidated ruined ancient stūpas are good beingsAnd these are indeed beings who suffer who are unprotected who have no guardian and who have no savior no strength and no supportIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance acquire the transcendent perfection of toleranceAlas these beings are intent on ruin Alas they wish for destructionO O fickleminded one Cili cili Culu culu Release your fluid release SvāhāThey promised We shall kill no morethat he teaches the Dharma with such matching words and lettersMaitreya if

buddhaundiminished diligenceDraw them holding their individual offeringsMoreover āradvatīputra the spiritual mentors to great bodhisattva beings teach the doctrine that feelings conditioned by sensory contact that is visually compounded are impermanentVenerable Lord In that case is this mind of the bodhisattvas unattached to physical formsto refine the fields as well to please honor venerate respect and make offerings to the tathāgatas arhats and genuinely perfect buddhas and they will not descend to the levels of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhasI have become very weak I wish to give them to someone who will take them who will preserve themThe reason for cultivating the strength Of love wisdom and methodand similarly in an uncreated manner and without apprehending anythingWhy was that tathāgata named AbhāvasamudgataThe tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas definitively know that things which are possible are indeed possibleKāśyapa I shall next give prophecies to these twelve hundred who have mastered themselves and are in my presencesince they avoid any obstacles to virtueHaving perfectly discerned their every word the Bodhisattvas learned understanding of the teachings was at once unimpeded discerning and perfectSince enlightenment is nonapprehensible it follows that this socalled enlightenment is nothing but a mere name or conventional termVenerable Lord How should the transcendent perfection of wisdom be actualizedThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya now emanated an inconceivable adorning array of various jewels on Gṛdhrakūṭa the king of mountains and in its entire environsvenerable SvāgataWhat use is this powerful army with its four divisionsElder replied nanda they do not listen to me I do not know what to doAfter eight or nine months had passed a boy

wards and apprentices happened by and askedif tathāgatas arhats and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers were gathered together in one place andIt is difficult to find a tathāgata We shall become renunciantsNoble son those pores cannot be perceived and they cannot be touchedhow could one possibly apprehend the real nature of omniscience and the restbut they assume and maintain the twelve ascetic virtuesDue to such causes conditions and basesVenerable Lord Will they also attain the excellence of the śrāvakasLord I have heard of a Dharmaworship which surpasses all other worship What is this Dharmaworshiphalf the retinue of the cakravartin numbering eightyfour hundred thousand quintillion beings themselves all became renunciantsHow marvelous How wondrously this body of the Tathāgata is adorned in its complexion and splendor It blazes with glory the marks of buddhahood and clear brilliant radianceI rejoice in those who live in solitude Neither praising themselves nor criticizing othersYou generated the power of diligenceThey went for refuge in the Buddha and the DharmaThey will attain the power of mental retention that is called the convergence of retentionsin front of the Bhagavān they fittingly praised him with these versesContinually maintain pure conduct And before long you will attain the supreme samādhi Yet at the side of the pond was a large kakubha treeBodhisattvas who obtain this samādhi And who always insatiably study itWhoever has such a face must have qualities to match They approached him and askedand after imputing them they become fixated on the psychophysical aggregates that constitute name and formDue to the absolute purity of what is this purity of phenomena not subject to affliction he askedThey do not engage with the notion that physical forms are with signs or that they are signlessBhadrapāla it is like a great celestial spirit accepting offerings of fragrant flowers perfumes incense and flower garlandsthe entry is easyAs this divine rain was falling all the beings who were touched by it felt blissfulThey all want to behold Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta and hear him teach the DharmaThey addressed Mañjuśrī KumārabhutaPracticing such conduct they will seek to obtain that teaching and so they will strive and persistMahauṣadhi then asked Blessed OneSubhūti in the same manner do great bodhisattva beings establish sentient beings many hundreds of billion trillions in number in the transcendent perfection of wisdom but they have not actually established any sentient beings at allHe then embraced Māra the evil one and his demonic retinue with thoughts of love and compassionThe plants bushes herbs and forest trees drink the water in accordance with their strength location and powerWhen they arrived there they cooled the great Avīci hellThe ground at the center of the kings palace should be strewn with flower petals and scented with various fragrancesAnd thus attain limitless eloquence and virtueWhat will you achieve through this manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenmentYou may wonder noble son what these qualities from expertise in investigating origination up through expertise concerning reality may implySubhūti in this precious transcendent perfection there are no phenomena at all that are apprehensible be they virtuous nonvirtuous determinate indeterminate mundane supramundane contaminated uncontaminated conditioned or unconditionedThe monks were crestfallen upset and lost their fearlessnessProstrations to the tathāgata in the World That Is Supremely Noble Buddha King Who Is the Light of Intelligence that Understands AllDirectly to the jinas and their saṅghas of students these actions constitute the fifth root transgressionSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not abide in anything at allAjita I teach that the accumulation of such merit is immeasurable unquantifiableSeeing and recognizing each other they will say to one anotherWhen he attains enlightenment living beings who have harvested the two stores and have planted the roots of virtue will be born in his buddhafieldHer husbands ornaments clothes and crown lie scattered on their bedDo you see Upatiṣya and Kolita or do you see venerable onesHe replied This is owing to the transcendence of all that is achieved by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasHe never loses his wisdom and thereforeI heard extensively from them this samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenagandharvasThey talked with each other and then became silentAnything that is without essential nature is also without defining characteristicsnanda there are four who dwell on and off the path of the four great kingsāriputra this buddha realm is beautifully adorned with displays of the excellences of buddha realms such as the four kinds of jewels namely gold silver beryl and crystalThen as King Glorious Splendor received the teaching on the boundless Dharma from that blessed one he was satisfied and pleasedHow should one view the appropriation of actionFurthermore it is because it comprehends awareness through feelings of pleasure and pain that it is called consciousnessWith trees of the great wealth of the Dharma And fruits of the gnosis of liberationSince all phenomena are connected with the enlightened mindHe came before other bhikṣus and similarly Those who believed in objective truthIt was just like a strong man who grabs a very feeble person by the neck and strangles himBut all those beings were unable to know Those guides in their entirety may I be a guide a leader a liberator a refuge a shelter a support and an assistant for those worldly beings who are blind and lack a guide a protector refuge shelter support and assistanceVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is samenessIt is the abode of all yakṣas and bhūtasAlways acting for the benefit of the worldthis is why you shine here todayAnd millions of residences beds and seats and clothinglet us reveal these profound sacred doctrines to sentient beingsSuch is the sum of smallest particles in a leagueIt is irreproachable in all respects andSons of noble family comeWith your pure mind you are radiant Like the sun at dawnFor the joyful set on perfection to act perfectly is hardNor does the sensory element of consciousness and so forth consider the expanse of realityWhen the bodhisattvas attain These three unsurpassable patiencesSenior Subhūti is it that only great bodhisattva beings who possess and are never separated from this meditative stability will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment or else are there other meditative stabilities through which buddhahood will be attainedAfter the merchants told me these things I said to them It is not right for us to be attached to rākṣasīs in this waythe applications of mindfulness the thorough relinquishmentsMonks every day since the beginning of the Bodhisattvas practice of austerities the village girl Sujātā had offered food to eight hundred priests in the hope that the Bodhisattva would come out of his discipline and hardship and maintain his vital functionsThis bodhisattva is praised by the lord buddhas throughout the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River GangesWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas perfect giving free of disdain consist inHe taught perfectly the spiritual conduct that is good in the beginningO hū phaṭRelease a torrential downpour of ambrosia O LordDo not have any doubt or uncertainty that he was someone elseYoung brahmins this is how I see it and this is my philosophyIt

attributes that portend a death of happy outcomehe could manifest miraculous powersAll you noble ones be attentive I am going to speak infallible wordsand there was no fog or dust in the air Fresh green grass covered the grounds everywhereThe ākyas repliedThen a god from the Heaven Free from Strife approached King uddhodana and spoke to himMañjuśrī these are an omen that the bodhisattva

the world the unsurpassable guide who tames beings the teacher of gods and humans the buddha the bhagavān named Samantaprabhāsathe one without attachment the one who is freeand yet nevertheless dullwittedThus neither the nature of the ultimate nor the nature of the conventional are observed as being of an expressible natureWhen one does not see the mind and the point of reference one then sees realityWhoever finds such ambrosia first he shall share it with the otherThey danced like the shoots of young creepers on a tree blowing in the breeze To stir lust in the prince sitting under the tree branchesOthers tossed their bodies around on the floor as if they were just about to dieIt is the deluded people with childish minds not the wise ones Who mistakenly perceive the body as beautifulHe had the strength of merit and the strength of body The strength of wisdom and the strength of miracles May the bodhisattvas who have the power of compassion The heroes who act in this world to benefit beingsApart from that that world knows of no moonlight or sunlight nor of any light from planets or starsEven though quintillions of māras Come to disturb their mindThe prayer of the tathāgatas is Having followed the path may I make others follow it for enlightenment for it leads to the wisdom of direct perceptionSubhūti it is because those great bodhisattva beings have excellently cultivated the emptiness of the psychophysical aggregates the sensory elements and the sense fields andThey will sink into filth and be overcome with their lust for honorI was bestowing gifts upon religious devotees brahmins the poor the wretched the unfortunate beggars and all the needyone gains mastery with respect to all phenomena and one actualizes all the qualities of a buddha That is why one is referred to as irreversibleSir if you have gone forth who will repay the principle and interest in a timely fashionIt is as if an illusory person were to teach the Dharma to illusory peopleEvil one today you will be held down by the Bodhisattva Like a weak wrestler by a powerful oneHe does not emulate anything other than the real nature of consciousness and the aforementioned aggregatesIs the unending and inconceivable engagement With the wisdom of the buddhas With that they began packing up their householdAnd just as is his positive thought so is his virtuous applicationIn that way they will know the smells of beings Those of men and of women who are far away And by the smells of boys and of girls They will know where they are locatedThey fall from the cloud and remain hereone should offer an oblation in the southwestern quarterJust like the great maṇi jewel the wishfulfilling jewel they accomplish all wishesAbiding on that irreversible levelYou shine with the luster of burnished gold Like the light of the full moonFor innumerable trillions of eons these two holy beings have perfected the roots of virtueWhy is it the joy of the eldest sons Because it brings the attainment of experiencing their fathers wealth the Buddhas wealthIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of tolerance acquire the transcendent perfection of perseveranceWho is there who could repay you Even by striving for many millions of eonsWhen that kind of omen appears at death they will go without impediment to SukhāvatīHow do they pursue the ways for maturing sentient beingsthe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of the kleśas concerning the kleśasHaving gained a fearless confidence in the Dharma taught by the TeacherIt is not on the level of fools Those who remain focused on perceptions and unsurpassed wisdom arose within him At Brahmās request he went to VārāṇasīEventually the venerable Saṅgharakṣita reached a settlement with an ashram where there lived five hundred seersThe Bodhisattva then said My friend this path does not free the mindIn what way is this similar It is because here too things are formed and done by the ripening of past karmic actionsHow so Because they have sharp facultiesBodhisattvas will cause such beings to develop diligencehe thought of his second aspiration prayer from the pastnor have they been conditioned by consciousnessVenerable Lord The emptiness of physical forms is not physical forms and physical forms do not exist elsewhere apart from the emptiness of physical forms This is because the nature of physical forms is also emptiness and emptiness indeed is physical formsthey do not revile noble onesshould be skilled in teaching this samādhiMoreover Kauśika those great bodhisattva beings who have cultivated the mind endowed with omniscience should meditate on the applications of mindfulnesspresented well and explained well to the bodhisattva mahāsattvasThe many kinds of crops That will become green Whatever grows on mountains In ravines forests and dellsno human or nonhuman beings who seek to intrude and cause harm would have a chanceletting them float on water one will surely pacify all and gain victoryUntil one attains accomplishmentThe signs of formative predispositions feelings perceptions mentation suffering longing and mental pain are held to be signs of consciousnessMonks at that moment the gods of the pure realms tried to discourage Māra in sixteen different waysIn your sleep when dreaming did you ever engage in passionate actsWhen the monk Vīradatta heard that the girls suitor intended to kill himThe real nature of the future is the real nature of the Tathāgata andThese are called the four meditative concentrationsnd who were adept in entering the wisdom of the tathāgatas had great wisdomSince at this point I do not apprehend anything at all having considered the inherent existence of all thingsfor it ensures the continuity of the line of the Three JewelsHe had recollection and realization He was disciplined and compassionate and he delighted in correct conductIt is the transcendent perfection of wisdom of great bodhisattva beings through which this is realizedgiver of the supreme boonIf you ask why it is supramundaneOn the very day Saṅgharakṣita was born that same day sons were also born to five hundred merchantsYou are exalted by the splendor of the light of the lamp of knowledge And have cleared all darkness of delusionSuch great bodhisattva beings will exclusively not regress from those superior attributes in the interim until they attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentSo then why today Sun of Speech do you remain indifferentFirst understand the inclinations of these monks and do not confuse priceless sapphires with glass beadsthe ensuing merit would suffice for the manifestation of one among the eighty excellent signsBlessed One on account of the fact that the śrāvakas and solitary buddhas do not have such great compassion nor such expertise in methods The action of repentance antidotal action the power of restraint and the power of supportSister the eye does not come from anywhereThus here and there They come to know the characteristics of space which bears everythingSeeing them they will at that time think That one will go to the foot of a tree And in order to benefit the world and its devas Will attain the highest enlightenment of buddhahoodWhen the Bodhisattva rose from his seat the earth shook in six waysAs a comparison if all those scribes were to become bodhisattvas on the tenth bhūmithat is to say if their only defining characteristic is that they are without defining characteristicsWhen they do not pursue ambitions they strive in what is genuineI will rightly roar the lions roar in the midst of the assemblyor with the emptiness of the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousnessA physician who knows every illness sees the blind man and thinksAll the children who had been born on that very day now slept with their heads toward the seat of awakeningNevertheless Blessed One in order that those noble sons and daughters who revere the Dharma who advance by means of the Dharma and who are suitable vessels for such a profound discourse may create roots of virtue I request that the ThusGone One himself may bless this Dharma teachingMoreover Kauśika the eyes are empty of the eyes and in the same vein the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty are empty of the mental faculty and so forthhow could there possibly be a transcendent perfection of this ethical discipline a transcendent perfection of this tolerance a transcendent perfection of this perseverance a transcendent perfection of this meditative concentration and a transcendent perfection of this wisdomPlease teach it to benefit the bodhisattva great beings of the present as well as the futureVenerable Lord if the notion of fundamental ignorance as permanent is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of fundamental ignorance as impermanent become a bodhisattvaThis divine being is the bodhisattvas revelation of his correct knowledge purified through concentrationThat will stop an opposing armysimilarly the real nature of all causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and the real nature of the Tathāgata are one and the same real nature They are not two but indivisibleLikewise they will think Having received ordination I shall increase enrich and expand all factors of virtueFor actually seeing you has brought me happiness for all my lifetimesI will practice the six transcendent perfections by any means until this great earth is fashioned of blue beryl and strewn with sands of gold I will even refine the buddhafields I will also bring sentient beings to maturityWhat is maintaining patience It is maintaining equanimity and not losing ones patience when others speak badly saying unpleasant wordsYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas thus wish to liberate all beings from all the suffering of existencewhere he mingled perfectly with all buddhas and became inseparable from the comprehension of the realm of phenomenaor do you think that that can subsequently reach omnisciencewill gain twelve hundred qualities of the noseExcellent he saidThey may speak of a lifeforce a soul a man a person a human and a human beingNoble son this is the manner in which the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara miraculously moves around in this Sahā world realmPreviously I wished to become a selfappearing lord and pursue omniscienceNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña in that same way this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma has transcended all the other sūtras taught by the tathāgatas is superior to them and is supreme among themBhikṣus in the southern direction there is the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named kāśapratiṣṭhita andSimilarly O gods this doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of the fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and owing to the attainments up to and including omniscienceThe entire fourfold assembly also rose from their seats and stood with hands together in homage gazing upon the BhagavānWhy is it like that Because such is the nature of lotusesAlas You should once again confess and reject those roots of virtueYour Majesty it is Prince BimbisārasThe ordinand responds I have lived it properly If the ordinand says he has lived the holy life properly the inquirer asks himThey do not engage with the notion that physical forms are calm or that they are not calmpresses his palms together and says Preceptor heed meAfter a time the nāgas caught sight of them and arranged two seats along with two plates of offerings for them The six perfections become fulfilledYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have become skilled in the wisdom of the nonexistent nature of all phenomenaNor does he think so for discipline forbearance diligence or concentrationDivine being moreover the correct knowledge of bodhisattvas is what causes them to assimilate the mind of omnisciencestrewn with coral tree and great coral tree flowersor that all things as far as enlightenment would have an essential nature of nonentityThey will not be released from the cycle of cyclic existence with its five classes of living beingsMañjuśrī thus should the sick bodhisattva consider thingsThe yogin should respectfully Pay homage to her in his mind definitive knowledge of the paths that lead

Maitreya the bodhisattva mahāsattvas physical actions are without malicenot an assemblagemay assume such corporeal forms by which they might act on behalf of sentient beingsbut he would not wish to attack those sentient beings nor would he be agitatedThis is a special quality of the Buddha From the leaders act of speaking in a single voiceThey are ignorantBodhisattvas are physically verbally and mentally pureWhen this chapter on Samantabhadras Encouragement was being taughtWhy is that Because noble son the thusgone ones are profound and hard to fathomneither placed nor unplacedThis teaching illuminates the basic virtues of the bodhisattvas showing how the Bodhisattva descended from the sublime palace in the Heaven of Joy intentionally entered the womb and sojourned in the wombAs they attain the intrinsic nature they are certain to awaken to unsurpassable and complete buddhahoodAwakening is characterized by the realization of emptiness yet emptiness cannot truly realize emptinessYou do not disparage the ignorantRather bodhisattvas minds engage in the process of taking birthThis Great Vehicle apprehends neither the limit of past time nor does it apprehend the limit of future time or the intervening presentThe Blessed One then asked nanda a second timeIn the same vein it is instructive because all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are unseenThe vinaya of the hearers clarifies ones own mind streamIf you ask why Subhūti the transcendent perfection of wisdom has no listeners or viewersHis body regains its former strength magnificence and splendorOne should use these one after the other over two daysand similarly they give drink clothing garlands incense unguents homes lodgings lamps and so on up to and including medicinesmany thousands of lotuses rose up into the sky from within the oceanswhen there are tathāgatas who maintain the three miracles and teach the doctrine to sentient beingsThrough the higher cognitions they gain the knowledge of the minds and conduct of all beings in the past the future and the presentwhile the hearers meditation on the truths does not involve consideration When the harem heard those words They were all perplexedhe required some milkIn the same vein why do you say that these remaining designations made with respect to the eyes up to and including their designation as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattvaThe ordinand first prostrates to the Teacher then three times to each monkWhen practicing generosity by relinquishing male and female slaves staff and workersowing to the fact that all those other attributes up to and including buddhahood are voidThese gods further embellished the jeweled structure that had delighted the BodhisattvaIs there a being who is able to comprehend this sūtra jewel and attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodThe Blessed One now drew forth his tongue and with his tongue he covered his entire faceneither an object of thinking nor not an object of thinkingLike the sun or the full moon Surrounded by starsThey will attain the power of mental retention that is called expertise in all soundsHe should unite with her and place the semen and blood obtained from this in the fold of a leaf or suchāradvatīputra do you think that physical forms constitute a bodhisattvaSo today he will conquer Māra and become a worthy one with the ten powersTerrified he thinkswhat happens if a son or daughter of noble family should hear just a little of this teachingwhen they practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomIn this way even if he strove for merit he would be unable to genuinely follow a meritorious pathHis higher knowledge was flawless and his five types of superknowledge were fully manifestA person who has traversed the five signs the eight flavors Or the eight levels and has thus become clairvoyant Has fully relinquished the action sealHowever the emptiness of inherent existence will neither disintegrate nor will it endure and nor will it go awayOne should meditate on the thencederived pleasureThe eight right modes are a cause of purificationSubhūti it is because those sublime individuals themselves partake of the establishment of the fruits while others do notWhen you eliminate the cause of formations there is no passing on Consciousness arises dependent on passing onthe samādhi named Creating Infinite Light Raysit is because indications are afflictive The bodhisattvas established in retentionIt is the conduct of those established in enlightenment And it also terrifies the army of the mārasBut Upāli when you speak perfectly the praises of the Buddha the Dharma and the SaṅghaThe aspiration to enlightenment And the other dharmas that lead to nirvāṇaNārāyaṇa just like the space element pervades everything that has material formplaced his begging bowl in the crook of his left arm and nestled his monks staff in the crook of his right armWho illuminates countless realms The Bhagavān the lion of men set forth xxxiAnd give her things according to needThose who indulge in the afflictions create the realms of beings and have the

SvāhaThe eloquence of bodhisattvas is timely in the sense that they avoid saying too early what should be said later or saying too late what should have been said earlierAll those shortcomings ensue from monks placing two novices togetherVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThey said Holy One Wellborn One who brings happiness to the world May you swiftly become awakened and lead beings to immortalityAnd with the union of the vajra and the lotusI rejoice in those who give away their own bodies With joyful minds for the sake of beingsMoreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible would thinkSon do you think I dont know where you want to goHearing them all the Bodhisattvas sleepiness vanishesBlissful One they

vowholders who have been consecrated Through the empowerment based upon the activities of ripening Which is taught in the supreme tantras Should please the sacred one with giftsWe are speaking words of truth And you know our aspirationYou have realized that the nature of phenomena is selfless And that though you bring beings to liberation there is no such liberation When they encountered the emanation the monks asked himThis is because the self is absolutely pureand even if he were to praise this Dharma teaching uninterruptedly day and nightThose are the practice of the seminal dropHe says Oh I was so stupid before in not believing what was taught to me not accepting what was saidand to perceive the gateways to liberation with a sense of familiarityI also saw the stūpa of the relics of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna and paid homage to itThe sufferings of saṃsāra will not afflict their bodiesVenerable Lord Just as when a carpenter or the skilled apprentice of a carpenter makes a machine in the shape of a woman or in the shape of a man or in the shape of an elephant or in the shape of a bull although this machine may function according to its purpose it does not think I am performing such and such a task according to that purposeThey are  they dwell in the dwelling of the Buddha  their meditation is nondwellingThe gatekeeper went inside as they askedSome cast sidelong glances at the Bodhisattvathe stride that leads to a happy rebirthThen the mahāśrāvakas departed to their own buddha realmsSubhūti these great bodhisattva beings are without doubt without hesitation and without indecision regarding all the languages sounds terms explanations and statements employed by sentient beingsA network of roots including latent formations Was burned up by the intense fire of wisdomHence he knows the mentalities and latent tendencies of the beings now present in my great assemblyThinking She will be pleased if I tell her what Ive doneKāśyapa you should see the result that is the undefiled liberation of all hearers and solitary buddhas who rely on reference points as being just like the single grain that the small insect carried off to eatThe fire offering should be performed A total of  times with the peaceful ritualShe saw how thin the Bodhisattva had become and it appeared as if he had diedwill not think them and will not conceive of them for he does not truly observe them emptiness of nonapprehensionWhere can a family with the qualities described by this holy being be found Pondering this

the wise Attain the unimpeded inconceivable buddha speech That has sixty aspects iWhen they saw that they approached the Bhagavān and bowed their heads to the Bhagavāns feetIt is what benefits both self and othersThe Blessed One was residing at Gayāśīrṣa Hill in the Gayā region together with a great saṅgha of seventytwo thousand monksand similarly just as the notion of nonliberation with respect to their aggregate of liberation is without foundationWhen they saw him they made vast offerings And stood before him with palms placed together vhaving strict control of their body and giving up all forms of bodily misbehaviorNor should they abide in the notion that the aggregates from physical forms up to and including consciousness are calmakras Brahmās and Brahmakāyika devas will wish to come to them so as to see them pay homage to them honor them and listen to the DharmaThese are the bodhisattvas ten masteriesThey speak words that are entirely meaningful without speaking meaninglesslyand

mistreated though visible to all creaturesTheir wisdom increases Like an ocean into which rivers flow Lion cubs descended from the snow mountainsOne who is without fixation on anything will reach the transcendent perfection of wisdomit is because both the things whereby they would find an opportunity to impinge upon them and the things upon which they would find an opportunity to impinge are without inherent existenceNow if he has seen pure water on his way and himself drunk from it and bathed in it he can respondthe bodily form of a sixteenyearold andPlaced at any doorstep it will

characteristics of phenomenaThis level is not reached by śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas let alone any adversary of the DharmaSimilarly nonarising noncessation nonaffliction nonpurification and nonconditioning are nonapprehensible owing to their utter purityThere are seventytwo thousand housesMañjuśrī within the nature of the realm of phenomena neither the relative nor the ultimate can be observedI then pondered what must be absent for grasping not to occur and what must cease for grasping to ceaseThe world will be named SuviśuddhāAll those shortcomings ensue from the monks allowing the going forth of those without handsattain distinction with regard to virtuous attributesThis is the time for cultivating the meditative stabilities of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessnessThere will be pure radiant namesandform That have that characteristic I myself will never speak about anyone in a defamatory way order someone to speak so or rejoice in anyone being

was aware that right then the time had come for him to leave homeAt this vision of the magnificent miracle effected by the supernatural power of the Lord Buddha the entire host was ecstatic enraptured

whatever direction Is teaching the Dharma with compassionate altruism In the midst of a śrāvaka saṅgha that is looking at himJust so the buddhaqualities do not grow in living beings certainly destined for the uncreated but do grow in those living beings who are like swamps and mud banks of passionsLikewise they will not become fixated on the four applications of mindfulnessIf you ask what constitute the nine serial steps of meditative equipoiseReverend the Blessed One has saidIt is such a beautiful lightAnd various beautiful realms were revealedThe tathāgatas of earlier times who were arhats and fully awakened buddhas accomplished the deeds of a tathāgata That is to sayNor do they consider at all the one who dispenses these gifts the one to whom they are dispensed and the gifts that are dispensedI grant instantaneously the accomplishment of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa there is no doubtHe is not obtained not obtainableThe Blessed One the Great Vajra Holder glanced at the nāga kings and repliedwhen he caught sight of them he asked Gentlemen why do you sit indifferent when a small caravan of traders is approachingWith such accomplishments their conduct and personal associations are excellentSon of noble family you can think of the accumulations of generosity and discipline as analogous to a mustard seed and the accumulation of learning as having the size of Mount Meru king of

cultivating those sacred doctrines and without earnestly applying them will turn out like thatTo make him return thereEmit the sound of the supreme drum By relating the nature of this DharmaSo noble son it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by myself in this worldevery last one of them fades away every last one of them dwindles awayNoble one if this world realm of a thousand million worlds were to be filled with yakṣas and rākṣasasWhen recognizing the works of the māras they are free from evilthese defilements come to an end without leaving any residueThe community of people who lived in that hilly fastness are none other than the five hundred merchantsand so they indulge in notions of I and mine and also become fixated upon them It is taught in words but it is not the mode

return once Ive eatenThere will then be in succession A full five hundred guides Supreme humans jinas With the same name SamantaprabhaThey themselves have few ailments and they are free from dust and stainsThey send out clouds of vast offerings that unstintingly fill up all endless appearances with a rain of precious mundane and supramundane qualitiesWhat is the use of designations It is worldly usageThen in the area of ones navelYet it is taught that it is not of such an essence Rather it is held to be composed of momentsAlternatively Mahauṣadhi fire is produced through the friction of two sticks being rubbed against each otherSubhūti if Māra or a man conjured up by the evil Māra were to approach great bodhisattva beings while they are reading aloud and reciting the most extensive discourses taught by the tathāgatasExcellent principal Vajra HolderI said Great brahmin if you are asking for two steps I will give you three nanda if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to extensively describe genuinely demonstrate and so forth these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to othersThe life of a being passes quickly Like a lightning bolt in the sky or a mountain streamO child of enlightened heritage it is because the lord buddhas who reside and are present teaching the sacred doctrine in the innumerable countless and immeasurable world systems of the ten directions surrounded by their monastic communities of fully ordained monks will proclaim the names and clans of these great bodhisattva beings while teaching the sacred doctrine and uttering their aphorismsthe six transcendent perfections the four meditative concentrations the four immeasurable aspirationswhat do you think king of godsMonk all phenomena lack existence their very essence is like a mirageThese hairs are fragrant and black so I shall make them grow on my head againthese actualize the fruit of arhatshipbut he is not intellectThey will smell the scents of the bodies of boys and girlsJust as a king does not leave the place Where he was consecrated by his kinfolk For a duration of seven days Since that is the duty of kingsThey praise the Buddha The lion of the ākyas the protector Then the sublime vajra song which is the realization of the vajra yoginīs welcomes the one who thoroughly accomplishes existenceThis level of those who are wise Is not within the field of experience of the foolish and only think of pleasureThe power of faith is a gateway to the light of the DharmaThey remember one eon and they remember a hundred eons a thousand eonsYou are free from form and numberBodhisattvas should view all kinds of demonic conduct within the mental processes yetWho bathes therein becomes immaculateHe saw

known such bliss as during these seven days and seven nights because of being close to the ThusGone Ones bodyWhat then are the genuine bodhisattva practices and what are the aspects of a bodhisattvas trainingthe abiding of phenomena in the real nature reality the expanse of reality maturity with respect to all things the real nature the unmistaken real nature the inalienable real nature and the finality of existenceThen with respect to accomplishing my activity I requested the Blessed One to bless me with his explanationThen the lord will grant the eight great siddhisBecause they will remain in happiness and meditation They will be protected by millions of beingsmay I cause all beings to perfect the mark of a great being who has the finest sense of taste gods from the realm of Māra who were born there because of their former virtuous actions  gods from the realm of BrahmāThus without any doubts or reservations about these matters bodhisattvas have trust in the teachings on the principle of the various waysIt is the observing mind that goes forth takes vows and becomes a monkHe is the essence that is the reality of sensationNot giving rise to the twelve limbs of existence means no birthAnd place this sūtra upon their head You should hold such people to be irreversibleIt is the unsurpassed transcendent perfection It is the highest transcendent perfectionThe ordinand

foodTheir mouth is compactIf a preceptor or an instructor has served out a probation or a repeat probationThe Tathāgata using a skillful method teaches three yānas to those beingsVenerable Lord if the sensory element of the eyes is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes become a bodhisattvaBut water that is not real cannot be drunk Know that all phenomena are like that in the same vein how could this illusory person attain emancipation in omniscience after training in the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathThey neither associate physical forms with the limit of past time nor do they disassociate them therefromand was preparing to beg alms in rāvastī with the ascetic attendant novice in towYet he supreme among gods can accept all offeringsMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings have donned the great armor and abide with a mind endowed with omniscience they do not permit the development of any other mindsets namely those of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasSimilarly consciousness and all the other aggregates are neither fettered nor liberated because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are voidAt the chakra of the Secret Guardian of Blissthere was no darkness within him he perfectly embodied all that is wholesomeand skilled in the differences

bodhisattva mahāsattvas dedicate all the accumulations of roots of virtue that they have created through their body speech and mind to supreme perfect enlightenmentThe natures of ignorance and knowledge are the sameIn this way moreover ākyamuni purified two hundred thousand million buddha realms in each direction in order to create space for the tathāgatas who were coming and arrivingI have

disdain the perfect giving of respect the perfect giving of reverence and worship the perfect openended giving and the perfectly pure givingBodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara opened all his poresVenerable Lord if the notion of fundamental ignorance as calm is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of fundamental ignorance as not calm become a bodhisattvaBecause ultimately space is utterly unrealThey emanate within the illusory absorption and attain the great displaySimilarly how should they train in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationLook at us Our faces are like the moon and like fresh lotus flowersThis is the circumstance and the reason why the Bodhisattva attended school even though he was already so learnedThe Blessed One replied As an analogy Mahauṣadhi a gentle flow of water among rocks pierces the very mountain and springs forth from itMoreover their birth among such people becomes an excellent condition that leads to a further increase growth and expansion of excellent conditionsThe beautiful jewel lattices she sees in her sleep are brokenAnd have extremely beautiful bodies Where did they come fromThey follow the example of my supreme conduct These children of mine practice free from worldly gatheringsThey have even soles and palms They are supremely bright and are seen as pureOnce you are there you can free yourself

forests for ascetic practice and templesTaking off his crown sword and shoes The king made salutations to the prince with his palms joined above his headadorned with verandas domes architraves skylights cool pavillions multiple stories and courtyardsIn fact it is called attaining acceptance because there is no involvement with any phenomenaand lets fall rain equally everywhere on the plants bushes herbs and forest trees and satisfies them with waterYou are a guide endowed with many methodsWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas skill in dispelling lingering regrets consist inIt is born of the abandonment of all evil qualities and of the gathering of all good qualitiesand similarly exhibit himself reborn among the priestly class standing out like a tall sāl tree they do not degenerate in their perseverance  they do not degenerate in their recollectionThe bodhisattva Vyūharāja surveyed the wide earth and repliedNoble son bodhisattvas do not seek acquisition in ways that cause physical or mental harmNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas scatter crush and destroy the mountain peaks of sentient beings arrogant prideI ask that you reverend accept charge of me as a novice for as long as I liveBlessed One what is an accumulation What is a heapYour Majesty banish them from the land And then the Dharma will remain for a long time The wisdom vision of bodhisattvas

keep the preceptsAll these things arise dependently from causesUltimately they have no such discriminative constructions and no such conceptualizations Therefore such views have themselves the nature of cessationThese noble ones do not live by relying upon either devas or humansYour master is never wrongāradvatīputra do you think that the ten powers of the tathāgatas are one thing and that illusions are anotherThus physical forms are themselves omniscienceDivine son understanding this utter signlessness is awakeningSenior āradvatīputra those sentient beings who actualize the impact of past actions through body speech and mind motivated by erroneous views have experienced the ripening of past actions corresponding to the roots of their particular volitions This causes the materializations of the sense field of sights which the denizens of the hells the animal domain the world of Yama the gods and humans possessThose born into the Pāṇḍava family have confused their genealogyYoung man how do bodhisattva mahāsattvas obtain the treasure of the DharmaIt causes the bodhisattva mahāsattvas to attain the highest complete enlightenmentIn just the same way the element of consciousness which lacks form makes manifest the six types of form bodiesI ask that the venerable and compassionate saṅgha in their compassion extend their compassion to meThen he had an idea These ascetic sons of the ākya are more easygoing but my brethren are badtemperedAs such they honor venerate respect and make offerings to the doctrines of the transcendent perfection of wisdomIt was because I had this in mind that you declared When all phenomena are not originating and not seen one will penetrate flawless realityThe future itself is also the nature of spaceāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as void or not void constitute a bodhisattvato cognize future nonarising is stainlessLord I am indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illnessThey should determine that there is no mental wandering whatsoever with respect to anythingthe samādhi named BlazingThey will be reborn among the hell realms the animal realms or in the world of the Lord of DeathSimilarly why would they have a view concerning the ten powers of the tathāgatas and in the same vein why would they have a view concerning the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThey do not think or ponderEmptiness is not other than consciousness nor is consciousness other than emptinessHe is immutable like the king of mountains with a body like the rising sunWhen the leaves or the ripe fruits of a big tree fall off they lose their lusterThinking that he saw they would be drawn by conductBlessed One what is the color of beings that dwell in hellit is an immense repository of omniscient pristine cognition that tames the minds of sentient beings Wherever this discourse on moral conduct is located or taught the spirits act as its protectorsare the very acts that cause a bodhisattva great being to awaken to unexcelled and completely perfect buddhahood without perfectly awakening Is that correctFriends whoever joins his palms in respect to this Dharma teaching of The Play in Full will attain eight supreme attributesThey will perfect the dharmas of the BuddhaNoble ones in order to bestow upon you this Dharma teachingOn one occasion a caravan of merchants set out from Magadha for Kosala with an armed escortWhat is relying upon excellent beings It is not being apart from a buddhaOn the relative level wrong view is a gateway to all sufferingBeyond that they do not have any aspirationsas he provides all the necessities for achieving happinessthe purity of all other attributes up to and including enlightenmentTiṣya was delighted and in his delight thoughtThe Dharma thus benefits the world constantly Satiating the entire world with DharmaApasmāra resembles a jackalSarvapāpahantrī She Who Slays All SinsProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha Greatly HandsomeAll these are free of hindrance impediment or obscurationFree of pride and with a humble attitude they go to collect refuse rags of the worst kind clothes that no one would wearand after attaining the path of cultivation will be tied to one more rebirth wearing down attachment to the world system of desire and to maliceVenerable nanda replied the elder monksSaṅgharakṣita descended and they secured their waresTerli ā terli ārecognition of the suffering in impermanence recognition of the selflessness of suffering recognition of aversion to foodFor two hundred million eons They did not fall into the lower existences the transcendence of generosity which is consummated in peacefulnessI can assure you that your efforts to ridicule me will make you feel useless hurt and in pain for a long timeBhagavān what is the name of this Dharma discoursethen Bhagavān we also would have been liberated in that DharmaSubsequently the monk Vīradatta returned to the city of Vijaya in order to beg for alms and again he went to the merchants home in order to beg for almsand joined the Buddhas renunciant order they quickly became disappointed and visibly upsetMoreover Subhūti physical forms are pure and similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are pure owing to the purity of sentient beings living organisms living creatures and so forth up to knowers and viewersāradvatīputra just as when someone afflicted by intense heat perceives various miragelike images moving in the manner of waves but does not become fixated on the notion that this mirage is actually waterand took their place to one sideAt the time of striking one should add the mantra Make the ḍākinīs and the rest go awayTerrifying him with a sword and a nooseThese two are  attachment and  anger Noble son these two factors cause beings to fall into the hell realmsthe throne radiated the sounds of hundreds of thousands of jeweled bellsThe bodhisattva rīgarbha declaredThere is the meditative stability named Unmodifiednot being weary of remaining in cyclic existence because of and for the sake of sentient beingsThose fine parks were beautiful clean and free of any stones pebbles

andUnending merit unending perfect aspiration unending unhindered eloquence and unending merit and wisdomOne should add the mantra Bring such and such to the state of enthrallmentThey do not attach importance to the applications of mindfulnessI would not even be born in the buddhafields where buddhas emergeWhy is that It is because they do not see that phenomenon they do not perceive that phenomenonBodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the BhagavatIn the same vein he does not emulate any other attributes and attainments up to and including omnisciencePrajñāpāramitā tooDivine being

always see the Buddha listen to the Dharma and serve the SaṅghaThe demons will be destroyedFor the sake of its swift attainment of awakeningWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas aspiration not to rely on others consist inand they will not bring ruin upon anyone at allIt possesses form and the substances that are tasted also possess formof the transcendence of effort consummated in initiative toward enlightenmentNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities are similar to windWhen they were all freed from that obscuration of karmaUpāli when you speak of these things perfectlyit is because they are all nonapprehensible and where could that which is nonapprehensible abideThis āriputra is how a tathāgata sees I am the father of these beingsTook rebirth sixty times in the Avīci hell the pot burst openIf there were an incalculable immeasurable treasure Filled with the seven precious jewelsbut the tathāgatas attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of all their defining characteristicsthe irreversible great bodhisattva beingstoo saw the bhikṣu they also were instantly established in irreversible progress toward the highest enlightenmentThe objects of enjoyment lead to much suffering and harmFreed from pain and happy he taught the Dharmaknows what is light knows what is weightywhich never decrease although all the poor and wretched may partake of them to their satisfactionAt the Bodhi tree itself there were four deities Veṇu Valgu Sumanas and OjopatiIf the Bhagavān will give me an opportunity to seek answers to themLord of the nāgas if one utters these four aphorisms of the Dharma in uttering them one is expressing all  articles of the DharmaMoreover Subhūti the irreversible great bodhisattva beings who always have their minds set on enlightenmentNoble one a woman who has four qualities will obtain The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in her hands Life is always passing and never stays It passes as quickly as a mountain streamhow do they recollect former livesIf you ask what constitute the ten powers of the tathāgatasThe postulant responds I am a malethe samādhi named Seeing the Ten DirectionsIn each of his pores there are a hundred thousand samādhisThe Blessed One in order to benefit his kinsmen and the local people was residing in the parks of King uddhodhana in the city of Kapilavastu parks adorned with many hundreds

tree had not left the Bodhisattvas bodythey investigate all things in that mannerThe bodhisattvas and gods having heard the Bodhisattva explain the attributes of the pure family and the pure mother thought to themselvesWhen anyone enters into union with this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom as it has been revealed for just a few dayssome will attain pratyekabuddhahoodwherever anyone

worldAt the time of absorption in cessation there is neither darkness nor lightSubhūti if even when he speaks such words the bodhisattvas are undisturbed and undistracted thinking in additionāradvatīputra those who with a mind free from conceptualization dispense generosityMañjuśrī what is the family of the tathāgatasHe should not delight those women Laughingly asking after their

SamādhiLet this perfect speech be heard through the instruments in a pleasant soundand utterly unrealHe will satisfy the world with its gods and humans through the doctrineMañjuśrī at that time there appeared a monk called Vīradatta He practiced all that is contained in the Buddhas teaching of moral conductAnd offered to you all of their airborne palacesindeed they have vanished entirelyBodhisattva Mahāsattva Kṣitigarbhathey would have much greater merit than those who establish sentient beings in those fruitsTheir kingdoms will always be happy In the same way Mañjuśrī we say empty empty as an entrance to inexpressible empty thingsThen the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thoughtYou will no longer continue in saṃsāraWhen the hundred million beings heard this answer from the buddhasThe same refrain should be applied to all phenomena as it has been indicated here in the context of the transcendent perfectionsāradvatīputra just as the presence of unconditioned elements in conditioned

doubts from their heartsvenerable NadīkāśyapaHe picked it up and sitting on his seat in the crosslegged position he held it with his left hand and strung it with a single fingertip of his right handWell then how is itThey also say to himand three thousand received the prophecies of their attainment of the highest complete enlightenmentNoble son it is like this As a comparison if all the women men boys and girls in the four great continentsIt is when the ThusGone One turns this wheel that he is called a thusgone oneAll the gods prostrate to youEvery sound in that world was heard as

complete enlightenmentAnd Hārītī with her children and retinue of servants also teaches itYoung man this king of samādhis the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaGive with faultless intention and devotion A faultless vessel to the ThusGone One Who is faultless in discipline and conductSimilarly the real nature of all things is also not the past not the future and not the presentWe are forever led by forceThen the Licchavi Vimalakīrti taught these beginner bodhisattvas a teaching that enabled them to attain the five superknowledgestIn the world system called Free from Negative Forms of Existence abides the Tathāgata called Pacifier of All Negative Forms of ExistenceThe king then said to the banditsthey can demonstrate such miraculous emanationsEven the basket in which the precious gemstone of the god realms is kept is endowed with its positive attributesTossing mandārava blossoms toward the Bhagavān Youthful Mañjuśrī and the monk Stainless LightWith their encouragement the novice ward went to where his preceptor used his miraculous powers to disappear and waitedIt illuminated in those buddha realms the stūpas made of precious materials that contained the relics of the buddha bhagavāns who had passed into nirvāṇaThus all you human beings in the ocean of saṃsāra Be afraid and long for liberationMore essential than the essence supremeNoble ones I also shall go before the Bhagavān and see your teacherWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent power of unshakable blessings consist inThis was taught and translated by the Indian scholars Jinamitra Dānaśīla and Munivarman and the translatoreditor Yesh D who proofed and finalized the translationIt is never going to the side of the kleśas Does the Jina teach this samādhi The continuity of the royal lineage which has endured so long Would become interruptedthey are at peace perfectly at peace thoroughly at peaceAnd they then achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration where even that sense of bliss is abandoned and neither suffering nor bliss is present because blissful and unhappy states of mind have both previously subsided while equanimity and mindfulness are utterly pureWith his achievement he understoodYet other sentient beings engage in positive physical verbal and mental conductdeclared that if any monk who has the same training as other monksperceiving the actual absence of formations is an obscuration That which I terrified request of you It is a request that is worthy to be fulfilledWith manifest faith in the teaching of the ThusGone One they exclaimedSince he is neither taken aback nor stirred When seeing this wild and fierce army So hideous and frighteningit does not think I am acting according to a certain purposeIf you are you uncertain unsure or undecided thinking that it was someone else who at that time on that occasion made an offering to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Meghadundubhisvararāja and gave him those eightyfour thousand bowls noble one do not have such a viewWe have never before heard such an extensive prophecy for bodhisattvas let alone for the śrāvakasāradvatīputra just as a mirage is without foundationFulfill your promise And act in the interest of the host of godsOne hundred vyavasthānaprajñaptis is called a hetuhilaAnd at death they will be reborn in the realm of Brahmā Those are the benefits of maintaining patience Noble son why are you astonishedThe view of I and mine is a cause of afflictionHow is it O Vajrapāṇi that the buddhas the blessed ones the teachers of the three worlds neither arise nor ceasenanda those in the past who became tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas alsohe addressed the bhikṣusThe authentic awareness of belief and liberation is nonattachmentIt is the single teaching It is not abandoning correct knowing and seeingand they do not consider anything as an entity or as a signAll those assembled Between body hairs in the bodys vital spots Or at the openings of wounds Are also brought forth by the noose incantationThe seal of nonreturning bodhisattvas is to hear this Dharma teachingis the supreme extraction of bloodAn innumerable countless number of sentient beings passed away from the three inferior realmsThose who follow the Dharma Will be the ones who listens to this sūtra will all put an end to suffering and fully and completely awaken to unsurpassable truly perfect enlightenmentAnd any maliciousness Toward other bodhisattvas He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the four supports for miraculous abilityTightly embracing the wisdomThrough great love to protect beingsand ask questions and counterquestionsWhere are his allies Why do you fear himand similarly they do not consider the transcendent perfection of wisdom and so forth as an entity or as a signand she never heard anything even slightly unpleasantWhen the Victors Son the Great Being settled in his mothers wombForms are empty by themselves In the same way they do not tell themselves that feelings perceptions formations or consciousness are emptyUpāli in the presence of the follower of another tīrthika order speak the Buddhas praises perfectlyVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the four assurancesNor does the fire element think I digest whatever the body eats drinks chews or tastesIf they so wish bodhisattvas may bless a trichiliocosm to be filled with the seven precious substancesYour virtue is without increase or decreaseāradvatīputra just as the notion of an illusory person practicing the ten powers of the tathāgatas is without foundationAre you not a threat to the king Have you not worked to harm the kingThey understand that giving up unwholesome company involves giving up the company of people whose discipline has degeneratedThe purity of self is the purity of all sentient beings The purity of all sentient beings is nondual not divided into twoThe prophecy declares that all phenomena are devoid of abidingWe have performed the role of teacher for our fatherSince the end of life is death I do not concern myself with deathSubhūti all things are indeed inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forthhave honored the lord buddhas in other buddhafieldsThen Senior Subhūti addressed these divine princes as followsIn the world system called Lotus Excellence abides the Tathāgata the Arhat the truly perfect Buddha called Lotus BornYou may wonder noble son how bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to subsidiary afflictions thorough afflictions and complete afflictionsAt all times he has been purifying his own buddha realmand in the same vein when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in order that they might abandon their views up to and including their view concerning the promulgation of the doctrinal wheelI entrust it to you I present it to you and I pass it on to youwith eight facets and very fine craftsmanshipWhere there are no physical forms no feelings no perceptions no formative predispositions and no consciousnessVenerable Lord Inasmuch as all things are naturally pure what are the attributes of great bodhisattva beings that should be refinedcarrying as many vessels made of gold from the river Jāmbū and adorned with all sorts of jewels as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā and extending to the end of spaceI performed immeasurable acts of generosityWith this king of mantras one should perform the preliminary ritualProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha ākyamuniWith the intention to liberate sentient beings I have often given beggars my house wealth grains beds clothes and parksNext they both take the material for the lower robe in their hands and the ordinand saysO There is nothing at all that is subject to cessation or birth aging death reprimand rebuke cutting piercing injury killing or bondageYour Majesty I would be delighted to see your son SarvārthasiddhaYet it is impossible that the one who has set out To benefit the world with a firm resolve Should rise from the foot of the great tree Before he attains awakeningThese are called the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasLikewise This is toleranceIn the court of Sañjaya He Who Is Born by MenSuch is the bodhisattvas perfect openended givingthe voice of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas endowed with its sixty aspects does envelop the countless innumerable worlds of the ten directionsHe is the one who is bound with a stainless headband of liberation great wisdom and nonattachmentThis is called the supramundane gift of the sacred doctrineThen the Bhagavān who had known what the youth Candraprabha would request addressed these lines of verse to himWhen not involved in the latent tendencies for covetousness and ill will they are irreproachableVenerable nanda it is when bodhisattvas do not grasp any phenomenawhether inner or outer virtuous or unvirtuous conditioned or unconditionedthat they receive a prophecySubhūti that which is equal to the unequaledwho desires memory should not have excessive prideYou are not dwelling in the aggregates The bases or the entrancesbared one shoulder and kneeling on his right knee and facing Bhagavat Viśvabhū placed his palms together and addressed these words to himIt would be wrong for you not to sleep with meIt is like jewels for those wishing for wealthI have trained in the perfect path to awakeninginasmuch as they are attentive to mental images of sentient beings and so forth they do not actually dedicate these roots of virtue to their unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment andAt that past time when I was practicing bodhisattva conduct I was King ūradattaall the ākya youths tried pulling the bow with all their strength but they were unable to string it let alone draw itThe Bhagavān asked Monk what do you thinkthey were unstained by any of the worldly concernsSubhūti then saidThese are the eight great merits that one will attainentered the absorption called the origination of all worldly wheels and emanated rays of light from the pores of his bodythe inconceivably numerous elucidations concerning teaching the compositeFather Mother it is difficult to find the appearance of a buddha bhagavān andThis concludes the thirteenth chapter on encouragementNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten such qualities quickly awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahoodSons of noble family not only was the name of the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni pronounced in this buddha realmThen the various statues in the temple all returned to their seats and spoke these verseslike magical illusions clouds and lightningBy applying this to the place struck by the poisonous fangs Or by drinking it one will neutralize the poisonVenerable Lord Is the transcendent perfection of generosity mundane or is it supramundaneThere are no females appearing there And there are absolutely no qualities of deceptionKauśika great bodhisattva beings who have acquired the transcendent perfection of wisdom owing to their skillful meansThey possess miracles wisdom and learning And for many millions of eons have practiced with knowledgeHe will be fearful at death go to the lower realmsit wanders to and apprehends material objectshow to remove this fatigueDo not disbelieve me I am reminding you of my firm resolveThey paid homage to the Buddha the Dharma and the SaṅghaThe markings on their palms and soles blaze with splendoryet it possesses no limbs or any other body partsand the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of existents concerning purification Those are the fourThe round water disk from ba Is said to be the cessation of mental activityWhat are the four They are desires clinging to desires longing for desires and pursuing desiresVenerable Lord would great bodhisattva beings not then engage or identify with erroneous viewsIf one were to ask why Venerable Lord it is because afflicted mental states would be indicatedtNārāyaṇa bodhisattvas should abide in these four in the following wayHe practiced the seven forms of generosity and engaged in the five types of action that create meritāradvatīputra this is the maturity of a great bodhisattva beingnot actingcan perceive that which is insubstantial as something substantialthat he fails to sit on his Dharma seat to speak of the Dharmaand then act on behalf of those sentient beings they do not hanker for themWhen united in the union of exquisite blissSome of them wore garlands of human fingers that they had cut off and strung togethernanda all the blessed buddhas in the past present and future have blessed without blessing this Dharma teachingIn a lavish ceremony Tiṣya took ārikā as his brideThe interior of the eyeball is like a water bubbleOne should regard a noble one who spreads this teaching as a thusgone one and perform worship exactly as one would for a thusgone onewhat kind of teaching does he intend to giveIf it is so that the bodhisattva the spiritual hero has no mental attachment and gives away all his possessionsBut tell me elder have you attained the state of arhatYoung man how do bodhisattva mahāsattvas know the nature of all phenomenacould remember his previous lives had the confidence of speechOne should grind the root of winter cherry together with downy datura and mix it with freshly churned buffalo butterpieces of flesh veinsI will rightly roar the lions roar in the midst of the assemblyAre unable to destroy this body of yours Wise one do not perform this illusion today viIn possessing just one verseand teach it extensively to others will become the subject of offerings from all beingsBut divine being since I have not attained or relinquished anything what sort of knowledge could I reveal All phenomena have no characteristics are devoid of characteristics They all have no characteristics and are pure of characteristicsto be without hypocrisyDifficult to know and difficult to see For such beings bodhisattvas will seek any means to rouse them from their condition and so they will teach them the Dharma accordinglyWhat is being openhanded It is having a virtuous natureLikewise feelings perceptions formations and consciousness are not brought to an end by emptinessFurthermore for a minister forcing somebody to give up the Dharma whether this entails the instructions on the śrāvakas definitive deliverance the instructions on the pratyekabuddhas definite deliverance or the instructions on the definite deliverance of the omniscient one as well as creating obstacles for the teachings or concealing them these constitute the third root transgressionYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of the individual What are the four kinds of knowledge of the individualto hold a view of annihilation or of permanence to grasp things as being empty permanent or impermanentāradvatīputra it is to that extent that great bodhisattva beings are said to abide in the Great VehicleMonk the import is what I need What good is a lengthy explanationHe has genuinely transcended the desire realm and therefore he is called the one who crossed the swamp of desirethe best the most excellent offeringThen at that time the bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs the upāsakas and upāsikāsfree from the six entrancesHe learned this samādhi and having learned it he understood itThe Buddha has not taughtIt supported heavenly lion thrones with hanging garlands of jewels cloth and flowers and was suffused with the sound of divine bellsJñānārcimat and Jñānābhyudgata Vighuṣṭajñāna and likewise Jñānaśūra You who have been a witness to my Dharma treasure Teach it so that it will be of benefit to beings When the chapter The Past of Bhaiṣajyarāja was taughtBlessed One we will remember your kindness and will not be ungrateful or have regrets laterSo it is Subhūti that this transcendent perfection of wisdom gives rise to the tathāgatas and instructs the worlds of sentient beings And whose superior motivation is never shaken That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind Therefore children of noble family in order to accumulate great insight you should study this very mantra and its manual of practiceand he has previously heard numerous accounts of the great DharmaO Bhagavān where does birth come fromthen searched for his preceptor among the denizens of Avīci the Great Hell of Unrelenting Torment he was nowhere to be seenPassing through the opening of the penis inside the bhaga of the womanclearly understands the Dharma of the nobles ones and by thus acquiring such right knowledge sees the Buddha the body of the unsurpassable Dharmachant it meditate on it with unadulterated meditationwent before the Blessed OneShould the king become agitated the monk should praise him saying Your Majesty thanks to you the disciplined welltrained and learned monks and brahmins of this land are free from oppression by savages and monkeys This is indeed a great fortuneGreat bodhisattva beings do not deliberately follow the path that leads to perfect enlightenment for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment except for the sake of the emptiness of inherent existenceAnd filled with joy I said to those protectors Supreme great rishis you speak meaningfully You should regard the appearance of the tathāgatas and their parinirvāṇa in the same wayUntil I have attained precious awakening The supreme level of immortality beyond old age and dyingwhich is as I have said before that they will attain purified eyes nose ears tongue body and mindThey will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in omniscience that is neither fettered nor liberatedAt the end of an eon when the great trichiliocosm is destroyedThey had acquired an aspiration to be reborn in the infinite buddhafieldsThe buddhas have concealed the great fruition in every instanceIs it possible to calculate the end the furthest extent of those worldsI will practice the six transcendent perfections until the master of sentient beings is none other than the unrivalled king of the sacred doctrine the tathāgata arhat and genuinely perfect buddhaso if people who dwell in their teaching utter themambara Bala Vemacitra and Rāhu Together with an entourage of thousands of asura maidensSubsequently they all saw a hundred thousand quintillion buddhas honored themAll phenomena are completely bereft of all defilements and thus undefiledThis world is tormented By sounds sensations tastes forms and smellsImagine that Brahmā as lord of a great billionfold universe extended love throughout that billionfold universeAll the animals should be released and then rounded up againThese conditioned phenomena know no remainingLike a mirage and similar to a cloudwho understands this number with the exception of me and perhaps one like me namely a bodhisattva in his final existence who has departed from the householdThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya was aware of his own doubt and uncertainty and knew in his own mind the thoughts that were in the minds of hundreds of thousands of quintillions of other bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in eight Ganges RiversSuch as the factor of the spirit of enlightenment and so forthSome showed their arms which had been rubbed with perfumeburn or make another person burn flog or make another person flogThe supreme highest Dharma that the protector of the world Taught while he was seated upon a single seatTheir bodies are suppleHow does their consciousness undergo transfer without any piercingThey do not consider whether physical forms constitute a self or a nonselfThis transmission of all tantrasBhagavān elucidate for us In what way you ripened these bodhisattvasnanda it is because those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritageSince even the noble listeners solitary realizers And bodhisattvas as wellMoreover because they are free of dullness they do not lose heart when things do not work out as they wished or when they are lacking material meansSubhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist had conjured up a large gathering of peopleIf one eats the leaf of water spinach ones semen will increaseHow is it not discontinuous It is not discontinuous because a sprout is not born from a seed that has already ceased nor from a seed that has not yet ceased Rather like the beam of a scale tilting from up to down a sprout is born precisely when the seed has ceasedProtector please fulfill my wish todaySubhūti if you ask what constitutes the refinement of the extrasensory power realizing knowledge of divine clairaudience which great bodhisattva beings haveThat touchable things are not touched is the lack of reference pointThey injure their own minds and they also intend to injure the minds of othersOne should intently pay attention there With the mind focused onepointedly on pleasureNevertheless reverend āriputra just as one cannot smell the castor plant in a magnolia wood but only the magnolia flowersVenerable Lord If the systematic presentation of the fruits takes place dependent on the relative truthWithout any error the truth is nothing else than thisThey will accomplish the inconceivable Dharma of the BuddhaI never had any clinging arise in my mindHow should they train in the refinement of the buddhafieldsThrough their retention they are fearless in upholding and teaching the meaning of what they have heardHis mind merciless and forsaking all thought of future liveslikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are without aspirationsThe eye unguent of the king of snakes The remedy of bad eyes the blood known as the flowerThis is the transcendent perfection of wisdom possessed by great bodhisattva beings skillful in practicing the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationguide an innumerable immeasurable inconceivable number of sentient beings to enlightenmentfrom physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions consciousness conditioned phenomena unconditioned phenomenalikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are emptyit can fly through the sky and transform itself This king of horses is known as BālāhakaSome had their heads hands or feet turned backward or their eyes facing backwardFor numerous countless endless eons For some beings he will manifest in the form attire and conduct of a monk for others in various other forms and attires including that of a girl and he will teach the Dharmaand in the same vein the transcendence of all the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas is always without fearAs for the yoginī ViśvavajrīMonks in this way the Bodhisattva sat upon a grand lion throne with these qualities and spoke to the great gathering of godsand afterward brings beings to nirvāṇa through a single yānaWith your beautiful voice endowed with eight aspects you said This birth of mine will bring an end to birth and death Providing for the guru with a higher motivation Doing all that he has told one to doI have no protectorFor the sake of many beings for the benefit of many beings for the happiness of many beings and with compassion for the worldThe lord buddhas who reside in the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Gangesall their trees with divine clothes and then cover them in nets of gems and jewels shining in all possible waysVenerable Lord those great bodhisattva beings do not practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomBodhisattvas serve the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅghathe Bodhisattva Mahāsattva NityodyuktaIn order to make offerings to the Tathāgata who had passed into nirvāṇaThey make assumptions on account of that wisdom and so forthMoreover Subhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom reveals to the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas that the world is calm and empty of inherent existenceLord of Secrets that is excellent Great Bodhisattva that is excellentthey do not engage with physical forms and they do not engage with feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessHe thus saw that sentient beings were grouped into three categoriesWhat ten qualities nanda I adhered to the teaching of the qualities of moral conduct and so I quickly realized supreme perfect enlightenment and became a buddhaThose who yearn for women have

miraclesSuch is the ripening of these heroes Who are always in a state of meditation Similarly they should determine that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are emptyWhen those who are bound within the caste system hear his teaching correct meditative stabilitySimilarly the purity of phenomena is profound due to the absolute purity of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessThe secret nosetip is the means tantraand because the emptiness of inherent existence is consciousness and the emptiness of inherent existence is all the attributes and attainments up to and including unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentSubhūti if the adamantine pristine cognition of great bodhisattva beings were an entity and not a nonentityWhen my son was born the world was lit as if by the gold of the rising sunHe has the power to know how one enters various types of worlds ThereforeYet I will attain that imperishable state venerated by the wise The state that brings ultimate happiness to the animate and inanimate worldsand as they shone they completely illuminated the world systems of the great trichiliocosmwhenever they do not engage with the notions that all attainments up to and including omniscience are permanent or that they are impermanent and that all fruitional attributes up to and including the five eyes are pure or that they are impureHe sees in his dream a light shining forth That clears away the deep darkness of the worldThough this put a stop to that the hermaphrodite did not lingerOffering ones eyes represents the

hot season the rainy season autumn or winterIf you allow going forth without consulting them a serious breach occursexhibit indefatigability relentlessness and tenacity I too will act in the way that the wise ones The guides of the world have describedInstead they will now control those phenomena that constitute a bodyThe one who knows that phenomena Have the nature of dreams and illusions Are without an essence like a plantain tree And are the same as echoesHe may follow the ways of the disciples yet he lets living beings hear the teaching they have not heard beforeI too find wrong views unpleasant I do not wish for them do not like them and do not enjoy them ThereforeThis is the true application of the diligence of the bodhisattva mahāsattvasBoth tathāgatas could be seen seated in the center of the great precious stūpa that remained suspended in the airBhagavat if those kinds of things appear just because someone thinks of the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets DisplayIt is wrong to assume that the prince returned here Before having attained awakeningBy the merit of praising you Most Eminent of Speakers who gave eyes to the worldThose beings sat before Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and requested himThe kiṃnaras contemplate in that wayOnce born there she will make offerings to an innumerable immeasurable inconceivable number of buddhasthe young man Candraprabha recited these verses to the Bhagavānand adorned by a parasol banners and flagsand some are completely filled with divine flowersAnd they were to take great joy in that Then they would not be trained in the Buddhas wisdom You are right Great Being you are rightārikā dreamed that a man carrying a torch rent and entered her belly She climbed to a mountain peakAs the nature of conceptions is known There will be no conceptions When combined with these six ignorance sees hears smells tastes feels and cogitatesMoreover Subhūti there are great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and who are absolutely intent on this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom but who have not accepted that phenomena are nonarisingAnd the minds that offer incense do not exist The concordant patience they have is of lesser kind I do not immediately teach them the wisdom of omniscienceIf you ask what is the understanding of all phenomena it is the partial understanding of selflessness with respect to personal identity that śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas acquire with reference to the twelve sense fields

he replied what would you have said to meThen one who wishes to be victorious in all skirmishes fights arguments dissensions and battles against opposing armies and enemies should first worship a large shrineUpon seeing this they prostrated to the Bodhisattva and were filled with joy devotion and wellbeingIf the Blessed One declared that I am first among those who wear the monks mantle standard then who is thisThey should hang silken flagsIf you ask why it is because if they were to dwell thereon they would vacillateBy the syllable a is expressed The unfabricated innate natureNo Venerable Lord āradvatīputra do you think that the designation of sights as a self or not a self constitutes a bodhisattvaThe emergence of the form of cloud Is the sign for birth the syllable ain

abode into anotherYou will suffer disastrously Children come here Come outyou should see that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is nonexistentcontinuing in the same vein as far as the designation of the sensory element of mental consciousness as entities or nonentities constitute a bodhisattvaNevertheless I did reach a genuine understanding on my ownRipening sentient beings is a gateway to the light of the Dharmahaving in the above manner committed it to writing compiled it as a book and then honored revered and respected it with flowers garlands unguents powders butter lamps incense

bimba fruitThere were grounds covered in blue beryl that reflected all the many fine features of the palaceThis is not appropriate others replied King Sumitra does indeed have these qualities Yet he is extremely aged so he does not even possess the ability to produce a sondo the thusgone ones prefer the vast or the inferiorsimilarly that the remaining designations made with respect to the other links of dependent origination up to and including the designation of aging and death as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattvathe inconceivably numerous words of boundlessness concerning the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous words of boundlessness concerning purification Those are the fourMahāsthāmaprāpta whenever that bodhisattva mahāsattva saw a bhikṣu or bhikṣunī an upāsaka or upasikā he would come before them and saythinking These actions follow me just as I follow themthey will become irreversibly set on supreme and perfect enlightenment without regressingBut none of them either are ever realMañjuśrī this nonperception of all dharmas is their samenessGiving away wealth grains and stores represents the bodhisattvas filling of the treasury of the sacred

and the vajra yoginīs are accomplishedthen great bodhisattva beings would indeed not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in omniscienceIt was the prayer of this Guide While he practiced in his previous livesBlessed One how do bodhisattvas live as mendicants how do they remain on a single seat and how do they abstain from late mealsEveryone must be on high alert First shut all doors then lock them tight And place door bolts firmly across the door panelsTherefore monks you too should train so that you come to argue for karmaA persons corpse is borne on a bier carried by four men and taken to the charnel ground where it is burned never to be seen againO Vajrapāṇi do the buddhas the blessed ones go to the realm of bliss after they relinquish the dharma bodyThat is to say they dispense food and drink to those who need food and drink and so onI purify and dispel them examine them and cast them outMy path going against the stream is profoundthen the Blessed One spoke well when he said nanda awakening is attained through diligence They do not maintain discipline based on the form realmWith the water of the absorption that occurs while abiding by insight bodhisattvas similarly moisten the savage minds of sentient beings thereby thoroughly pacifying the dust of affliction in themVenerable Lord Those who would don this armor for the sake of sentient beings actually seek to strive struggle and make efforts for the sake of spacethey will be joyful and experience happiness and pleasureand they will be dedicated to this Dharma teachingMañjuśrī it is like this just

of the bodhisattvas and the finality of existence are uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned If you ask why it is because these unconditioned phenomena up to and including the finality of existence are absolutely nonapprehensibleto take what is not delightful to be delightful to take what is not the path to be the pathThrough these dissimilar words The highest of Dharma is taught the whole assembly including the bodhisattva kāśagarbha and others were overjoyed andThose bodhisattva mahāsattvas should dedicate that generosity through four prayers of dedicationUltimately they accomplish

this transcendent perfection of wisdom are the three vehicles taught without apprehending anythingPhenomena are also naturally like that In that way there will be no attachment in any kind of activity They will also be established in the protective sacred doctrineThus they muster a diligence that upholds all the qualities of the Buddha and gives up all negative and unvirtuous qualitiesThus engaging in such conduct May I who am known as MaitreyaHas in an instant been broken into pieces Like a flower garland held by a woman Noble son when the sun shines all sorts of agricultural activities become

exclaimed Venerables this retired devotee claims he has taken up these signifiers on his ownlikewise they do not consider whether the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty are with signs or signlessAbandoning the five senseobjectsdo not have that view Why is thatit is the understanding that one will not subsequently be reborn among the living beings of phenomenal existenceflower garlands

Complete Absence of DoubtNone of the diseases or harm in the world will affect them at allIndeed they have not conceptualized the ethical discipline of the lord buddhas of the past future and present nor their meditative stability wisdom liberation or perception of liberating pristine cognitionhear this teaching concerning individuals who abandon the sacred doctrine and defame the sacred doctrineBounteously grants every accomplishmentSimilarly other posited subjects from sentient beings and living creatures to knowers and viewers are all nonapprehensiblethey stand on water just like they would on the groundThe removing of poison the removing of diseasethe thirtyseven aspects of enlightenmentIf the Bhagavān considers the time has comeand he was reborn among the gods in the realms of the Four Great Kingsthen this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its gods humans and antigods HoweverWhen they think accordingly this is called the tolerance that understands phenomenaThe shape of their bodies is that of a crocodileThis is the noose empowermentHe appeared to be adorned with ornaments yet always was endowed with the auspicious signs and marksNeedless to mention then that they also know the blessings of other beingsin which they had produced the roots of virtue by serving five hundred buddhas for the sake of perfect enlightenmentand likewise too that individual enlightenment is discernedLike the element of space he does not abide in any of the four elementsthe unconditioned phenomena up to and including the finality of existence are without the nature of the finality of existence and the aforementioned and It is the practice of the teaching of the lions roar It originates from the supreme wisdom of buddhahoodas well as the world with its gods humans asuras and gandharvas all rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed OneIf the Blessed One was the first selfordained one in this world this

beings in existence Venerable Lord How may reversible bodhisattvas be called irreversibleAll around for sixteen leagues Mansions are formedMay you quell those tormented by the fires of afflictionsBodhisattvas recognize this by the power of genuine insightThus noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are like the moon recollection of the Saṅghavenerable MahākātyāyanaSupreme in this worldSo too will they also see The other wellknown mountains and the oceansBodhisattvas do not have limited aspirations based on meager accumulations for awakeningSo it is O gods that because the tathāgatas attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of defining characteristics in all thingsSo please teach the lofty and excellent good DharmaEntering

directions but I have obtained an excellent benefit Through my renunciation of this purulent body I shall attain the excellent buddha body which is of the nature of indestructible realityHow should they train in the four assurances and how should they train in the four unhindered discernmentsThe Buddha to whom humans and devas made offerings Had appeared within the domain of King Mahābalasentient beings will have great desire anger and ignoranceand in what way may the other transcendent perfections up to and including wisdom when dedicated toward omniscience be styled as the

meaningNot knowing the wickedness of existence One cannot know this restraint of the body They do not observe the precepts of the sūtras and the vinayaAt that time the bhagavān tathāgata ākyamunis emanations as other tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas who had arrived from a hundred thousand quintillion world realms were teaching beings in other worldsWhen the Blessed Buddha had done so he saw the Tāthagatas entourage to be smallAnd enjoy them out of compassion for usA wishfulfilling jewel named Varada provides light in that placeThat state is free from desiresBy calling him by his name and worshipping him one will be completely liberated from all defilementsWhoever wishes to gain accomplishment Must know the stages Of killing the burnt offering and the suppression ritualVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom genuinely displays the essential nature of all things because it is the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom has precedence over all branches of enlightenment It is the wisdom of the tathāgatas  It is having the preeminence of a buddhaSimilarly not even minor negativities will stick to bodhisattvasThe man through employing that skillful method brought those children out from the burning houseHence when this is the case one maintains the conduct of a bodhisattvaThrough these words of truth May food be transformed into ambrosiait is unproducedBlessed one please teach me the Dharma and by any means I will learn it and thereby dispel the darkness of wrong views of misguided beings with faulty views becoming myself a teacher of the Dharma of the genuine viewEven if all beings possessed the amount of merit of a wheelbearing monarch or akra or Brahmā it would not be on a par with thisFirst is the practice of the development stage Related to the vase initiationthe state of mind which discerns that all things are empty of their own defining characteristicsOn its petals starting from the east one should draw the great yakṣiṇīs Candrakāntī and so forthThe strength of ten fearsome elephants is the same as the strength of one elephant akin to a female elephantand then accomplish the sphere of the infinity of consciousness and maintain itMonks last nightand the inconceivably numerous words of innumerability concerning purification Those are the fourThe sight of

entered the yoga of meditation through an inconceivable dhyānaBut after it has produced a body if it is endowed with wellproportioned limbs is provided with the particular food facilities possessions and clothing that ensures its wellbeing and if the person becomes rich with jewels gold and silverSo listen now to learn about these actions Acknowledge the kindness done to youViśeṣamativenerable āriputra together with the world of gods humans asuras and gandharvasArm yourselves Carry in your hands weapons Swords and lances bows and arrows and twopointed spearsWhen they cultivate comprehend

wayThe wise ones will think They are all my teachers And they will have toward them the respect one has for a guruis also inexhaustibleListen all of you this is my own rightful sonbut they do indeed develop great compassion at all times for the sake of all sentient beingsYoung man if in that way you wish for this samādhi and wish to attain quickly the highestBy any means I should swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and teach them the sacred doctrines that all things are impermanent imbued with suffering and without a self and that nirvāṇa is peacea woman adorned with ornamentsAll vicious ones will have nowhere to remainMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings lacking the roots of virtuous actionWhen he finds just a little food he is delighted and overjoyedUpatiṣya went to Kolita and saidThis youth Candraprabha Has praised the Buddha with unequaled joyWhile seizing crocodiles and other aquatic creatures from the oceanVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is the emptiness of external and internal phenomenaShe pervades the entire Egg of Brahmā the animate and inanimateNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities pursue virtuous deedsThis shaking of the world Is the miracle of the bodhisattvaO Vākya Homage to youThe thirteen

one with perfect mindfulness mode of thinking and intellectHe dwelt in the mountain caves of mental stability complete liberation absorption and deep meditationAs they caught sight of one another they exclaimedThey too displayed those same types of supernatural powers by manifesting many tathāgatas sitting on their lion thrones expounding the Dharma throughout the world systems of the east south west and northI was the principal kingThose who meditate that these phenomena are empty Constantly radiate ten billion light raysThey experience the physical happiness of which the noble ones say To possess mindfulness and remain in happiness is equanimityWhen the bodhisattva great beings each looked through their meditative absorption they saw that they had never moved from this Sahā worldMoreover āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings analyze this same physical body in terms of its material elementsThe guides are seated upon lion thrones At the foot of no fewer than millions of treesStrung upon the lion throne were strings of divine precious bells from which came clear beautiful gentle soundsthe characteristic of future mind is that it has not yet occurredfevers which last a

yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragasIt is the memory of previous rebirths It is being free from doubt concerning the ripening of karmaIn the same vein they should not abide in the sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of phenomenaThe bodhisattva great being noble Avalokiteśvara then saidUpon bandhūka flowers The karavīraholderIt is without ideation because it is free of mind thought or consciousnessSo in order to guard the Bodhisattva even more he erected a perimeter wall around the palace dug trenchesThe ministers saidNor does such a person reflect on the

gazing upon the Bhagavān with wonder amazement and joyhow should a bodhisattva console another bodhisattva who is sickThey have become a light to all the multitudes of beings And they have no fear of the lower existences and what I should do but I was totally in the darkThe levels of higher cognitions Of the protector bodhisattvas are taughtThe bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin and all the other bodhisattvas then proceeded to Gayā and Gayāśīrṣa Hillseeing with a genuine mind of enlightenment the array of the tathāgatas emanations he fully recognized the nature of this teaching and attained patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as nonarisingAfter calling out three times they set out upon the ocean in pursuit of richesTherefore Lord I am indeed reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illnessHowever Bhagavān the poor man then becomes frightened terrified and alarmedand relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is attainedwhen confronted by a buddhafield adorned with the splendor of all noble qualitiesMasters the little we seek we seek because of youThey are protected by devas They have the thirtytwo primary signsMoreover

solitary place Awakening Mañjuśrī is without outflows and without clingingIf someone were surrounded By terrifying malevolent wild beasts with sharp fangsGreat bodhisattva beings do indeed practice the sacred doctrine and its profunditiesIt is the accomplishment of dhyāna It is not savoring dhyānaDivine princes the self too is like a dream like a magical displayIt is exclusively the eightfold path of the noble ones This is the path that starts with correct view and ends with correct concentrationEmptiness is the supreme Dwelling of the great beingsThey have no substance like a bubble of water or foamHow should they train in the path of the bodhisattvas whereby those who have trained therein investigate the modalities of all phenomenaThey should not make assumptions on account of sights and similarly they should not make assumptions on account of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomenaThe wise know that they are without thought Are devoid of thought and that there is no objectYour Majesty There is no human no descendant of Manu to be found Who goes to the next world when his time has come to an endWhen they experience the lifeforces most basic feelingUpatiṣya replied SañjayinThey had perfected them all They had perfected the samādhi stainlessHaving transcended the levels of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhasThese qualities of the Sugata are immeasurable They are the supreme humans perfection of qualitiesNoble son when bodhisattvas step into the center of a gathering they are free of fears and anxietiesMahākāśyapaThe Blessed One is endowed with inconspicuous ankle boneswhen they do not make assumptions on account of consciousness and the restIf you ask what world it reveals to be inconceivableSo surely without being taught by others He will attain omniscienceArrange the fleshes and so forth on itNoble son that which accords with the intrinsic nature is rationalfollowing the same procedures as described previously will accomplish all the rituals described previouslyexpounding analyzing and elucidating them and demonstrating the drawbacks of their experiences as well as genuine emancipationOn the relative level diligence is a gateway to realizationThis āriputra is my Dharma seal That I teach today at this later timeVenerable Lord if the notion of the sensory element of the eyes as void is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes as not void become a bodhisattvaāriputra if you have no aspiration for this What could be said for the other śrāvakas of mineSimilarly I should cultivate the thirtyseven aspects of enlightenmentAs soon as the Blessed One thusgone one the foedestroyer the completely perfect Buddha Immaculately Renowned King appeared there the woods were instantaneously

in the last of the third Place the syllable iAfter twentyone days one will be able to enthrall an eminent personThe same applies to all the other sensory elements starting from the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousnessBhaiṣajyarāja those noble men or noble women will have prayed to many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddhasVenerable Lord Similarly it is dependent on these great bodhisattva beings that the fruit of entering the stream is discernedThey comprise the notion of self the notion of others and the notion of the act of givingA central awning hung above and there were two red cushions placed upon itthe four assurances and all other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasit trembled strongly and it trembled intenselyhave not conceptualized the generosity which they have dispensedAfter seeing the village he entered a park at the edge of the fieldsIn future times beings will be confused And having heard this single yāna of mineHe is a light unto all sentient beingsNo Blessed One it would notThere were  sons born to the ākya houseA thousand times more bodhisattva mahāsattvas than that attained the power of retentionWith that knowledge they give up such origination and conditioningIn the same vein is this mind of the bodhisattvas unattached to sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomenaThis is the abiding nature of all thingsBlessed One you have mentioned how it all happened and yet it is simply beyond mesome of the bodhisattvas emanated forth jewel trees complete with flowers and fruits and perfect in their height and circumferenceNot grasping at the ear andnot to stray from the qualities of an ascetic or from having few possessionsWe wish to see his honored personfreedom from obscurations and their eruptions due to having a pure stream of beingThe transfer should be considered to resemble the transfer of the deceaseds consciousnessto wish for wealth and honor to be attached to ones family line to be attached to casteWithout their own form going there Such is the nature of phenomena Bhadrapāla it is in just the same way that the element of consciousness is not observed as form and does not manifest as formsyād yathedam dhire dhidhire balinirghoṣe balisvare

being birth as an animal or birth in the world of the Lord of DeathMade infinite offerings to jinas throughout eons xxxviThen those hundreds of millions of quintillions of bodhisattvas who had emerged from out of the ground as numerous as the atoms in a world realm placed their hands together in homage and said to the BhagavānHaving drawn this on birch bark One should wear it on ones upper armSixty times a hundred thousand devas and human beingsIndeed they will not actualize those gateways to liberation which by means of actualization would cause them to regress to the levels of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhasHe approached his monastic companions and said I have neglected my moral conduct As I am no longer an ordained devotee I shall fall into the great hell realmssome are made of emeraldsThen the ThusGone One out of respect to the thusgone ones of the pastHearing this venerable Subhūti asked the monksThe guard stationed there said Brahmin dwarf you cant enterInspiration is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for with it the mind is divested of impuritiesto scrutinize phenomenaAnd having caught them with the hook of desire They establish them in the buddhaThe same goes for the sensory element of sights and the other nonexistent sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental phenomenaBecause of being excited with great passionthe one who has gone beyond the world the light of the world and the one transcending the world beings to the level of BrahmāThus they are definitively destined to make irreversible progressMonks you might think that the juniper berries of that time were larger than now but that is not the case They were just as they are nowYour Majesty from my guru I have received a few teachingshe left the great city of Vārāṇasī Next he went to MagadhaThey will never sustain themselves through wrong livelihoodMoreover Subhūti the great armor of great bodhisattva beings entails the refinement of the six extrasensory powersOn the contrary that view would be impossible for themNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña that bodhisattva mahāsattva will attain that kind of development of knowledgethey are said to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdomNevertheless through the coming together of the elements of earth water fire wind space and season the sprout forms as the seed is ceasingand how excellent is the training of the TathāgataOnce he had instructed his father and those in the retinue He instantly returned to the supreme cityAnd from all the pores of their skin arose a perfume like that of the trees that grow in the universe SarvagandhasugandhāIts nonobservation is the two form buddha bodiesClearly in this world today There will be the appearance of a buddhaIf you ask why O child of enlightened heritage it is because unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and those other fruits are without desire and are not an object of desireand wish to attain quickly the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood should be skillful in methodsI answer him by saying There is an afterlifeEvil māra when a bodhisattva receives the prophecy numerous sentient beings will arouse the mind aimed at unexcelled and perfect awakeningmany hundreds of thousands of living beings conceived the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentare knowersWhen this sūtra was taught Through the blessing of the TeacherAvoid all crowds without exception And always delight in solitudeFool What do you knowWill be very youthful and handsome Similarly they establish them in the fruit of entering the stream and in the other fruits up to an including individual enlightenmentall causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas will emerge in the worldThe one who abandons form sound smell Taste and touch is one who protects the teaching Whoever disregards That speech of the Sage so eloquently uttered Will have his oldest son Eliminated by Brahmās nooseand it bears a gold victory bannerWhen avoiding what should not be done they are irreproachableLikewise ten thousand mares and ten thousand colts headed by Kaṇṭhaka were bornSimilarly when the beings who are lost in the wild of cyclic existence see a bodhisattvaNoble son there will be beings who do not worship this Dharma teaching who do not memorize itIf they do not perfect the transcendent perfection of wisdomThen at that time the Bhagavān gave a detailed Dharma teaching on purifying the great higher cognition of all phenomena by chanting the following extensive verses to the youth CandraprabhaEven the smallest feeling is said to be accompanied by cravingThey hold all the extensive pure qualities of buddhafields and possess all intentionsNoble sirs how does the Tathāgata Gandhottamakūṭa teach his DharmaBodhisattvas are free from strife With abundant patience they bring joy to sentient beingsHe is extremely skilled in full expressions and in the reconciliation of dichotomiesmay I engage in the conduct of the bodhisattvasor slaughter dismember flog and tear apart every last being on this earth with the edge of a cakra bladeberylHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of desireHis face was as calm as the sphere of the moonThey should also praise and rejoice in others who are equipoised in the meditative stabilities of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessnessLikewise so long will the understanding of all phenomena and the understanding of the aspects of the path emerge in the worldAs coral shoots spring forth on the mountaintopsHe whose consciousness pursues signs is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in signsIn this regard the inconspicuousness of his ankle bones means that being endowed with broad heels he is also endowed with inconspicuous ankle bones unlike those of other human beingsI will see him performing his recitation As he stays alone in the forest and mountainsAbiding on the level of HayagrīvaSubhūti this constitutes the refinement of the extrasensory power of great bodhisattva beings that realizes the knowledge of the minds of othersWhenever someone is practicing diligently The result will swiftly be attained within a single lifeWhen the great kings Radiant with glory and splendor had thus departed The omniscient teacher Floated up suspended in spaceSpreads throughout the ten directions So too does the aroma of the dharmabhāṇaka You are not depressed but intrepid joyous and hard to dominateAlthough the monks confessed their wrongs as wrong the actions came to fruition causing them to resemble mortars and pestles Elder Mahākāśyapa if equipoised in the eight liberations without transcending the eight perverse paths you can enter the sameness of reality by means of the sameness of perversityThe one linked to the first syllable is united with hrīḥYou gave him your fine and beautiful tusks and did not relinquish your disciplineSo it is that the purity of physical forms andthinking I have committed a horrific deed I have committed an inexpiable deed I have indulged in pleasure and moreover I have caused a man to die What kind of creature am I What will I become in a future life I will fall into the hell realmsWithout moving from one given buddha realm they worship and venerate the thusgone ones in numerous buddha realmsAs an analogy nanda the riches and enjoyments of beings in the realm of the Utterly Purifying buddhafield will be on a par with those of the gods in the Joyous HeavenThis is not a worthy place others replied This king was born into a family with wrong viewsyou know that the priests who are skilled in making predictions as well as the gods who have definite knowledgeEnlightenment is neither somewhere nor nowhere abiding in no location or dimensionthe bodhisattva will not covet any of itReceive this with great reverenceNoble son those sentient beings who hear this Dharma teaching and do not doubt it will be reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī after they die and pass from this worldLikewise they may speak of the sense sources of the ear nose tongue body and mindAgain it is said Hair tonsured and body clad in robes From the Tathāgatas call to come forth That moment their senses were perfectly stilledRelatively they produce emanations by means of wisdomHe wished happiness and the peace of accomplishment for the worldThereupon the Bhagavān in order to explain this topicExcellently favored in this way they also attain omniscience without regressing to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhasThey have no illness They are bhikṣus They are free from all bondageTens of thousands Of trillions of bodhisattvas All filled with astonishment Are looking at the supreme humanAnd may there be glory surrounding youTaught the supreme Dharma of that teaching During the entirety of eighty intermediate eons If for some reason You should travel to the north May the constellations in that direction Protect youShow the path to blind beingsthe inconceivably numerous accumulations of eloquence concerning the kleśasYou have put it excellentlyMañjuśrī the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddhascalding their bodies and inflicting unbearable pain that caused them to cry out pitifullyand of flowers incense perfume garlands ointments aromatic powders clothing parasols banners and flagsBhikṣus at that time the airborne palaces of the Brahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds in the southeast became very beautiful bright radiant glorious and majesticIn this way they observe the activities of all sentient beingsand if that person is inspired and comes and if they listen for just a momentAs bodhisattvas regard all sentient beings equally bodhisattvas would not dismiss even a few sentient beingsthe dedication is made without engaging in the dualistic attitude that differentiates the subject who makes the dedication and the object to whom the dedication is madeWhat the priest Asita predicted shall come truespangled upper garments andIt is the accomplishment of the Buddha the accomplishment of the Dharma and the accomplishment of the Saṅgha It is the accomplishment of Brahmā the accomplishment of Indra the accomplishment of the guardians of the world and the accomplishment of śvara It is the accomplishment of the truth the accomplishment of the path and the accomplishment of dependent origination It is the accomplishment of the moon the sun the planets and the starsOr like a garuḍa devouring a nāga or an elephant catching a lionHis aim is to turn the great wheel of Dharma and utter the lions great roarI must cultivate the pathIn the degenerated age whoever wishes To tame those sentient beings that are difficult to tameBecause he is a bodhisattva mahāsattva who has accepted the fact that all phenomena are unproducedStanding before the Bodhisattva they pondered what his thoughts might be as they looked at his faceand they do not maintain the maturity of the bodhisattvasWhen one does not dwell with the dharmas one does not come into existence or go out of existencegreat bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom do discern that phenomena are like a dream and so forth and that they are like a phantomIn this world it will remain only for a while Here it will spread to some places but not to othersOther bodhisattva mahāsattvas as numerous as the atoms in a world realm of a thousand worlds heard this Dharma teaching and attained unimpeded eloquencenanda if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to establish as many sentient beings as there are in all the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges in the fruit of entering the streamnot to mention the sentient beings of Jambudvīpa and similarly not to mention the sentient beings of the four continents not to mention the sentient beings of the world systems of a chiliocosm not to mention the sentient beings of the world systems of a dichiliocosm and nanda not to mention the sentient beings of the world systems of a great trichiliocosmFriends here is a descendent of a great royal clan He has abandoned his kingdom of a universal monarch and now he turns his mind to a dusty ragHe is like the water because he is purified of evil and always has pure thoughts and stainless body and mindDominating all the multitudes just as Sumeru the king of mountains looms high over the oceans the Lord Buddha shone radiated and glittered as he sat upon his magnificent lionthroneThen throw it in the water using this mantra Oṃ caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hūṃ phaṭthe great bodhisattva being Maitreya and all the remaining great bodhisattva beings rejoicedGentlemen he replied as I am not at liberty to do as I please you should put your request to my preceptortheir sense faculties from the sense organ of the eyes to the sense organ of the body will never be deficientI will never again fall under the power of the arising of wicked thoughtsThe tathāgatas do not speak even a single syllableThen both men and gods who subscribed to the Disciple Vehicle thoughtMay all your wishes be fulfilledMahāsthāmaprāpta do not have such a viewThis king of mantras duly recited can accomplish all endeavorsnanda the buddhafield of that tathāgata arhat perfectly complete Buddha He Who Proclaims the Lions Roar of Conduct That is Renowned to be the Lotus of Good QualitiesHowever one who lives among created things in the mines of passions without seeing any truth is indeed capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentHe is the one with a voice that satisfies because it is in accord with the languages of all sentient beingsFree of all logic it is no object of analysisSimilarly it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena and to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities that the applications of mindfulness are nonexistent and nonapprehensibleThat you have made this request to meas well as their wisdom ethical discipline liberationNow as the ten months had been completed he emerged from his mothers right side fully aware and mindfulthe body is miserable but should not encourage him to find solace in liberationlord of the Sahā World surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of gods approached the Bodhisattva carrying a drop of the vital force of the divine realmsBodhisattvas do not give oral teachings while their minds are involved in negative projectsWhen you were dwelling in the Heaven of Joy you taught the Dharma liberallyBrother Gayākāśyapa Brother āriputraBhagavat how is that soAll pregnant women birthed their babies with comfort and easeVenerable Lord for these reasons great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not abide in the transcendent perfections from the transcendent perfection of generosity up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomThis is noble son the reason that bodhisattvas wear refuse ragsSimilarly after attaining manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment they reveal to sentient beings the sacred doctrine that physical forms neither arise nor cease and that they are neither defiled nor purifiedYou will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animalsNot grasping at the body andAnd they adorn this realm With endless adornments With stable power and steadfast exertion they truly practice the transcendences and gradually accomplish the buddha qualitiesForm is form aloneAll people stopped their workTo sentient beings who are attached to grasping at a self and grasping at phenomena they teach the path of no self and emptinessAlthough the tree died you remained remembering its kindness The king of gods saw your virtues and rejoicedthey enfold such beings with love andVenerable Lord Are those great bodhisattva beings who have first begun to set their mind on enlightenment said to be stableExtremely ferocious yakṣas live there Who are gnawing on human corpseswho worships it with a pure motivation writes it down commissions it to be writtenSubhūti great bodhisattva beings reveal to sentient beings who have gone astray on mistaken paths or who are bound for inferior realms the

that irreversible levelBhaiṣajyarāja those noble men or noble women will have served a full hundred thousand quintillion buddhasthat overwhelms ones audience ones words will be acceptedEnough with this disputewithout voice without placeHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of distractionYou will bring sentient beings to maturity in such a way that all of them from the lowliest among

others Saying After me it will be Just as I have taught to all the worldTo the younger monks they should show their appreciation and in their presence remain standingand the aged man having taught them an appropriate Dharma returned to his homeThey may speak with words about the Dharma But do not believe it showing their anger and aggressionDivine son the vinaya that is well known in the three worlds is the vinaya of the hearersin which case they are sanctioned as followsseven states of great depletion seven hundred states of depletionBlessed One I request you to dispel their remorseOrnament the king of horses and bring it bedecked to meand then they should also praise and rejoice in others who are equipoised in the attitude of loving kindnessThey who have this supreme samādhi in their hands I prophesy will have unending understanding And like the kind Jina who has infinite fame They will accomplish many benefits for beings they attain emancipation in omniscienceThe vast community of bhikṣus Are like only sons who have lost their mothers The bodhisattva kāśagarbha manifests his birth and appears in different places for their benefitSubhūti there is no possibility and no chance for the minds of those great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible to be alienated in the hellshis accumulation of virtue has been exceptional ThereforeThey are endowed with all supreme features of engaging without engaging the level of faithful practicethe one honored by the world the ultimate refuge of the worldwho wish to roar the lions roar of the completely perfect buddhasLike a cloud over parched earth O Guide satiate them with the rain of DharmaSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections accordingly will swiftly perfect the

statescome and goHis words were authoritative informative and clearWhat are those ten They are honesty gentleness absence of trickery absence of ill will an immaculate mind a pure mind absence of abusiveness absence of viciousness abundant patience and perfect decency Noble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities are upright peopleWe shall destroy that monk alone at the king of trees considering all elements to be present in bluenesswe cannot travel the realm with the Blessed OneLike foam they are feeble and insubstantialVenerable Lord How should great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom investigate the meditative stability of emptinessit is the absence of movement in the aggregate of wisdom it is having the discerning insight of the aggregate of liberation and it is seeing correctly as it is the aggregate of the insight of the wisdom of liberationkāśagarbha when a bodhisattva is about to die he should cultivate the wisdom of the hour of deathNot beautified by ornaments his body is perfectly stainlessAt that time on that occasion I was that kingIt also entails the completion of great compassion by understanding that the self is not a selfthe one worthy of offeringsThat man has come out of his house When the dwelling catches on fireThere should be formed a magnificent image along with a shrine of the great king to whom a particular graha belongsGreat Vaiśravaṇa brings about possession of the secret just as he promisedSon of noble family bodhisattva great beings do not aspire to the three realms in order to become afflictedand wisdom He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of ideation and scrutinyIt is pristine fearless gentle stable profound immutable unchanging indisputable beyond the reach of the intellect inconceivable marvelous and utterly inexpressibleWho are they They are Good and bad karma are indestructible Whatever I have created I will have to experienceand it were not hard to bring this forthand the intelligent ones disparage them Yet the ignorant embrace them and the immature rely on themvoicelessbut the nature of matter is itself voidnessThere is the meditative stability named Great Array OrnamentSo get up Since you are in my realm follow my ordersA word indicates a meaning That word is not a thingSubhūti it is because sentient beings are nonapprehensibleMany beings will develop the aspiration to enlightenmentSince they neither apprehend nor consider the essenceless transcendental perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom andThey listen without listening to the instructions on how all phenomena are ultimately utterly unarisenThe sūtra manifested by Brahmā Through engaging in creating karma There will be the best and the worstand they do not attend upon them do not befriend them do not respect them and do not honor them and eventually they go so far as to criticize themin ultimate reality they are not like thatare purethe abode of the ThirtyThree along with the Palace of Victory and akra lord of the gods would all be visiblestand on dry landBhikṣus at that time in this buddha realm there will be no lower existences and there will be no womenThe light rays caused the Blessed thusgone worthy perfect Buddha ākyamuni to teach the DharmaThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Kṣemadatta was joyful and happyVenerable Lord This purity of phenomena is not cognizantSimilarly they become fixated on feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessIt is like a silkworm making a dwelling from strands of yarn that emerge from its own bodyIt is without specific instancesthe four immeasurable aspirationsand similarly that this one is practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdomThey have no verbal pretense as they fully explain the true meaningand their poor complexions become unpleasant to look atWhat are those ten They refrain from sitting at a tree that is very near to town very far from town full of thorny fruits covered by malu creepers or vine has withered leaves or is the home of monkeys the home of birds the home of aggressive carnivores the home of herons or the home of demonsOn saying that he went the way of all temporal phenomenaThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of the result concerning the compositesamādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaencouraging them to undertake training divorced from the conduct of the bodhisattvasAlthough the shadow is not connected to the persons body the shadow does not occur when there is no body In a similar way virtue and nonvirtue stay connected with a bodywherever the body moves that is where its actions goBodhisattvas similarly are limpid free of murk and clearHe teaches the Dharma without even revealing his teeth let alone any obvious facial expressionand so it is with all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death the emptiness of which is not aging and deathNoble son when endowed with these ten qualities bodhisattvas are endowed with subtle intellectIf you wish to be omniscientThen the hair should be fumigated and rubbed with bdelliumāriputra it is enough to say just thatWhen seven days had passed the nāga kings understood that the bad weather had let up and so they unfurled their bodies from the ThusGone Ones bodyin that same manner they should develop this perception with regard to all inner and outer phenomenaNonduality is objectlessnessThat bhikṣu was named Yaśaḥprabha He received a billion Dharma robesThey are unwaveringly established in miraculous powers Excellently learned they have realized the power of wisdomWhen superimpositions of a self do not ultimately arise manifest views also do not arise and ultimately even the views related to passing beyond suffering do not ariseThus is the conditional relation in inner dependent arising to be seenSince other trees with their leaves flowers and fruits bow to the Bodhi treeThey will have many illnesses and harmsProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha King who is Lord of the Worlds Orbwho desires discernment should be devoted to learningHouseholder whence came this sickness of yoursThere is no room here for even a hairI should cultivate wisdom in this mannerThe applications of mindfulness are pure owing to the purity of the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities and the restThat can never be measured Thus he remains for the sake of enlightenmentThe precious minister is learned lucid and intelligentSon of noble family what do you thinkBlessed One how many qualities do bodhisattva mahāsattvas need to possess in order to become irreversibly set on supreme and perfect enlightenment without regressing without regressing in the slightest andSimilarly they apprehend phantoms and so forth and they also apprehend the viewers of phantoms and so forthHow should I understand the Venerable Lords statement that the fruit is not established by eradicating conditioned and unconditioned phenomenait is the absence of doubt with regard to phenomena associated with the minds and mental states of other sentient beings and other individualsOne should take it in the evening This will remove excess wind and phlegm and ones voice will become melodiousSubhūti owing to the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesHe is a father and mother for beings who sufferAnd also meditating on patience Being established on the level of disciplineDo not act so as to accrue the fortune for that mass of sufferingNaming them is a gateway to all phenomena because it establishes all kinds of gatewaysEverywhere in every place there live Centipedes snakes and vicious creaturesWhen those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage preach and expound this transcendent perfection of wisdom on the eighth day the fourteenth day and the fifteenth day of the lunar monthIt is not an easy task to find that which you seekand then accomplish the sphere of the infinity of space and maintain itand through the essential nature of all beings they reveal the essential nature of a bodhisattvaWith such a stride the Bodhisattva set out for the seat of awakeningThey do not apprehend the emptiness of great extent as the emptiness of great extentāriputra the tathāgatas teach all dharmasElucidate for me great hero The summit of all Dharmas You should not misconstrue it as the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration or the transcendent perfection of wisdomO Blessed One It would be good if you in your compassionNor can things that have dissimilar defining characteristics acquire things that have dissimilar defining characteristicsHe will make offerings to those supreme humans AndO seize seize Pull pull all the evildoers with the noose Bind bindWhat is the doorway It is abandoning faultsThese are called the eight aspects of liberationAt that point the transgressor will think Since even someone endowed with miraculous powers may slay their parents then how about someone like methey have practiced for the highest complete enlightenment with many hundred thousand quintillions of buddhasThe road on which he traveled through the sky was very broad indeedMy younger sister and my daughterinlawSimilarly are the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas also nonconceptuala tree that after it has developed its leaves and foliage will then with time evolve so that finally they wither and fallNoble son thus bodhisattvas cause their virtuous environment which has been accumulated throughout incalculable eons and contains an ocean of absorptions liberations and retentions as well as a central mountain light moon sun Dharma ways forests houses and virtuous surrounding mountains to manifest within the environment of sentient beings who cycle in existence In this way they guide them mature them and transfer them to the unsurpassable state beyond a body This is how they blow the wind of destructive wisdom Noble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are similar to windLikewise the windlike bodhisattvas delight sentient beings with their cloudbanks of numerous bodiesWhat is bondageMañjuśrī bodhisattva mahāsattvas are patient selfcontrolled have attained the level of selfcontrol and their minds are without anger or envyThose immeasurable qualities I have practiced for ten million eonsBecause the kleśas are not created They are clear pure and brightnanda go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illnessand this is to be actualizedWhen ignorance is eliminated none of the afflictions will ariseIf you ask what constitute the deeds of Mārahe is called the Possessor of the Universal Elixir of ElixirsSubhūti if all the sentient beings for whom the tathāgatas turn the doctrinal wheel were entities and not nonentitiesHe may follow the ways of cripples yet he is beautiful and well adorned with the auspicious signs and marksall speechStarting with what I have said about practice please expand on it and express it in your own wayOne should obtain when the moon is in the asterism of Puṣya the fruit of downy daturaHow can they have pure actions of the body How can they avoid faults in speechVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is voidOne should imagine oneself in the form of JambhalaSenior āradvatīputra it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena that the three vehicles have been extensively taught without apprehending anythingI relinquished all defilements And the highest wisdom has dawned in meIt is in the same manner that they train in the other transcendent perfections from the transcendent perfection of generosity onwardsHe understood that saṃsāra is full of many calamities and terrorsAnd thus it was that any ornament that was placed on the Bodhisattvas body lost its lusterHere in the best Dharma you have reached perfectionBhagavān create a cause to inspire the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara to come to this Sahā world realmthey shine like the moon in order to illuminate the worldWith the vajra smile you are affectionate toward all sentient beingsthe inconceivably numerous kinds of inner knowledge concerning the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous kinds of inner knowledge concerning purification Those are the fourMay we also quickly be like him Such aspirations did they makethrough skill in means they integrate them in the finality of existence and they never have doubt indecision or hesitation regarding their own levelThey themselves should cultivate the extrasensory powers of the bodhisattvasHere we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship the one who is stainless and splendidthe three gateways to liberation the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasOn the right side Sunetra repliedpiśācas pūtanasWhat do you think reverend SubhūtiThe bodhisattvas exclaimedThe stūpa of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna was remaining in the same placeare shackledWhen they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomIt is because they know perfectly that nature which is the nature through which a tathāgata comes to beYes Blessed One replied Mañjuśrī Those who focus on attributes who are without restraint Who are constantly fixed in the conception of a selfThe youth Candraprabha knowing that the Bhagavān had assented by his silenceBlessed One how should we understand the presence of consciousness in the bodythey do not do so out of  contemptIf anyone desires awakening they should pay homage in the three realms to this guideSimilarly emptiness is not something other than sounds odors tastes

Is the Lord of the World present They see to it that they have servants personnel and workers as neededThe ritual of threads and colors Should be done just as the activity ritualIt is not I argue accompanied by sufferingThere is no being who with physical eyes Is able to see their bodies Moreover āradvatīputra the Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beings does not cause one to know that all things are distraction or this is meditative equipoiseYou neither cling to nor abandonand selflessness is their true natureProclaim this excellent sūtra to those Who are considerate and respectful to each other Who do not rely on fools And are happy in mountain cavesAjita this question you have asked me concerning this vast subject is excellent Ajita excellentWhen the Bodhisattva saw this man he turned to the charioteer and asked him the following even though he already knew the answerThe Bodhisattva needs saffroncolored robestThe strength of ten bodhisattvas who have been definitively emerged for one billion eons is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who has been definitively emerged for ten billion eonsStealing from a place of worship or from the saṅgha of the four directions is considered the first root transgression of a ministerThere is nothing at all that will be attained on the basis of things that are nonarisingThe outsider opponents advocate convictions and the bodhisattva is not troubled by convictionsHe only delights in the pleasures of the Dharma The bliss of concentration and the significance of immortality And the joy of liberating sentient beings and the happiness of a loving mindIt is this excellent cart made of jewels That goes from here to the Bodhimaṇḍa Which the Sugatas śrāvakas listen to And which many bodhisattvas enjoyMade inconceivable offerings To the buddhas of the past The heavens above this trichiliocosm are filled with gods And on earth demigods kiṃnaras and humans roamBhikṣus how long has it been since that tathāgata appearedBlessed One how is it that a bodhisattva great being should endeavor in order to perfect such qualities as theseinexhaustible merit oceanlike merit inconceivable merit the accumulation of merit and the marks of one hundred meritsand desist from wicked habits of body speech or mind so that like palm trees that have had their tops cut off they will not arise again in the futureBut he would not accept it I then said to himIn the city of Kapilavastu the clan of the ākyas and everyone else had plenty to eat and drink and they enjoyed themselves with various amusementsNoble one it is excellent that you have come because you wish to see the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuni and myself to listen to The White Lotus of the Good Dharma and to see Mañjuśrī KumārabhūtaThe thusgone ones know the minds and latent tendencies of sentient beingsLord these successive prophecies Have made us happy delighted and overjoyedand as the monk who inducts him into the novitiate contemplation of a worminfested corpseAnd I was Prince Mati who was freed from illness Through the wisdom of the samādhi Father why are you unhappyThey expose the doubts of all beings They have a view that is always accurateThe nature of physical forms is indeed nonarisingWhen monks are not free from desire it leads to transgressions requiring saṅgha interventionThe bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin then inquiredThey have horses elephants and perfect chariots to ride upon They have abundant gold and precious jewels This is the conduct conducive to enlightenmentThe kingdom was at peace undisturbed and with welltimed rainMoreover Subhūti in the presence of virtuous ascetics and brāhmins who are nonBuddhists the irreversible great bodhisattva beings do not say that those virtuous ascetics and brāhmins know what should be known see what should be seen or discern the correct viewIn this way I teach the true ultimate truthLikewise the same goes for the gateways to liberation and in the same vein all the other attainments up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesMonks in all those places the laypeople invited the ThusGone One to stay and refresh himselfAnd if there were a wealthy mindful learned Brave educated and fearless person Who was there as their guide In that terrifying dreadful jungleThese three gateways to liberation are merely names and the same applies to all the remaining meditative experiences up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesthey travel through the air just like a bird they dive into the ground and emerge from it just as they would in waterOne should speak nice wordsFriends tonight the Bodhisattva will leave his home You must help him leave by carrying the hooves of his fine horse with your handsUpāli repliedAre you not one of untarnished reputation Who takes delight in the Dharma not desirehe empowered his composite life to continue for a further twenty hundred thousand quintillion years and proclaimed widely this Dharma teachingTherefore Vimalatejā all phenomena are dependentand they undertake training while fully comprehending the twelve links of dependent originationthe aggregate of wisdom is still discernedthey always maintain the perception that the five psychophysical aggregates are essenceless thinkingMoreover beyond that and further beyondat which point the goddess charmed them so they could not see one anothernor do they become merit nor do they become sin nor do they become both merit and sinThis sacred doctrine is compatible with the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationWithout respite they answer Thousand of millions of questions Yelling out You child they attacked from the left and from the rightHave seen today the same kind of omen definitive knowledge of multiple world systems and diverse dispositionsDefeat opponents and tame all demonsIs this also the case with respect to the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomWhen it sees these youthful gods it becomes overjoyedAlways deluded in impure existence Beings spin like a bee caught in a vaseand as devas with crowns the size of bherī drums they will dwell among those deva maidensLooking upon the great assembly of bodhisattvas and the great assembly of gods the Bodhisattva then addressed the gatheringIt is likewise too when there are demeritorious formative factorsHe is the one who has fully abandoned all obscurations of habitual tendencies and disturbing emotionsO Brahmā the gates of nectar are opened To those sentient beings of Magadha With ears and with devotion Who constantly listen with attention and without doing harmThe southwestern redAll of this is caused by virtuous deeds Arising from study discipline and conscientiousnessit is because even the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges originate from this transcendent perfection of wisdomA million seekers and those with no more need for learning will always bow to me Because I enjoy the Dharma I no longer seek joyful objectsThe applications of mindfulness do not apprehend the sameness of the three timesOne will perceive distant tastesthat have an implied meaning of the secret aspect of the Dharma taught by the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas so that the bodhisattva mahāsattvas may attain complete accomplishmentSimilarly knowing that the four applications of mindfulness and all other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and the three gateways to liberation are empty of inherent existenceGood sir how should a bodhisattva regard all living beingsThe qualities of awakening and buddhahood have their basis in the component of disciplinethe monk said The king has given us a princes libertyHe will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are entities or that they are nonentitiesThat which experiences maturation merit and nonmerit is consciousnessSenior Subhūti are you inspired to say that things are nonarising that things are indeed nonarisingIn the light of such events only monks with ten years and five qualities may allow going forthnot to be beheldYou are speaking about intended meaning Without anyone asking you about it What is the root of desire and attachmentSubhūti if all things were not empty of inherent existenceThose who ultimately are not attached to any phenomenon will gain convictionKnowing this I remained At the Bodhimaṇḍa for three full weeksand in the same vein the transcendence of all the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas is not the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and the restthe samādhi named Vajra ArmorI will even refine the buddhafields I will also bring sentient beings to maturityyet ultimately there is no grasping to or abandoning of any phenomenonIn order to cure them of such afflictions bodhisattvas will demonstrate residing upon the seat of awakening and taming the demonsThese thrones were so tall spacious and beautiful that the bodhisattvas great disciples akras Brahmās Lokapālas and other gods had never before seen the likeMṛgarāja resembles a deer they are reborn into a wealthy family and as soon as they are born they have a mind that aspires to generosityAnd they enjoined him in what he must practice and howsome of silverDivine being the buddhas appear in order to reveal that the essential nature of the aggregates elements and sense sources is the realm of phenomenaThe god Dharmacārin repliedHomage to Tathāgata Sūryaprabhāketuśrīsevenandahalf māṣakaBlissful One many beings have gathered hereand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the sensory elements from the eyes to mental phenomena are without aspirationsBodhisattvas think as follows The mind fondly believes that the impermanent is permanentThrough his insight learning and accumulations Developed over the course of tens of millions of eonsIn the very fearful future times You Ajita will be my witnessShe took up offerings for the Blessed One and went before himdeserve the respect of the entire world with its gods humans and antigodsthe emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end the emptiness of nondispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all thingsBhikṣus the Bhagavān gave his assent by saying nothing to the MahābrahmāsWere freed from illness when Queen Māyā placed her hand on their headsIn that pure environment there were springs ponds pools and reservoirs brimming with water of the eight qualitiesWith the passing of the four maṇḍalasThereafter akra lord of the gods arrived together with the gods from the Heaven of the ThirtyThree bringing divine flowers perfumes garlands ointments scented powders garments parasols victory banners flags earrings and adornmentsDoing this every day for the rest of ones life Will increase ones semen or bloodThe generosity of relinquishing male and female slaves staff and workers represents the perfection of the bodhisattvas freedom independence and selfarisen wisdomTranscending misery the most basic of body and lifeforce Life ends unaccompaniedThe lifespan of that bhagavān will be twelve intermediate eonsyou should know that they are untainted by the defects of taking birth in the animal realmsSince bodhisattvas indeed perfect all the meditative concentrations and formless absorptions but will not be reborn on account of these experiences how could they possibly be reborn on account of desire hatred and delusionTake care to fasten your anklets wellOnce the guide a bull among men had awakened to buddhahoodIt is afflicted by adventitious afflictionswere filled with a great lightExcept in order to bring sentient beings to maturation they will never be born in the inferior realmsand similarly they will not become fixated on any of the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighty minor marksFresh and sweet the fragrance of flowers drifts through the air Please issue an order and let us go there right awayadopt false doctrinesHe was the portrait of a supreme leader With the wisdom of selfarisen buddhahoodThat Vimalā world realm and this Sahā world realm both shook in six waysThe son of uddhodana is sublimely handsomeThen the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuni replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva PadmaśrīWhen this tīrthika saw the fine seats arranged there and the array of communal food and drinkby becoming a member of the priestly class tall as a great sāl treeMonks long ago a king who lived in a remote mountain range took a wife of equal casteMoreover āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings maintain alertness whether they are going out or returning backThey also see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraI realized that I should henceforth live on only a single sesame seed and restrain myself from eating twoBhagavān the man did not give just one cart to his childrenThey bring a multitude of beings to aspire to enlightenment And they become selfarisen buddhas supreme jinas who does not distinguish between the phenomena of malice and the phenomena of patienceevery extremist symbol and banner that the five companions were wearing disappeared in an instantIt is not in vain that you have comeThen in the same way as before one emerges and is bornthey do not then reject it doubting that this is not the real nature of phenomenaWere one to extol them for innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of eons one still could not exhaust their mighty flood of virtuesBhikṣus that is the skillful method of the tathāgatasThat shall now be correctly explainedFor countless eons they had endeavored to benefit and bring happiness to both themselves and others andIt teaches the disengagement of body and mind and is a gateway to the disengagement of all phenomenaHe was affectionate filled with compassion nobleminded amicable learned wise clear intelligent knowledgeable devoid of laziness disciplined wholesome honest straight soft gentle and sincereThey were distressed unhappy and shockedThey will have golden bodies adorned by the thirtytwo signs of a great beingOh This is the first time weve heard the phrase withdrawn into seclusion in such a long timeIt is as follows MañjuśrīThe Blessed One replied This is owing to the infinity of spaceWhen one does not come into existence or go out of existence one becomes fixed and has obtained the DharmaAs disciplined as an ascetic she follows a strict code of conduct And while following her own conductwho accumulates various paths to enlightenment who has entered sacred liberationhave magnificent fair complexionsLikewise it applies to the six transcendent perfections and in the same vein to all the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighty minor markswhat is the cause and what is the reason whyThus a bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can manifest all the splendors of the virtues of all the buddhafields within a single buddhafieldSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom perfect the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationKnow it as supreme compassion for all beingsshould burn the big toe of a foot for the caityas of the TathāgataSimilarly beings whose minds are inebriated by desire and conceitwho brings beings to nirvāṇaThe heads of guilds head merchants and regional commanders All gained the ten strengths and freedom from the kleśas One should blend sea salt borax camphor and the powder of loofah together with honey and apply it to the penis The result will be the sameBy means of his great supernatural power the Tathāgata and his surrounding retinue were then transported to the city of VārāṇasīWhen the Bodhisattva knew that they were settled he taught them a Dharma teaching and instructed themThe countless millions of beings Who hear that musicThey are under the power of Māra And they will not attain liberation Looking at the Blessed thusgone worthy perfect Buddha

banners of victoryTherefore it is said Whether the tathāgatas arise or notMonks you should not address the ThusGone One as venerableSenior āradvatīputra when you asked how these distinctions have come

the gods of the world system of form extending from the Brahmakāyika realm as far as the Pure Abodes are without foundationBrahmā lord of the Sahā World now spoke to the gods of the Brahma realm sayingNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities are delightful to accompanyLook who I am in realityI am master of the Dharmaand having heard directly from the Bhagavān the prophecy of Brother āriputras attainment of the highest supreme enlightenmentThey could not be described in either wayOne should not think about higher realms or liberationBecause of the vastness of that samādhi My body cannot be seen If however they find that their mind is involved in something unvirtuous they will feel great weariness ponder it extensively and then strive to abandon those unvirtuous qualitiesThere will be many hundred thousands of bodhisattvas thereAnd if that being having been inspired Listens for a moment to this sūtraIn reply the blessed thusgone Padmanetra said to themand the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of suffering concerning purification Those are the fourSimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle is also not something that is seenin the same vein Subhūti all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaledAll the passions are their disciples Controlled at willWho travel in all the ten directions Seeking a bhikṣu who has the excellent teachingbeautifully adorned with a variety of jewelsMonks in this way the Bodhisattva proceeded on his wayMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings with overweening conceitThese disciples are not expert in discerning the superiority and inferiority of the spiritual faculties of living beingsThey attain those four great brahmavihārasfor actions for causes and for diligence Monks that is how you should trainthusgone worthy perfect Buddha Ratnaketu who resided therethey

conscientiously to this Dharma Vinaya abandons the cycle of birth and puts an end to sufferingBlessed One how is it that a bodhisattva who is free of afflictions aspires to the three realmsEach house has a hundred thousand further housesWhat is knowledge of the infinite It is the effortless knowledge of mundane and supramundane skillsThe aspect Mañjuśrī is explained as taking up all wholesome dharmasEverything inside is going to be burned in this great firethe tonguebaseTheir minds endowed with omniscience they will encourage secure and establish those sentient beings in physical and mental perseverance in order that they might abandon nonvirtuous doctrines and undertake the excellent virtuous doctrinesYouthful Mañjuśrī and the god Ratnavara had also joined the gathering and were present thereThey will have inferior wisdom and be devoid of good qualities And they will always be criticizing the supreme yānaNoble son the thusgone ones gain their true accomplishment over many incalculable eons The markings on their palms and soles blaze with splendorSimilarly physical forms and the other aggregates up to and including consciousness are neither fettered nor liberated because they are void because they are nonarising and unceasing and because they are not fettered and not boundMoreover Kauśika they should not dwell on the notion that physical forms are permanentBecause it was I who at that time in those days was the great sage Supreme OneFor countless millions of eons In the training of nonperceptionHe has developed an equanimity that does not differentiate and thereforeit is still based on many unpleasant and dirty thingsWill cut the path to the lower realms and open the paths of the godsBhadrapāla here is how the element of consciousness

shines forth clearly constantly radiant and vividHe lived the holy life for the rest of his days but he did not attain any store of qualitiesThis is why I grieve so strongly The form that we manifested to destroy Gautama Would have broken his heart Had he only seen itnd some in villages towns regionsaccompanied by its support of nonvirtueThey are dedicated to the teachings of the Tathāgata in order to realize the four truths of the āryas as the cause of attaining nirvāṇa for themselvesIf they find that their mind is involved in virtue they will feel joy appreciation and inspirationSo it is that this vehicle is said to be equal to spaceFrom the center of the sky gods called out the following verseWhoever is attached to the two views Will later be in a realm of delusionand likewise it has not been revealed so that the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path might be grasped or not graspedThe prince Ratnākara then said to his parentsI wonder whether it is because this woman who has investigated so well in this way is meritorious learned and naturally wiseI will explain to you the purification of the buddhafield of the bodhisattvasand since they are also not confused with respect to feelings that are neither painful nor pleasant they are not predisposed to ignoranceSaying this the Guide of Men smiledYou previously made an aspiration To become their protector and refuge As well as their supreme supporter and defenderwho extinguishes AvīciAs there are methods for bringing the womans mind to the state of enthrallmentThus they think When I experience feelings of pleasure if the body should perish that will be the end of

lost his confidence he disappearedI would not run out of things to sayāradvatīputra the noble eightfold path is merely conceptualizedSo I will also offer you my homageuddhipaṃthakaAs we have set out upon the state of awakening you have made us vigilantSubhūti it is because they possess and manifest the attributes indications and signs of the irreversible great bodhisattva beingsWith this mantra any serious diseases will go awayIt is because of this that offerings are always being made To me and Prabhūtaratna the selfarisen Jina He is one who is constantly going in every direction In order to listen to such a Dharma as thisMake offerings to the lords of humans in the future And venerate all the guides in the present other pots had become completely filled with food that had the supreme flavors Always being respectful and delighted Remaining continually in a peaceful viewThey will say unpleasant things to each other And find great joy in having done bad things If all sentient beings were solitary buddhas And someone were to offer with great attention Flowers perfumes and ointments Continually over several eonsWhen māras or demonic gods befriend bodhisattvas and speak to them

proper knowledge and conductit is because they are even unattached to the mind endowed with omniscience which is uncontaminated and not included within the three world systemsI rejoice in those who see the harmfulness of crowds Who avoid every kind of disagreementand when the lotus disappears into the water it is wherever its seed may be that its colorThese airborne palaces of the Brahmās have become very beautiful bright radiant glorious and majestic Who is this a sign ofIt is like a palmyra tree if you were to lop off its crown it would no longer be green nor would it flourish grow or

lake has appearedIt is having the natural result of good qualities It is the abhorrence of bad qualitiesand similarly if they meditate on and perfect the applications of mindfulnessthe expanse of reality which includes all phenomena itself abides indivisiblyThe king then sent messengers on horseback into the four directions with the orderHe will teach the Dharma to eradicate the pride conceit and arrogance of an unfathomable countless number of beingsBlessed One we would like to see Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta and those bodhisattva great beingsAfter Brahmānana there was a buddha A jina who was named BrahmaśravaHence I have left the gathering The two hundred monks concurredThat is called the emptiness of nonapprehensionSome arrive proffering ponds with blooming lotuses They bring blue and white lotuses that have opened At the center of each of the flowers there are beings endowed with the thirtytwo marksSimilarly physical forms are all neither fettered nor liberated because physical forms are unceasingYou should keep this pledge that you made in former lives when someone asked you and you vowed I will become a refuge sanctuary protector ally and guide to all sentient beingswho have cultivated the mind of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment will arrive thereWhat may I do for you Tell me what to do The queen repliedSimilarly when they maintain ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance become equipoised in meditative concentration and cultivate wisdom if they do not understand the limitations of perceptionthe four assurances the four unhindered discernmentsNoble son it is rare for thusgone ones to appear and for this king of sūtras to be heardAccepting all phenomena as unborn and unceasing it is the acceptance of the nonarising of

transcendent perfection of generosityThe prince is to pray in the temple Ornament him welland to the memorials of the thusgone ones he has offered fragrant oils banners of delicate cloth flags and threads of silk ThereforeI request it Bhagavat that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara may comerest in concentrationI will establish them on the auspicious dry land without old age or deathA bodhisattvas buddhafield is a field of wisdom In the past hundreds of thousands of buddhas Have taught the Dharma hundreds of thousands of timesThey experience intense suffering from unbearable heat and go through very unpleasant experiences In this way they suffer greatlyOṃ nīlāmbaradhara vajrapāṇi hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ The root mantra of the Blessed One accomplishes all activities This is the secret of the awakened mind of all buddhasIts branches were long and spread out spaciously The ground where the fig tree stood was smooth like the palm of a hand beautiful and open and it was full of dark blue grass the color of a peacocks neckAlternatively the transfer it undergoes is like a seedSubhūti do you think that with regard to the reality of all things there exists the description of anythingthese marks cause the earth with its mountains and forests to tremblebut if I had no method and instructed these beings to attain a tathāgatas wisdom strengths and fearlessnessesThey must not be moved by ambition anger ignorance or fearthe other sensory attributes are empty of feelings due to sensory contact that is visually compounded and so forth similarly feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compounded and so forth are empty of feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compoundedYou should remain consciously aware in the midst of the pleasures of desireit with flowers incense perfumes and flower garlands or by offering even just a single karṣāpaṇa to itThen Ajita that man introduces those beings to the Dharmas guidance that has been taught by the TathāgataI will completely ripen those beingswithout a soul or a personthree million two hundred thousand gods gave rise to the intention to attain unexcelled perfect and complete awakeninghe is the One Who Does Not Perceive DifferencesThe ākya girl Gopā heard this rumor and in front of all the folk of the inner quarters she said these versesHe went to the king and saidUpāli asked the Blessed Buddhathose who wish to abandon attachment to the world system of formThrough this transcendent perfection of wisdom and skill in means they do not regress to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhasit is because the doctrine of the Great Vehicle and the doctrine which is omniscience are neither conjoined nor disjoinedThe nature of the noble truths is emptiness Emptiness is the noble truthsHe will teach so that those engaged in yogic practices will achieve their fruitionbodhisattva mahāsattvas who obtain this samādhiSubhūti there are two ways in which great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom attract sentient beings with the gift of the sacred doctrineSituated optionally on a sun diskIt is said that his power consists of the ten strengths and that he has a body like that of Nārāyaṇalikewise they do not consider whether feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness arise or ceaseAnd then due to the ripening of previous karma of beginner bodhisattvas and immature ordinary people who are guided by means of nirvāṇaIt is done without seeing the tathāgatas without focusing on the self and without any desire for the ripening of karmaEighty bodhisattvas attained patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as nonarisingThere are no unworthy beings present here xxviiNoble son in the past when I was a bodhisattva named Siṃhalarāja I was going to the island of Siṃhala with five hundred merchantsOne with a pure mind clear and unblemished Practices the peace of this samādhi One should keep all ones practice very secret So that nobody knowshe unsurpassed guide who tames beings the teacher to gods and men the Blessed Buddha ākyamuni Just as you have realized the Dharma And practiced the Buddhas instructions in the worldThe strength of ten gods dwelling in the immeasurable palace is the same as the strength of one ṣādhāra godāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the ten powers of the tathāgatas and in the same vein all the other aforementioned fruitional attributes up to and including omniscience as nonentitiesThat is why they are called bodhisattva mahāsattvasPassing quickly into nirvāṇa they do not bring forth the fragrance of the buddhas disciplineIt neither bestows nor withholds the maturity of the bodhisattvasCan never be accomplished by religious austeritiesKnowing this the goddesses approached the seat of awakening and praised the ThusGone One with these versesThe Bhagavān replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Noble Avalokiteśvaras inquiry with the following wordsI pay homage to you who possess the power of truth and the ten strengthsHaving completed the procedure of the preliminary practice as beforeIn accordance with the aspirations made by the thusgone ones through the gift of my flesh and bloodThat is called the emptiness of external and internal phenomenaThose of noble family who engage in this practice must maintain ritual purity make ablutions and change their clothes three times a daySimilarly they teach the doctrine that the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty are impermanentWhen day broke he had arrived six leagues away from the town of Anumaineya in the country of MaineyaThe strength of correct conduct the strength of samādhi And the strength of the Dharma and therefore was a superior bhikṣu Seeing them they make offerings to them with faith Those are the benefits of being without avarice All are invincible strong and powerfulSimilarly they apprehend the eyes and develop a view of the eyes in an apprehending mannerAnd so generously provide them With the gifts that consist of the seven jewelsWho would give these shavenheaded ascetics alms or think to help themReflecting on the bliss of the spirit of enlightenment circulatingSome who have gathered the accumulation of merit Arrive at the seat of awakening bright as rainbowsHowever the Bodhisattva wanted to demonstrate the conduct of a renunciant so he did not give the cloth to akra Instead he washed it himselfIn your past lives you gave away your wealth jewels and gold Your beloved wife and children your land cities and villages And even your own head eyes hands and feetthe nāgas Vāsuki and so forth also the nāginīs made of nāgakesara woodNow that you have surely reached the other shoreThrough that they make offerings to meThere is no eye no man no woman and no self There is no ear no nose no tongue and no bodyYou must develop a powerful diligence In order to attain omniscient wisdomWhen I claim to have attained genuinely perfect buddhahoodMaitreya here today the Bhagavān gazing at a rice seedling spoke this aphorism to the bhikṣusWhat is meant by seat of enlightenmentAs soon as the Bhagavān entered that state there fell a rain of coral tree flowersLikewise the flower does not think I form the fruit Nor does the fruit think I am formed by the flowernanda those who retain hold and so forth this transcendent perfection of wisdom andcontinuously patient and acceptingIn this case if the stars the planets the sun and the moon are not visibleThose who remain in equanimity Are always free of arrogance and depressionmillions of silken banners fluttered in the windas a physical feelingThen he saw two gods the Sun and Moon standing on his right and left sidesThere are some who wear one two three four five six seven or more pieces of clothing while others go nakedThose who maintain perfectly pure correct conduct Who remain always in inconceivable dhyānaThus with this insight bodhisattvas understand correctly that although sentient beings do not exist the ripening of virtuous and unvirtuous karma nevertheless does manifestPhysician Kumārabhṛta What illness is this Please have a lookMeasure with a splint just four finger widths tall A splint of exactly that length shall be called a bar I will also bring sentient beings to maturity It is speaking gently  It is not remaining anywhere in the three realmsI will destroy it with knowledge Just as water destroys a vessel of unbaked clayMañjuśrī it is likewise that the Tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha creates through the might of his arms and his merit the three realms of a Dharma king within the three realms which is trampled on by evil MāraHaving completely given up all their possessionsMonks at that point the ThusGone One decided My five ascetic companions will be the ones to whom I shall teach the Dharma for the first timeI am the one who first established them on the level of being a bodhisattva I am the one who has ripened and developed themI see others Mañjughoṣa following the teachings Of sugatas who have passed into nirvāṇaThe bodhisattva mahāsattvas who see in that way are engaging in the discernment of phenomenathen āriputra the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas with skill in methods teach that single Buddhayāna as a teaching of three yānasThe yogins do not conceptualize things But live always detached And seeking this highest enlightenment They give their hands and feet when requested They will not deviate whatsoever from the mind of complete awakeningI took the bowl and went to the door of the mansion of a great brahmin familyShe will by her own actions Certainly maintain her pregnant wombFor conjunctivitis relief will come after wiping the eyesEvil one the earth here is my witnessand whose knowledge had rent open the shellSubhūti There is a distinct way in which bodhisattvas might undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from itSarvabodhisattvaśrī Glory of All Bodhisattvasup to those who are attentive to the notion that the eyes are the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities and at the same time apprehend those modes of emptinessIn my threepetaled lotus Endowed with a fleshy circleThey build the strong ship of the DharmaDivine son I base myself on the acts with immediate consequence andPadmaśrīgarbha tell me are there many displays of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha AmitābhaThus for one hundred thousand years they will venerate these tathāgatas with the divine and manifest offerings meant for a tathāgataDivine son whoever is an irreversible bodhisattva great being has no chance and no opportunity not to attain awakeningand their father said to KoṣṭhilaThey could not perceive their bodies their features or shape nor did they have a sense of touchAt this the Bhagavān congratulated

noble onesthen feelings of pleasure and feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful come to a haltIn that way we work for the Guide Just like that trustworthy manSome beings are to be converted by bodhisattvaswill conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentThen the deva Maheśvara came to the Bhagavat bowed his head to the Bhagavats feet and saidThose ordinary people with diverse notions think that physical forms are one distinct thing and the emptiness of inherent existence anotherexamine this book of the transcendent perfection of wisdom and master itWithin three months one will become a master of speechand similarly if they perfect the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas exclusively by way of signlessnessWhen he said the letter ā out came the statement Beneficial to self and others ātmaparahitaThey will speak with a voice that is gentle and pleasant Beautiful and pleasing to the earand without cultivating the mindsets of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas may those sentient beings by scenting that fragrance exclusively ascertain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThe ordinary beings with incorrect behavior Those who do not have faith in the DharmaNor should they dwell on the notion that I having travelled there should establish innumerable countless sentient beings in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentSo why do you give me the order for leaving The Bodhisattva repliedI barely get enough from begging to fill my own stomach he replied Where out there can I get enough to provide for themWhen their relatives heard that the master Māṭhara was leavingThe moment they are reborn there in front of them will be eightyfour thousand deva maidensExplain those things that constitute spiritual practice Listen venerable newly ordained monks nameRather your hand struck hard shaking them and you defeated Māras armyConduct that is perfectHow does one examine the nature of the composite I have laid down the banner of pride that I held high for so longSo long will beings listen to this transcendent perfection of wisdomor sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who have been accepted by a spiritual mentorall of these may receive this transcendent perfection of wisdom which is so profoundNoble ones considering this I say Bhikṣus the appearance of a tathāgata is difficult to find so that conceiving that the appearance of a tathāgata is difficult to find they perceive it as a wonder and they have the understanding that a tathāgata passes into nirvāṇaAt the same time as an offering to the Bodhisattva alms were distributed at the four gates of the city of Kapilavastu and at all its crossroads and junctionshe was nowhere to be seen there eitherHe was honored as the official among officials because he regulated the functions of government according to the Dharmaso that we also may be students of the TathāgataOne should mix equal amounts of salt and black mustard seed and offer them in a homa offering Whoevers name is used in the offering that person will become enthralledGautamī do not stand gazing at the Tathāgata unhappily thinking The Tathāgata has not spoken to me has not prophesied the highest complete enlightenment for meBy such truth and true words as follows of all those who observe ethical discipline controlled conduct austerities or pure conduct those who are known as supreme in the discipline that pleases the noble oneshave crossed the pitVenerable Lord Owing to the nonappropriation of all things bodhisattvas do not grasp physical forms and similarly they do not grasp feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessSarvālakṣmīnāśayitrī She Who Destroys All Inauspiciousness Sarvapuṇyākarṣaṇaśrī Glory That Collects All Meritsand whether they are eating drinking chewing tasting waking up resting coming or going standing or sitting reclining or not reclining and speaking or not speakingāriputra if those sons and daughters of good family hear the name of the Bhagavān Tathāgata Amitāyus and keep it in mind unwaveringly for one two three four five six or seven nightsNo being whether god demigod or human Is able to look upon her with a lustful mindand similarly feelings perceptions and formative predispositionsIn time he saw the spread of fine shelters with choice food laid out for the community there and thoughtNoble sons when those boys had recited those verses they said to their father and motherThe greatly famed bodhisattvas Have no doubt in that wisdom Nonentities are empty of nonentities Essential nature is empty of essential nature Extraneous entities are empty of extraneous entitiesHe always spoke patiently to protect others Even when his limbs were cut off he was never angry or hostileJust as a welltrained conjurer Is able to display illusionsThat is how one informs the saṅgha of the wish to go forthTwo nāga kings dwelling in space spouted forth two streams of cool and warm waterIn each of the mansions appeared  parasols of various colors multiple colors hundreds of thousands of colors beautiful wellcrafted and of fine proportionsWhen he said the letter aḥ out came the statement Reaching an end astaṃgamanaāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of physical forms as a self or not a self constitutes a bodhisattvaFor so long he has showed respect to parents leaders elders holy people monks priests beggars destitute beings and many others who have come to himOh my the mendicant Gautama has turned black Have you seen hes so dark The mendicant Gautama has the color of the madgura fishāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving sights as entitiesSenior āradvatīputra that is not the casethe internal space element does not at all disrupt the external space elementCountless beings attained irreversibility from the highest complete enlightenmentwere well adorned by the splendor of their immaculate meritI made the sound of spitting andassuming the kingly guise of a universal monarch or by becoming the king of a nation orI take refuge in the Blessed One the Dharma and the Saṅgha of monksUncountable billions of gods of the desire and form realms hovering in the sky made various types of offerings to the Bodhisattva and followed after himThe Blessed One has feet that are well positioned In this regard excellent positioning of the feet means that the soles of his two feet entirely touch the groundO when destroying all the Māras nail the feet of such and such Hū phaṭThey will know that this one skilled in the faculties of faith and perseverance will consistently obtain an excellent corporeal formand likewise they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomenaāradvatīputra The purity of phenomena is not subject to involuntary reincarnation due to the absolute purity of physical forms which does not pass awayBuddhas have not seen any dharma nor heard it smelt it tasted it touched it or cognized itSubhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom neither bestows nor withholds the attributes of ordinary peopleSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent patience that liberates based on commitmentDear boy please listenFrom the time when they first begun to set their mind on enlightenment onwardsBut they were unable to cure me of my disease Everyone in my family was in suffering Having entered homelessness along with his children and wives He kept to the station of acquiring alms foodSuch acts do not ripen in the outer element of earth nor do they ripen in the outer elements of water fire or windeach bodhisattva would cover as many golden buddhafields as the number of grains of sand in the GangesFurthermore a kṣatriya commits the fourth root transgression with any one of these five heinous deeds purposely killing ones own mother father or a śrāvaka arhat or the Bhagavān dividing the saṅgha or purposely and out of negative intention causing a tathāgata arhat perfectly complete buddha to bleedBe without avarice and make known to the noble men and noble women who come to you this Dharma teaching that is a great skillful method for seeing the wisdom of the tathāgatasWhen the Jina placed his foot on the gateways threshold All those people who were blind Deaf and had no protector and little meritHere I rent asunder The closed doors of the five obstructions And cut through the vines of cravingHowever it is not necessary to place the relics of the Tathāgata within itAnd may you return with great profitThe web of the Bodhisattvas light rays Streamed out all around in the ten directions And illuminated an inconceivable number of realms As numerous as grains of sand in the GangesBy upholding that very virtue of wisdomgnosis One is an upholder of virtue a fully ordained monkBut with loving intent toward all sentient beingsOnce its attention is linked with the element of dharmas and it has taken up virtue and nonvirtuenanda this woman was my mother for five hundred lifetimesThen she said to the lad Son of a lord please wait a moment while I climb up to the roof of the houseMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings have not turned away from the transcendent perfection of generosity andand similarly those who wish to comprehend feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessan expressionVenerable Lord If the transcendent perfection of generosity were mundane and that were also the case with respect to the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom then emptiness of nondispersalHaving been thus taught the bodhisattva Maitreya said to the Buddhawho has the splendor of beautiful lotusesIt is the domain of activity of someone with restraint of the body Who like space is unstained by worldly qualities Likewise the neither positive nor negative ripening of neither positive nor negative past actionsThen one should soak it in the clarified butter of a cowThis Subhūti is the most difficult task of great bodhisattva beingsTherefore rejecting both extremes The wise do not even remain in the middle By whatever means they make such determinations they should do so with an unwavering mindThey will pass genuinely beyond the danger of the world of the Lord of DeathIn the presence of other sentient beings who understand as little as those just mentioned they recall these sūtras in great detail in word and meaning just as they heard and understood them and they teach them to othersāriputra it should be known that it is through this teaching through the accomplishment of the wisdom of various skillful methods that the Tathāgata teaches the single MahāyānaVenerable Lord How is it that great bodhisattva beings who have heard this teaching on the transcendent perfection of wisdom become afraid and terrifiedAt that time the Four Great Kings thought Let us go to where the Blessed One resides so we can meetOne should make love to ones womanShaking the earth They dry up the groves Shaking the mountains They harm these beingsThey indeed enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas butāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness as permanent or impermanent constitute a bodhisattvaHe covered this entire world of the great trichiliocosm in soft green grass curled to the right in the pattern of a swastika soft as the finest cloth and pleasant to the touchWith discrimination you reject all carelessness You have conquered the infinite powerful mārasAnd as for the gods in the realms of meditative concentration and form if I can demonstrate a superior meditative concentration they will become interestedI see some bodhisattvas Who are dwelling resolutely in the mountainsThe gods who view them cannot get enoughThis concludes the Section of the Question of Maitreya the fortyfirst section of The Noble Dharma Discourse the Great Heap of Jewels in one hundred thousand sectionsThis is called bow postureThen its outer form will remain for twice as long as thatthe gods of the Heaven of Making Use of Others Emanations such as VaśavartinThose who remain in fabricated views Displease a multitude of buddhas Oh Oh With the planks of generosity You have made a ship and tied it with the ropes of diligenceRāhula repliedBy many women performing dances Many millions of various excellent cloths And beautiful excellent garlands of flowers viiiThey will have the power of their faith the power of their roots of merit and the power of their prayersVenerable Lord if the notion of sights as permanent is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of sights as impermanent become a bodhisattvaThe tathāgatas who came and arrived sat crosslegged on the lion thrones in front of those treesthe ravishingly beautiful chariots take him back homeAt the beginning it precedes all roots of virtueThose were the words Bhagavān ākyamuni spoke Such is the bodhisattvas excellent outer patienceThis was the ripened result of that merit The beings could not stop looking at the Lord of humans It is thus that great bodhisattva beings who dispense generosity perfect the transcendent perfection of generosityListen to me bhikṣus I declare to you today And I make it known to you todayEven if all the māras in the world transformed Into buddhas and said to such practitioners Enlightenment is too difficult So become a śrāvaka They would not believe those words and would not regress eyeconsciousnessand in the same vein are the other nonexistent sense organs up to and including the nonexistent mental faculty unattached to the nonexistent mental faculty and the restBrother Uruvilvākāśyapa Brother NadīkāśyapaNow who will slay this bhikṣuelse without all their limbs intactwhich was simply unshakable He was perfectly forbearing and gentleAmong them the tolerance of suffering implies thatSince the nature of mind is inconceivableIf you ask what are the eight sense fields of mastery they are as followsHow are moral conduct patience diligence meditation and transcendent awareness obscurationsSuppose Mahauṣadhi that someone were to cut his hair and beardThey prostrated at my feet circumambulated me And gathered here before meAnd through the samādhi similar to an illusion He goes to all realms and makes offerings to the jinasAnd you young man at that time Were the wise goddess who wished to help bwithout a living beingwhere a discourse on the genuine Dharma emerged amid a symphony of  musical instruments From their sound the following verses of inspiration arose telling of the many virtuous deeds that the Bodhisattva carried out in times pastIt is without a person because it dispenses with past origins and future destiniesAs one progresses through the stages of perception of the maṇḍalaFinally the Bodhisattva let his hand rest while maintaining mindfulness and carefulnessBecause he has cut through ignorance and the craving for existence he is known as the one who is free from wearinessNoble son there are  mountains in that poreBlessed One those bodhisattva great beings who have perceived the gate of liberation yetIn this manner the universal monarch comes to possess the precious wife Worthy friend you are as beautifulWhen they enter a temple they develop the motivation I shall deliver all beings to the city of the transcendence of sufferingWhat are these three They are emptiness the absence of attributes and the absence of aspirationNoble son bodhisattvas who have not yet attained the strength of the powers must apply remedies to avoid the arising of afflictionand just as a nonentity cannot relish a nonentity they do not relish these meditative stabilitiesHere your garments are scented in the cold season with warming oils And in the hot season with sandalwoodSimilarly it has not been revealed so that the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousness might be grasped or not graspedThey teach quintillions of samādhis Throughout the ten directionshaving made his firm resolveThe sage took up his robes and bowl And was prepared like the maned lionRemember do not forget you who are of infinite renownFour times shoutingdistance is one leagueAt the time the dharmabhāṇaka bhikṣu Varaprabha who held his teachingThey dwell in the supreme city of the Dharma They who are wise raise up the banner of the Dharma the Form of hundreds thousands Tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of tips of hairIn fact all the gradual practices of awakening are my witnessesThe Bhagavān has said there is but one liberationA sentient being does not exist nor does a living beinga tathāgata rarely teaches this kind of Dharma āriputra believe me I am speaking the truthMaster if that is how you feel you should keep half of this village and I shall keep claim to the other halfthose who are tied to one more rebirthOn the paths of the triple universe One will attract and engage with All those who are known as noblewomen By means of oblation and the diagramI do not want to be enslaved or seized or encounter other kinds of harmIn this way they taught without teaching this Dharma teaching which abides within both the ultimate and the relative truthsdefinitively perceive all things in the manner of a dream and all things in the manner of a phantom and so onThings are not apprehended because the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are nonapprehensibleIn this way they regard the realms of sentient beings in accordance with reality perceiving the virtuous and unvirtuous actions in the realms of sentient beingsIn that way he made the main road of Rājagṛha up to the town free of stones pebbles and gravelTheir eyes are plucked out their faces disfigured And their teeth are broken Rākṣasas have their noses and ears severed Their tongues severed and their faces wrinkled Their hands and feet are chopped off And their heads are cut offOne should drink the root of winter cherry with clarified butter Then one will become pregnantIt was adorned and beautified by balconies porticoes entranceway arches windows upper pavilions towers and gardenshow could I go forth into the mixed caste order of the ascetic sons of the ākyaMañjuśrī how will they abideThe Blessed One then uttered these versesThose now present in my assembly Are pure and free of the chaffWhat is skillfulness in answers It is the knowledge of replies and rejoindersApply the last of the syllables and fix in place the five seedsWhich was beautified by being webbed and had markings of a vase and hook A knot of eternity a wheel a victory banner a flag and fishes iiFull in complexion and strong Accordingly one thrashes and runs aboutDevout the just king ruled justlyAt that time fearlessly and joyfully Having abandoned every hesitationread it aloud or make offerings to itthey will have the confidence that comes from studying the sacred doctrine andThe road was shaded at the height of seven palm trees with a jeweled latticework and adorned with divine parasols flags and bannersAnother made a pledge to become his studentAnd they do not increase their defilements The ones who live in a forest gain these benefits Similarly it has not been revealed so that the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of tastes and the sensory element of gustatory consciousness might be grasped or not graspedFriends since perfect and complete buddhas of the past all produced and manifested a signSimilarly this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to the sensory element of the eyesFrom all worlds and realms came bodhisattvas desiring the Dharmanor a monk of five years nor a monk of six years nor a monk of seven years nor a monk of eight yearsMonks at that moment the Bodhisattva realized that everyone in the city was sound asleepSo since the Blessed One had given him the opportunity the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya asked the Blessed OneWhat are these sixhow then could they possibly apprehend or consider the essence of those attributes from the transcendent perfection of wisdom to omniscienceand others were prattling incoherently Some others were gnashing their teethSimilarly the emptiness of the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness is not the sensory element of visual consciousness and the aforementioned sensory elementsThe divine princes of the Yāma realmThey will also smell the aromas of desire Anger hypocrisy and peaceful mindsfor the mothers family is not pure nor is the fathersSubhūti just as all phenomena attributes and attainments up to and including the expanse of nirvāṇa accommodate countless innumerable sentient beingsThose who long for peace and emptiness Should possess this Dharma of the jinas Those persons who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas making such dedications will settle into the levels of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhasAnavatapta and Utpalakanot being weary of gathering the qualities of the factors of awakeningKnowing the subtle nature of phenomena They will always have a completely pure memory They do not attach importance to the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations or the formless absorptionsthis craving for the sacred doctrine in the case of great bodhisattva beings is indicative of their immaturitySimilarly it should be applied to all the meditative stabilities and also to all the gateways of mnemonic incantationso it is that they correctly perceive the arising of perceptionsBy the method of a shooting starfor all harvests of the roots of virtue like the earthMañjuśrī how does one tame the disturbing emotionsProstrations to the bodhisattva of the northwest Exalted JewelUnderstand the method of the Tathāgata Through the teaching of this analogyAlthough they indeed ascertain how calm and how profound these phenomena all are they do not become discouraged but think Let us attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to these phenomenaWhen one becomes fixed and has obtained the Dharma one applies oneself to the proper dharmaVenerable Lord What is the refined eye of flesh possessed by great bodhisattva beingsThe bhikṣu is beloved and he is beloved by me So I gave him my flesh and blood for the sake of enlightenment What is not hoarding It is renouncing material wealth and seeing it as harmful to the maintenance of correct conductFather Mother it is good for me to go forthTheir bellies hands and feet were deformed and their faces brimmed with vehement ardorListenthe heat elementWhat is the doctrine which having realized all these things would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentJust as space the air is undefiled Has a pure nature and is vast and brightwhy do we use the names Acala Immovable as well as Ekallavīra Sole Hero andRather they receive ordination based on investigating the virtues involved in thatIt was bestrewn with lotuses of gold from the Jambū River scented with aromatic essences and covered by a jewel canopyThe maṇḍala should be known as hisnever stop worshiping and venerating the saṅghaYou shall awaken to the incomparable wisdom of the victorious ones
