never sorrows at all A pathknower practising rightlyBut a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma to others with the thought The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One directly visible immediate inviting one to come and see applicable to be personally experienced by the wiseBut are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair would not arise in you in such an eventBut as to the future friendBut for the good it is disclosed It is light here for those who seeBut have I not already declared Ananda that we must be parted separated and severed from all who are dear and agreeable to usBut having fully understood what can be expressed One does not conceive one who expressesBut here headman a Tathagata arises in the world an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed OneBut here

for the unsurpassed security from bondage that they still have work to do with diligence in regard to the six bases for contactBut if one has removed aggressionBut if they do not accept it from you then to whom does the food belongBut if with a mind clear and pureBut if you cannot recall the Buddha Best in the world the bull of men Then you should recall the Dhamma Emancipating well expoundedBut

way dear sir do you know emancipation release seclusion for beingsBut is it possible to give a simile Master GotamaBut is it possible to give a simile venerable sirBut mindfulness bhikkhus I say is always useful But now like headmen in a villageBut now like headmen in a villageBut now Kassapa the elder bhikkhus are no longer forest dwellers and do not speak in praise of forest dwelling   they are no longer energetic and do not speak in praise of arousing energyBut one here who leads the holy life Having expelled merit and evil Who fares in the world with comprehensionBut that deed is well performedBut the Blessed One is far away friendBut the instructed noble disciple  does not regard form as self  nor feeling as self  nor perception as self  nor volitional formations as self  nor consciousness as selfBut the wise as it were drink it upBut theres one born in the Sakyan clan The Enlightened One without an equal Conqueror of all Maras subduer Who everywhere is undefeated Everywhere freed and unattached The One with Vision who sees allBut these have fallen claiming We reciteBut those who have peace and acquiescenceBut those who understand suffering Who know too sufferings origin And where suffering completely stops Where it ceases without remainderBut we do not see Master Gotamas yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen yet Master Gotama says I too brahmin plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eatBut what do you see Evil One that you speak thus to meBut what one has done by body Or by speech or mindBut what chamberlains is that other confinement to which you are subject which is even more confining and considered more confining than the former oneBut what venerable sir is that conflagration more terrible and frightful than that oneBut what venerable sir is that darkness greater and more frightful than that oneBut what venerable sir is that one thingBut what venerable sir is that precipice steeper and more frightful than that oneBut when he has transcended this The mindful disciple of the BuddhaBut when one has obtained the pathBut when one sees with correct wisdomBut when sacrifices free from violenceBut when the

there is this aginganddeath is another or The soul and the body are the same or The soul is one thing the body is anotherall these are abandoned cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated

who pierce as it really is This is suffering  who pierce as it really is This is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingBut Anuradha when the Tathagata is not apprehended by you as real and actual here in this very life is it fitting for you to declare Friends when a Tathagata is describing a Tathagatathe highest type of person the supreme person the attainer of the supreme attainmenthe

the way leading to its cessation it is possible that they will abide having transcended aginganddeathBut bhikkhus by directly knowing and fully understanding the all by developing dispassion towards it and abandoning it one is capable of destroying sufferingBut bhikkhus I say that one in whom these five faculties are completely and totally absent is an outsider one who stands in the faction of worldlings But bhikkhus I say this If you have gone to a forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut and fear or trepidation or terror should arise in you on that occasion you should recollect me thus The Blessed One is an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and

eating almsfood they were ragrobe wearers and spoke in praise of wearing ragrobes they were triplerobe users and spoke in praise of using the triple robe they were of few wishes and spoke in praise of fewness of wishes they were content and spoke in praise of contentment they were secluded and spoke in praise of solitude they were aloof from society and spoke in praise of aloofness from society they were energetic and spoke in praise of arousing energyKassapa one formerly belonging to another sect who desires the going forth and the higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on

From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life Mahanama when a lay follower has gone for refuge over a long time to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha how could he go to the nether worldMahanama when over a long time a lay follower has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha how could he go to the nether world Mahanama over a long time Sarakani the Sakyan had gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha so how could he go to the nether worldMany are the disciples of the BuddhaMany feelings flourish within Originating from the visible form Covetousness and annoyance as wellMaster Bharadvaja what is the cause and reason why these young bhikkhus lads with black hair endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life who have not dallied with sensual pleasures lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously Master Gotama even those ascetics and brahmins who are the heads of

have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind let alone those that have not been recitedMaster Gotama what is the cause and reason why the true Dhamma does not endure long after a Tathagata has attained final NibbanaMaster Gotama what is the cause and reason why these various speculative views arise in the world The world is eternal or The world is not eternal or The world is finite or The world is infinite or The soul and the body are the same or The soul is one thing the body is another or The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathMaster Gotama when a flame is flung by the wind and goes some distance what does Master Gotama declare to be its fuel on that occasionMaster Kaccana said with sense doors unguardedMastery is sovereignty in the worldMetre is the scaffolding of versesMigajala even though a bhikkhu who dwells thus lives in the vicinity of a village associating with bhikkhus and bhikkhunis with male and female lay followers with kings and royal ministers with sectarian teachers and their disciples he is still called a lone dwellerMigajala even though a bhikkhu who dwells thus resorts to forests and groves to remote lodgings where there are few sounds and little noise desolate hidden

rivers there arethat is the Ganges the Yamuna the Aciravati the Sarabhu the Mahall slant slope and incline towards the east so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants slopes and inclines towards Nibbana The Venerable Ananda saw the Venerable Sariputta coming in the distance and said to him Friend Sariputta your faculties are serene your complexion is pure and bright Then referring to the bhikkhu Katamorakatissaka the independent brahma Suddhavasa recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One  This is what is not a bhikkhus own resort but the domain of others thus this aging and this death are together called aginganddeath unless he were mentally deranged What is the source of these volitional formations what is their origin from what are they born and produced who are covetous  who bear ill will  of wrong view come together and unite with those of wrong view who are uncovetous  without ill will  of right view come together and unite with those of right view With its deliverance he understands Clinging has been exhausted by me With its deliverance he understands Clinging has been exhausted by me your son With ignorance as condition volitional formations With volitional formations as condition consciousness  Is consciousness permanent or impermanent  It is because these four establishments of mindfulness are not developed and cultivated  are developed and cultivated that the true Dhamma endures long after a Tathagata has attained final Nibbana  These four establishments of mindfulness when developed and cultivated lead to going beyond from the near shore to the far shore  With the cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formationsEverything in the three realms is nothing but mind The expressionsmind mental faculty awareness and appearance are synonyms Here the term mind is meant to include associated mental factors  The expression nothing but is meant to rule out the existence of external objects Verse  This is all appearance only for even nonexistent objects are presented to us as for instance a person with faulty vision sees unreal hair etc What is being said If colorappearances are produced not by the colors themselves but in their absence then why are such appearances produced at some places and not everywhere Even then they are produced only sometimes and not always perceived by people with faulty vision fail to be causally efficacious in the way hair flies etc should be But others ie the hair flies etc seen by people with normal vision are causally efficacious in that way The production of appearances at particular times and places is established just as in the case of dreams In dreams even without the presence of any external object certain objects like flies gardens women men etc are seen only at certain places and not everywhere Even when a particular place is fixed they are only seen only at certain times in the course of those dreams and not always Hence even without the presence of any external object appearances may arise only at particular places and times The production of appearances across different minds is established just as in the case of hungry ghosts When placed in the same predicament with respect to the ripened fruit of their previous acts all hungry ghostsand not just one of themsee a river full of pus They also see a river full of urine and excrement governed by men armed with swords and clubs etc The analogy is that even though there is no sexual intercourse in a dream the dreamer still discharges semen  In the same manner the four constraints on appearances namely the production of appearances at particular places and their production at particular times etc are established by other examples too All four constraints on appearances are established as in the case of hell How is the analogy with hell established Verse   Through the perception of the wardens of hell etc and through torture at their hands The inhabitants of hell undergo visions of hellwardens And even though hellwardens dont exist the suffering that the hellwardens cause to the inhabitants of hell is still established  for the ripened fruit of their past morally equivalent acts holds sway  The Argument for Idealism Then why is it to be understood that the Buddha spoke about the existence of the external bases of sensory cognition like color intending to convey that there is no external object which is presented by each appearance eg by the appearance of color Because Verse  This object cannot be simple nor can it be a plurality of atoms What is being said The external basis of sensory cognition such as colour etc which appears as an object of our awareness can be simple eg the partpossessing form accepted by the Vaiśeṣikas Neither can a plurality of atoms be the object of awareness because we are never aware of an individual atom Nor can a unified collection of atoms be the object of awareness because the status of an atom as a simple substance isnt established Why not If an atom could be simultaneously conjoined to six other atoms on its six sides then it would have six parts If an atom could simultaneously be conjoined to six other atoms on its six sides so as to produce a composite object then each atom would have six parts for the region which is in contact with one atom cannot be occupied by another Moreover if the six atoms were to occupy the same location the composite object consisting of the atoms would also be an atom The Kashmiri Vaibhāṣikas  say Atoms are not conjoined to each other because they dont have parts So this unacceptable consequence doesnt follow  Rather unified collections of atoms are in contact with each other They are to be asked this A unified collection of atoms isnt something distinct from the atoms themselves If atoms cannot be conjoined whose conjoining do we see in unified collections of atoms   An independently existing thing or entity see substance So unified collections of atoms cannot be established by appeal to the conjoining of atoms because atoms have no parts Well even unified collections of atoms are not conjoined to each other Therefore it cannot be said that the reason why the conjoining of atoms cannot be established is that they dont have parts for even the conjoining of unified collections of atomswhich are objects with parts cannot be accepted If no individual atom were spatially extended how could shadows be cast at dawn at one place and sunlight at another For the atom would have no region which was untouched by sunlight How could one atom be concealed by another atom if atoms were not spatially extended For in that case there wouldnt be any front region of an atom such that when another atom arrives at that region it blocks the original one If one atom didnt block another all unified collections of atoms would be reduced to a single atom III Against Composite Wholes Why dont you accept that only composite wholes are subject to shadows and concealment If you dont accept the view that the composite whole is distinct from its constituent atoms then the shadows and the concealment are not properties of the composite object As long as the defining characteristics such as color etc  Being an object detected by the eye etc and being blue etc Is the thing which is blue yellow etc and which is also taken to be the object of visual perception etc a simple substance or a plurality If one imagines that the object of visual perception is just one unbroken substancenot many then gradual traversal across the earth would be impossible where traversal means motion for in a single step the whole earth would be traversed Nor could elephants horses etc which are separate and distinct be located at different places for wherever one was there would be the other Or  how could the places that they occupy and do not occupy be one given that empty space is apprehended between them Thus we have to accept that different substances can differ with respect to their atomic compositions Hence these are nothing but appearances If there is no external object then how does the thought  perceived  arise When the perceptual thought arises in the form This object is perceived by me then the external object isnt seen for it is by mental awareness that the object is then discerned since visual awareness by then has ceased This principle namely that only directly apprehended objects can be recalled cannot be established because Verse  If appearances that arise when one is awake were about unreal objects just like appearances produced in dreams then one would oneself recognize the nonexistence of such objects This doesnt happen The absence of objects in dreams isnt recognized unless one is awake The ordinary personenwrapped in the sleep of traces left by her habits of false imaginative constructionsees as in dreams unreal objects Thus she fails to recognize the absence of such objects in that unawakened state Then faced with the purified worldly awareness that arises as a result of that transcendent awareness she recognizes the absence of external objects IV Causation and Moral Responsibility If appearances are produced in sentient beings not by external objects but rather by events within their own minds then how can we establish that particular appearances arise in particular sentient beings from the company of good or bad friends or from hearing good or bad teaching If the appearances produced in a wakeful state have no object just like appearances produced in a dream then why do good and bad acts performed in wakeful states and dreams not have the same desirable and undesirable consequences in the future In dreams the mind languishes in a state of torpor that is why the fruits of acts are different  If all this is just appearance then no one has a body or speech Then how do butchers kill approaching sheep If they do not kill the sheep why are the butchers subject to the sin of killing  Verse  Death is a change brought about by a mental event that arises in another being just as certain mental powers of demons bring about the loss of memory etc in others The mental powers of demons can induce loss of memory dreams and possession by spirits in others for example Sāraṇa saw a dream due to the influence of rya Mahakātyāyana while the mental sins of the forestdwelling sages led to the conquest of Vemacitra  Analogously it is to be understood that due to the influence of one beings mental events a change opposed to the life of another being arises This interruption of the homogeneous continuum that constitutes the mind of the latter being is called death How else could the Danḍaka Forest have been emptied owing to the anger of the sages if one doesnt accept that mental events of one being can bring about the death of another The householder Upāli was asked by the Buddha who wanted to establish the sinfulness of mental torture O householder have you heard that the Danḍaka Forest the Forest of Mātaṅga and the Forest of Kaliṅga were emptied and turned into grounds fit for sacrificial rites And he said I have heard o Gautama If one imagines that the beings living in those forests were destroyed by demonic creatures who were pleased with the sages and not killed by the mental sins of the sages then how can that action establish that mental torture is the greatest sin It can only be established if the death of those beings came about solely due to the mental sins of the sages IV Our Knowledge of Other Minds If all this is just appearance do knowers of other minds become aware of other minds or not If they are not aware of other minds how are they knowers of other minds Well then they are aware of other minds Awareness of other minds is illusory Just like ones awareness of ones own mind Because ones own mind is unknown to one in the manner in which it is known to the Buddhas Since one isnt acquainted with the ineffable manner in which the mind both anothers and ones own is known to the Buddhas ones awareness of both anothers and ones own minds turns out to be illusory for the misleading appearance of a distinction between the graspable object and the grasping awareness isnt dispelled Even though the doctrine of appearanceonly is comprised of innumerable theories and distinctions and is unfathomably profound Verse  I have established the doctrine of appearanceonly according to my capacities but it is in fact not thinkable in its entirety This doctrine under all its aspects is grasped by the supreme Buddhas for nothing stands in the way of their grasping graspable things of all forms From the delusion of self and dharmas Comes the conveyence of various manifestations These are supported and transformed by consciousness And there are only three of these which may transform The first of these is the laya Consciousness Which is retribution as well as all the seeds It is undefiled and morally indeterminate Mental contact and the others are also like this Its conveyence is like that of a flowing stream And it is abandoned in the stage of the arhat Next is the second which is able to transform And this consciousness is called Manas It is supported by the previous conveyence And its character and nature are that of thought It is always associated with the four vexations Which are delusion of a self perception of a self Identity with a self and love of a self As well as mental contact and the others In the Nirodha Sampatti of the arhats And in the Supramundane Path it does not exist Next is the third which is able to transform Which is distinguished into six different divisions Its appearance and nature are perceiving external objects And these may be good bad or indeterminate It is associated with omnipresent mental activities With the external objects the good the vexations The secondary vexations and the undetermined And it is associated with all three feelings Omnipresent mental activities are mental contact etc Next are those with objects which are desires Determination mindfulness samdhi wisdom etc And the object of each of these is not the same The vexations are desire hatred Delusion pride doubt and wrong views The secondary vexations are anger Hostility obscuration anger jealousy greed Deceit harmful flattery arrogance Lack of shame lack of conscience Acting upon agitations torpor A lack of faith laziness Negligence as well as forgetfulness Distraction and incorrect knowing The undetermined are remorse sleep And both types of initial and sustained thought With their basis in the root consciousness The five consciousnesses manifest according to conditions These manifestations may occur together or separately Just as waves are formed upon the water These various consciousnesses are transformed As discrimination and that which is discriminated And with this basis they are all empty Thus they are all Consciousness Only Through the consciousness of all seeds There are suchandsuch transformations And from the power of this conveyence Thisandthat are produced by discrimination Due to the habit energy of various actions Along with the habit energy of dualistic grasping Even when earlier retributions are exhausted Still the renewed arising of retribution occurs From this and that imagination One imagines all kinds of objects These pervasive imagined objects Are without actual selfnature From the selfnature of interdependence Comes discrimination arising from conditions The perfection of the fruit comes from Always being apart from the former nature Therefore in relation to the interdependent It is neither different nor is it not different Just like the nature of impermanence etc And when one is not perceived the other is On the basis of the three kinds of selfnature Is established the threefold absence of selfnature Thus the Buddha spoke with the hidden intent That all dharmas are without nature The first is the naturelessness of characteristics The next is the naturelessness of selfexistence The last is the detachment from the first When the natures of self and dharmas are grasped Because its nature is eternally so It is the true nature of Consciousness Only So long as one has not given rise to the consciousness Which seeks to abide in the nature of Consciousness Only Then regarding the two types of grasping dispositions He is still not yet able to subdue and extinguish them Setting up and establishing even something small And saying this is the nature of Consciousness Only Because there is still something which is grasped It is not truly abiding in Consciousness Only When one regards that which is conditioned With the wisdom of total nonappropriation Then at that time one abides in Consciousness Only Apart from the duality of grasping at appearances Without grasping and not conceptualizing This is the wisdom of the supramundane realm Which abandons the coarseness of duality And naturally attains transformation of the basis This itself is the realm of no outflows Inconceivable good and eternal The peaceful and blissful body of liberation And what the great Muni called the Dharma Who created the variety of the world of living beings and the receptacleworld which we have described in the preceding chapter It was not a god who intelligently created it The variety of the world arises from action But in this hypothesis how does it happen that actions produce at one and the same time pleasing thingssaffron sandalwood etcon the one band and bodies of quite opposite qualities on the other The actions of beings whose conduct is a mixture of good and bad actions produce bodies resembling abscesses whose impurities flow out through the nine gatesand in order to serve as a remedy to these bodies they also produce objects of pleasing ejoyment colors and shapes odors tastes and tangibles But the gods haveaccomplished only good actions their bodies and their objects of enjoyment are equally pleasing kk What is action It is volition and that which is produced through volition The sūtra says that there are two types of action volition and the action after having been willed Action after having been willed is what the kārikādesignates by the wods that which is produced through volition These two actions form three actions bodily action vocal action and mental action To what does this question tend If one were to regard its support there is nothingbut an action for allactions are supported on a physical support a body If one were to regard its nature there is only vocal actio for of these threebody speech and anasonly the voice is ultimately actionby its nature The Vaibhāṣikas say that the three types of action are established by reason of all of these three causes support nature and original cause in this order Volition is mental action it gives rise to two actions bodily and vocal action Volition is called mental action that which arises from volition namely action which has been willed is made up of the two other actions bodily and vocal action These two actions are informative and noninformative Bodily action and vocal action are informative and non informative  we then have bodily informative action vocal informative action bodily noninformative actio and vocal noninformative action What action is bodily informative action b Bodily vrjñapti is shape Bodily viñapti is such and such a shape of the body by reason of a volition According to others bodily vijñapti is dis placement for it takes place when there is movement and not when there is no movement This is not so because all conditioned things re Tnoeṇtary What is understood by momentary  Kṣaṇa means to perish immediately after having acquired its being ksaṇika īs a āharma that has kṣaṇa as a daṇḍika is one who has a staff A conditioned thing does not exist beyond the acquisition of its being it perishes on the spot where it arises it cannot go from this spot to another Consequently bodily vñapti is not movement If conditioned things are momentary we would admit that they are not susceptible of displacement It is proven that they are momentary since they necessarily perish for the destruction of conditioned things is spontaneous it does not come from anything it does not depend on a cause That which ḍepends on a cause is an effect something done created Therefore destruction does not depend on a cause Destruction does not depeṅd on a cause hence a conditioned thing perishes as soon as it arises if it did not perish immediately it would not perish later since it would then remain the same Since you admit that it perishes you must admit that it immediately perishes Would you say that a conditioned thing changes and that consequently it is later subject to destruction There are many remarks to make with respect to this In fact people do not directly perceive the destruction of kindling by reason of fire If you think that kindling perishes through its relationship to fire because we no longer see the kindling when this relationship has taken place then your thesis rests on an inferenceand not on direct perception and your reasoning is not conclusive The fact that we no longer see kindling after its relationship with fire is open to two interpretations You admit that the destruction of the flame is spontaneous When after a relationship with wind the flame is no longer visible you admit that this relationship is not the cause of the destruction of the flame but you admit that the flame by virtue of this relationship stops renewing itself Therefore it is inference that should determine this question We have already said that destructionbeing a negative state cannot bpe caused We would further say that if desttuctin is the eftect of a cause nothing would not perish without a cause If like arising destruction proceeds from a cause it would never take place without a cause Now we hold that intellgence a flame or a ṣound which are momentary perish without their destruction de pending on a cause Hence the destruction of the kindling etc is spontaneous The Vaibhāṣikas maintain that an earlier thought perishes by reason of a later thought that earlier sound perishes by reason of later sound But the two thoughts in question are not simultaneous Some contradictory thoughtsdoubt and certainty pleasure and suffering love and hatedo not displace one another and the same holds for noncontradictory thoughts And if you suppose that they do contradict one another then how can weak dharmas destroy strong dharmas of the same typeas when weak thoughts or sounds immediately follow strong thoughts or sounds Some think that a flame perishes through the absence of a cause of duration ccording to the Vaiśeṣikas flame perishes by reason of dharma anṇd adharma merit and demerit This explanation is inadmissible Dharma and adharmma would both be causes of arising and of destruction Furthermore since this manner of explaining destruction would hold for all conditioned things it is useless to pusue the discussion If one holds that the destruction of the kindling etc has for its cause the relationship of this kindling with fire one would then be forced to acknowledge that a cause that engenders is at the same time a cause that destroys Cooking  or a relationship with fire produces different products  of deeper and deeper color The same cause that produces the firstcolor destroys this firstcolor or at leastif you object that it refers to a new relationship with fire since the fire is momentarythe cause that destroys the first color is similar to the cause that produces it Now it is impossible that a certain cause would produce a certain effect and that later this same causeora parallel cause would destroy this same effect Would you say that if the successive flames are differentlong short large andsmallour conclusion does notbecome indispensable By the prolonged action of ashes snovw caustics sun water or earth there arises and disappears in turn different products of cooking Some ask why water diminishes when it is beated if a relationship with fire is not destruction of the water By reason of its relationship with fire through the foce of the fire the heat elementwhich is present in water increases and increasing causes the mass of water to be reborn inquantities more and more reduced until being totally reduced the water ceases renewing itself This is what a relationship with fire does to water itself The destruction of things is spontaneous Things perish in and of themselves because it is their nature to perish As they perish in and of themselves they perish upon arising As they perish upon arising they are momentary Thus there is no movemenṇt no displacement there is only arising in another place of the second moment of the series this is the case even in the opinion of our opponent for the fire which consumes firewood The idea of movement is a false conception kksk The Sautrāntikas say that shape is nota distinct thinga thing in and of itself For theSautrāntikas shape does not exist as a substance but only as a designation When there arises in one directiona large mass of color this mass is called long When by comparison a mass of color is small it is called short When a color arises in a great quantity in the four directions it is called square When it arises equally in all directions it is called circuler Shape is thus not a thing in and of itself a npa First argument If shape were a thing in and of itself It would be perceived by two organs Now according to the scriptural definition rūpāyaana the visible physical matter is perceived by only the eye but exactly the same holds for the visible one calls a visible or a tangible arraṇged in a certain manner long When we have the idea of length after having touched something we are not perceiving shape through touch we remember the shape because it is associated with a tangible It is the same when we see the color of firefor we then remember heat  and when we smell the odor of flowerwe then remember its color But a tangible is not iavariably associated witha certain shape how then does the perception of a tangible provoke the rememberance of a certain shape If a similar remembrance is produced without there having been an invariable association betweena tangible and its shape one would in this same manner remember color after having touched something But such is not the case Hence one must not say that the perception of a tangible provokes the remembrance of its shape Second argument One sees many shapes in a multicolored piece of cloth Thus there would be according to you many rpas in the category of shape inone and the same piece this is impossible as itwas for color ow Shape does not exist in an atom There is no atom of length In fact when a long mass diminishes we arrive at the moment when we no longer have the idea of long with regard to it but rather the idea of short Therefore what we designate as long is number of real thingsatoms of coloraranged in a certain manner If you maintain that the expressions long etc refer to some atoms of shape arranged in a certainmanner and thatsome atoms that would not be shape by nature could not be designated as long etcthis is merely repeating your affirmation without the support of any argument In fact if the existence of special atoms of shape were proved you wouldbe able to maintain that united arranged in a certain fashion they constitute length but since the existence of these atoms has not been proved as the existence of the atoms of color has been proved how could they be united and arranged If a shape is not distiact in color if a shape is nothing other than a certain color then shapes would not differ when their color is the same now somne jugs of the same color have different shapes Somne ants all similar arrange themselves in a straight line or in a ciccle and so present different shapes But in darkness or at a distance one sees the shape of an objecta colum a person etc without seeing its color Hence shape exists separate from color This army is arranged in a circle O rather it happens that one does not clearly distinguish either color or shape one only knowsthrough the mental consciousnessa mass You Sautrāntikas negate both movement and shape Then what is designated by the term bodily vṝjñapñ Bodily action is theaction which has for its object thebody itproceeds by being supported on this gate which is the body and is thus called bodily action If bodily action and vocal action are volition what difference is there between the two types of action defined in this scripture There are two types of volition First the initial or preparatory stagewherein one produces a volition which is pure volition I must do such and such an action this is what the Scripture calls cetanākarman action which is volition Then afteṛ this stage of pure volition one produces a volition of action the volition of doing an action in conformity with what has been previously willed to move the body or to emit a voice If this is the case then informative action does not exist And if viñapti does not exist then vjñaptinoninformation of the sphere of Kāmadhātudoes not exist These difficulties can be refuted Avñapri is explained very well in our system This s generis volition is subordinate to the mind  like the eviñapti which in our system arises from dhyāna for the avijñapti of Kāmadhātu develops during sleep etc No for this s generis volition is projected bya certain volitionof decision  its distant cause and by a certain volition of action and voice its near cause Now however you woūld have it that the vijñaptiift it existswould depend like the projectionof the evjñapti on the force of the thought for it is itself nonintelligent kksk The Vaibhāṣikas say that shape exists in and of itself and thatbbodily vijñapti is shape Vocal vijñapti is vocal sound Sound whidch is discourse by naturethat is articulated sound is voca viñapti kṣk Avijñapti has already been defined because it solely consists of not doing an action after having undertaken not to do it  because one designates a thing which would exist by reasonof past primatry elements as evijñapti now past dharmas no longer exist  and because avjñapti does not have the nature of pa the nature of rūpa is rūpyate and since the aviñapti is not susceptible of destruction  it cannot be rūpa Scrīpture says that rāpa is of three types and that there is a pure vpa there is increase of merit and there is a course of action for him who is not concerned with himself etc A scripture says that there are three types of rpa Rpa is embraced within a threefold rpa there is visible rūpa susceptible of destruction  there is an invisible rpa susceptible of destruction  and there is an invisible rp free from destruction and this latter can only be the gvjñapti The BlessedOnesaid in a scripture that there is pure rpa What are the pure dharmas All rūpa of the past the future and the present all consciousness of the past future present concerning which there arises neither affection nor antipathy these are the pure dharmas Now apart from avjñapti there exists no rpa which can be invisible and free from destruction and no rāpa which is pure A scripture says that there is an increase of merit   There are seven mateial meritorious works when a believer son o daughter of good family who is endowed walks stands still sleeps or is awake his merit increases with intensity without ceasingmerit continues adding to itself By reason of what dharma other than the avjñapti could merit increase even when the mind is not good or when one is without thought f avijñapti does not exist he who does not himself act who gives orders to others will not be endowed with a course of action Would one say that when the action is accomplished the action that consists of giving the order becomes a course of action But it is evident that the nature of this action is not modified by the execution of the order The Blessed One said Monks the dharmas the external sources of consciousness not included within the eleven āyatanas are invisible and are free from destruction He did not say that the dharmāyatana īs nonrūpa If avijñapś does not exist the Way no longer has eight parts for the parts samyagvākc samyakkarmānta and samyagājīva  are incompatible with absorption would disappear For a person who has assumed the vows of religion is still a Bhikṣu or Bhikṣuṇī when his mind is bad or neutral A scripture teaches that the renouncing of sin is a dike which arrests immorality An absence cannot be a dike These arguments are numerous and diverse but are not conclusive Let us examine them one by one The Sūtra teaches that rāpa is of three types The Yogācārins say that in the Dhyānasthrough the force of absorptiona rpa arises which is the object of the absorption that is which is perceived by the person in the absorption This rpa is notseen by the eye it is thus invisible it is thus free from destruction If you ask how this object of absorption can be rpa you forget that the existence of gviñapti would give rise to the same question The scripture says that there is a pure rpaThe Yogācārins maiṇtain that thepa that arises through the force of the absorption is pure since the absorption is pure But other masters maintain that the rpa of the Arhats and external rpa  are pure because they are not a support of the vices AlI that which is organ of sight all that which is visible To this one could object that the same dharmas would be impure because they are not opposed to the vices and at the same time pure because they are not a support of the vices with the unpleasant consequence that the characteristic of pure and impure would be confused No answer the Dārṣṭāṇtikas for these dharmas are not pure from the same point of view in which they are impure Further if the visible and the other āyatanas are exclusively impure why would the scripture specify The impure and pādānaprovoking rūpas the impure and upādānaprovoking dharmas are the cause of the hardening of the mind and of hypocrisy The scripture says that merit increases The ancient masters say It is in this sense that the text says Merit increases in an intense and u interrupted manṇner rmerit adds to itself But how does one explain the increase of merit in the case of noṇmaterial meritorious work by reason of the repetition of volitions having for their object Even during dreamms these volitions are linked together On the contrary we do not see how the partisans of a avirñaptican explain the growth of merit in the case of nonmaterial meritorious work But according to other masters in the case also of material meritorious works merit proceeds from the repetition of a volition having for its object But this opinion is inadmissible in light of the scripture which says When an energetic Bhtkṣu endowed with morality possessor of good dharmas eats the alms of a donor he then enters into and dwells in the absoption called infinites  and by reason of this fact there is certainly produced for the donor an outflowing of merit and outflowing of good and prosperity Now does the donor whose merit thus continues to increase have a special volition whose object is the person who receives This holds likewise when one acts for oneself when the course of action is achieved at this moment the series undergoes a transformation This transformation is called course of action and consequently the person whose series is transformed is endowed with the course of actionfor the effect receives the name which belongs more properly to the cause and this transformation is called bodily or vocal accordingly as it results from an action of the body or the voice It is by virtue of these same principles that the partisans of evijñapti consider the avjñapti as a bodily or vocal course of action A person is touched by the sin of murder by reason of a tritemporal volition with regard to the skandhasr which constitute a living being  that is when he thinks I shall kill I kill he is killed But this triple volition does not necessarily bring about the achievement of the course of action for according to the theory of the Bhadanta there would be a mortal sin for the child who says my mother has been murdered if she has not in fact been killed by the emissary charged with the murder Nevertheless all this exercise of volition I shall kili I kill he is killed applies only to the person who kills the intention of the Bhadanta is to refer to this type of murder But why do you in your antipathy deny the existence of the gvñapti and yet admit a transformation of the mental series  I thus have no antipathy But tosay that there arisesat the moment of the achieving of the course of action by a bodily operationdependent on amind a certain dharma called aviñapti either from the mind of him who has ordered or separate from the body of him who has accomplished the murder is a hypothesis that cannot satisfy us but to say that there is produced at the moment of the achievement of the course of action by an operation ordered by a ceṛtain person a transformation of the mental series of this person is a hypthesis that satisfies us And it also satisfies us that the result arises from a transformation of the series and not from an avjñapti if the viñapt does not exist  The dharmāyatanais not defined as nonmaterial The response to this objection is as has been given above there is an invisible rpa free from destruction forming part of the dharmāyatana this is not the avijñapti this is a ppa which is the object of the absorption and which arises from the force of the absorption The Way say the Vaibhāṣikas would not have eight parts How does the saintwhen he has attained the Way possess correct speechaction and livelihood Does he pronounce correct speechact ina correctmannet and corectly ask for the robes of a monk In the Pat the saint takes possession of certain pure avijñaptii so thatvhen he ḹeaves the contemplation it is by the force of these pure gviñaptis that he produces correct speech actions and livelihood and does not produce incoLrect speech actions and livelihood A cause takes the name of its result thus speech action and livelihood are designated as avijñapti If this is sowhy not accept my theory One gives to the cause the name of their result and we can thus affirm that the Path possesses eight parts ccording to another opinion the parts of the Path solely consist of poncommission The person who is in absorption acquires through the force of the Path definite absolute abstention This abstention which is ac quired having the pure Path as its support is pure but these are not the only real and distinct things which constitute the dharmuas there are for example the eight worldly dharmas possession and nonpossession glory and nonglory praise and blame pleasure and suffering Nonpossession of clothes of food etc is not a thing One refutes this objection according to the same principles by making a state out of the force of the intention Discipline is volition which after it has been translated into the positive action of abstaining from transgression into the pledge of no longer cornmitting transgression arrests bad actions anddisciplines the body and the voice the Prātimokṣa discipline should be understood in this manner The Vaibhāṣikas object that if the Prātimokṣa discipline is volition the monk who thinks a thought other than this thought of volition would cease being disciplined for he does not then possess the volition which disciplines This objection is worthlessIn factthe mental series is perfumed in such a way that when a thought of trasgression starts to appeatr the memory of the vow undertaken also appears And this volition has the characteristic of a dike When one is obliged not to comrmit transgression one remembers this obligation shame is present and one constrains oneself in such a manner that one does not violate morality In your system on the contrary ifimmorality is dammed up by an aviñapti independent of memory then even a persoa who has a faulty memory would not be able to commit a transgression since the avijñapti is always there Let us stop this discussion here The Vaibhāṣikas say that there exists a certain substantial thing  sui generis which is avrñaptirūpa the question is then posed whether it derives from the same primary elements which are the support of the viapti that is the primary elements of the body through which the action termed vjñapti is accomplished or if it deives from other primary elements The general rule is that all derived rpa is simultaneous to its primary elements But certain derived paof the present and the futurederive from past primary elements From the firstmoment the vjñapti of Kāmadhātu arises derived from past primary elements From this first moment on avijñapti of the sphere of Kāmadhātuin opposition to the avjñapti arisen from the dhyāna and pure avijñapti arises that is it continues to be reborn being derived from the same primary elements of the first moment which are now past In the same way the hand that has hurled the wheeland the ground that the supports the wheel are the causesrespectively of the prevṛzti and the anuvṛtti of the movement of the wheel When impure bodily and vocal action derive from the primary elements of the sphere to which they belong Bodily and vocal actions of Kāmadhātu derive from the primary elements of Kāmadhātu aṇd so on to the bodily and vocal actions of the Fourth Dhyāna which derives from primary elements of the Fourth Dhyāṇa When they are pure they are from the primary elements of the sphere to which the person who has produced them belongs When they are pure bodily and vocal action derives from the primary elements of the sphere where the person who produces arises for the pure dharmas are transcendent to the sphere of existence kk What are the characteristicss of these two actions vñapt and avijñapti The aviñaptiis not integral to the organism it is also an outflowing itbelongs solely to livingbeings Not of absorption it derives from the primary elements which are an outflowing which are integral to the organism which are differentiated  The avijñapti is a derived rūpa exempt from mass  nonextended  thus it cannot be a support of the mind and of mental states thus it is axepātta not integral to the sense oganisrm The avrñapti is never moally neutral  the fitst pure aviñapti is not an outflowing Not absorbed or in other words belonging to Kāmadhātu it derives from primary elements which are an outflowing and which are integral to the organism These primary ekements are differentiated because each of the seven avñaptis the renouncing of killing etc which form the Prātimokṣa discipline derive from a distinct group of the four primary elements Arisen from absorption it derives from nondifferentiated primary elements not integral to the organism and increase Avjñapti which arises from samādhi is divided into two types that is absorption and pure discipline These two botharise from saādhi are of increaseand not integral to the sense organism They are both arisen from undifferentiated primary elements In the same way that the mind which engenders these renouncings is a unity the primary elements upon which the renouncings are based constitute a unity The vijñapti is an outflowing being bodily it is integral to the organism Does bodily vjñapti by arising destroy or not destroy the preexistent bodily figure which is retribution  The two hypotheses create difficulties That it destroys it is impossible for it is contrary to the principles of the Vaibhāṣikas that a rpa retribution by nature continues again after having been interrupted If on the contrary bodily vsjñapt does bot destroy the previous figure two figaresthe first of retribution the second of out flowingwould be found to coexist in one and the same spot We must admit that bodily viñapti arises deriving from new primary elements outflowing in its nature and that it does not destroythe previous figure If this is the case the part by means of which a bodily vrñapti is produced would be greater than has existed previously being pene trated by new primary elements from whence this viñapti derives We could answer that the bodyretribution in naturepresents some voids  to which sphere do they belong The avijñapti is never neutral It is either good or bad In fact neutral volition is weak it is not capable of engendering a powerful action as is the vrñapti which continues reproducing itself after its initial cause has disappeared Other action are of three types Other actions namely volition and the vñapti can be good bad or eutral Bad action exists in Kāmadhātu Not in the other spheres for in the other spheres the three roots of evil  and noshame and imprudence  are missing The restriction of the stanza refers only to bad actions hence good actions and neutral actions are in all of the Three Dhātus Avṣjñapti also exists in Rūpadhātu in Kāmadhātu as well as in Rāpadhātu not in rūpyadhātu for the primary elements are missing there Only where body and voice exist do we find is the discipline of the body and voice There are no pure primary elements and yet there is a pure aviñaptiPure avijñapti derives from the primary elements of the sphere wherein the person arises who produces the pure vijñaptin the same way when a person arisen in Kāmadhātu and Rūpadhātu enters into an ārūpya absoption he produces an avijñapti of rūpyadhātu deriving from the primary elements of Kāmadhātu or Rūpadhātu The case is not the same for the pure avñapti ttranscends the spheres it has nothing in common with the defilements of the sphere where the personwho has produced it is found it is neither of the same type nor of adifferent type through rapport with the primary elements of the sphere On the contrary an avājñapti of rūpyadhātu cannot derive from the primary elements of a different typeof Kāmadhātuor Rūpadhātu Further turning away from all āpasince any idea of rūpa is absent in itan ārūpya absoption is not capable of producing an avijñapti which is rūpa Morality exists in opposition to immorality But the ārāpyas are removed from Kāmadhātu by the four estrangements of āśraya prakara āālambana pratipakṣa Vijñapti exists in the two spheres where there is vcāra There is vñapti bodily and a vocal action only in the spheres of Kāmadhātu and the FirstDhyāna where there is vicāra The vjñapti termed njvrta is also missing in Kāmadhātu  defiled but neutral Also in the spheres where there is no vicāra and also in Kāmadhātu of the anivṛtāvyākrta class exists only in the world of Brahmā It is reported that Mahābrahmā produced a false vocal action in his assembly Mahābrahmā boasted falsely in order to avoid the inquires of the venerable Aśvajit ksek But if vocal avjñapti is absent above the First Dhyāna how can sound exist in the Second Dhyāna and above It exists there but it has for its cause the external primary elements sound caused by the wind etc masters say In fact the beings who are born in these Dhyānas do not call fortha good or defiled mmind of a lower sphere by which mind they would be able to produce a good or defiled vijñaptiFor the good mind of a lower sphere is of an inferior oṛder and the defiled mind has been abandoned But defend the first opinion Why is the vjñapti whatever it may be absent above the world of Brahmā Why is the vzjñapz of the defiledneutral class absent in Kāmadhātu Because the cause which produces it is absent iIt is the mindassociated with vtarka aṇd vicāra which gives rise to the vṝjñapti such a mind is absent in the Second Dhyāna and above The nvṛtāvyākṛṣta mind gives rise to a vtjñapi of the same characteristics since this mind belongs to the class to be abandoned through Mediation Thus it does not give rise to vijñapti kkk Is it solely by reason of the nature of the mind which gives rise to themgood or bad naturethat the ḍharmuas are good or bad The dharmas are good or bad in four ways absolutely  in and of themselves  through association  and through their original cause Deliverance is absolute good Nirvāṇa being the cessation of all suffering is perfectly tranqnil andhappy hence it is absolute good Comparison like the absence of sickness The roots respect and fear are good in and of them selves The three roots of good respectand fear  independent of their associations and of their causes are good in and of themselves like a salutary medicine That which is associated is good through association The dharmas volitions and mental states which are associated with the roots of good with respect and with fear are good by association Associated with these principles they are good not associated with these principles they are not good Comparison like a drink wherein one has mixed a salutary medicine Actions etc are good by reason of their original cause Comparison like the milk of a cow which has drunk a drink mixed with a salutary medicine How can prāptis be good when they have their origin in a mind which is not good Evil is the contrary The contrary of good is as shall now be taught Sasārao existencehas for its nature the process of all suffering it is thus perfectly unhappy and so absoute evil The roots of evilthe absence of shameand imprudence are bad in themselves The dharmas associated with these principles are bad in themselves Having their origin in the roots etc and in the dharmas associated with these roots etc bodily action vocal action their characteristics and the prāptis of the baddharmuas are bad by reason of their original cause sickness unhealthy drugs etc hence can nothing which is impure be good or neutral From the absolute point of view this is true But putting oneself in the point of view of retribution the impure dharma which is not defined as to how it should be retributed is called undefined or neutral  and the impure dharma which produces an agreeable retribu tion is called good What is absolutely neutral Two entities are neutral in the absolute sense The two unconditioned things  namely space and apraṭisakhyānirodha are without ambiguity neutral The Vaibhāṣikas teach that action bodily or vocal is good or bad by reason of its original cause JThe same rule should apply to the primary elements which conṇstitute bodily or vocal action No answer the Vaibhāṣikas for the intention of the agent coresponds to the action not to the primary elements The agent entered into absorption does not have any intention with regard to the avrñapti and so does not think Let us create an gvjñapi We cannot admit that the avñapti produced by the absoption has its origin in a nonabsorbed mind which proceeds from the absorption for this mind is of another class Thus the avjjñapti produced by the absorption is not good or rather if the Vaibhāṣikas maintain that it is good they should consider as good the divine eye and the divine ear which they regard as neutral t has been said above that the mind susceptible of being abandoned through Seeing does not give rise to vsjñaprYet the Blessed One said From bad views there proceeds bad resoution bad speech bad action bad livelihood This Sūtra does not contradict this theory In fact That which gīves rise is of two types which are known as hetusamutthāna aṅd tatkṣaṇasamutthāna Samutṭhāna is that through which the action arises What is both cause and samutthāna īs hetusamuṭthānaWhat is samutthānaat the very moment of the action is ratkṣaṇasamuithāna It is thus promoter The atkṣaṇasamutthāna is second mover because it is contemporary to the action But what is the efficacy done by the tatkṣaṇasamutthāna which makes it the second mover If the ratkṣaṇasamutthāṇna is absent the action will not take place even if it was projected dies how is there vjñapti for a person free from a mind which undertakes the discipline The vññapti is clearer in him who is endowed with the mind which is at the moment of the vūñapti the second mover mind The consciousness to be abandoned through Seeing is solely agent The mind which is abandoned through Seeing is alone the agent of the viñapti because it is the cause of the mental process which gives rise to the vñapti this latter is put into motion by a thought turned inward  because to suppose that it is a seoond movet it would then follow that the rūpa created by it would also be abandoned by this Seeing And this hypothesis is in contradiction to the Abhidharma īcd is not contradicted either by vidyā  or by avidyā  For he who maintains the thesis of the abaṇndoning of pa through Seeing would not admit that rūpa is not contradicted by vidyā which has its origin ina thought to be abandoned through Seeing is itselfalso to be abandoned through Seeing then the primary elements which serve as a substrate to this rpa to this viñapti will be themselves also abandoned through Seeing for they take their origin from the same thought We deny this consequencen fact the primary elements in qestion are not good or bad by reason of the thought which gives rise to them whereas this is the case for the vñapti Or rather we admit this consequence the primary elements in question are abandoned through Seeing this is impossible The primary elements cannot be abandoned through Seeing they are no longer nottobeabandoned For the undefiled dharma is not contradicted either by vidyā or by avidyā Hence the Sūtra quoted above does not invalidate our thesis The manas susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation is twofold The mental consciousness of the hāvanāheya category isatoneand the same time both agent and mover The five are solely mover The five viiñānakāyas ae solely mover There are thus four cases The mind susceptible of being abandoned through Seeing is exclusively agent The five sense consciousnesses are exclusively mover iii The mental consciousness susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation is both promoter and mover The pure mind is neither promoter nor mover kkīṭ Is the mover of the same as the agent There is no rule on this subject From a good agent etc a mover of three types A good bad or neutral mover can come from a good agent The same for a bad or neutral agent With regard to the Muni mover of the same type With regard to the Buddha the Blessed One the mover is of the same species as the agent from a good mover a good mover from a neutreḷ agent a neutraḹl mover Or good Or rather it happens that a good mover comes out of a neutral agent whereas a neutral mover never comes out of a good agent the teaching of the Buddhas is not subject to diminution Accoding to other Schools the mind of the Buddhas is never neutral they are always in absorption their mental series is exclusively a series of good thoughts This is why the Sūtra says The Nāga is absorbed when he walks when he stands still when he dreams and when he is seated The Vaibhāṣikas say That which arises from retribution is neither of the two according to the character isties of the agent or  according to the characteristic of its mover To what does this question lead First hypothesis and the anāgrāhadrṣi are not agents the other wrong views are agents Second hypothesis The vjñapt through which a person under takes thePṛātimokṣa discipline will not be good if this person while he is receiving the ordination has a bad or neutral mind The vñapti is of the same nature as its agent when this latter is of a mind susceptible of being abandoned through MeditationIt is not of the same nature as its agent when this latter is of a mind susceptible of being abandoned through Seeing for example the thought the soul exists for in this case another agent arises between the promoter and the action  a thought susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation turned inward accompanied by vicāra and by vitarka through which for example one preaches the existence of a soul But if the action is not good bad or neutral by reason of the mover the explanation that you have given of the Sūtra does not hold You have said in effect that the Sūtra considers a wrong view as agent and thatas a consequence by affirming that a wrong view is the generator of vjñapti the Sūtra contradicts neither the principle that the mind susceptible of being abandoned through Seeing does not engender vrñapti nor its corollary that in Kāmadhātu there is no vjñapti of the defiledneutral class Oṇe must say that the Sūtra considers a wrong view as an agent to which there follows separating it from the action  another agent which is susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation This is enough on this point which has been defined above Avijñapii is threefold discipline  undiscipline anddifferent from either discipline or undiscipline It is of three types  savara discipline so called because it constrains the flix of immorality because it destroys or arrests the flux of immorality  naivasavaranāsavara Prātimokṣa discipline pure discipline discipline arising from dhyāna There are three types of discipline this is the morality of the sphere of Kāmadhātu the morality of beings of this world  the discipline produced through dhyāna is morality of the sphere of Rūpadhātu and  pure discipline which arises from the Path pure morality The Prātimokṣa is of eight types It includes the discipline of the Bhikṣu the Bhikṣuṇī the ik ṣamāṇā the rāmaṇera  the rāmaṇerikā the Upāsaka  the Upāsikā and the Upavāsastha These eightdisciplines are the Prātimokṣa disciplines thus from the point of view of the names given to them the discipline of the Pṛātimokṣa is of eight types In substance however the Pṛātimokṣa is of four types the discipline of the Bhikṣu the rāmaṇera the Upāsaka and the Upavāsastha In facī the disciplipe of the Bhikṣuṇī does not differ does not exist separately from the discipline of the Bhikṣu the discipline of the ikṣamāṇā and the rāmaṇetikā do not differ from the discipline of the rāmaṇera and the discipline of the Upāsikā does not differ from that of the Upāsaka The name changes with the gender Liṅga is yyañjana that which dīstinguishes men and women It isby reason of gender that the names Bhikṣu Bhikṣuṇī etc differ When their gender is modified the Bhīkṣu becomes a Bhikṣuṇī the Bhikṣuṇī a Bhikṣu the rāmaṇera a rāmaṇerikā the rāmaṇerikā like the īkṣamāṇābecomes a rāmaṇera the Upāsakaa Upāsikā and the Upāsikā an Upāsaka Now one cannot admit that a person by changing his genderabandons the former discipline and acquires a new one the change of gender cannot have this inflaence Thus the four female disciplines are indentical with the three male disciplines Or rather do these disciplines produced all of a piece exist separately one from the other They are not mixed for in the parts that are common to them allUpāsakas rāmaṇeras and Bhikṣus all renounce killing stealing ilicit sexuality lying intoxicating liquorsthe three dis ciplines have some distinct chaacteristics Their differencs lie in the difference of the occasions of transgression In factthe person who undertakes the observation of a greater number of rules avoids by this action itselfa greater number of occasions of intoxicationpride and of nondiligence  he avoids by this action a greater number of occasions of transgression killing etc Consequently the three series of renouncings are not identical with one another If it were otherwise ṭthatisīf the disciplines of Upāsaka andrāmaṇera were integral to the discipline of aBhikṣuthen the Bhīkṣu who renounces the discipline of a Bhikṣu would renounce at the same time all three disciplines a thesis that is not admitted Hence the disciplines exist separately But they do not contradict one another They can coexistby undertaking the following disciplinesone does not abandon the preceeding ones Thus the fact that a Bhikṣu who renounces his quality of Bhikṣu remains in possession of the discipline of Upāsaka and rāmaṇera is explained How does one become an Upāsaka an Upavāsastha a rāmaṇera or a Bhikṣu By undertaking the renouncing of the five things to avoid of the eight the ten of all the things to avoid one obtains the quality of Upāsaka Upavāsastha rāmaṇera and Bhikṣu By undertaking the renouncing of five items murder  illicit sexuality yngand  intoxicating liquorsone places himself in the discipline of an Upāsaka By undertaking the renouncing of eight items killing  anchastity lying  intoxicating liquors  scents garlands and unguents dances songs music  high beds broad beds and  These make ten items for one counts scents garlands and unguentsseparately from dances songs and music By undertaking the renouncing of all the actions of the body and the voice which should be avoided one is a Bhikṣu kṣk The Pṛātimokṣa discipline is Morality good conduct action and discipline Etymologically because it cools  as it says in the stanza Happy is the undertaking of morality because morality does not burn Good conduct because it is praised by the wise Action  because it is action by naṭure How can aviñapti be action Without doubt the aviñapti makes the disciple endowed with shame to abstain from transgression it is thus not doing But it is action according to the etymology riyata iti kriya According to othersavifñapti is action because it is thecause and the effect of an action Discipline because itdisciplines or constrains the body and the voice The expression Prātimokṣa discipline designates all Pṛātimokṣa discipline since its origin The Prātimokṣa is the first vñapti and the firstavijñapt these are courses of action The expression Prātimokṣa designates the first vrñapti and the fitst gvijñapti of the undertaking of the discipline such is the efficacy of the first moment of the undertaking of discipline They are courses of action that is courses of action properly so called There is no longer any Prātimokṣa in the moment which follows the first moment and iṇ the moments which follow for the transgression is not rejected by the second moment having been rejected by the first there is prāti mokṣasañvara that is discipline of the Prātimokṣa type or discipline arisen from Prātimokṣa there are no longer courses of action properly socalled but solely consecative action esksṣk Who possesses each of the three disciplines Eight persons possess the Prātimokṣa Eight persons theBhikṣuBhikṣunī the Upavāsatha possess the Prātimokṣa discipline Does this mean that nonBuddhists cannot possess a morality that they have undertaken In fact the morality that they undertake  tests on an idea of existence even when they have in view not a heavenly existence but that which they call deliverance  they conceive of deliverance as a certain type of existence Hence transgression is not absolutely rejected by them nor can they be released through the discipline they have undertaken kkāk He who possesses dḥyāna possesses the discipline which arises from dhyāna Which arises from dhyāna  that īs which arises from dhyāna or by means of dhyāna Dhyāna means not only the Four Principal Dhyānas but also the absorptions which are close to them In the same way when one says There is a field of rice or a field of wheat in this village one means the village and its environs kḥ The ryans possess pure discipline kksk We have seen in the definition of sahabhhetu  that two disciplines accompaṅy the mind The last two disciplines are concomitants of the mind The discipline that arises from dhyāna and the pure discpline are concomitants of the mind not of the Prātimokṣa discipline for this latter continues to exist in a person whose mind is bad or neutral or who is unconscious In the nine nantaryamārgas of anāgamya these two disciplinesthe discipline of dḥyāna and pure discipline are abandoning disciplines  for through them one abandons immorality and the defilements which produce them There are thus disciplines arisen from dhyāna which are not abandoningdiscipline Four cases Discipline arising from dhyāna impure with the exception of what arises from the ānantaryamārgas of anāgamya discipline arisen from dhyāna which is not abandoning ii Pure discipline obtained in the ānantaryamārgas of anāgamya Impure discipline in the ānantaryamārgas of anāgamya dis cipline arisen from dhyāna which is abandoning iv Pure discipline arisen outside of the ānantaryamārgas of anāgamya According to the same principles one would establish four cases relative to putre discipline which is not abandoning to abandoning which is not pure discipline etc kkk The Blessed One said Good is discipline of the body discipline of the voice discipline of the mind discipline in all things and again He lives disciplined through the discipline of the organ of sight What is the nature of these two disciplines discipline of the mind and disciplipe of the organs But on the contrary Discipline of the mind and discipline of the organs are each of them two things attentive consciousness and mindfuiness In order that the reader should not come to believe that the first discipline is consciousness and the second mindfulness  the author says that each of them is two things kḥrk Let us examine who possesses vñapts and avi ñapt and to what period these belong in each case He who is in Prātimokṣa always possesses avsjñapti of the present moment as long as the does not reject the gvijñapti As we have said previously the person who dwells in thePrātimokṣa discipline always possesses presentavjñapti as long as he does not reject the avñapti which costitutes this discipline After the first moment he also possesses avijñapti After the first moment which is designated by the expression Prṛātimokṣa  he also possesses earlier past avjñapi this of course as long as he does not reject the discipline As he who dwells in the Prātimokṣa discipline So too is he who dwells in undiscipline He who dwells in undiscipline  always possesses avijñapti of the present moment as long as he does not reject it He who possesses discipline aisen from dhyāna always possesses past and future avsjñapti He who possesses the discipline arisen from dhyāna always possesses avsjñapti of the past and vijñapti of the future as long as he does not lose i From the first moment when he acquires the discipline of dhḥyāna he takes possession of the discipline of former dhyānas either of this existence or of a previous existence that he had lost The ryan at the first moment does not posses past avijñapth The ryan possesses pure avijñapti which constitutes his pure discipline in the manner in which he who possesses the discipline arisen from dhyāna possesses the avijñapti arisen from dhyāna he possesses his past and future vjñapti but with the difference that when in the first moment of the Way he takes possession of pure avijñapti fr the first time he cannot evidently possess pure avsjñapti of the past The person who is in a state of absorption the person who is placed in the Way possesses aviñapti of the present moment The person who is absorbed  the person who is cultivating the Way  possesses at present the vijñaptiwhich is proper to him arisen from dhyānaand pure medially gvjñapti when the avijñapti is produced Medially means the present situated between the past and the future Action  or aviñapti created by an act of morality  or avijñapūi is cteated by some other good or bad acts the worship of a tūpa hitting and woundinghe possesses this aviñapti of the present at the moment when it arises Afterwards of the present and the past krḥṣḥ Can a disciplined petson possess bad avijñaptiz Can an un disciplined person possess good avijñp And how long does the aviñapti last in these two cases As long as he is endowed with faith or with very active defilements the undisciplined person possesses good zvsjñapti and the disciplined person possesses bad gvñapti As long as there continues in anundisciplined person the strength of faith by which accomplishing actions such as the worship ofa Stūpa he has created goodavsjñapti as longas there continues ina disciplined perso the power of the defilements by which accomplishing actions such as killnghittingbindinghe has created badavjñapti goodo bad avijñapii coṇtinues At the moment of the action in question the agent possesses avij ñapri of the present then he possesses aviiñapti of the present and of the past Those who have createdone viñapti possess it always in the present AIl those who accomplish a bodily or vocal action whether they aredisciplined undisciplined or intermediaries so liong as they are accomplishing this action possess it in the present From the second moment onward they possess vijñapti of the past until the moment when they give it up From the secondmmoment onward that isafter the first moment One cannot possess future viñapti One does not possess past vjñapti of the nivṛta and anivṛśa classes One does not possess these actions once they are past because the possession of a weak dharma being weak itself is not prolonged Why is this dharma a neutral action weak By reason of the weakness of the mind which gives rise to it But then the possession of this mind too will not be prolonged the case is not the same The vijñapti in effect is stupid for it does not know an object furthermore it is dependent for it depends upon the mind Such is not the case with the mind itself Thus the vijñapti producedby a neutral mind is weaker than this mind itself the possession of the vjñapti is not prolongued whereas the possession of the mind is prolongued kkk We have spoken of an undisciplined person one who is in undiscipline Undiscipline bad conduct immorality action course of action It is undisciplinebecause there is no constraining of the body and voice It is bad conductbecause it is blamedby wise men and because it produces painful results It is immorality because it opposes morality It is an action as it is created by the body and the voice It is a course of action as it is included in the principal action Four cases present themselves The intermediary acting with a weak volition possesses a single vjñapti He who is in neitherdisciplinenornondiscipline and who with a weak volition does good or bad action  possesses solely this act anddoes not possess any avñapti Allthe more reason that there is no possession of aviñapti by an agent when his action is neutral material meritorious works and  wWhen an ryan has changed his existence or when he has not created vijñapi  or when he has lost the ufñapti  he pssesses only avijñapti  and not vsṝñapt The two other cases the possession of vjñapti and avijñapti and the nonpossession of either are set up according to the same principles kssk How does one acquire the disciplines The discipline that arises from dhyāna is acquired by one thought of the sphere of the dhyāna It is through one thought of the sphere of the dyāna that īsof the mauladhyāna and the sāmamtakas  and with an impure mind that is with a mind not forming part of the Way that the discipline of dḥyāna is acquired this is a discipline concomitant with this type of mind Pure discipline by the same mind whean it is ryan ryan meas pure forming part of the Way We will explain below that the ryan mind exists in six spheres of dhyānanamely the Four Dhyānas thedhyānāntaras and the anāgamya Paravijñapana is informmative action to or from another the candidate makes known something to another avnd another makes something known tohim Another is the Saṅgha through the acquisition of the disciplines of Bhīkṣu Bhīkṣuṇī or ikṣamāṇā or a person  the acquisition of the five other prāimokś According to Viṇaya scholars of the Vaibhāṣika School there are six types of ordination In order to include them all within his definition the author says  Ordination by oneself in the case of the Buddha andthe Pratyekabuddhas Through entry into thePath  in the case of the Five that is to say of jñatakauṇḍinya and his companions Through the summons Come Oh Bhikṣu in the case of jñata By recognizing the Blessed One as master as in the case of Mahākāśyapa By a messenger as in the case of Dharmadinnā By an official action as the fifth that isordination beforea Saṅgha of five Bhikṣus as in frontier lands By ten Bhikṣus as in Madhyadeśa By repeating three times the formula of Refuge as in the case of the sixty Bhadravargas ordained in a group One sees that according to these scholars the Pṛātimokṣa discipline is not necessarily acquired by means of a vjñapti for example the ordination of the Buddha etc One undertakes the discipline for a lifetime or for a day and a night wThe first seven categories of the Prātimokṣa discipline are undertaken for a lifetime the fasting discipline is undertaken for a day and a night Because there are two limits of time the period of a lifetime and the period of a day and a night As for the forthnight and the other durations of time they consist in additions of day and night periods kksk What is the dharma that we term time  When it is light in the four continentsit isdaytime when it is dark it is night Discussion We admit say the Sautrāntikas that the Prātimokṣa discipline is solely produced for the duration of a lifetimeIn facteven if one were to undertake to observe these rules ina future life one would not now produce this discipline for this other lifethe person that one would become would be different   he would not remember undertaking them But if a petson assames the duties of a faster for more than a day and a nightfor five days or for ten dayswhat obstacle would this be to his producing in himself many disciplines of the fast It needs be that there wouldbe an obstacle since the Blessed One in a Sīūtra says that one undertakes the fast for a day and a night did he think that the discipline of fasting could not be produced for a longer duration He thought that persons in whom the senses are difficalt to subdue would be well capableof undertaking the fast for a day and a nightBut in truth nothing is wrong with producing the discipline of the fast for more than one day As the Blessed One does not speak of the fast as lasting any longer the Vaibhāṣikas do not admit this manner of viewing the matter esk What is the duration of undiscipline There is undiscipline for a day and a night Undiscipline never last longer than a day and a night like the discipline of the fastfor it is produced by the acceptance of transgression for ones entire life For says the School one does not undertake it thus No one undertakes undiscipline in the manner in which one undertakes the fast by saying I wish to remain a day and a night in undiscipline Rather he carries out in effect shameful actions Objection No one undertakes undiscipline by saying I wish to remain for my life undisciplined Thus one coes not undertake undiscipline for an entire lifetime It is not in this manner in fact that one undertakes undiscipline One does not undertake undiscipline by means of a ritual One acquires undiscipline by acting with the intention of always acting badly one does not acquire undiscipline by the intention of acting badly for a time In the case of the fast the intention is not for always nevertheless one obtains the discipline through the force of the action which consists of saying I wish to remain a day and a night in the discipline of the fast and one accomplishes this action because one desires to acquire this discipline If someone desires undiscipline he could without doubt give himself over to undiscipline for this period of time kksk ccording to the Sautrāntikas undiscipline does not exist in and of itself apart from volition Undiscipline is the intention t commit evil that is a certain volition with the traces which allow this volition And as long as this volition with its traces has notbeen destroyed by a contrary volition the person even when he has a good thought remains filed with undiscipline a person undisciplined kk How should one undertake the discipline ofa day anda night or the discipline of the fast One should undertake the fast in a humble attitude speaking after with ornaments removed until the morrow complete the morning from another In a humble attitudesquatting or kneeling with the hands joined in kapotaka or in the position of eñal except in the case of sickness Without a respectful attitude discipline is not produced The candidate does not speak before the ordainer or the giver the person who gives the fast nor at the same time In this way it is from another that oneundertakes the fast otherwise there would be neither receiving nor a thing received The candidate does not wear any ornaments he wears his normal dress because he does not draw forth vanity from it The morrow at the rising of the sun since this is a discipline lasting a day and a night When these rules are not observed one has nevertheless done a good action but one does not obtain the discipline of the fast When the rules are observed the fast is even more useful for the person who commits transgressions by day and by night The fast is termed pavāsa because embracing a way of life conforming to that of the Arhats he places himself near the Arhats Accoding to another opinion it isbecause he places himself near the lifelong discipline It has for its end procuring an increase of the roots of good of persons who have only small roots of good As it procures an increase of good the Blessed One said It is called poṣadha ksks Why is the discipline of the fast undertaken with eight parts Part of morality  part of vigilence  parts of ascetic vows  have respectively four one three parts Four partsthe renouncing of killing stealing adultery and lyingconstitute the parts of morality by which what is transgression by nature is abandoned One part the renounxing of intoxicating drinks constitutes the rule of vigilence by which nonvigilence isarrested For even if a person who has undertaken morality drinks intoxicating liquor he will be noo vigilent Three partsthe renouncing of high beds musicetcand meals at forbidden timesconstitute the rule of asceticism for they are favorable and conform to disgust In order to avoid weakness of mindfulness and arrogance When one drinks intoxicating liquorone loses ones mindfulness of what one shouldand should not do When one uses high and wide beds when one attends dances singing and music the mind becomes arrogant In both cases one is not far from violating morality When one observes the rule of eating at the proper times and when one avoids eating outside of this time one retains a mindfulness of the obligations of the fast and disgust is produced kakk i Accotding to certain masters the fast or pavāsa consists of the fast proper and the renouncing of food at forbidden times whereas the other renouncings are the rules or parts of the fastThe abstention fromfood is not a part thus with an end to the obtaining the number of eight parts one should distinguish two parts in the seventh rule first the renouncing of dancing singing and music and the second the renouncing of perfumes garlands and unguents This interpretation is not in accord with the Sūtra  for according to the Sūtra immediately after the renouncing of meals at forbidden times the faster should say By these eight rulesI imitate the ruleI conform myself to the rule of the ryams the Arhatsī ii Then what would the fast be distinct from its rules and yet embracing eight parts Accoding to theSautrāṇtikas it is the very collection of parts which one says possesses parts it is to this very collection that one attributes parts The expression a fast having eight parts should be understood in the same way as the expressions a part of a carriage a foupart army  or a powder made up of five parts According to the Vaibhāṣikas the abstaining from food at forbidden times is at one and the same time the fast and a part of the fastIn the same way that Right Views are at one and the same time the Pathand a part of the Path  in the same way that Investigation into the Dharmas is at one and the same time Bodhi anda part of Bodhi  and in the same way way that Samādhi is at one and the same time dhyāna and a part of dhyāna But we would say that it is impossible for Right Views Investigation into the Dharmas and Samādhi to be parts of themselves Would you say that earlier Right Views etc are parts of later Right Views etc This would be to admit that the first moment of the Path does not have eight parts kkk Is the possession of the discipline of the fast kept only by Upāsakas Others can possess the fast but not without taking the Refuges When a person who is not a Upāsaka takes in the same day and night the Three Refuges before he undertakes the rules of the fast then the discipline of the fast is produced within him The MahānāmasūtrasaysOh Mahāṇāma the layman with white clothes male and possessing the male organ who after having taken refuge in the Buddha in the Dharma and in the Saṅgha pronounces these words Consider me as an Upāsaka only through this does he become an Upāsaka Does this mean that one becomes an Upāsaka by only taking the Three Refuges The Kaśmīreans affirm that one cannot be an Upāsaka when one does not possess the Upāsaka discipline But does this not contradict the Sūtra Because The discipline is produced through the fact that he accepts the qualities of an Upāsaka The discipline of the Upāsaka is produced in him by the mere acceptance of the quality of the Upāsaka when he says Consider me from today onwardsfor the rest of my lifeas a prāṇāpeta Upāsaka One should understand prāṇātpātāpeta through ellipis as free from killing having renounced killing Thus by accepting the quality of an Upāsaka one undertakes the discipline Yet in order that he understands the points of the rule  One explains them to him as is also the case for a Bhikṣu Your coreligionists will tell you the rest The same holds for the rāmaṇpera Thus one is not an Upāsaka without possessing the discipline of the UpāsakaIf allUpāsakas possess the discipline of the Upāsaka how can an Upāsaka be an ekadefakāriṇ etc If all Upāsakas place themselves within the discipline of the Upāsaka why did the Blessed One describe four types of Upāsakas the Upāsaka of one rule  of two rules  of three or four rules adbhhyaskārīn and of five rules  These terms say the School refer to the fact of observing the ruḹes The Upāsaka who in fact observes one of the rules is said to practice this rule Yet all the Upāsakas are equally placed within this discipline Your doctrine contradicts the Sūtra In what way does it contradict the Sūtra You say that one acquires the discipline by the mere fact of accepting the quality of a prāṇāpeta Upāsaka Consider me But such is not the text of the Sūtra In fac the Sūtra that interestsus is the Mahānāmasūtra which gives the definition of an Upāsaka and not another Sūtra You hold that you are authorized by another Sūtra which has From today for the rest of my life risking my life  having taken refuge believing perfectlyNow this text refers to persons who have seen the Truths who have acquired the faith of intelligence  and who as a consequence adhere to the Good Law even at the price of their lives We are incapable of abandoning the Dharma even in order to save our lives This text does not give a definition of the Upāsaka discipline Further the expression prāṇāpeta npo which you establish your theory is nowhere to be found either in the Mahānāmasūra nor the Dṛṣṭasatyasutra Whobased on faith in this expression would admit that the Upāsaka has undertaken the five renouncings before he has undertaken them ritually f the expression ekadeśakārṣn designates a person who violates the discipline thequestion raised in the Sūtra is not justified nor its answer In fact who is it that being acquainted with the discipline of an Upāsaka and knowing that it is made up of five rules would be incapable of explaining He who does not violate a rule observes a rule and so on On the contrary someone who does not know the extent of the discipline of an Upāsaka seeing the persons capable of observing one or two or three or all the rules would he be able to pose the question What does one do to become an Upāsaka of all the rules If one were an Upāsaka without possess ing the discipline of an Upāsaka one could also as well be a Bhikṣuor a rāmaṇera with an incomplete discipline How can we know the extent the number of the rules of the disciplines of the Upāsakatherāmaṇeraor theBhikṣu Evidently through the teaching of the Master The Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr do not admit this opinion All the disciplines are weak etc according to the mind The weakness the mediocrity and the force of the eight rules depend on the weakness on the mediocrity or on the force of the mind through which one has undertaken them But if such is the case the Pṛātimokṣa discipline of an Arhat could be weak and that of a Prṛthagjana could be strong  Is one an Upāsaka if one solely undertakes the discipline withoutundertaking the Refuges No except in the case of ignorance by the person who gives and by the person who receives kkṣk When a person takes refuge in the Buddha the Dharma and in the Saṅgha what does he take refuge in He who takes the Refuges takes refuge in the afukṣa dharmas which form the Buddha in the two types of dharmas which form the Saṅgha and in Nirvāṇa He who takes Refuge in the Buddha takes refuge in the dharmasr of the Arhat which form a Buddha the ḍharṇeas which are the causes of the designation Buddha that is the dharmas by reason of which as principle cause a certain person is called a Buddha or rather the dharmas by the acquisition of which a certain personunderstanding all things is called a Buddha As for the material body of the Buddha that is not subject to modification through the acquistion of the quality of Buddha Thus one does not take refuge in the material body of the Buddha which is in fact the material body of the Bodhisattva Does one take refuge in all the Buddhas or in one Buddha According to the nature of things and in the absence of an explicit declaration in all the Buddhas He who takes Refuge in the Saṅgha takes refuge in both the aikṣa and the aśaikṣa ḍharmas of the nonAhat and of the Arhat which form the Saṅgha that isthe dharmuas through the acquisition of which the Eight Saints become a Saṅgha becoming unanimous they cannot be divided with regard to that which concerns the Path Does one take refuge in all the Saṅghas or in one Saṅgha for the Pathfollowed by the Saints is always the same Without doubt the Buddha said to the two merchants Also take refuge in the Saṅgha which shall exist in the futre but the Master expressed himself in this manner in order to exhault the qualities of the Jewel of the Saṅgha which would soon be visible to the merchants He who takes Refuge in the Dharma takes refuge in Nirvāṇa that is to say inpratisakhyānirodha He takes refuge inall Nirvāṇa for Nirvāṇa has for its unique characteristic the cessation of the defilements and suffering of oneself and others Discussion If the Buddha is none other than the afxikṣa dharmas the dharmas pertaining to an Arhat how could the fact of wounding the Buddha with a bad thought constitute a mortal transgression  The Vaibhāṣikas answer When one wounds the materialelements which are the supportof these dbarmas these dharmas themselves suffer injury But the āstra does not say that the Buddha is solely ikṣadharmasIt says that the Buddbha is thedharmas that form a Buddha that is to say either the worldly or transworldly dharmas which are the object of the designation Buddha are the Buddha Thus the āstra does not deny that the ārayathe organism the support made up of the five worldly sxndhasforms part of the quality of Buddha Hence the objection taken from wounding the Buddha is without value If it were otherwise if the Buddha was only asukṣadharmas and if the Sañgha were only fxikṣaand aśaikṣadharmasa person whose mind is presently worldly would not be able to be either a Buddha or a Saṅgha And by virtue of these same principles one would have to say that a Bhikṣu is only morality the discipline of a Bhikṣu In the same way that one who honors Bhikṣus honors the morality which makes up the Bhikṣus According to another opinion one who takes refuge in the Buddha takes refuge in the eighteen āveṇikadharmas of the Buddha śkkṣk What is the nature of the undertakings of the Refuges They are vocal vñaptś What is the meaning of Refuge  The Three Refuges are so named because by going to them for refuge one obtains definitive deliverance from all suffering The Blessed One said in fact Tormented by fear persons most frequently take refuge in mountains in forests in woods and in sacred trees This is nota good refuge the supreme refuge it is not by taking refuge in these that one is delivered from all suffering But one who takes Refuge in the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha when one sees through wisdom the Four Noble TruthsSuffering the Arising of Suffering the Extinction of Suffering and the Holy Eightfold Path which leads to Nirvāṇathis is the good refuge this is the supreme refuge by taking refuge in this one is delivered from all suffering This is why the undertaking of the Refuges is the enterance to the undertaking of all the rules of discipline kedk The other rules of discipline contain the renouncing of all sexual activity  but the discipline of the Upāsaka only contains the renouncing of sexualmisconduct Why is this Sexual misconduct because it is much censured because one easily abstains from it because the ryans have obtained abstention from it Sexual misconduct is much censured in the world because it is the couption of anothers wife and because it leads to retribution in a painful realm of rebirth It is easy for householders to abstain from it but it is difficult for them to abstain from all sexual activity householders do not leave the world because they are not capable of difficult things The ryans possess akaraṇasavara with regard to sexual misconduct that is they have obtained definite abstention from it in fact in their future existence they will be incapable of violating this precept As a consequence the rules of discipline of the Upāsaka contain only the renuniation of sexual misconduct it is inadmissible in fact that the ryaṇns in a susequent existence would be capable of violating the discipline of an Upāsaka which could happen if this contained the renuncation of all sexual activity kkk Has the man who marries after having undertaken the Upāsaka discipline undertaken renouncing with regard to the woman whom he marries Yes answer the Vaibhāṣikas for in the contrary hypothesis this man would have undertaken a restraining discipline  They have acquired it as they have accepted the discipline they have not accepted it with regard to some persons They have acquired it as they have undertaken the discipline They undertake it by saying I renounce sexual misconduct that is I renounce all sexual activity with all prohibited females they do not undertake it by saying I shall refrain from all sexual activity with such persons Consequently they do not violate the discipline by getting married kṣṅk Among the transgression of speech why does the renouncing of lying constituteone of the rulesof the Upāsakawhereas the renouncing of other transgressions of speech are omitted For the same reasons Because having violated any other rule he would lie  he would lie when he violates any other rule saying i have not done it Consequently the Upāsaka should renonnce lying thinking I shall cofess what I transgress kḥ Why are not the transgressions of disobedience included in the discipline of the Upāsaka Oe renounces strong liquor which is a transgression of disobedience Why should the Upāsaka renounce a single transgression of disobedience and not others In order that the other rules may be kept One who drinks strong liquor will not keep the other rules īThe bhidhārmikas maintain that strong liquor does nothave the characteristic of being a transgression by its nature A transgression by its nature is committed only by a person whose mind is defiled now it happens that as a remedy one can drink strong liquor in a quantity where it is not inebṛiating But the mind of one who drinks knowing that such a quantity is inebriating is defiled the mind is not defiled when one drinks knowning that such a qnantity is not inebriating To Upāli who asked him How should one attend to illesses the Blessed One answered Except Upāli by transgression of nature Aṇd the Blessed Oe did not permit strong liquors to sick ākyans Those who recognize me as their master should not drinkaṇy strong liquor even a drop on the point of a blade of grass The ryans even in a following existence do not drink strong liquor not any more than they would commit the other traṇsgressions of nature killing etc Scripturethe Nandikasūra and eisewhereplaces strong liquor among the misdeeds of the body In general the transgression of disobedience is permitted to the ill as the answer to Upāli proves But strong liquor is an exception though solely a transgression of disobedience it is forbidden to the ill and this witha view to preventing theupleasant consequence of strong liquor because its inebriating quantity is undetermined M Ifthe ryans certainly abstain from strong liquoritis not because it is a transgressionby its very naturebut because they are filled with the force of modesty  this is because strong liqtor makes mindfulness fail even if they do not drink a dtop this is because the inebriating quantity is not determinedas for poison cripture considers strong liquor as a bodily misdeed because strong liquor is a cause of nonvigilence This is not the case for the other transgressions The Scripture says that one is reborn in hell through the practice of strong liquor As a consequence of strong liquor there is continual activity of a series of bad thoughts from whence there is either projection of a new action retribuable in hell or else the entry into activity at the moment of death of an old action Swrā is a fermented drink of rice mzaireya is a fermented drink of various ingredients Ata certain moment the liquor is no longer inebriating at a ceṛtain moment it is no longer that this is why the word adya has been added Even the arecanut the paspale are termed syrā and maireya when they inebriate Strong liquor is only a transgression of disobedience The formula thus contains the words pramādasthāna in order to have one understand that one should renounce strong liquor because it is the cause of all failures of mindfulness One acquires the discipline of Kāmadhātu relative to all actiops relative to the two types of beings and to the two types of actions relative to things of the present This discipline is relative to all actions preparatory actions actions themselves and consecutive action This discipline is relative to the transgressions by nature and to the transgression of disobedience both of which are capable of relating to living beings or to nonliving beings This discipline is relative to thingsskandhas āyatanas and dhātusof the present for the things of the past and of the future are neither living beings nor nonliving beings One acquires the discipline of dhyna and the pure discipline relative to actions themselves and to things of the three time periods One acquires these two disciplines relative to actions themselves not relative to preparatory actions or to consecutive action and not relative to the transgression of disobedience and relative to the skandhas āyatanas aṅd dhāṭus of the past present and future There are thus some skandhas āyatanas and dhātus relative to which one acquires the Pṛātimokṣa discipline and not the two others Preparatory and consecutive actions transgressions of disobedience of the presentalluded to by the Prātimokṣa Courses of actions of the presentalluded to by the three disciplines for when one undertakes the discipline no bad course of action is present relative to which one could undertake the discipline ikk Does one acquirediscipline or undiscipline with regard to allbeings relative to all of their parts and by reason of all causes One acquires discipline with regard to all beings one must distinguish regarding the parts and the causes One acquires discipline with regaxrd to all beings not with regard to only some of them The discipline of the Bhikṣu is acquired relative to all parts The other disciplines are acquired relḹative to four parts sttong mind mediocre mind weak mind The discipline is acquired by reason of one of these three minds There is a person abiding in disciplinedisciplined with regard to all beings but notdisciplined relative to all the parts nor disciplined by reason of all causes he who through a strong or mediocre or weak mind has acquired the discipline of the Upāsaka the Upavāsastha or the rāmaṇera There is a person abiding in the disiplinedisciplined with regard to allbeings and relative to all the parts but not disciplined by reason of all causes he who has acquired the discipline of the Bhīkṣu through a sttong mediocre or weak mind There is a person residing in discipline disciplined with regard to all beings relative to all the parts by reason of all the causes he who has acqnired each of the three disciplines of the Upāsaka the rāmaṇera and the Bhikṣu through minds which are respectivelyweak mediocre and strong There is a person residing in discipline disciplined with regard to all beings disciplined by reason of all the causes but not disciplined relative to all the parts he who has acquired each of the three disciplines of the Upāsaka the Upavāsastha and the rāmapera through minds which are respectively weak mediocre and strong No one abides indiscipline who is not disciplined with regard to all beings he acquires the discipline through a good mind having for its object all beings The person who makes a restriction is not completely rid of the intention of transgression The Prātimokṣa discipline includes the absence of the fivefold reṣṭriction with regard to beings I renounce transgressions with regard to certain beings  with regard to parts of the discipline T renounce certain actions  with regard to place I renounce committing transgressions in a certain place  with regard to time I renounce transgressions for a month  with regard to circumstances I renounce transgressions except in the case of a quarreL He who undertakes such undertakings does not acqnire thediscipline rather he does a good action similar to the acquisition of the discipline How can one acquire the discipline with regard to all beings Because we believe one acquires the discipline through the intention of pot killing any being The Vatbhāṣikas givea different explanationIf the discipline was acquired only with regard to beings who are within range the discipline would be liable to augmentation and to diminution The discipline would thus be acquired with regard to gods who become human and lost with regard to humans who become gods without there being any cause either of the acquisition or of the loss of the discipline For the discipline that oneundertakes with regard to grass neither increases nor diminishes when new grass arises nor when old grass dries up But when living beings enter into Nirvāṇa they no longer exist exactly like grass so the discipline acquired with regard to living beings is subject to diminution Thus the explanation of the Vaibhāṣikas is invalid If one objectsIn the case where the Prātimokṣa discipline wouldbe acquired with regard to all beings then the discipline of later Buddhas would be reduced in comparason with that of former Buddhas for it would not be relative to beings who have alteady entered into Nirvāṇa to former Buddhas and their disciples we would reply all the Buddhas disciplineall beings and if former Buddhas were to exist again later Buddhas would be disciplined by them Undiscipline with regard to all relative to all parts and not by reason of all causes Onṇe acquires undiscipline with rgard to all beings and relative to all courses of action No one is undisciplined with an incomplete undiscipline One is not undisciplined by reason of all causes un discipline being undertaken by aweakmediocreor strong mindLet us suppose that an undisciplined person has undertaken his undiscipline with a weak mind and commits a murder with a strong rmind his undiscipline remains weak but he is adorned with a strong vijfñapti with a strong murder The butchers of sheep birdcatchers the butchers of pigs fisher ma hunters bandits exceutioners jailers elephant hunters the slaughterers of dogs and the vāgurikas are all undisciplined It also holds that kings office holders judges etc are undisciplined A butcher of sheep is the person whose profession is to kill sheepThe same etymology holds for the names of the other professions iiWe understand that discipline undertaken with the intention of universal benevolence would be acquired with regard to all beings But the butchers of sheep do not have the intention of maltreating their parents their children or their servants they would not want to kill them even at the price of their lifes How  can one say that they are undisciplined with regard to all beings Because they have the intention of killing with regard to their parents who have become sheep through trans migration But they do not kill their parents who have become sheep knowing that they are their parents hence the butcher is not undisciplined with regard to them if the butcher is undisciplined with regard to his present parents because he willkill his parents who have become sheep one would say as well that he is not undisciplined with regard to some other sheep since he is not disposed to kill the sheep which are reborn as humans as his own children But he who does not have the intention of killing the sheep who bave become his children is certainly not undisciplined in their regard how can the butcher who does not steal who is not an adulterer and who is mute be undisciplined relative to all these transgressions Because his intention is perverted A mute can express himself through gestures But what is there to say of a man who has accepted two or three parts of morality For the Vaibhāṣikas nondiscipline is never incomplete that is relative only to certain parts nor is it partial that is including restrictions in the practice of a certain transgression For the Sautrāṇtikasdiscipline apd undiscipline with the exception of the Prātimokṣa discipline can be incomplete and partial This depends on the manner in which one undertakes discipline or undiscipline one binds oneself to a part of immorality or to a certain part of morality kk How does one acquire undiscipline How does one acquire the avijñaptis which are neither discipline bor undiscipline One acquires undiscipline through action or through accepting it Persons born in a family of undisciplined petsons acquire un discipline when they accomplish the actions preparatory to kiling One acquires the other gvijñaprisby reason of the field of undertaking of an action seriously undertaken Cetain persons axe a field of sucha nature that by offering thema garden etc one reduces vjñapti One produces viñapti by undertaking vows for exampleI shall not eat unless I have paid homage to the Buddha I shall give alms food on the fast day for a fortnight for a month for a year etc Action undertaken seriously witha burning faith with a burning passion  produces evṝñap ksk How does one lose discipline The Prātimokṣa discipline is lost through abjuration through death through hermaphroditism through the cutting off of the roots and by the night coming to an end Excluding the discipline of the fast the Prātimokṣa discipline is lost through abjuration intentionally renouncing the rule in the presence of a person capable of understanding it  through the death or abandonment of the nkāyasabhāga   through the cutting off of the roots of good The discipline of fast is iost through these four causes and further when night come to an end Some say through a patanīya According to the Sautrāntikas the discipline of the Bhikṣu and the novice is also lost through any one of the four patanyas or transgressions involving a falling away Through the disappearance of the Good Law say some other masters According to theDharmaguptakas the Prātimokṣa discipline is lost when the Good Law disappears there are no longer any rules any boundaries nor any ecclesiastic actions The Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmīr say A monk guilty of a grave transgression that isof apaanīyadoes not lose hisBhikṣu disciplineIt is notadmissible that one loses the entire discipline by destroying only a part of the discipline He who comrnits a transgression other than a patanya is not immoral He who commits a paanya is at one and the ṣame time moral and immoral as a person who has both riches and debts but when this transgressor has confessed his transgression he is no longer immoralbut solely moral as a person who has paid his debts But the Blessed One has said He is not a Bhikṣu he is not a monk he no longer belongs to the sons of ākya he falls from the quality of Bhikṣu his quality of monkhood is cut off falen eased tumbled down annihilated The Vaibhāṣikas In this text Bhikṣu signifies a true Bhīkṣu An inadmissable explanation you avoid the question that the Blessed One made in a clear sense furthermore you lead defiled persons to the practice of immorality How can you prove that this quotation is of clear sense and should be taken liteṛally The Blessed One has explained this himself There are four Bhikṣus  this refeṛs to a fifth Bhikṣu namely a person who has been properly ordained but who through patanya loses this quality and this discipline it is certainly not a question of his being a true Bhikṣuan Arhat for one capable of a patanāya is not a ttrue Bhikṣuan Arhatbut is susceptible of losing the quality of being a true Bhikṣu The agument that one does not lose the entire discipline through the losing of one part of itis refuted by theMaster himself who in fact compares a transgressor monk to a palm tree whose head is cut off henceforth incapable of becoming green of growingof developing or of growing larger this means that when one part of the discipline the part which is the root of the discipline is cut off the rest of the discipline is incapable of growing The patanhya or the maui āpatti is in contradiction to the state required of being a Bhikṣu he embraces an extreme absence of fear of transgression  he breaks off the root of discipline all his discipline is lost The Master excludes persons guilty of paanāya from all com merce with the Bhikṣus he prohibits them from participating with them for even one mouthful of food he forbids them from even setting one foot into the monastery He says He who is not a Bhikṣu but who has the aspect of a Bhikṣudestroy this tare uproot this rotten tree drive out this plant without seed What indeed can be the Bhikṣu quality of this criminal He possesses the quality which consists of his quality of Bhikṣu For the BlessedOne said Cunda there are four monks and not a fifth Does one not speak of burning wood of a driedup pond of a parrotṇose  of rotten seed of a ciṛcle of fire or of a dead being One does not lose the quality of monkhood through pataniya since the Blessed One admits a monk guilty of unchastity as a penitent We do not say that any Bhikṣu guilty of unchastity is a pārājka a fallen or destroyed Bhikṣu But whoever is a pārājña is no longer a BhikṣuIt is the idea of hiding the crime which is decisive here if thanks to the excellence of his moral dispositions thanks to the excellence of his series the guilty one does not have the thought of concealing his fault for en instant then the King of the Law admits him as a penitant If a pārājñka is no longer a Bhikṣu why is he not again admitted to ordination Because he is susceptible to discipline Also even if he had renounced the rules  he cannot be ordained again To what good does this discussionlead If a similar Bhikṣu is aBhikṣu we pay homage to this quality of Bhikṣu When the Good Law disappears all ecclesiastical acts become impossible and as a consequence also all acqnisition of the discipline But he who possesses the discipline will not lose it kkīk How does one lose the discipline of dhyāna and the pure discipline The good of the sphere of dhyāna is lost through a change of state and through falling All of the good of the sphere of dḥyāna that is material and nonmaterial good is lost through two causes through arising in a superior or inferior stage through falling away when the ascetic falls away from this absorption One should add a third cause the Pṛthagjana loses certain gooddharmas throughdeath even whenhe is reborn in the same heavenly stage from whence he died The same for the good of rūpyadhātu It is lost through the changing of the stage or through falling away Note that discipline does not exist in this sphere Pure good is lost through the obtaining of a resuit through perfection of the faculties or through falling away By obtaining a result the ryan abandones the good dharrmas of the path of the candidate   when he perfects his faculties  he abandons the path of weak faculties and  when he falls he abandons the result or the path of a superior result Undiscipline is lost through the acquisition of discipline through death or through hermaphroditism The discipline of dhyāna cuts off undiscipline being a threefold change hostile to undisciplipe An undisciplined person who rejects the tools of his workdagger and net even with the intention of no longer committing murder does not by this cut off his undiscipline if he does notundertake the discipline Iiness does not improve without medicine even though one may avoid the causes of illness Does an undisciplined person who undertakes the discipline of the fast remain undisciplined when he departs from the fast or rather does he find himself in the intermediary state neitherdisciplinednor undisciplined Opiniops differ For some he is found to be undisciplined for the petson who undertakes the fast does not have the intention of definitively renouncing transgressions a mass of iron turṇed red retuns to its original state For others once an undisciplined person has departed from the fast he is no longer undisciplined for the acquisition of indiscipline supposes a physical or vocal action kii How does one lose avjñap which is neither discipline nor undiscipline  Intermediate avijñapti is lost through the catting off of the force the undertaking the action the object the lifeand the roots We have seen how one acquires vjññapti which differs from discipline and from indiscipline This avijñapti is lost by reason of six causes when the intense force of faith or the defilements which have projected the avjñapti come to an end Example Good nonmaterial action of the sphere of Kāmadhātu is lost through the cutting off of the roots and througharisingina superior sphere We have explainedhow material action namely bodily action vocal action and the avjñapati is cat off Good nonmaterial action of Kāmadhātu is lost thorough the cutting off of the roots of good and through birth in Rūpadhātu or rūpyadhātu That which is defiled and nonmaterial is lost through the arising of its opposite All that which is defiled of whatever sphere is lost through the arising of the Path which opposes this defilement This refers toa path of abandoning which can be Seeing or Meditation and which can be worldly or transworldly This Path causes the abandonment of a certain category of wpakleśa and with it all its attendant prāptis etc xc What beings are susceptible to discipline and to undiscipline Humanswith the exception of the two categories of eunuchs hermaphrodites and the Kurusare susceptible of undiscipline the same for the discipline which pertains also to the gods Undiscipline exists only among humans One must furthermore except ṣaṇḍhas and paṇḍakas hermaphrodites and beings in Uttarakuru Discipline exists among humans with the abovementioned exception and among the gods thus it exists in two realmns of rebirth this results from the Sūtra Oh Mahānāma white clothed laymen male and possessing the male organ  and from the Vimaya One must expel such a person Why is this Because they possess to an extreme degree the defilements of the two sexes because they are incapable of the reflection necessary to combat these defilements and because the vigor of respect and fear is absent in them Why are they not susceptible to undiscipline In the painful realms of rebirth there is no vigor of respect and fear now a vigorous respect and fear are necessary for discipline in order for there to be indiscipline it is necessary to destroy respect and fear Neither discipline nor undiscipline can arise in the bodies or in the persons of eunuchs hermaphordites and beings in the realms of painful rebirth for these bodies are similar to soil saturated with salt wherein there can neither grow wheat nor bad herbs The Sūtra says OhBhikṣu there isa Nāga bo froman egg which each eighth day of the fortnight leaves its dwelling and comes to undertake the eightfold fast Discipline exists thus solely among humans and among the gods The three disciplines exist among humans Discipline of dḥyāna exists among the gods of Kāma dhātu and Rūpadhātu Not in higher spheres So too the pure discipline with the exception of the gods of the intermediate dhyāna and the Asajñisattvas and also in rūpyadhātu It exists in Rūpadhātu with the exception of the dhyānāntarikas of beings arisen in intermediate dhyāna and the Asajñisattvas and in rūpyadhātu The gods of rūpyadhātu never in fact manifest this discipline since discipline is matter rpa but they can possess it Following the exemination of action the author now defines the diverse categories of action which are taught in different Sūtras keṭk There are three actions god bad and neutral Good action is salutary bad action is pernicious and action differing from good and bad isdifferent from the salutary and the pernicious Such is the definition of good action etc Good action is salutary because it is of agreeable retributionandas a consequence it protects one from suffering for a time  o rather because it brings about the attainment of Nirvāṇa and as a consequencedefinitively protects one from suffering Bad action is pernicious this is action of disagreeable retribution Action concerning which the BlessedOne does not say whether it is good or bad that is morally neutral action is neither salutary nor pernicious There are three actions meritorious action demeritorious action and nonagitated action action of agreeable feeling action of disagreeable feelingand action of neither disagreeable nor agreeable feeling Meritorious action is a good action in Kāmadhātu non agitated action is a good action above there Good action of the sphere of Kāmadhātu is called meritorious action because it purifies and because it produces an agreeable retribution Good actionabove there that is to say of the two higher spheres is called nonagitated  But did not the Blessed One say that the first three Dhyānas are agitated Did he not say that the ryans say that the viarkita and the vicaria of the First Dhyāna are agitation The Blessed One said in fact that the first three Dhyānas are agitated but he is saying this from the point of view of the corrupted characteristics of these dyānas  their vices are what agitate them But in the Iījiasūra the Blessed One declared that these dhyānas are nonagitated because he considerd them a pathway favorable to nonagitation But why term that which is agitated nonagitated t Because with regard to that which concerns its retribu tio action of the domain of the higher stages does not vary Action of the sphere of Kāmadhātu is agitated in its retribution one action which produces naturally a certain realm of rebirth can be retributed in another one an action which produces a heavenly realm of rebirth can be rettibuted in another heavenly realm of rebirth In fact t happens that actions which produce power a good figure beauty or objects of enjoyment instead of being retributed in a heavenly realm of rebirth are retributed in a human animal or Preta realm of rebirth through the efficacy of certain causes But no cause can make an action of the sphere of Rūpadhātu or rūpyadhātu be retributed in any but the sphere which is proper to it Bad action is demeritorious As for actions of agreeable feeling etc Good action up to the Third Dhyāna is of agreeable feeling Agreeable sensation ḍdoes not exist above the Third Dhyāṇas Hence the retribution of good action is of agreeable feeling up to the Third Dhyāna Action having such a retribution is called of agteeable sensation There only remains the sensation of indifference which is the only retribution of good action retributed above the Thitrd Dhyāṇna Bad action here below is of disagreeable sensation Bad action is of disagreeable sensation kṣksk Is the result of all these actions only sensation No they also have the apparatus of sensation as their result According to some intermediary action also exists below some say that the retribution of dḍhyānāntara action is the seṇsation of pleasure of the dhyāna itself some others say that the retribution of this action is not sensation These two opinions are in contradiction to the āstra  Does it happen that an action is solely mental sensation Yes the retribution of a good action which was free from vsitarka Because it is admitted that the retribution of the three types of action takes place at the one and same time The āstra says in the same place Does it happen that there is at oe and the same time retribution of the three types of action There can take place at the same time the retribution of an action of agreeable sensation namely of materialdharmas  the retribution of an action of disagreeable sensation namely the mind and the mental states  the retribution of an action of neither agreeable nor disagreeable sensation namely thedbarmas dissociated from the rnind Now the three types of action cannot be retributed simultaneously outside of Kāmadhātu for the retribution of action of disagreeable sensation takes place only in Kāmadhātu pkkḥ Is the action of neither agreeable nor disagreeable sensation good or bad It is good but of weak force But didnt you say that good action up to the Third Dhyāṇna is of agreeable sensation  This definition refers to cases in general kskk But how can one say that action is of agreeable sensation Action by its nature is not sensation One expresses oneself in this way because action is favorable to agreeable sensation or rather because its retribution is agreeably sensed In the same way that one calls bathing clothes snānāyakāṣāya the clothes with which one bathes in that same way one terms to be sensed action through which one senses a retribution There are five ways of being vedanīya sensed ex perienced of itself through sensation as an object by being retributed and by the fact of its presence Sensation by its nature is feeling Agreeable sensation is agreeable experience etc Contact is feeling because it is associated with sensation contact of agreeable sensation etc The six objects of the six organs are feeling in the role of object  Seeing color with the eye he experiences he feels the color but he does not feel the color with affection Color is thus the object of sensation Action is feeling in its role of being retributed an action experienced in the present existence Sensation is feeling through the fact of its appearance When he feels when he experiences agreeable sensation two sensations the disagreeable and the neutral are then found to be obstructed by it hence when agreeable sensation is functioning there is no other sensation through which one would feel it Thus if one says that this sensation is to be felt  this is because it is present This action is determinate or indeterminate The action that we have just described is either determinate that is which will necessarily be felt or indeterminate which will not be necessarily felt Determinate action is of three types to be experienced in the present life etc Determinate action is to be experienced in the present life to be experienced after having been reborn in other words in the next immediate life and to be experienced later By adding indeterminate action this makes from the point of view of the modality of retribution four types According to one opinion action is of five types that which is indeterminate with regard to the period of its retribution but whose retribution is in any case certain and that which is indeterminate with regard to its retribution which can be not retributed kkk Action experienced in the present life is action which ripens or is retributed in the same existence in which it was accomplished Action experienced after being reborn is action which is retributed in the existence which follows that in which it was accomplished Action experienced later is action which is retributed ina latet existence from the third existence on But some other masters  cennot admit that a very strong action has a weak retribution Consequently the retribution of an action experienced in the present life can continue into other existences yet as this retribution begins in the present life this action i said to be experienced in the present life The Vaibhāṣikas do not accept this way of looking at it There is they say some actions whose results are near and some actions whose results ae distant In the same way flax bears its fruit after two and a half months but wheat and godhāma after six months Others distinguish four alternatives The Dārṣṭāntikas distinguish four cases Action determined with regard to the period of its retribution but indeterminate with regard to its retribution this is njyatavedanīya but ansyaṭavipāka action Action determined with regard to its retribution but indeterminate with regard to the period of its retribution nyabavipākabut ansyatavedanīya nyatavipāka and niyatavedanāya Action indeterminate from two points of view aniyatavipāka and aniyatavedanṅīya According to this system there are eight types of actions action experienced in the present existence and of certain retribution  action which can be experienced in any existence and of only possible retribution kkk Does it happen that a person produces or projects all four types of actions at one and the same time Three types of actions project existence Action experienced in the present existence does not project the present existence  this has been projected by a former action kkṣk How many types of action can be produced in the different spheres of existence and in the different realms of rebirth In the three spheres of existence and in all of the realms of rebirth the four types of good or bad action can be produced But this general rule has some restrictions In the hells one can produce good action to be experienced in the next existence good action to be experienced in a later existence and good action which is indeterminate but no good action to be experienced in the present existence for there is no agreeable retribution in the hells When he is detached from a certain stage that is when he is delivered from attachment with regard to a certain plane of existence  in this stage he never produce action to be experienced in his next rebirth When he is firm the Saint does not produce in the stage from whence he is detached any action to be experienced either in the next existence or in a later existence In factthe Pṛthagjana incapable of fallingaway is not reborn in the next existence in the stage from whence he is detached end a Saint incapable of falling away is never reborn at this stage Both produce relative to the stage wherein they are born actions to be experienced in the present existence and indeterminate action The ryan not firm when he isdetached fromKāmadhātu or from Bhavāgra the same Even when they are subject to fallingaway that is to saysusceptible of losing the results obtained these Saints do not produce action to be experienced in the next existence nor in a subsequent existence either in Kāmadhātu or in Bhavāgra We shall explhain how the Saint subject to falling away always reacquires the results before dying Does the intermediate being produce any actions The intermediate being in Kāmadhātu produces twenty two types of actions The embryo passes through five stateskalala arbuda pesin ghana and praśākhāA hbuman being passes through five statesas an infantan adolescent a grown person a mature person and an old person In this same way he produces eleven indeterminate actions These actions bear their results in the present existence The eleven determinate actions of the intermediate being belong to the category to be experienced in the present existence The intermediate existence and the ten states which follow it are projected by a single action Thus one does not distinguish en action to be experienced in the intermediate existence this is projected in factby the action itself which is to be experienced in the life which follows the intermediate existence kksk By virtue of what characteristics is an action determinate that is to say necessarily retributed Action accomplished through intense defilement or through intense faith with regard to the field of qualities continually and the murdering of a father and a mother are determinate Actio accomplished with regard to these fields even in the absence of an intense thought of defilement or of faith or of continuity is determinate whether it is good or bad The same for the murder of ones father or mother with whatever intention it was committed kkḥ By virtue of what characteristic is an action experienced in the present existence Action bears result in the present existence by reason of certain characteristics of the field and the intention By reason of the excellence of the field even though the intention may be weak for example the Bhikṣu who becomes a woman through having insulted the Saṅgha You are nothing but women By reason of the excellence of the intention for example the eunuch who delivered bulls from the danger of being castrated and so regained his own sexuality When a person is definitively detached from a cetain stage  he cannot anymore be reborn in this stage as a consequence action retributable in this stage but in another existencewhether it is good or bad changes its nature and becomes retributable in the present existence this action will be retributed in the present life the person for whom actions should be retributed in this first rebirth in a certain stage cannot be definitively detached from this stage As for action nondeterminate with regard to the retribution itself it will not be retributed if one detaches himself from the stage where it could have been retributed kskk Which field confers on an action which is in a relationship with it the quality of being necessarily retributed in the present existence In general it is the Saṅgha of Bhīkṣus having at its head the Buddha to enumerate its persons there are five types of persons in this absoption he has obtained an extreme tranquility of thought for this absorption is similar to Nirvāṇa When he leaves itit is as if he had gone to Nirvāṇa and has returned from it The person who leaves the absorption which arrests the defile meants of another  in this absorption his mental series is endowed with the intention of placing an infinite number of beings into the absence of defilement when he leaves it his series is penetrated with an intense and measureless merit in this absorption his series is endowed with the intention of increasing the wellbeing of an infinite number of beings when he leaves it his series is penetrated with an intense and measureless merit The person who leaves the Path of Seeing the Ttuths in this Path he has abandoned all the defilements which are abandoned through Seeing the Truths When he leaves it his series is thus pure since his personality has just been renewed The person who leaves the result of Arhat that is to say who has just acquired the result of Arhat he has just achieved the abandoning of all the defilements which are abandoned through Meditation on the Truths His series is pure since his personality has just been renewed This is why good or bad actions well or badly done with regard to these five persons bear a result in the present existence The Paths of Meditation through which one obtains the results of Sakrdāgāmin and of Aṇāgāmin are incomplete in themslves and in their result Can the retribution of a certain action be excusively mental senṣation and not bodily sensation  And can the retribution of a certain action be bodily sensation and not mental sensation Sensation the result of good action free from viarka is exclusively mental Actions of the the sphere of dhḥyānāntara the interval between the First and Second Dhyānas  and the actions of the higher stages are free from vitarka Like bodily sensation that is to say associated with the five sense consciousnesses which always embraces vitarka and vicāra  it cannot be the reṣult of a retribution of an action free from vñarka Sensatio which is the result of a bad action is exclusively physical A sensation the result of retribution of a bad action is painful painful mental sensation is what is termeda sensation of dissatisfaction We have established that dīssatisfaction is never the result of retribution Mentaltrouble is produced in the mental consciousness The expression that the Kārikā uses manascita mental thought is equivalent to the expression wanovijñāna mental consciousness cosciousness of the anas The five sense consciousnesses cannot be troubled because they are free from imagining inquiry and memory and mental trouble is the imagining of that which does not exist It arises from the retribution of actioṇ Mental trouble arises from the retribution of action Through fear the attack of demons irritation of the elements and fear Demon beings with horible features will approach such a person seeing them the person is frightened and his mind is troubled Furious at the evil conduct of humans demon beings willhit them in their vital parts the wind heat and liqnid will be irritated Fear also troubles the mind for example in the case of Vāsiṣṭhī etc kṣksk But one would say if mental trouble or trouble of the mental consciousness arises from the retribution of action how can one say that this mental sensation is not retribution We do not say that trouble of the minda troubled mindis retṛibution of action but that it arises from the retribution of action The primary elements in a state of disequilibrum are retribution the troubledmind proceeds from it t thus arises from retribution Onessays that the mind s troubled whenby reason of the disequilibrium or the irritation of the humors which results from actionthe mind is deranged anarchic devoid of mindfuiness The mind troubled without being disturbed the mind undefiled but troubled  the mind disordered without being troubled the mind defiled but tranquil  the mind troubled and disordered ksk Among whom is trouble of the mind produced Among the gods of Kāmadhātu there are two madnesses all the more so is there madness among humans Pretas and animals Beings in hell always have troubled minds their vital parts are incessantly hurt by thousands of different torments they are crashed down by suffering they do not recognize themselves so they do not distinguish that which they shoulddo and that which they shouldavoid We give as an example a being in hellwho laments by saying Ah With the exception of the Buddha the ryans are not free from trouble of the mind their thoughts can be troubled following the disequilibriim of the elementsBut their disequilibrium of the elements is never retribution for determinate actions where retribution could produce trouble of the mind are retributed before they have obtained the Path and indeterminate actions will not bear their results due to  the fact that the Path is obtained Neither terror nor the attack of demon beings nor fear can trouble the mind of the ryaṇms for theyare above the five fears they do no disobedient actions which excite the fury of demon beingsfor they cmpletely know the nature of things ṅtk The Sūtra teaches that there are three ctookednesses crookedness of the body speech and mind and thus three corruptions and three stains What is termed crookedness corruption stains is action arisen from hypocrisy hatred and attachment Action of the body speech and mind which arises from hypocrisy proceeds from crookedness and is called crookedness  action which arises from hatred proceeds from hatred and is called coruption and action which arises from attachment proceeds from stai and is termed stain Action is of four types white black etc The Sūtra teaches that action is of four types black of black retribution white of white retribution blackwhite of blackwhite retribution neither black nor white without black or white retribution and that which destroys the other actions Bad actions good action of Rūpa good actions of Kāma are respectively black white blackwhite action which destroys the other actions is pure action Bad action being defiled is absolutely black retribution being painful is black Good action of the sphere of Rūpadhātu not mixed with the bad is absoutely white its retribution being agreeable is white Objection Why not say the same for good action of the sphere of rūpyadhātu Because the qualification white applies only to action which has two retributions  aṇd which is threefold bodily vocal andmmental Good action of the sphere of Kāmadhātu being mixed with the bad is blackwhite its retribution is mixed so it is thus blackwhite There is no action which is blackwhite nor any retribation which is blackwhite which would be a contradiction Butbad action is also mixed with whiteaction hence bad action should be defined as blackwhite Bad action is not necessarily mixed with good action whereas in Kāmadhātu good action is necessatrily mixed with bad because in this sphere the bad is stronger than the good Pure action destroys the other three types of action Not being defiled it is not black not being retributiion it is not white It is nonwhite the Blessed One wishes to oppose pure action to white action but speaking in the Mahāśūnyatāsūśra of thedharmas proper to the Arhat he expresses himself thus The dbarmas of the Arhat Oh nanda are absolutely white absolutely good absolutely irreprochable And one reads in the Treatise What are the white dharmas The good dharmas and the neutral dharmas Pure action does not have any retribution for it is not of the domain of the spheres of existence in factit aṛrests the process of existence Does any pure action destroy all the actions of the first three categories black white or blackwhite A volition may be of twelve types namely the volition of the dharmakṣāṇtis andof the first eight paths of abandoning in the detachment of Kāmadhātu such is the action which destroys black action Four volitions correspond to the four dharmakṣāntis of the Path of Seeing the Truths eight voiitions correspond to the fitst eight paths of abandoning in thedetachment of Kāmadhātu inall twelve volitionsall pure actions which destroy bad actions The volition of the ninth is the action which destroys blackwhite action The volition which corresponds to the ninth path of abandoning in the detachment of Kāmadhātu is the pure action which causes the abandoning of blackwhite action and black action for at this moment one abandons in its entirety good action of Kāmadhātu and the ninth and last category of bad action Volition which arises in the last paths of abandoning of the detachment of the dhyānas destroys good action The volition of the ninth and last path of abandoning which produces detachment of Kāmadhātu with regard to each dhyāna is fourfold volition which destroys white action Objection Thefirst eight paths of abandoning in the detachmentof Kāmadhātu destroy black action But you attribute the power to destroy whiteblack and white action solely to the ninth path of abandoning There is not propetly speaking abandonment of any good dharmas for even if they are abandoned the good dharmas can reappear but when the defilement which has thisdharrna for its object is destroyed this dharma is said to be abandoned Therefore as long as the last category of defilement which can grasp it as its object is not destroyed this gooddharma is not considered abandoned According to others the action which should be experienced inhell is black action action which should be experienced elsewhere in Kāmadhātu in addition to hell is black white action Infernal retribution is produced exclusively through bad action as a consequence action which should be experienced in hell is black action Retribution in Kāmadhātu with the exception of hell is exclusively produced by goodbad action Accoding to others arisen in Kāma actions are black when they can be abandoned through Seeing the Truths they are blackwhite in the contrary case According to other masters action which is abandoned through Seeing the Truths not being mixed with the good is black AIl other actions of Kāmadhātu namely action which is abandoned through Meditation is blackwhite that is good mixed with bad k The Sūtra says There are three silences silence of the body voice and of the mind  Afaikṣa that is an Arhats actions of the body voice and mind are in this order the three silences Silence of the body and silence of the voice is bodily and vocal action which belongs to the Arhat Silence of the mind is the mind or thought which belongs to an Arhat this is not mental action Why is this Because the mind is the true Silent One the trne Muni The Vahāṣikas say that one knows through inferenceby reason of the actions of the body and voicethat the mind is afaikṣa But silence is abstention thus the mind itself which abstains receives the name of silence Why does only the mind of the Arhat receive this name Because the Arhat is the true Silent One through the cessation of all murmnuring of his defilements kks The Sūtra says There are three purifications purification of the body purification of the voice and purification of the mind The threefold good practice in its entirety is the threefold purification All the good practices of the body pure or impure are a purification of the body because either for a time or in a definitire manner they efface the impurity of the defilements and bad practices The same holds for the voice and mind This teaching has for its goal the instruction of persons who take a false silence for silence and a false purification of purification kkk The Sūtra says that there are three bad practices The bad actions of the body speech and mind are regarded as being the three bad practices Bad actions of thebody are the bad practices of the body and so on Even though greed wickedness anger and false views are not actions they constitute a threefoldbad practice of the mind greed wickedness or harm and false views The Dārṣṭāntikas say that greed wickedness and false views are in fact mental actions for the Sacetanāyasñra considers them as actions In this hypothesis defilements and actions would be the same thing The Dārṣṭāntikas What harm do you see in that The Vaibhāṣikas As for the Sacetanāyasra to which you allude it is volition itself that it designates when it says greed because volition comes into play under the influence of greed Because these produce a painful retribution and because they are condemned by good persons these practices of the body speech and mind are bad they are thus termed bad practices good actions of the body speech and mind further nongreed nonwickedness and right views kksḥ How can false views or right views by regarded as bad or good In fact the firstdoes not contain an intention to do evil and the second does not contain an intention to do good to another By taking among these practices the most evident one defines the ten coutses of action good and bad respectively The Sñtra defines ten courses of actin good coutses of action by taking the most importantwhich are the easiest to seefrom among the good practicesand bad courses of actionby taking the gravest from among the bad practices kkk What practices bad or good are not included in the courses of action A part of thebad practices of the bodynamely preparatoy aṇd consecutive actions of bodily courses of action  and certain defiled actions of the body for exampledrinking alcohol hittingbinding etc  ate not incuded among the coutses of action because these practiees are not extremely grave Among the bad practices of thebody are courses of action which deprive another of his life of his goods or of his wife one must absoutely abstain from them That which is very grave among bad practices of speech is for this same reason declared to be a course of action not preparatory consecutive or minor actior One part of the bad practice of the mind volition is also excluded from the bad courses of action The good courses of action do not include  eithera part of the good practice of the body preparatory or consecutive abstention from inebriating drinksetc alms worshipetc or one part of the good practice of speech affectionate words etc  or one part of the good practice of the mind good volition kkk Among the courses of action Six bad courses of action can be exclusively gviñapti When one has six courses of actionmurder stealing lying maliious speech harmful speech or inconsiderate speechperformed by another then these six courses of action are only avsjñapiHe who had these actions carried out is lacking the principle vijñapti that is the act of killing itseif etc One bad course of action is always of two types When one has it committed by another he does not procure the same pleasure ix when one caries them out himself are of two types When one executes them himself the six courses of action specified above are atone and the same time vñapt andavjñapt if death takes place at the same moment as the vjñapti  if death takes place later there is only gvijñapti ksksk Among the good courses of action Seven good courses of action are of two types In fact the morality that one undertakes depends on one vrjñapti They are only zvrñapti when they have arisen from absorption The courses of action which are included in āharmasia that is in the discipline of dhyāna and in the pure discipline are qualified as arisen from absorption These two disciplines depend on a single thought the courses of action are thus not vsjñapti Is this also the case for preparatory and consecutive actions as for the principle action or the course of action proper They are always viñapti They may or may not be avij ñapti When they are accomplished with a great violence of passion or with an extreme strength of faith  they are avijñapt If not then no The opposite concerning consecutive action Consecutive actions are on the contrary necessarily gvijñaptiThey are viñapti whenhaving accomplisheda course of action one continues to commit actions analogous to the course of action k What is it that constitutes preparatory action the course of action proper and consecutive action A maṇ desiring to kill an animal rises from his bed takes some silver goes to the market feels the animal buys the animal leads it pulls it makes it enter mistreats it takes a sword strikes the head once or twice At the strokeby which he deprives the animal of its lifethat isat the moment when the animal diesthe vñapts of this moment and the aviñapti which is simultaneous to this viñapti are the course of action proper For it is by reason of two causes thatone is touched by the transgression of murder by reason of the preparatory action and by reason of the achievement of the result The moments that follow the moments of viñapti cteated by the killing are the consecutive action the series of the moments of viñapti are also consecutive action moments that constitute pulling the hide off the animal washing it weighing it selling it cooking it eating it and congratulating oneself on it In the same way one can explain with the necessary changes the other six courses of bodily and vocal action There is no reason to distingnish preparatory and consecutive action for greed wickedness and false views at the moment when they manifest themselves by the sole fact of their presence they are couses of action proper A question is raised at the moment when the animal is in varapa bhava ṭthat isat the moment when the animal dies Or is the vjñapti and the avjjñapti of the moment when the animal is in rtabhava that is when it is dead If you accept the first hypothesis a person would be guilty of the transgression of killing when he kills at the very moment when the killed animal dies but your system does not admit this And in the second hypothesis you have rightly said that at the stroke by which he deprives the animal of its life the viñapti of this moment and the svjñapti simultaneous to this vifñapti are the course of action proper Further if you accept the second hypothesis you contradict the explanation that the Vaibhāṣikas give to the phrasewhile the prayoga has not yet disappeared that one reads in the Mlasfāstra This āstra says Can it be the case that a living being has already been killed but that murder has not yet occured Yes when the living being has already been deprived of life but when the prayoga has not yet disappeared The Vaibhāṣikas explain this text by saying that the word prayoga which normally signifies pteparationhere has the meanin of consecutive action Now you contradict this explanation since placing the course of principle action at the moment when the animal dies it is indeed the course of principal action which according to you has not disappeared at the moment when the animal dies You interpret the word prayoga of the āstra in the sense of the principal action But how could the vñapt of the moment when the animal is already dead be the principal course of action Why would it not be Because it is ineffective The Vaibhāṣikas It is not their efficacy which makes a vjñaptś ḥk Can it be the case that one course of action is either a preparatory action or a consecutive action of another couse of action For example the ten courses of action can be a preparatory action for murder A man desires to kill his enemy in order to assure the success of this enterprise he takes the goods of another and offers an animal in sacrifice as a means to this same end he committs adultery with the wife of his enemy in order to make her an accomplice through lying malicious injurious and frivolous words he causes a falling out between his enemy and his friends who would be able to defend him he coveṭs the goods of his enemy he wishes to do evil to his enemy he nourishes false views with regard to the murder that he wants to commit In this same way the ten courses of action can be the consecutive action of muder But greed wickedness and false views are never preparatory actions for they are not the beginning of an action nor are they preparatory actions for they are solely a production of the mind kkṣk The Sūtra says There are Oh Bhikṣus three types of killing killing arisen from desire killing arisen from hatred and killing arisen from ignorance and thus following to There are Oh Bhikṣus three types of false views All the courses of action are not indifferently achieved by desire hatred or ignorance but Preparatory action arises from three roots The preparatory action of all of the courses of action can indifferently arise fromm the three roots The BlessedOneby expressing himself as we have seen refers to the first cause the cause which gives rise to the course of action LKilling arisen from desire killing in order to seize a ceṛtain part of an animal killing in order to seize some goods killing for pleasure killing in order to defend oeself or ones friends Killing arisen from hatred in order to satiate hostility Killing arisen through ignorance To consider the sacrifice as a pious action andso to kill when a king according to the authority of the legalists kills through duty The first of the meritorious actions of the king is to punish evildoets when the Persians say One should kill ones aged and sick parents when one says One should kill serpents scorpions and ryambuka flies  etc because these creatures are poisonous one must kill game cattle birds and buffalos in order to nourish oṇeself And finally killing which is provoked by false views murder committed by a person who denys a future life and whom nothing can stop Stealing arisen from desire Either one steals the object desired or one steals in order to then gain possession of another object to acquire honor and respect or in order to defend oneself and ones friends Stealing arisen from hatred in order to satiate hostility Stealing arisen from ignorance A king upon the authority of the legalists seizes the goods of evildoersThe Brāhmins say All things have been given to the Brāhmins by Brahmā and it is through the weakness of theBrāhmins that the Vrṣalas enjoy it Consequently when a Brāhmin steals he takes that whichbelongs to him he eats what is his wears what is his and gives what is his And yet when Brāhmins take they indeed have the notion of the goods of another Stealing provoked through false views is also stealing from ignorance TIicit sexuality arisen from desire Sexual intercourse with the wife of another either through love or in order to obtain honor and respect or in order to defend oneself and ones friends Illicit sexuality arisen through hatred in order to satiate hostility The Persians etc have intercourse with their mothers and other forbidden womer In the gosava sacrifice a Brāhmin drinks water in the manner of an animal grazes through the grass has intercourse with his motherhis sisterora woman of his gora he must copulate with them wherever he finds them And such too are those that say Women are like rice mortars flowers fruits cooked food ladders roads and ferryboats they are there to be used Lying and other vocal transgressions arisen from ignorance and from hatred as above Lying arisen from ignorance Oh King playful lying lying to women in marriageor indanger of death does not hurt one says that these five lies are not transgressions This is lying provoked by false views Malicious words and other vocal transgressions arisen from ignorance These are provoked through false views How do greed wickedness and false views arise out of desire etc Greed and the other two mental courses arise from the three roots because they appear subsequent to these roots When they appear immediately after desire they arise from desire kck We have explained the bad courses of action in their relationship with the roots As for the good courses of action Good actions with their preparatory and consecutive actions arise fron nondesire nonhatred and nonignorance Good courses of action with their preparatory and consecative actions have a goodmind for theiroriginating cause This good mindbeing necessarily associated with the three roots arises from the three roots  The renouncing of a preparation of a bad course of action is a preparation of a good course of action the renouncing of the action proper which constitutes a bad coarse of action is itself a good course of actio the renouncing of a consecative action of a bad course of action is a consecutive action of a good course of action the ordination of a novice From the moment when the novice enters into the nānāvasa salutes the Saṅghaaddresses his request to the Upādhyāya uṇntil the first or second karmavācana this is the preparatory actior At the achievement of the third armavācana there takes place a viṝñapti and an avijñapti simultaneous to this vupti which constitute the course of action itself kkk We have seen that bad courses of action were not indifferently achieved by the three roots Killing wickedness and injurious words are achieved through hate Solely by hate They are achieved when one thought of murder or one thought of violence manifests itself Adultery greed and stealing are achieved through desire Adultery is illicit sexuality False views through ignorance Through an extreme ignorance The others by the three The other courses of actionlying malicious words and in considerate wordsare achieved either through desire hatred or ignoraṇce The courses of action which have just been divided into four sections three  three one and three have respectively for their Object Living beings are the objects of killing wickedness and injurious speech the objects of enjoyment are the objects of adultery greed and stealing nāmarūpa that is the five skandhas atre the object of false views nāman that isthenāmakāya is the object of lying and the other two transgressions of the voice kkṣk When one has decided to kill someone and if the murderer dies either before the intended victim or if he dies at precisely the same momentas the victimis therea principal courseof action for the author of the murderJf one dies before or at the same time there is no principal course of action When a person has made the preparation for killing can itbe that at the moment when the result of this preparation is achieved thiśs person is not touched by the transgression of killing Answer Yes when the murderer dies before or at the same time The reason is cleat as long as the victim is living the murderer is not touched by the trans gressioṅl of murder and when the victim dies he no longer exists if he died at the same time or before Because a new body has come into existence The bodythe personalityby whom the preparation had been accomplished the body of the murderer is destroyed the murderer takes up a new body which belongs to another niāyasabhāga  this body did not make the preparation is not prayoktar and as a consequence cannot be touched by the transgression of murder When many persons are united with the intention to kill either in war or iathe huntor inbanditry who is gnitty of mutder if only one of them kills As soldiers etc concur in the realization of the same effect all are as guilty as the one who kills Having acommon goal all are guilty exactly as he who among them kills for all mutually incite one another not through speech but by the very fact that they are united together in order to kill But is the person who has been constrained through force to join the army also guilty Evidently sounless he has formed the resolution Even in order to save my life I shall not kill a living being kkṣk What does he do in order that he who kills should commit the course of actin Same question for the other transgressions up to and including false views Murder is to kill another consciously without making an iiA When a personkills by thinking I am killing such a one and kilis this same person and not another through error then there is murḍder But is there murder when a person kills doubting if he hits a living being or a thing or if he hits another This person possesses the certitude This is certainly him he hits him and as a consequence there is the thought of parityāga How can therebe murder or destruction of the prāṇa  since the skandhas are momentary Prāna the vitalbreath is a wind whose existence depends on the body and the mind This prṇa is annihilated by a murderer in the same way in whichone annihilatesa flame or a sound of a bell that isto say by obstructing the continuation of its reproducing itself Or rather prūa is the vital ogan  when a person creates an obstacle to the arising of a new moment of the vital organ he annihilates it and is touched by the transgression of killing But to whom do you attribute the vital organ Who do you say is dead when life is absent Let us observe that the Blessed One said When life heat and consciousness leave the body it lies abandoned like a piece of wood deprived of feeling One says that the body lives when it isendowed with the organs and that the body is dead when it is devoid of them kesk According to theNirgranthas transgression results for the doer from killing even comrmitted without knowing it or without desiring itin the way that contact with fire results inburning But if this is the case then one is gnilty when one sees or touches without wanting to the wife of another he who trims the hair of the Nigranthas is guilty the master of the Nirgranthas is guilty since he preaches terrible austerities he who gives the Nirgranthas food which provokes cholera and death is also guilty The mother and the embryo which are both the cause of sufferingare guilty guilty aiso is the person killed for he is bound to the action of killing as the object killed and fire burns its own support But on the other hand he who has murder committed by another is not guilty for one is not himself burned when one has another person touch the fire Since you do not take intention into consideration wood and other materials even though lacking consciousness are guilty of murder when a house collapses and living beings perish kk Stealingtaking what is not givenis to appropriate to oneself the goods of another through force or in secret The reservation above holds with the condition that there has been no eor To appropriate to oneself through force or in secret that which is possessed by another when one does not confuse the person from whom one wants to steal with another person constitutes stealing for at the moment of Nirvāṇa the Blessed One accepted appropriated to himself all the gifts made to Stūpas According to others this is to take a thing which has not beengiven by the guardians of the Stūpa To take a thing that does not have an owner is to take what is not given by the ruler of the country To take the goods the robes etcof an deceased monk is to take what is not given by the Saṅgha of the parish in the case when an ecclesiastical action has not been done in the opposite case this is to take what is not given by all the disciples of the Buddha Illicit sexuality fourfold is intercourse with a woman with whom one should not have intercourse Intercourse witha forbidden woman that is the wife of another onesmother onesdaughter or ones paternal or maternal elations Intercourse withones own wife through aforbidden way at an unsuitable time when the wife is pregnant when she is nursing or when she has takena vow Some say when she has taken a vow only with the consent of her husband The reservation relative to killing with the condition that there has been no erroralso extends to illicitsexualityand there is no course of action when one has intercourse with the wife of another if one thought that he was with his own wife Opinions differ on whether there is a coutse of action when one takes the wife of a certain one for the wife of another one For some yes for it isthe wifeof another who was the objectof the preparatory action it isalso the wifeof another thatone enjoys With regard to whom is intercoutse with Bhikṣuṇis ilcit sexuality With regard to the master of the land who is not disposed to tolerate it As for the master of the country himselfif his spouse when she has undertaken a vow is forbidden to him all the more reason are nuns so forbidden Intercourse with a young gitl is illicit with regard to the Inan to whom she is engaged and if she is not engaged with regard to her guardiam if he has no guardian then with regard to theking Lying is discourse held with differing thoughts with a person who understands the meaning  Lying is discourse held with thoughts different from the sense expressed with a person who understands the meaning When the person addressed does not understand such discourse is only frivolous words Discourse is sometimes made up of numerous syllables Which will be the course of action Which will be lies The last syllable which is viñap and which is accompanied by avijñaptiOr rather the syllable whose hearing causes the meaning to be understood The preceeding syllables are a preparation for the lie How should one interpret the expression arthābhijña a person who understands the meaning Does this refer to the moment when the person addressed understands the meaning Does it refer to a person addressed capable of understanding the meaning In the first hypothesis you admit that the course of action takes place when the person addressed has understood the meaning it follows then that the course of action is solely viiñapti for the person addressed understood the meaning through mental consciousness which is consecative to auditory consciousness and the vjñapt o vocal action peishes at the same time as the auditory consciousness There is no longer any viṝñapti at the moment when the person addressed understands But what must one do in order that the person addressed is capable of understanding the mean ing The person who knows the language and in whom auditory consciousness has arisen is capable of understanding the meaning One must interpret the text in a manner in which it will not give rise to criticism ksksk The Sūtra teaches that there are sixteen yocal actions eight of which are bad tosay that one has seen what one has not seen to say that one has heard cognized or known what one has not heard cognized or known to say that one has not seen when one has seen and to say that one has not heard cognized or known when one has heard cognized or known and eight are good to say that one has not seen when one has not seen What is the meaning of the words seen  heard  cognized  and known  What is perceived through the visual consciousness through the auditory consciousness through the mental consciousness and through three consciousnesses is called in order seen heard cognized and known What is perceived through the visual consciousness receives the name of seenwhat is perceived through the consciousness of smell taste and touch receives the name of known How do you justify this last interpretation The Vaibhāṣikas say that odors tastes and tangible things being morally neutral are as dead  this is why they are called mmākā The Sautrāntikas According to the ūtraandby virtue of reasoṇing The Sūtra says What do you thinkOh Mālakīmātar the visible objects that you have not seen that you have not seen formerly that you do not see about which you do not think Would that I could see them do you have by reason of them any longing lust desire affection attachment appetite or searching out No Lord Oh Mālakīmāta with regatd to the subject seen you will only think it is seen with regard to the subject heatd cognizedand known you will only think it is heard cognized known The words seenheard and cognized certainly refer to visible things to sounds and to the dharmas hence the word ata refers to smells tastes and tangible things If it were otherwise the experience relative to smells tastes and tangible things would notbe refered to inthis teaching of the Blessed Oṇne This ūtra does not have the meaning that you beiieve it does and is does not confirm your interpretation of the word maiaThe Blessed One does not aim to define the characteristics of the four experiences having seen having heard having cognized having mataHis mind is evidently In the fourfold experience seeing etc each of which beats on the sixfold objects visible things sounds smells tasṣtes tangible things and dharmasyou maintain only that this experience takes place that you see etc without attributing to the object the characteristic of disagreeable or agreeable Then what should one thus understand by seen heard mata and cognized According to the autrāntikas that which isimmediately perceived by the five material organs is seen dṛṣṭ that the consciousness of which is transmitted to us by another is heard frux what is admitted by reason of correct reasoning is zaśaknown and what is perceived by the mental organ is cognized vñāta such is the fourfold experience that the Sūtra refers to It is thus false that in the hypothesis whereaadoes notdesignate odors tastes and tangible matter the experience relative to these objects would be omitted in the Sūtra thus the argument of the Vaibhāṣikas does not hold According to former rnasters seen is what is perceived by the ogan of seeing heard is what is perceivedby the organ of hearing and what one learns from another known is what is personally accepted or experienced and cognized is what one feels in and of oneself kksk Does he who by means of his body and not by means of speech causes to be understood what is not in his mind comrmit lying The āstra says in factQuestion Can one be touched by the transgression of killing without acting without attacking bodily Answer Yes when one acts vocally Question Can one be touched by the transgression of lying without vocal action Answer Yes when one acts bodily Can one be touched by the transgression of murder by the transgression of lying without either bodily or vocal action Answer Yes for example the ṣis guilty of murder through their anger and a Bhikṣu guilty of lying through his silence in the confession ceremony hence there is no viñapti and avsjñapti of the sphere of Kāmadhātu cannot exist where vjñapti is absent This is a difficulty that must be resolved Malicious or slanderous speech is the discourse of a person with a defiled mind with a view to dividing The discourse that one has witha defiled mind with a view to dividing others and creating enmity is malicious speech The restrictions formulated above when the person addressed understands when there is no confusion of persons applies here Injarious wods are abusive discourse All defiled discoutse is inconsiderate speech The Kārikā has all defiled  but it refers here to discourse All defiled discourse is inconsiderate speech one who utters it is thus aninconsiderate speaker but the Kārīkā has bhinnapralāpitā in place of sabhinnapralāpa According to others inconsiderate speech is the defiled discourse which differs from the others the name inconsiderate speech is reserved for the defiled speech which is neither lying nor malicious nor injurious For example boasting singing declamations for example bad commentaries For example a monk boasts about himself in order to obtain alms etc through frivolity some others sing in the course of plays or dances the dancers in order to entertain the public hold inconsiderate discourse adopting the doctrines of bad philosophers nonBuddhists read bad commentaries And in addition there are lamentations and loquaciousness caried out with a defiled mind but which differ from lying malicious speech and injurious speech But is it not true that in the period of a Cakravartin King there are songs that do not have inconsiderate words In this period songs are inspired by a spirit of detachment not by sensuality Oṛ according to another opinion there is in this period inconsiderate words since one speaks of āvāha of vivāha etc but this inconsiderate speech does not constitute the course of action of this ame Greed is the desire to appropriate to oneself by illigitimate means the goods of another To desire to appropriate to oneself the goods of another in an illegitimate manner in an unjust mannerby force or secretlyWould that the goods of another were mine is the course of action called greed abhidhyā According to another opinion bhihyā means all desire of the sphere of Kāmadhātu for the Sūtra of the Five Nīvaraṇas on the subject of kāmacchanda expresses itself thusly Having abaṇdoned abhidhyā But say other masters Cakravartin Kings and the Uttarakurus are not guilty of the course of abhdhyāactioand yet they are not delivered from desire of the sphere of Kāmadhātn Let us admit thatall desire of the sphere of Kāmadhātu is bhidhyā but all abhidhyā is not a course of action Only the most notable among the bad practices are included among the courses of action Wickedness is a hatred of living beings It is a hatred of living beings by which one desires to harm the person of another False view is the opinion that there is neither good nor badt As it is said in the Sūtra There is no gift no sacrifice no oblation no good action nobadaction there are no Arhats in the world False view as this Sūtra shows consists of negating action its reṣults and the existence of ryans The Kārikā only indicates the beginning Such is the definition of the ten bad courses of action kṣkṣk What is the meaning of the expression couse or pathway of action  Three are courses of action seven are also action Greed wickedness and false views are courses of actioncourses of action that one terms volition it moves by their outgoing A similar composition is justified by the rule of asarāpāṇām apy ekaśeṣaḥ A single meaning is maintained even when the terms of a compound are different In the same way one should understand the good courses of action the renouncing of killing etc non etc kksk Why are not preparatory and consecutive actions considered as courses of action  And finally courses of action are actions the augmentation and dirinution of which have for their result the augumentation or the diminution of things and living beings strk The Sautrāntikas do not recognize volition as a mental action for them there is no mental action outside of greed etc How then do they explain the fact that the Sūtra gives the name of course of action to greed etc This is a question they must answer The response is not difficult Greed wickedness and false view are mental actions and they are pathways leading to bad realms of rebirth or rather they are both courses of action for greed sets into motion wickedness and false view and vice versa kīk The ten bad courses of action are in complete contradiction with the good dharmas The view of negation cuts off the roots of good The cutting off of the rootsof good takes place through the false view of the ninth degree strongstrong Objection You affirm that only false view cuts off the roots of good but the Treatise says What are the strong roots of evil They are the roots of evil which cut off the roots of good the roots of evil which are initially adandoned when one acquires detachment from Kāmadhātu Only false view cuts off the roots of good but false view is brought about by the roots of evil hence the Treatise attributes to these last the operation which more properly belongs to false views In the same way that one says that bandits burn a village because it is they who light the fire that burns the village kksk What roots of good are cut off The innate roots of the sphere of Kāmadhātu The roots of good of the sphere of Kāmadhātu are cut off when one cuts off the roots of good for one who cuts off the roots of good of Kāmadhātu is not endowed with the roots of good of Rūpadhātu or rūpyadhātu If this is so how should one understand this text of the Prajñāpti What cuts off this persons roots of good of the three spheres This text means that at this moment the aoquisition of the roots of good of the superior spheres become distant because this person who was formerly fit for these acquisitions ceases to exist through the cutting off of the roots of good of Kāmadhātu It refers to the innate roots of good for one who cuts off the roots of good has already fallen from the acquired roots of good What is the objectof the false view which cuts off the roots of good The false view which negates cause and result Negation of cause is to think There is neither good nor bad action Negation of result is to thinkThere is no retribution no result of good or bad action According to another opinion these two false viewsthat which negates cause and that which negates resultcontribute to the cutting off of the roots of good in the same way as ānantaryamārga and vimukiimārga contribute to the cutting off of the defilements In fact the negation which bears on the pure or the higher spheres is weak because it is in relation with these objects only by association Completely The roots of good are cut off completely by false view whether this tefers to cause or result pure or impure Kāmadhātu or the higher spheres ksk Some say that the nine categories of the roots of good weakweak roots of good weakmedium weakstrong mediumweak etc are cut off all at once through one moment of false view in the same way that the defileaments which are abandoned by Seeing into one Truth are in all their categoriesabandoned through the Seeing of this Ttuth Gradually The roots of good are cut off in the manner in which the defilements to be abandoned through Meditation on the Truths are abandoned this means that the strongstrong root of good is cut off by a weakweak false view and thus following to the weakweak root of good which is cut off by a strongstrong false view This theory is not in agreement with the text What are the small and concomitant roots of good They are those which are abandoned lastly to the cutting off of the roots of good those through the absence of which a person is termed onewhohastherootsof If the cutting off is gradual how should one understand the text What are the strongstrong roots of evil The roots of evil through which one cats off the roots of good This text refers to the achievement of the cutting off of the roots of good for it is through the strongstrong roots of evil that the roots of good totally disapear As long as the last category of the roots of good the weakweak is not cut off it can determine the reappearance of the others According to certain masters the cutting off of the riine categories takes place at one time without interruption like the abandoning of the defilements through the Path of Seeing into the Truths According to certain masters the abandoning of discipline preceeds the cutting off of the roots But the Vaibhāṣikas say that the discipline is lost when one loses the mind of which this discipline is the result kkk What beings are capable of cutting off the roots of good Only humans cut them off not the creatures in the painful realms of rebirth for their discernment  whether defiled or not is not firm not the gods for the reṣult of action is manifest to them And only humans of the three continents cut them off bot those of Uttarakuru for they do not possess bad āśayas According to another opinion only humas in Jambudvīpa cut off the roots of good But this is in contradiction with the text The inhabitants of Jambudvīpa possess a minimum of eight organs the same for the inhabitants of Pūrvavidena and of Avaragodānīya Men and women cut off the roots According to another opinion women do not cut off the roots because their will and their application are weak But this is in contradiction with the text Whoever possesses the female organ necessatily possesses eight organs The sensualistdoes not cut off the roots of good because his āfaya is in movement the only one who cuts them off is The rationalist Because his āfzya is bad fitm and hidden By virtue of thesesame principleseunuchs etcdo not cut off the roots of good because they are counted among the sensualists and because their discernment like that of the creatures of painful realms of rebirth is not firm What is the nature of the cutting off of the roots of good The cutting off is nonpossession When the possession of the roots of good is obstructed in rearising in continuing then ten nonpossessions  or nonendowed ments arise When aprāpi has arisen there is a catting off of the roots of good It can happen that a person whose roots of good have been cut off produces relative to cause and result either doubt or insight into their existence which is Right View When Right View has arisen then one says that the roots of good have arisen because the possession of these roots is henceforth present The roots arise in their nine categories but they willonly gradually manifest themselves in the same way that one initially regains ones health and then gradually ones strenṇgth Other persons who have cut off the roots of good can take them up again in this lifebut not one guilty of an āvantarya transgression who has thus cut off the roots of good It is with regard to this transgressor that it is said This person is unfit to again take up the roots of good in this life but he certainly will take them up either by dying in hell or bybeing born By being born means to be found in an intermediate state By dying meanms disposed to die The roots of good are taken up by being born since they have been cut off by the force of the cause and by dying since they have been cut off by the force of a condition Same difference when they have been cut off by ones own force or by the force of another The person who is āfayavipannathat is to say lost by the fact of his false viewcan take up again the roots of good in the present existence The person who is both āśayavipaṇṇa and prayo gavipannathat is one who is furtherrmore lost through the fact of his ānantarya transgressiontakes up the roots again only after the destruction of his body One can cut off the roots of good and not be destined to hell Four cases Ajātaśatru  Devadatta and  persons who have not cut off the roots and who have committed an ānantarya transgression keksk Volition is the principal action We shall explain with how many courses of action volition can coexist With regard to the painful realms of rebirth volition can coexist at most with eight courses Volition caṇ coexist with one course of action as when either greed anger or a false view manifests itself without any material course of action having taken place or rather the person who has prepared one of the material courses of action finds himself to have a nondefiled that isa good or neutralmind at the moment when on his instigation this course of action is perpetuated Volition can coexist with two courses of action as when a person with an angry mind kills or when a person who is prey to greed steals or commits adultery or speaks in an inconsiderate manner Volition can coexist with three courses of action as when a person with an angry mind kills and steals at the same time But havent we seen that stealing is only achieved by desire alone  This testriction refers to the achievement of stealing com mitted by a person who only thinks of stealing Volition can coexist with threecourses of action as when greed is present at the moment when two material courses of action are completed that one has committed by another Volition can coexistwith four courses of action as when one lies or when one injures with the intention of dīviding there is one mental course f actionand three vocal courses of action O rather when the mind is in the prey of greed etc at the moment when three material courses are completed Volition can coexist with five six or seven courses of actio as when the mindis in the prey of greed etc at the moment when four five or six material courses of action are completed Volition can coexist with eight courses of action as when a person has made the preparatoy action of six courses of action murder etc at the moment when these six courses of action are completed he is in the prey of greed and commits adultery Volition cannot coexist with nine courses of action or with ten courses because greed anger false view are not simultaneous Concerning good courses of action volition can coexist with ten The ten good courses of action can be simultaneous to volition Volition does not coexist with one eight or five couses of action Volition can coexist with two courses of actionsas when a person in the absorption of rūpyadhātu in possessionof kṣayajñāna or anutpādajñāna  his five consciousnesses are good There are thus two courses of action nongreed and nonanṇger Volition can coexist with three courses of action as when the mental consciousness is associated with Right View and when the seven good material courses of action are absent Volition can coexist with four courses of action  Volition can coexist with six courses of action as when the five consciousnesses being good one undertakes the same disciplines Volition can coexist with seven courses of action When with a good mental consciousness one undertakes the same discipline add Right View O rather when with a bad or neutral mind one undertakes the discipline of Bhīkṣu Volition can coexist with nine courses of action One undertakes the discipline of a Bhikṣu the five consciousnesses being good Right View is absent one undertakes this same discipline at a momenṭ when in an absorption of rūpya dhātu one possesses kṣayajñāna o anutpādajñāna Volition can coexist with ten good courses of action when one undertakes the discipline of a Bhikṣu with a good mental cosciousness except in the case of ṣzyajñāna and anutpāda fñāṇa and all volition concomitant with the discipline of dḥyāna and pure discipline when this volition is not associated with hbṣaūn o anutpādajñāna When one renounces a transgression and when one has a mind different from thatwhich provokes this renouncing that isa defiled ot eutralmind  this good mental consciousness includes the three mental actions to which is added two renouncings two material actions and  whenunder the same conditions whenone renounces five transgressions ākik What are the courses of action which exist either in fact or as potentiality in the different realms of rebirthInconsiderate words injurious words anger of two types exist in hell Inconsiderate words exist in hell forbeings in helllament injurious words for beings in hell mutually reproach one another and anger because they hate one another for the duration of their lives Greed and false views as potentiality Beings in hell possess greed and false views but these do not actually exist in hell because of the absence of any object to which one could become attached and because the result of action is manifested In hellkilling isabsent for beings in helldie through the exhaustion of their actions  stealing and adultṛy are absent for beings in helldo not have property or objects of property or women lying isabsent for it is useless and malicious words are useless for beings in hell are at a distance and are always separate from one another Three exist in Uttarakuru Greed anger and false views exist in Uttarakuru in the sense that the inhabitants of Uttarakuru are in possession of a potentiality for greed anger and false views The seventh course exists there in fact also Because bad āśzya is absent there because the duration of ones life is determined there  and because no one possesses any property or object of property or women and also through its lack of usefulness killing and the other courses of action are absent in Uttarakuru If the men of Uttarakuru do not have wives how can they have uṅchaste behavior They take the women with whom they desire to enjoy pleasure by the hand and go to a tree If sex with this woman is allowable the tree covers up the couple with its branches in the contrary case the tree does not cover up the couple The ten bad courses of action exist elsewhere in Kāma dhātu The ten bad courses of action exist in fact in Kāmadhātu with the exception of hell and Uttarakuru Does killing exist among the gods The gods do not amongst themselves kill one another but they kill beings belonging to other realms of rebirth Pretas etc According to another opinion the gods also kill bycutting the head or the body Three good courses of action exist everywhere as potentiality and in fact Everywhere in the three spheres of existence and in the five realms of rebirth nongreed nonanger and Right Views exist both as potentiality and in fact In the rūpyas among the Unconscious Ones seven courses of action exist as potentiality Amonghe beings of rūpyadhātu aṇd the Asāmjñisattvas  the seven good material courses of action bodily and vocal exist solely as potentaility In fact ryans who are born in rūpyadhātu possess the past and future discipline of pure morality and the Unconscious Oṇes possess the discipline of hyāna under the same conditiops The past pure discipline that the ryan who is in rūpyadhātu possesses has for its base of support the stage or stages which he has produced and destroyed the future pure discipline that he will possess has on the contrary the five stages for its base of support For the rest good courses of action also exist in fact with the exception of beings in hell and the Uttarakurus The rest that is in the other spheres of existence and in the other realms of rebirth Beings in hell and the Uttarakurus do not undertake any morality Elsewhere the seven good material courses of action exist in fact One must make a distinction Among the animals and Pretas the good courses of action are never necessarily connected with discipline in Rūpadhātu they are always necessarily connected with discipline elsewhere they can be of one or the other category All the other courses of action have retributive results outflowing result and predominating results Good or bad the ten courses of action have a threefold result Such is the retributive result If a transgressor is rteborn in a human existence through murder he will be of brief lifespan through stealing he will be poor through llicit sexualityhe will have an unfaithful spouse through lying he will be slandered through malicious speech his friends will become enemies through injurious speech he will only undertand disagreeable speech through inconsiderate speech his words will not come to be believed through greed he will have great desires  through anger he will have great hate and through false views he will have great ignorance for ignorance is great in false views Such is the outflowing result But one would say a human existence even if it is short is the retṛibution of a good action How can one regard it as an outflowing result of murder We do not say that this existence is the result of murder we say rather that a murderer will have a short life by reason of the murder murder is the cause which rends a human existence short an existence otherwise caused by a good action By reason of the intense practice of killing external things plants the sun etcare of little vitality by reason of stealing they are crushed by rains of stones dust and acid by reason of illicit sexuality they are covered by dust or acid by reason of lying they are of bad odor by reason of malicious speech they are in a hole or on a hill by reason of injurious speech the land and the sun are impregnated with saltand are sterile and the plants are detestable and pernicious by reason of inconsiderate speech the seasons are reveṛsed by reason of greed fruits are small by reason of anger fruits are sour and by reason of false views ftnits are very few or are totally absent Such is the pre dominating result Existence in hell is a retributive resultwhereas shortness of life isan outflowing result of the killing According to others existence in hell comes from the preparatory action of killing the fact of having a short life comes from the action itself It is true that the Sūtra speaks of killing as the cause of existence in hell but itunderstands by killing not only killing but killing with all the actions thataccompany itWhat is called outflowing result does not here exist separately from the retributive result and the predominating result It is called outflowing by reason of the resemblance between the cause and its effect kksk Why is the result of the courses of action threefold One who commits murder causes the victim to suffer causes him to die and destroys his vigor Because one causes suffering there is a retributive result that is suffering in hell because one makes him die there is an outflowing result that is his life is short and because one destroys his vigor there is a predominating result that isexternal things are of little vigor The same for the other courses of action kksk The same for thethree results of the good coutses of action through having practiced cultivated and developed the renouncing of killing one is reborn among the gods if one is reborn down here in human condition one will have a long life Is this to say that wrong livelihood is separate from wrong speech and wrong action It does not exist separately Bodily and vocal actions whicharise from attachmentare wrong manner of livelihood itconstitutes a separate category because it is difficult to purify Bodily action and vocal action arising from hate and ignorance are respectively wrong actrion and wrong speech ttachment is by its naturea bandit one watches withdifficulty the mind of the actions which provokeattachment Consequently since the mananer of livelihood is as long as one lives difficult to purify the Blessed One with an end that one should apply himself to purifyiDg it made a separatecategory of wrong livelihood There is a stanza The layman purifies his views with difficulty for he is always in the prey of multiple views the monk purifies his manner of livelihood with difficulty for his subsistance depends on others If one says that it is solely action issued from attachment to the resources necessary for lifeno for this is incontradiction with the Sūtra If someone thinks that to dance to sing etcfor ones own pleasure is not a wrong manner of livelihoodbecause wrong manner of livelihood is only bodily and vocal actions inspired by attachment to the means of subsistancewe would answer In fact the Blessed One in the īūaskandhikā taught that looking at elephant fights etc isa wrong manner of livelihood Because this is to enjoy bad objects xkk We have seen that there are five results predominating results results of virile activity outflowing results retributive results and disconnection or liberation How many results are included in the different types of action Impure in the path of abandoning action embraces the five results The path of abandoning is so called because it has abandoning for its goal or because the defilements are abandoned due to it Action which forms part of the impure path of abandoning includes the five results retributive result an agreeable retribution which belongs to the same stage as the action  an outflowing result dharmas arisen from the absorption similar to theactionand lateṛ than it  a discoṇnective result thedharmas that this action gives rise to namely the path of deliverance  the coexisting dharmas the future dharmas of which this action causes one to obtain possession and the abandoning itself and  a predominating result all the conditioned dharmas with the exception of the action in question and with the exception of the dharmas already arisen Pure it includes four results The preceding ones with the exception of the retributive result The rest of pure action and neutral action three results The same two results are absent also in neutral action whether it is defiled nor not kkk What is the naturegood bad or neutralof the results of different actions The goodbad neutral dharmnas constitute four two and three results of good action Outflowing results discoṇnnective results virile activity and pre dominating results of good action are good dharmasRetributive results are neutral by nature Virile activity and predominating results of good action are bad dharmas Good bad neutral dharmas constitute respectively two three and four results of bad action The expressionanukraman signifies yathākraman Three resultsby ornitting retributive results and disconnective resultsare bad dharmas Four resultsby omitting disconnective resultsare neutral dharmas How is this namely of the universal defilements which one abandons through the Seeing of Sufferingand Arising and of the defilements of the rāga class etc which one abandons through the Seeing of Suffering The same dharmasgood bad nutral harmasmake up two three and three results of neutral action Three resultsby omitting retributive results and disconnective resultsare bad dharnas Three resultsthe same as aboveare neutral All the āharmas or some dharmas of all types that is past present and future cen constitute four of the results of past action One must exclude the disconnective result which is outside of time Some future dharmas constitute four results of median action Median action that is present action has four resultoby excluding disconnectionwhich are future dharmas There are two which are median dharmas Some presentdharmas are predominating results and virile activity of median action For action not yet arisen there are three results made up of future dharmas Future action does not have outflowing results Some dharmas of the same stage constitute four results whereas some dharmas of another stage constitute three or two results An action of a certain stage produces four resultsby exclding disconnectonwhich are dharmas of its own stage Some pure dharmas belong to a stage different from that of the the action which constitutes three results of this action virile activity predominating result and also outflowing tesult after the rule gīven in ii Some impure dharmas belong to a stage different from that of the action which constitutes virile activity and the predominatiṇg result of this action Some aikṣa harmas etc constitute

susceptible of being abandoned  constitute three results two results one result of action susceptible of being abandoned through Seeing the Truths Some bhāvanāheya dharmas are four results of this action excluding disconnection Some apraheya harmas are predominating results of this action The samedharmas constitute two four and three results of action susceptible of being abandoned through Meditation Darśanaheya dharmas are virile activity and predominating results of bhāvanāheya action Bhāvanāheya dharmas are four results of this action excluding disconection Apraheya dharmas are

Darśanaheyadharmas are predominating results of apruheyaaction action Some apraheyadharmas are four results of this action omitng the retrṛibutive result Such isin effectthe process of abbreviation kksk In the teaching of the doctrine of action the following question is again posed What is the meaning of these three actions Improper action is defiled action according to some irregular action also Some say that improper action is defiled action because this proceeds from a wrong judgment when a person walks stands still eats or dresses himself in a manner other than that which he should this actionwhich is undefiledneutralis improper for this person acts contrary to received usage this is either good action ot good and regular action Action which differs from proper action and improper action is neitherpropernorimproper action kkk Does one action project one birth or many births Do many actions project one birth or many births According to the system of the School One action projects one arising By arising anmam one should understand not merely birth  but an existence He who comes into an existence is said to be born This thesis is in contradiction with what the Sthavira Aniruddha says Through the retribution of this single alm  after baving been born up to seven times among the Thirtythree Gods I am finally born in the family of the rich ākyaṇs Aniruddha through this alm obtained a great prosperity he obtaineda memory of his past lives and he accomplished many new meritorious works By expressing himself as he did he intends to indicate his point of departure It is thus that a person who had acquired a sum of one thousand by means of a single penny could say It is through one penny that I have acquired this fortune One answers again By reason of his alm Aniruddha produced many streams of volition one result appeared to each volition for if this were the case the projection of existence would take place in parts But admitting that one existence is projected by a single action Many actions complete an existence The same way that a painter with one stroke delineates the outline of an image and then fills in this image so too even though their quality of being a human is the same certain humans have perfect organs major and minor members certain humans are beautiful through the excellence of their hue figure shape and power whereas in certain humans this or that is lacking It is not solely action which projects one existence all retributive dharmas namely sensation etc also project it However Neither the two absorptions of unconsciousness nor the prāptis project Even though they are retribution the two absorptions of un consciousness do not project an existence because they do not coexist with action The prāptis do not project an existence because they do not have the same result as does the action with which they coexist kk The Blessed One said that there are three āvaraṇas oṛ obstacles the obstacle of action  the obstacle of the defilements  and the obstacie of retribution What are the three obstacles dnantarya actions chronic defilements and bad realms of rebirth and Asajñisattvas and Kurus are the threefold obstacle The obstacdle which consists of action are the five mortal transgressions Defilement is of two types chronic and violent chronic defilemet is continual defilement and violent defilement is strong defilement Chronic defilement constitutes an obstacle as is the case for example among eunuchs Defilements which surge up from time to time even if their impulse is strong can be overcome but not continual defilement even though it is at rest The person inwhom this is found does not find the time to make an effort to overcome it From being small they become mediurm sized and from medium sized they become strong thus they form an obstacle The obstacle which consists of retribution is the three painful realms of rebirthexistence in hell animal existence and Preta existenceand one part of the good realms of rebirthhuman existence in Uttarakuru and heavenly existence amoṅg the Un conscious Ones What does obstacle mean That which causes an obstacle to the Way and to the roots of good preparatory to the Way wṣmagatas etc One should mention as actions forming obstacles other categories of actions besides mortal transgressions Actions which necessrily produce painful realms of rebirth etc which produce birth in eggs birth in sweat birth as a woman or an eighth birth form obstacles Only actions easily discernible by others and by the agent himselfand that from five points of vieware mentioned here from five points of view action which is mortal transgression is easy to discern Among the obstacles the gravest is the obstacle of defilement followed by the obstacle of action For these two obstacles rend one incapable of health not only in the present existence but also in the next existence According to the Vaibhāṣikas  the obstacle of defilement is the gravest because it produces the obstacle of action the obstacle of action is heavier than the obstacle of retribution because it produces this obstacle Or rather a person guilty of a mortal transgression is reborn after this life immediately in hell the gailty person is thus entara one without intermediate  thus the dharma the possession of which makes the guilty one an nantara is called ānantarya like one terms śrāmaṇya the dḍharma which makes someone a rāmaṇa Mortal transgressions exist in the three continents The inhabitants of Uttarakuru and living beings which are not humans are not capable of mortal transgressions And among humans only men and women can commit mortal trans gressions It is not admitted that eunuchs etc are capable of this traṇsgression because of the mediocrity of their kindness and respect For the same reasons that rend eunuchs etc incapable of indiscipline  and further because their parents having given to the eunuch only an incomplete body and having only a mediocre affection for their son are mediocre benefactors because on the other hand the eunuch does not experience a strong respect for his parents the destruction of which would render him guilty of a mortal transgression For the same reasons then Pretas and animals if they were to kill their parents are not guilty of mortal transgressions Nevertheless the Bhadaṇta said that animals in whom intelligence is lively for example the gāneya horse are capable of mortal transgressions For the same reasons a human born of demon parents does not commit a mortal transgression in killing them The other two obstacles exist in the five realms of rebirth Birth in Uttarakuru is an obstacle of retribution for humans birth among the Asajñisattvas is such for the gods kksṭ What are by their natures the different actions of mortal transgression Four are bodily action one is vocal action three are killing one is lying and oe is the preparation for murder for the Tathāgatas cannot be killed by the attack of another sksḥ We say that schism is lying and that this lying is the fourth mortal transgression If we make schism a mortal transgression this is because we give the name of schism to lying which is the cause of schism or rather the word schism should be explained s that which the divides Saṅgha In fact Schism is by its nature disharmony this is an undefiled neutral dharma disassociated from the mind  Schism that is disharmony is a saṇhskāra not associated with the mind  and is undefiledneutral As much as it is a person who divides the Saṅgha the schismatic is not in possession of the schism On the the contrary It is the Saṅgha which possesses the schismn It is that which is divided and not the schismatic which possesses the saskāra called division of the Saṅgha But what does the schismatic possess The transgression of schism is lying it belongs to the schismatic The schismatic possesses the transgression of schism which is This lyingarises at the same time as the schism itself it consists of vocal vjñapti and avijñapti Possessed of this lying The schismatic falls into Avīci for a katpa He falls into the great Avīci hell for an intermediary period Those guilty of other mortal trasgressions are not necessarily in Avīci Yet all mortal transgressions are retributed in the next existence what would happen if a person is guilty of many mortal transgressions Suffering growsby reason of supplementary transgression A person guilty of many moral transgressions possesses in Avīci a large body and very tender flesh by which he feels twofold threefold fourfold or fivefold and his torments are extrememly numerous and insupportable kkr Who is capable of dividing the Saṅgha A Bhikṣu who is an intellectual who is virtuous divides It is a Bhikṣa who divides not a layman not a nun etc This Bhikṣu should be an intellectual not a sensualist he should be viṛrtuous not immoral for the words of an immoral Bhikṣu lack authority kksk Where does schism take place Schism is impossible where the Master is to be found for the Tathāgata cannot be conquered and his word is full of authority Only fools and not ryans for ryans see the Dharma with direct insight According to another opinion the schismatic can no longer divide possessors of kṣāati kk What does the Saṅgha do that it is divided When it admits another Master or another Path it is divided Once it is divided how long does it remain divided A night of the same day When the Saṅgha is divided infallibly the Saṅgha will again be in concord at sunrise The schism that we have just described and which is a mortal transgression Is what we understand by breaking the WheeL The Wheel of the Law of the Blessed One is then broken because the progress of the Path is hindered As a consequence there is at the same time both bbreaking of the Wheel and a division of the Saṅgha Where is breaking of the Wheel produced In Jambudvīpa Not in the other continents where the Buddhas do not appear The Saṅgha susceptible of being divided counts at a minimum eight Bhikṣus the ninth monk necessatry is the schismatic ktḥ Another type of schism different from the breaking of the Wheel and which is not a mortal transgression results from a division in eccesiastical actions when in one parish  the monks divide themselves in order to perform ecclesiastical actions posadha etc Ritual schism in three continents Only there where the Religion exists This schism supposes eight Bhikṣus or more It is necessary to form two groups of four Bhikṣus but here there is not one schismatic who declares himself a Master kiik At six periods the schism of the breaking of Wheel cannot take place The breaking of the Wbeel is impossible at the beginning at the end befoe the abscess before a pair when the Sage is extinguished or when a parish has not been delimited At the beginning that is when a little time has passed since the setting into motion the Wheel of the Law and at the end that isat the period of the Parinirvāṇa of the Blessed One in these two periods the Saṅgha is penetrated by a single sentiment In the interval breaking is impossible before the appearance of an abscess as long as the abscess of precepts and the abscess of views does not appear in the dispensationIt is also impossible before the apparition of a pair Breaking is impossible when the Sage is extinguished for once the Master has entered into Parinirvāṇa a schismatic would have no opponent Finally when a parish has not been delimited for oe says that the Saṅgha is divided when there two parties in one parish All Buddhas do not have their Wheels broken as does ākyamuṇi this depends on their former actions kskk Why are the trensgressions enumerated above matricide etc mortal transgressions to the exclusion of other transgressions Because they destroy or hurt a field of benefaction or a field of qualities Matricide and patricide are mortal transgressions because they destroy a benefactor How does the murderer destroy them By killing themn The murder of an Arhat and the last two mortal transgressions are mortal transgressions because an Arhat the Saṅgha and the Buddha are fields of qualities Even if their gender changes there is morral transgression in killing him who was the mother and in killing her who was the father It is said in fact  Ca a petson be guilty of a mortal transgression killing a man who is not his father or who is not an Arhat Yes if he kills his mother whose gender has changed Can a person be guilty of a mortal transgression by killing a woman who is not his mother or who is not an Arhat Yes if he kills his father whose gender has changed When the embryo of a woman falls out and when another woman deposits it in her womb which of these two women is reputed to be the mother whose murder constitutes a mortal transgression The mother is the woman from whose blood one is born The second woman takes up the offices of a mother she is the one who gives the child liqguid to drink who nourishes it and who raises it kskok There is no mortal transgression if wanting to kill ones mother a person kills someone else there is no mortal transgression if wanting to killanother person a person kills his mother For example a man who kills his mother stretched out ona bed where hebelieves there isa man asleep and the child of the laundryman who kills his father wanting to kill a mosquito do not become guilty of mortal trans gressions If a man kills his mother and another person with the same stroke there are two avijñaptis an avijñapti of simple murder and an evijñapti of a mortal transgression but the vñapti is solely of the mortal trasgression by reason of the force of the mortal transgression Yet according to Ghoṣaka  there are two vijñaptis fot a viñap is made up of atoms The person who kills an Arhat without knowing him to be an Arhat thinking only to definitely kill such a person does not have any discrimination with respect to the person to be killed The person who kills his father when his father is an Arhat is guilty of only one mortal transgressionnamely thekilling of an Arhat for the father and the Arhat make up only a single person Objection Tell ikhaṇḍin that he has committed two mortal transgressions patricide and the murder of an Arhat Rudrāyaṇa means that his son commmitted a mortal transgression through two causes of mortal transgression or rather Rudṛāyaṇa said two mortal transgression in order to doubly condemn the conduct of his son Does the person who with a bad mind cause the blood of the Tathāgata to fiow necessarily commit a mortal transgression He comrmits a mortal transgression when he has the intention to kill No when he only had the intention of striking the Buddha Is a person guilty of a mortal transgression when he injures to death a person who becomes an Arhat after being injured No with regard to the person who became an Aṛrhatafter the blow In fact the preparation for murder had for its object a person who was not an Arhat kkṣk Can a person who made preparation for a mortal transgression obtain detachment and its result by arresting it Detachment and its results are impossible for one who has made preparation for a mortal transgression Because there is an absolute contradiction between the intention of a mortal transgression and the acquisition of detachment or a result A person who enters the Pathafter havingdone the preparation for anṇy other evil deed will not produce this deed by reason of the absoute contradiction between his new personality and the deed skksḥ What is the gravest of the mortal transgressions Lying with a view to schism is considered the gravest transgression A person who knowing what is Dharma and nonDharma lies with a view to dividing the Saṅgha and teaching falsely by this makes himself quilty of the gravest transgression among all misdeeds In fact he wounds the Dharma body of the Tathāgatas he creates an obstacle to temporal wellbeing and to the deliverance of creatures As long as concotd is not established in the Saṅgha there is hindrance to entry into the Path  to the acquisition of ṛesults to the acquistion of detachment and to the destruction of the defilements all actions relative to dhyāna study and reflection are also arested the worlds of gods Nāgas and humans are troubled and saddened they are not masters of themselves and misguided This is why the retribution for this crime lasts a cosmic age and takes place in Avīci Among the other mortal transgressions the fifth the third and the first are in descending order the heaviest Patricide is the lightest Objection The Blessed One said that mental daṇḍa is the most culpable of the threedaṇdḍus he saidalso that false view is the gravest among all the transgressions Oṇe must understand that among the mortal traṇsgressions schism is the gravest transgression that mental deṇḍa is the gravest among the three actions and that false view is the gravest among the bad views Or rather schism is the gravest transgression if one considers the extent of its retribution vanodaṇḍa if one considers the number of persons destroyed by it and false view if one considers the roots of good which false view alone cuts off Among the good worldly dharmmas a volition for Bhavāgra bears the greatest result This action is the most fruitious of good worldly actions for its retribution is a perfect tranquility for twentyfour thousand cosmic periods TThis is anderstood from the point of view of its retributive results From the point of view of its disconnective result the most fruitious action is volition associated with Vajropamasamādhi  for this volition has for its tesult the cutting off of all the bonds This is why the Kārikā says Among the good worldly dhar ksksk Is itonly througha mortal transgression thata person is necessarily rṛeborn in hell Others add but not immediately s  To defile ones mother to defile an Arhantī to kill a predestined Bodhisattva to kill a Saikṣa and to steal the goods of the Saṅgha are transgressions similar to mortal trans gressions the fifth is the destruction of a Stūpa These five transgressions in this order are similar to mortal transgressions to defile ones mother to defilean Aṛhantī  to killa predestined Bodhisattva  to kill a Saint who is not an Arhat  to rob the Saṅgha of its means of substance  and to destroy a Stūpa kik Other actions embracing retribution are impeded in three cir Zcumstanhces He absolutely impedes actions by the acquisition of Kṣānti the quality of Anāgāāmin and the quality of Arhat When upon leaving the stage of mrdhānas he obtains the stage called patience  the actions which should be retributed in painful reelms of rebirth being impeded remain below because he passes beyond the state of retribution of these actions In the same way the creditors of the man who is about to emigrate from his country rise up When he obtains the quality of Anāgāmin  the actions which should be retributed in Kāmadhātu being impeded remain belowwith the exception of those which should be retributed in the present existence The same for the actions which should be retributed in Rūpadhātu and rūpyadhātu when he obtains the quality of Arhat kk We have seen that the killing of a Bodhisattva is a quasimortal trasgression Since when is one a Bodhisattva From what momenton does one receive the name of Bodhisattva When he begins to cultivate actions which produce the marks  Starting from the moment when he begins to cultivate actions which have for their retribution the thirtytwo marks he is predestined From this moment onward he always Has good realns of rebirth he is born into noble families he possesses all the organs  he is a male he remembers his past lives and he does not desist One says that he is srgati  because his rebirth realms are excellent for he is born among gods and humans He is born in the wealthy families of Kṣatriyas Brāhmaṇas and Grhapatis not in humble familes He is always male never female and even more so never non sexual In ali of his existences he remembers his past births in fact with an end to being useful to all cteatures he is not cast down by all sorts of sufferings or by any outrages He is called the slave not purchased by the worldindeed the Bodhisattva ktksk He cultivates actions which have the marks for their retribution In Jambudvīpa being a male in the presence of the Buddhas thinking of the Buddhas having their origin in reflection in the course of one hundred supplementary cosmic ages The Bodhisattva cultivates actions which ripen in the marks solely in Jambudvīpa not elsewhere for the inhabitants of Jambudvīpa are of lively intelligence he is a male and not a female for he has already gone beyond the state of female and he is only in the presence of Masters for his volition has the Buddhas for its object These actions have their origin in reflection not in hearing or in the absorptions The Bodhisattva accomplishes these actions in the course of one hundred supplementary cosmic ages and not during a longer time Nevertheless the Blessed ākyamuni through the purification of his energy leaped over nine of these cosmic ages and caried out the actions ripening in marks in the coutse of ninetynine cosmic ages so that in this wayone hundred werecompleted This is why speaking to Aśibandhaka he said Oh village chief remembering ninetyone cosmic ages from now I do not see any family that has been impoverished or inconvenienced by the giving of cooked foods The Blessed One expressed himself in this way because his natural memory bore on this number of cosmic periods Former masters say It is when he finished the first cosmic age that the Bodhisattva abandoned the four defects and obtained the two qualities Of the marks Each arises from one hundred merits What is the measure of each of these one hundred merits According to some it is equal to the merit which has for its result the pleasure of allbeings with the exception of the Bodhisattva close to Bodhithat is to say accomplishing actions which ripen in marks According to others it is equal to the collective action of all beings which through its predominating result  produces the creation of the world According to others only the Buddhas know the measure of this ṛnerit k How many Buddhas did the Blessed One venerate when he was a Bodhisattva In the course of the first asamkhyeya kalpa he venerated seventy five thousaṇd Buddhas seventysix thousand in the course of the second and seventyseven thousand in the course of the third In the period of the perfect and complete Buddha Ratnaśikhin he completed the first asekhyeya kalpa in the period of the Blessed Dīpakara he completed the second and in the period of the Tathāgatha Vipaśyin he completed the third kikk Of all the Buddhas that he venerated The first was ākyarnuṇi It was an ancient ākyamuni  a peṛfect Buddha under whom the Blessed One the then Bodhisattvaformulated for the first time the vow of Bodhi by saying Mey I too become a Buddha in all ways similar to yon This ākyamuni as ours appeared during a bad age of the world also his Law lasted only one thousand yeats kkk How did the Bodhisattva complete each Pāramitā  When he gave everything to everyone even to his eyes and the marrow of his bones out of compassion without desiring any happiness for himself he completed the virtue of Giving When even though he was not detached he was not at all irritated when his limbs were brokenhe then completed the virtues of Morality and Patience The Blessed One when he was a Bodhisattva saw the Tathāgata Puṣya who had become incandescent in the interior of a cave in a mountain He praised him for seven days and seven nights standing rṛepeating the stanzaNeither in heaven nor on earth nor in this world or in the abode of Vaiśravaṇa nor in the palace of the Marus nor in other celestial abodes nor in any of the ten directions would one find Oh Chief of Men an ascetic who is your equal even if one were to traverse if one wished the entire world with all of its people with its mountains and with its forests Then according to this School he was found to have fulfilled the virture of Energy and nine cosmic ages were passed over At the moment of Vajropamasamādhi immediately before Bodhi he accomplished the virtues of dhyāna and prajñā The Pāramitās receive the name of pāramitā because they have arived at the other shore of the other shore of the totality of the perfectons proper to each of them ksksk The Sūtra teaches that there are three items of meritorious work  which cosist of Giving Morality and Meditation How are Giving Moralityand Meditation items of meritorious work Three are merit action occasions of the exercise of action as in the case of deeds These threeGiving Morality and Meditationeach according to its nature are merit action or occasion of exercise either in combination or in isolation the same way that the deeds are either at one and the same time actions and deeds or only deeds To consider first the item of meritorious work which consists of Givingone mustdistinguish bodily and vocalaction which is an item of meritorious work on three grounds merit because its retribution is agreeable action because it is action by nature and an occasion for the exercise or an object of the volition of giving which provokes it  the volition of giving which is merit and action  and the dharmas which accompany bodily and vocal action and which ae solely merit The item of meritorious wotk which consists of Morality is exclusively bodily and vocal action it is necessarily merit action and occasion of execise of actior For the iterm of meritorious work which consists of Meditation let us consider the Meditation of Compassion  this mediation is merit it is also an occasion for the exercise of a meritorious action namely that of a volition associated with compassion  the volition in question is merit and action the other dharmas concomittant to this Meditation are solely merit According to another opinion puṇyaukriyā is to speak precisely good volition GivingMorality andMeditation are its vasx an occasion for the exercise of this volition xṅ What is Giving dāna Without doubt dāna in general is what is given  but here Giving is what gives But one gives through fear or with the hope of reciprocity or through attachment etc now this does not refer to this type of giving Consequently in order to specify the author says Giving is what gives Through the desire to render homage or service What is it that gives It is bodily and vocal action and that which produces this actio this collection and this action give As the stanza saysWhen a person with a goodmind gives what belongs to him then one says that the good skandhas give It has for its results great joys The puṇyakriyāvastu which consists of Giving has great joys as its result The suffix aya which we translate which consists of should be understood as having as its nature the same way that one says a house made of grass  or a vase made of leaves Giving is beneficial to oneself to others to both or neither A gift made to a Caitya is not useful to another but it is useful to him who gives when he is an ryan not detached from desire or a Prthagjana detached or not detached This gift is only useful to another The gift thata nondetached ryan makes to another to a detached or nondetached Pṛthagjana is useful both to himself and to another The gift that a detached ryan makes to a Caityawith the exception of the case when this gift willripen in the present existence is not useful either to himself or to another This gift has for its effect only the expression of homage and recognition kkrk We have said ina general manner that giving produces great joys Giving is excellent by the excellence of the giver of the object given and of the field The giver is excellent through his faith etc The giver is excellentwhen he isendowed with faith with morality with learning with generosity with wisdon with few desires etc When the giver is excellent the gift is excellent when the gift is excellent its result is excellent He gives with respect etc Such a giver gives with respect by his hand at the right timne without doing evil to anyone  to ones master or to other benefactors Example the Jtakas of the bear of the antelope etc A field is excellent through its qualities The BlessedOe said A retribution one hundred thousand times greater than a gift made to a person who upholds the necessities and so on kks Among all the giftsThe best is the gift from a delivered person to a delivered person The Blessed One said that a gift given by a detached person to aother detached person is the best of material gifts Or rather the gift that a Bodhisattva gives for the welfare of all beings this gift although given by a nondetached person to other nondetached persons is the best gift kikk With the exception of the gift from the Bodhisattva Or the eighth The eighth among the eight gifts that the Blessed One taught What are the eight gifts An āsadya gift  a gift through fear  a gift made because he gave to me  a gift made because he gives to me  a gift made because my fathers and my grandfathers gave ceti dāṇam compare Jāpaka  vol iv   a gift made in order to adorn ones mind  in order to fillthe mind  in order to equip it with a view to yoga and in order to acquire the supreme goal What is an āsadya gift Some ancient masters explDain this as an immediate gift to those who are near who approach one A gift through fear is a gift that a person makes who sees that the object is going to perish Better it should be given he thinks kkk The Sūtra says An incalculable retribution proceeds from a gift made to a srotaāpannaphalaprats pannaka an even more incalculable retribution proceeds from a gift made to a ṛrotaāpannaBut there are also five persons who even though Prthagjanas confer an incalculable retribution on the offering that is made to them Even though they are not ryams offerings made to ones father and mother to a sick person to a preacher to the Bodhisattva in his last birth are without measure These offerings are without measure from the point of view of their retribution kksk In order to appreciate the lightness and the gravity of actions one should in short take into consideration six causes Accordingly as these causesconsecutive field adhisṭhāṇa preparation volition or intentionare small or large action also is small or large Consecutive after having done the action that is consequential action the person to whom one does good or evil bodily or vocal action with a view to the preceding Volition that through which the deed is achieved to project the thought I shall do this or that to them then I shall do this or thatt It happens that an action can be grave only by reason of its consecutive action for example when this confers on the retribution the character of necessity It happens that an action can be grave by reason that if the field is the same a certain adhiṣṭhāna rendets an action grave while another adhiṣṭhāna makes it light for example tokill ones father and mother is a grave action but to steal from ones father and mother to lie to them etc is not grave by comparison One can explein in this same way the gravity resulting from the preparation etc What are the characteristics and conditions of accumulated action Action is termed accumulated by reason of its intentional character by its completion by the absence of regret and opposition by its accompaniments and by its retribution By reason of its intentional characterAction done voluntarily or intentionally is accumulated action action done involuntarily or unconsciously and action not done in haste even if it is voluntary is action that is done By reason of itscompletion Some go to painful realms of rebirth thtrough misdeeds some by two some by three  some through one deed through two through threethrough ten Since it s a rule that a person goes to a painful realm of rebirth through a certain quantity of actions if this measure is not completed the action is done but not accumulated but when this measure is completed it is accumulated By reason of theabsence of regretand opposition When remorse is absentor when oppositionconfession etcis absent action is then termed accumulated By reason of itsaccompaniments When an action isbadand has a bad escort it is By reason of its retributin Action is accamulated which necessarily gives forth retribution Action which does not present these characteristiss is done but is not accumulated kkk We have seen that a gift made to a Caitya by a person not detached from desireis a gift of benefit for him who made it But no one emjoys the thing given how can this gift be meritoriaṇs The merits of the gift are of two types merit produced by abandoning that is the merit which results from the sole fact of abandoning  merit produced by its enjoyment the merit which results in joy in the object given by the person who receives The merit of a gift to a Caitya is merit produced by abandoning How can the gift produce merit when no one receives it We would answer this objection by asking why would the gift produce merit whensomeone receives iand why itwould not produce merit when no one receives it If the satisfaction of a person who receives is a condition for merit you then deny that the Immeasurable Mediations and the Meditation of Right View are meritorious The gift to a Caitya thus produces merit Even though no one receives it as is the case with compassion etc In the case of the Meditation on Compassion no one receives n one is satisfied and yet merit arises for the compassionate person through the very force of his thoughts of compassionIn the same way even though the Excellent Being has passed away a gift to a Caitya made with devotion to him is meritorious by reason of the thought of the believer himself Should we conclude then that material offerings and worship are superfluous No for the devotion which produces these actions very much outweighs the devotion of a person who worships and who gives in mind only When a person who has the intention of killing his enemy contintes his bodily and vocal actions on the dead body of his enemy which this intention provokes thinkingThis is my enemy that is to say he thinks This enemy is not yet dead he obtains dermerit very much greater than he would have through merely the intention in the same way even though the Master has passed away the person who does actions of giving and worship inspired through devotion obtains a much greater merit than he would have only through devotion kskk If a seed given to a good field bears an agreeable result should we think that it bears a disagreeable result if given to a bad field Even seeded into a bad field the gift bears agreeable results for there is never opposition between the result and the seedi From the seed of the vine there arises solely the sweet fruit of the vine from the seed of the vmba there arises only the sour fruit of the vwba even seeded into a bad field the seed bears the result which is appropriate to itIn the same way this seed which is the gift of a person who has the intention of being useful to another even if placed into a bad field can only produce an agreeable result Bat through the evil of the field the result will be small or almost nil We have explained meritorious work which consists of Giving together with its related questions kkk We must now explain meritorious work which consists of the Precepts Immorality is bad rpa Morality is the renouncing of immorality Bad rūpa is calledimmorality The renouncing of immorality which is morality is f two types This renouncing is also vijñapti and aviñaptiHe who has undertaken to observe the rules and who then violates them commits immorality The morality that we have just described in short is Pure when it is endowed with the four qualities Morality endowed with the four qualities is pure itis impurein the contrary case Not troubled by immorality by the causes of im morality it takes as its support the opposite of immorality and Not troubled by immorality we have described not troubled by the causes of immorality that isby the eśar and upaklefas it takes as itssupport the opposites ofimmorality becausejt relies oa the four smrṛtyupasthānas  and it relies on peace not on rebirth in celestial realms because it is directed to Nirvāṇa According to another opinion five causes make morality pure the purity of thedeed itself   the purity of their attendants   the absence of disturbance from the vurus   its supervision through mindfulness  ad  its application to Nirvāṇa According to another opinion morality is of four types the morality of fear which one observes from the fear of the loss of the resouEces necessary to life from fear of a bad reputation froṃ fear of chastisement from fear of bad realms of rebirth  mercenaty morality which one observes from attachment to agreeable realms of existence to pleasures to honots  a morality suitable to the parts of Bodhi which persons who possess Right View possess with a view to their deliverance and  pure morality which being free from stains is free from vices We have explained morality kkk Good absoption or good in absorption is bhāvanā meditation soaking in or impregnation What do we understand by samāhita absorbed That which is absorption by its nature and that which coexists with what is absorption by nature Why does good absorption receive the name of bhāvanā Good absorption impregnates the mind to an extreme degree because it grasps the qualities of this good in the same way as sesame seeds are impregnated by fliowers in their grasping the odor of these flowers kkk We have said that the result of giving consists of joys What result does one obtain from the precepts and from meditation Essentially the precepts have heaven for their result meditation has disconnection for its reṣult Giving also has heaven for its result but the precepts are the principle normative cause of it Disconnection or Nirvāṇa has meditation for its cause which in the path of abandoning immediately produces disconnection from the defilements but the precepts contribute to it since stilling and insight presuppose the precepts kīfik The Sūtra says that four persons produce Brahmin merit brāhmapnṇya What is this merit According to the Vaibhāṣikas  this is the merit which has been defined above in order that we might know th measure of theaction which has the marks of theBodhisattva for its result The ancient masters said Four possess Brahmin merit because they are happy in the heavens for a kalpa The merit of sucha measure thatone is happy inheaven for a apa is the Brahmin merit for the lifespan of theBrahmapurohitas is a alpa And in another Canon one reads He engenders Brahmin merit he is happy in the heavens for a alpa kkrḥ We have studied material giving The gift of the Dharmas is the correct teaching not defiled of the Sūtras etc The gift of the Dharma is to teach correctly and with a mind not defiled the ūtra and the other parts of Scripture Consequently those who teach the Dharma either falsely or with a defiled mind through a desire or gain for respectand for reputation destroy the great merit which would otherwise fall to them cṅtk We have explained the three types of good according to the distinction of the three items of meritorious work Furthermore Good is threefold merit Nirvāṇa and penetratiorn Good merit or good favorable to merit is the good which leads to an agreeable retribution The good which is deliverance is the good which when it arises becomes a dharma of Parinirvāṇa It is recognized that whoever understanding the sermons concerning the defects of Sasāra the nonself and the qunalities of Nirvāṇa has his hairs stand on end and who pours forth tears possesses the mokṣgabhāgīya rtoot of good in this same way one knows that there was a seed in the khalabila when in the rain one sees a plant put forth shoots The good of penetration is fourfold urmagatas etc it will be explained later kkṣke What is the nature of what is popularly caled writng carving  eloquence poetry  and calculation An industrious action of the body of the voice or of the mind with that which gives rise to it are such things as writing caving eloquence poetry and calculation Iṇḍustrious that is due to a certain technique Threefold action is bodily vocal and mental action Writing and carving are bodily actions industrious together with what gives rise to this action namely the collection of the mind and its mental states Eloquence and poetry are vocal actios Consequently writing carving eloquence and poetry are by their nature the five sanṇdbas Calculation is mental action this refers to the mental eṇumera tionof the dharmas Defiled dharmas are sāvadya nivrta and hṇa Some synonyms of defiled are tvadya associated with vadya ot bad nvrta that is covered by the defilements and the defilements themselves are covered by other defilements ha or ignoble because they are low or abandoned by the ryans Good and pure dharmas are praṇīta Praṇīta excellent s a synonym for śubha that s kuśala goodand of amala immaculate oOr anāsrava Good conditioned dharmas are sevya Sevya to be cultivated is synonymous with good and con ditioned It then follows that other dharmas some unconditioned others conditioned but defiled or nondefiledneutral are not to be cultivated now it is with a view to a result that one cultivates Deliverance is the highest These is nothing which outweighs Nirvāṇa Nirvāṇa being eternal and good outweighs all Oṃ Homage to the Buddha Oṃ Homage to the Buddha Desiring to compose a treatise with the intention of making known the greatness of his master the author undertakes to render him homage and to first present his qualities He has destroyed all blindness that is to say by him or through him blindness with respect to all things is destroyed He has destroyed all blindness that is to say by him or through him blindness with respect to all things is destroyed Blindness is ignorance for ignorance hinders the seeing of things as they truly are But they do not know the qualities proper to the Buddha objects very distant in space or time nor the infinite complex of things therefore they have not destroyed blindness in an absolute manner for the ignorance freed from the defilements is

disjunction Conscious disjunction visamyoga iid from the impure dharmas is pratisaṅkhyānirodha ii or Nirvana Conscious disjunction visamyoga iid from the impure dharmas is pratisaṅkhyānirodha ii or Nirvana Pratisaṅkhyāna or pratisaṅkhyā signifies a certain pure prajñā the comprehension of the Truths The extinction of which one takes possession by this prajñā is called pratisaṅkhyānirodha we   P

occurs separately The objects of disjunction are as numerous as the objects of junction If it were otherwise if pratisaṅkhyānirodha were single then a person who has experienced the extinction of the defilement which is abandoned by seeing the Truth of Suffering would have obtained at the same time the extinction of the defilements which are abandoned by the Seeing of the other Truths and by Meditation If it were otherwise if pratisaṅkhyānirodha were single then a person who has experienced the extinction of the defilement which is abandoned by seeing the Truth of Suffering would have obtained at the same time the extinction of the defilements which are abandoned by the Seeing of the other Truths and by Meditation It would be useless for him to cultivate the part of the Path which

called apratisaṅkhyānirodha is called apratisaṅkhyānirodha Apratisaṅkhyānirodha is an extinction which is different from disjunction Apratisaṅkhyānirodha is an extinction which is different from disjunction it consists of the absolute hindering of the arising of future dharmas It is so called because it is obtained not by the comprehension of the Truths it consists of the absolute hindering

combination There is no dharma which is engendered by a single cause Even though the expression samskrta signifies that which has been created    it also applies to future dharmas and to present

compose a treatise with the intention of making known the greatness of his master the author undertakes to render him homage and to first present his qualities He refers to the Buddha the Blessed One He has destroyed all blindness that is to say by him or through him blindness with respect to all things is destroyed Blindness is ignorance for ignorance hinders the seeing of things as they truly are By this the Buddha the Blessed One is sufficiently designated for he alone through the possession of the antidote to ignorance  has definitely destroyed all ignorance with respect to all knowable things so that it cannot rearise But the Pratyekabuddhas and the rāvakas have also destroyed all blindness for they are freed from all ignorance defiled by the defilements But they do not know the qualities proper to the Buddha  objects very distant in space or time  nor the infinite complex Having thus praised the Blessed One from the point of view of qualities useful to himself the author praises him from the point of view of qualities useful to others He has drawnout the world from the mire of transmigration Transmigration is a mire because the world is bound up in it and because it is difficult to traverse The Blessed One having pity on the world which finds itself drowned without recourse in this mire has pulled it out as much as possible by extending to each one the hands of the teaching of the Good Law I render homage by prostrating myself even to my head to this teacher of truth By thus qualifying the Blessed One the author indicates the manner in which the Blessed Oxe is useful to others It is by the true teaching that the Blessed One the teacher has pulled the world our of the mire of transmigration not by his supernatura powers nor by the granting of favors After having rendered homage to this teacher of truth what will the author do Which treatise The Abhidharmakośa What is Abhidharma Prajñā which wili be defined below is the discernment of the dharmas Pure prajñā is undefiled prajñā it is thus a factor in Abhidharma in the absolute sense of the word sḥk Why is the present work called the Abhidharmakośa The present work is called the Abhidharmakośa because the Abhidharma enters into it through its meaning or because the Abhidharma constitutes its foundation The Treatise that bears the name of Abhidharma enters by its meaning into this work which is thus the Abhidharmakośa the sheath of the Abhidharma Or rather as the Abhidharma is the point of support of this work one can say that this work is drawn from out of the Abhidharma as from a sheath it is thus called the Abhi dharmakośa the work which has the Abhidharma for a sheath So it is with a view to this discernment that the Abhidharma has been they say spoken Apart from the discernment of dharmas there does not exist any means for the extinguishing of the defilements  and these are the defilements which cause the world to wander in the great ocean of transmigration This is why say the Vaibhāṣikas with a view to the discernment of the dharmas the master the Buddha the Blessed One spoke the Abhidharma For without the teaching of the Abhidharma a disciple would be incapable of discerning the dharmas And in the same way that the Sthavira Dharmatrāta made a collection of the Udāṇas scattered throughout the Scripturesthe Udānavargain this same way the ryan Kat yāyāniputra and the other Saints established the bhidharma What are the dharmas of which the Abhidharma teaches the discerning Conditioned dharmas with the exception of the Path are impure With the exception of the Path all conditioned dharmas are defiled Why is this What are the pure dharmas The undefited truth of the Path and the three uncondi tioned things are pure What are the three unconditioned things Space and the two types of extinctions The three unconditioned things and the truth of the Path are pure dharmas because the defilements do not adhere to them Space is that which does not hinder Space has for its nature not hindering matter which in fact takes place freely in space and also of not being hindered by matter for space is not displaced by matter Pratisakhyānirodha is disjunction disjunction from the impure dharmas īs pratisaṃkhyānirodha  The extinction of which one takes possession by this prajñā is called pratsakhyānirodha we could say pratisaṃkhya nirodha the extinction obtained through pratisaṃhkhyā but the middle word is elided as in the expression x cat and ot cart hitched to oxen ratha Why is this The objects of disjunction are as numerous as the objects of jvnction If it were otherwise if pratitakhyānirodha were single then a person who has experienced the extinction of the defilement which is abandoned by seeing the Truth of Suffering would have obtained at the same time the extinction of the defilements which are abandoned by the Seeing of the other Truths and by Meditation It would be useless for him to cultivate the part of the Path which is opposed to these defilements This means that extinction does not have a cause corresponding to its effect  and that it is not a cause corresponding to its effect A different type of extinction whichī consists of the absolute hindering of arising is called epratisankhyānirodha Apratisaṃkhyānirodha is an extinction which is different from disjuṇction it consists of the absolute hindering of the arising of future dharmas It follows that the five sense consciousness the visual consciousness etc which have had for their object other visible matter sounds odors tastes and tangibles caanot arise for the sense consciousnesses are not capable of grasping their object when the object is past There is thus an absolute hindering of the arising of the said consciousnesses by reason of the insafficiency of the cause of arising Here we have a fourfold alterṇative  solely pratisahkhyānirodha of the impure dharmas past present and destined to arise  solely apratisakhyānirodha of pute conditioned dharmas not destined to arise  pratisañkhyānirodha and apratisaṃkhyānirodha of impure dharmas not destined to arise and  neither pratisaṃkhyānirodha nor apratisakhyanirodha of pure dharmas past present or destined to arise We have said that the impure dharmas are the conditioned dharmas mirus the Path What are the conditioned dharmas Conditioned things are the fivefold skandhas matter etc These are the aggregate of matter the aggregate of the sensations the aggregate of ideas the aggregate of mental formations and the aggregate of consciousness Saṃbrṛta conditioned is explained etymologically as that which has been created by causes in union and combination There is ṅo dharma which is engendered by a single cause Conditioned things are the paths they are the founda tions of discourse they are possessed of leaving they are possessed of causes Conditioned things are pathsthat is to say the time periods the past present and futurebecause they have for their nature heving gone of going of shall be going Or rather conditioned things are called paths because they are devouted by impermanence Discourse  means words o speech  discourse has names or words for its foundation Niḥsāra signifies leaving which is the Nirvāṇa of all conditioned things As one should depart from conditioned things one qualifies them as endowed with leaving Conditioned things are dependent on causes they are thus qualified as savasuka that is having causes The Vaibhāsikas believe that in the expression savastuha vastu signifies cause When they are impure they are upādānaskandhas The upādānaskandhas are so called because they proceed from the defilements as one says grass fire or straw fire or rather because they are governed by the defilements as one says the kings man or rather because they give rise to the defilements as one says flowerbearing tree or frnitbearing tree The defilements are of battle because they injure oneself and others Impure conditioned things are qualified of battle in a relationship with battle because the defilements of battle adhere to them equally as we have seen they are qualified as impure possessing impuritybecause the defilements adhere to them They are also suffering arising the world the locus of false opinions existence Suffering because they are odious to the Saints Arising because suffering arises from them World because they are in the process of decomposition Rūpa or matter is the five sense organs five objects and avijñapti The five organs are the organs of sight hearing smell taste and touch The five objects of the five organs are visible matter sounds odors tastes aṅd tangibles And avñapti  such is rūpaskandha ks We have enumerated five things visible matter sound etc The points of support of the consciousnesses of these things namely the subtle material clements ae the five ogans the organ of sight etc The five which are the point of support of the consciousnesses of visible matter sounds odor taste and tangibles and which consist of the suprasensible subtle mmaterial elements are in this order the ogans of sight hearing smell taste and touch The Blessed One said in fact The eye Oh Bhikṣus an internal āyatana a subtle matter derived from the primary elements Or rather the points of support of the visual consciousness or eye consciouspess etc What is the organ of sight It is the subtle matter which is the support of the coṇsciousness of sight kṭck Let us now examine the five objects beginning with visible matter rūpāyatana Visible matter is twofold Visible matter is color and shape Color is fourfold blue red yellow white other colors proceed from out of these four colors Shape is eightfold O twentyfold Some make a color of the firmament  this would give us the number twentyone Even signifies of even shape uneven is the opposite mist is the vapor which rises from the ground and from water hot light is the light of the sun light is the light of the moon the stars fire grasses and gems shadearisen from an obstacle to lightis where formns still rernain visible darkness is the opposite blue red yellow white shade hot light light darkness There can be shapes without there being color that part of the long of the short etc which constitutes bodily action There can be color and shape at oe and the same time all the other categories of visible matter Some other Masters maintain that only hot light and light are exclusively color for blue red etc present themselves to the sight under the aspect of long short etc Sound is eightfold It is fourfold having for its cause present primary elements forming part of the organs having for its cause other primary elements  belonging to liv ing beings and not belonging to living beings First categoy sound caused by the hand or by the voice sound of the wind of the trees of water According to other masters one sound can belong to the first two categories at one and the same time for example a sound produced by the coming together of a hand and a drurm But the School does not admit that one atom has for its cause only two tetrades of the primary elements thus one cannot admit that one atom is produced by the four primary elements of a hand and the four primary elements of a drum Taste is of six types Sweet sour salty pungent bitter and astringent Odor is fourfold But according to the Prakaraṇa  odot is threefold The tangible is of eleven types Eleven things are tangible things the four primary elements softness hardness weight lightness cold hunger and thirst Softness is smoothness hardness is roughness weight is that by which bodies are susceptible of being weighed  lightness is the opposite cold is what produces a desire for heat hunger is what produces a desire for food thirst is what produces a desire for drinking the cause is designated by the name of the effect In the same way that it is said The appearance of the Buddha is happiness the teaching of the religion is happiness happiness the harmoṇy of the commnunity happiness the austerities of monks who are in agreement Both huṇger and thirst are lacking in Rūpadhātu but the other tangibles are found there It is true that bothersome cold is lacking in Rūpadhātu but beneficent or pleasing cold is found there when such a distinction is lacking for example when one sees the multiple colors and shapes that an army or a pile of jewels present at a distance and bunched together The same remark is applicable to the auditory consciousness the olfactory consciousnesses etc But one touch consciousness arises from only five things at most namely the four primary elements and one another of the other tangibles soft hard etc But according to another opinion one touch consciousness can arise from eleven tangibles at one and the same time When the organs of touch and of taste attain their object at the same time  which consciousness is the first to arise ksṣk We have explained the objects of the five organs of sense consciousness and how these objects are preceived One whose mind is distracted is one who has a mind different from the mind that provoked the zvñaptifor example a bad mind i when the avijñapti has been provoked by a good mind One without mind is one who has entered into one of the absorptions of nonconsciousness called asarjñisamāpati  Pure or impure means good or bad In dependence on the primary elements this in order to distinguish the gvijñapt seties from the prāpti series This is called the avijñapti in order to indicate the reason for the name avjñapti This serial continuity while being by its nature matter and actionlike vjñapti bodily and vocal actionnevertheless does nothing by way of informing another as vjñapti does Is called in order to show that the author here expresses the opinion of the Vaibhāṣikas and not his own In short avjñapti is a rūpa good or bad arisen from vijñapti o from absorption ksik because they ae the point of support for allderived matter Or it is because they assemble on a large scale in the mass of the earth the water the fire and the wind where their modes of activity are manifested together What activity establishes the existence of these dhātusr and what is their nature They are proven to exist by the actions of support etc i They are solidity humidity heat and motion As for their natures the earth element is solidity the water element is humidity the fire element is heat and the wind element is motion Motion is what causes the series of states which constitutes a thing to reproduce itself in different places in the same way that one speaks of the motion of a flame The Prakaraṇa and the Sūra say What is the wind element What is the difference between the earth element and earth etc In common usage what is designated by the word earth is color and shape That is when one sees earth one sees its color and its shape As is the case for the earth The same for water and fire Wind is either the wind element But the wind element is simply called wind in the world What is called wind in the world is also the wind element in fact one speaks of black wind or circular wind Why do all these dharmas from visibles to avijñapti teceive the name pa The Blessed One said By what it is broken It is broken by contact with the haṇd By deteriorating by being transformed According to other mmastets the quality that makes physical matter rpa namely rūpaṇa is not cutting off deterioration but rather impenetrability impact or resistance the obstacle that a rūpa opposes toits place being occupied by another rpa If this is so the rāpa that constitutes an atom a moṇad will not be rūpa for a monad not susceptible to deterioration or resistance is free from rāpaṇa Avijñapti is not rūpa for it is devoid of resistance For avijñapii is not subject to modifications further in order that the comparison be exact the gvjñapi should perish when the vijñapti perishes as is the case for the shadow and the tree This response is not valid Avijñapri exists dependent upon the primary elements as a shadow exists dependent on a tree as the brilliance of a jewel exists dependent upon the jewel The visual consciousness is not dependent upon an organ which is solely the cause of its arising That the shadow or the brilliance of a jewel exists dependent upon the tree or on the jewel is a hypothesis that does not conform to the principles of the Vaibhāṣikas The Vaibhāṣikas hold that each one of the atoms of color which constitute shade and brilliance exists dependent upon a tetrad of primary elements The shadow is dependent upon the tree since the shadow is dependent on the primary elements which are proper to it and these are dependent upon the treethe comparison to the shadow and avḍñapti is inadmissible Thus from the fact that avjñapti is called rūpa because its point of support is rpa one cannot conclude that visual consciousness should be called rāpa sicsk The organs and objects which have been defined as rāpaskandha These same ogans and objects are regarded as ten āyataas te dhātus kāyādhatu spraṣṭavyadhātu kṣk We have explained rpaskandha and how it is distributed into āyataṇas aṅd dhātus We must now explain the skandhas l Sensation is painful impression etc Vedanāskandha is the threefold mode of feeling or experiencing sensation which is painful pleasant neitherpainfulnorpleasant One should distinguish six classes of sensations those which arise from the contact of the five material organs the organ of sight etc with their object and those which arise from contact with the mental organ Ideas consist of the grasping of characteristics The grasping of the dīverse naturesperceiving that this is blue yellow long short male femnale friend enemy agreeable disagree able etcis sajñāskandha One can distinguish six types of sarṅjña accoding to organ as for sensation Sakāraskandha are the saskāras different from the other four skandhas It is true that the Blessed One said in a Sūtra The savṇhskā raskandha is the six classes of volition but this definition excludes from saskāraskandha  Also the Blessed One said The upādānaskandha called sanskāra is so called because it conditions conditioned things that is to say because it creates and determines the five skandhas of future existence Now the Blessed One said If there is a single dharma which is not known and penetrated I declare that one cannot put an end to suffering And again If there is a single dharma which is not abandoṇed These three skandhas with avijñapti and unconditioned things are the dharmāyatana the dharmadhāta Vedanāskandha sajñāskandha saskāraskandha plus avijñapti and the three unconditioned things  are seven things which are called dharmāyatana or dharmadhāta Consciousness is the impression relative to each object Vijñāarkandha is six classes of con sciousness visual auditory olfactory taste touch and mental consciousness Considered as āyatana  It is the mental organ Considered as dhatu  It is seven dhāṭus What are the seven The six consciousnesses and the aanas We have seen that there are five rkandhus twelve āyataas and eighteen dhāṭus Rāpaskandha is ten āyatanas ten dhātus aṇḍ avijñapti The dharmāyatana or dharmadhātu is vedanā sajñā and saskārāskanṇha avijñapti and the anconditioned things Vijñānaskandha is the manaāyatana it is seven dhātṭus namely the six classes of consciousness and the mental ogan Could a manas or manodhātu be distinct from the six classes of consciousness distinct from the sense consciousness and from the mental consciousness There is no manas distinct from the consciousness The Dhāsus  Of these six consciousness the one which continually passes away is the manar All consciousness which has just perished receives the name of manodhātu in the same way a man is both son and father the same vegetable element is both fruit and seed If the six consciousnesses which make up six dhātus constitute the anas and if the manas is not a thing other than the six consciousnesses then there would be either seventeen dhātusby excluding the anas which is cofunctional with the six conscious nessesor else twelve dhātus by excluding the six consciousnesses which are cofunctional with the anassupposing of course that you want to enumerate distinct things and not mere designations This is true but One counts eighteen dhātus with a view to assigning a point of supposrt to the sixth consciousness The first five consciousnesses havefor their point of support the five material organs organ of sight etc Consequently with a view to attributing a point of support to this consciousness one calls manas or manodhātu or again mana āyabana aṅṇd manaindriya that which serves it as its point of support that is to say any one of the six consciousnesses which depend on these six points of support and six objects If it is not followed by a new mind namely the consciousnessofconception of a new existence  this is not related to its nature rather this results from the absence of other causes actions and defilements necessary to the production of a new thought All conditioned dharmas are included within the totality of the skandhas  all of the impure dharmasr are included within the totality of the xpādānaskandhas  and all the dharmas are included within the totality of the āyatanas and the dhatus But more briefly All the dharmas are included in one sandha one āyatana aṇd oe dhāṭu A dharma is included in its own nature Why is this For it is distinct from the nature of othets For example the organ of sight is included within the rūpaskandha being rūpa by its nature within the cakṣurāyatana and within the cakṣurdhāta for it is the cakṣurāyatana and cakṣurdhātu within the Truth of Suffering and Arising for it is suffering and aising but it is not included within the other rkandhas āyatanat etc for it is distinct by its nature from that which is not itself there is therefore tagraha of oe thing by a thing different from it The organs of sight of hearing and of smell although twofold form only in pairs one dhātu for their nature their sphere of activity and their consciousnesses are common The two organs of sight have a community of nature for they areboth of themthe organ of sight community of sphere for they both have visible matter for theit sphere and community of con sciousness for they are both the point of support of the visual cosciousness Consequently the two ogans of sight form a single dhātu The same holds for the organs of hearing and smell It is for beautys sake that they are twofold With but a single eye a single ear or a single nostril one would be very ugly ksksṣk What is the meaning of the terms skandha āyatanra and dhātu Skandha signifies heap āyatana signifies gate of entry gate of arising and dhāṣu signifies lineage future internal or external gross or subtle inferior or excellent far or near if ope puts together all this pa that which is past etc one has that which is called rpaskandha past rāpa is rpa destroyed by impermanence future rpa is rūpa which has not arisen and present rūpa is rūpa which has arisen and which has not been destroyed rūpa is internal when it forrs part of the series called me  all other rūpa is external or rather the terms internal and external are understood from the point of view of āyatana This objection is invalid for terms of comparison do not vary when a rūpa is gross in relation to another rāpa it is not subtle in relation to this same other rūpa like father and son Inferior rpa is defiled rāpa excellent rpa is nondefiled rūpa past and future pa are distant present pa is near According to the Bhadanta gross pa is that which is perceived by the five organs all other rāpa is subtle past rpa etc has already been designated by its ncme The same for sensation it is far or nea according to whether its point of support is visible or iavisible it is gross or subtle according to whether it is corporeal or mental Etymologically āyatana is that which extends the entry of the mind and of the mental states In the same way that the place the mountain where there are many families of gemsiron coppet silver goldis said to have numerous dhātus in this same way in the huiman complex or series there are eighteen types of families which are called the eighteen dhātus Let us say that they are the mine of the mind and mental states According to another opinion dhātu signifies species The specific nature of the eighteen dhātus is what is understood by the eighteen dhātus As an atom in this hypothesis cannot have the qnality of being a heap do not say that skandha signifies heap According to another opinion  skandha signifies that which bears the burden namely its effect  Or else skandha signifies part section as one says in the world I will lend you three sandhas if you promise to return them to me These two explanations are not in conformity with the Sūtra Whatever rpa there is past ptesent or future if one puts together all this rpa all rpapast rūpa future rūpa etcis individually called ṛandha the same way that it teaches that hair etc is earthelement  thus each real element of past rpa future rāpa etc receives the name of skandha Thus the skandhas have real existence and not merely nominal existence if one puts together all this pa one has that which is called rūpaskandha When the bhidhārmikas take into cosideration the fact that the term sandha is only the denomimation of a heap they say that an atom is part of a dhātu an āyatama and a skandha when they do not take this fact iato consideration they say that an atom is a dhātu an āyatana skandha In fact one metaphorically designates the part by the whole for example The robe is burned for One part of the robe is burned Why did the Blessed One give skandhas āyatanas and dhātus as the triple designation of the dharmas The teachings of the skandhas etc because error faculty joy are threefold  Eor is threefold three catagories sharp mediocre dul  The two mental states sensation and ideas are defined as distinct sandhas because they are the causes of the roots of dispute because they are the causes of transmigration and also by reason of the causes which justify the order of skandhas There are two roots of dispute attachment to pleasure and aṭtachment to opinions Sensation and ideas are respectfully the principal causes of these two roots In fact if one becornes attached to pleasures it is because one relishes the sensation if one becomes attached to opinions it is by reason of erroneous or false ideas Sensation and ideas are the causes of traṇsmigration those who are greedy for sensation and whose ideas are erroneous transrmigrate The reasons which justify the order of the rkandhas will be explained below ab Unconditioned things are not named with respect to the ṛkandhas because they do not corespond to the concept Unconditioned things cannot be placed within any of the five skandhas for they are not matter nor sensation  one has that which one calls the a asaskṛtaskandha for the distinctions of past etc do not exist with respect to unconditioned things According to one opinion the same way that the end of a jug is not a jug in this same way unconditioned things which are the end or cessation of the skandhas ate not skandhas The order of the sandhas is justified by their grossness their defilement the characteristic of the jug etc and also from the point of view of their spheres of influence Matter being subject to resistance  is the grossest of the skandhas In the course of external transmigration men and women are mutually infatuated by their bodies because they are attached to the pleasures of sensation This attachment proceeds from erroneous ideas  which are due to the defilements which are saskāras The srbkandhas are thus arraṇged according to the process of their defilement Matter is the pot sensation is the food ideas are the seasoning the ramskāras are the cook and the mind is the consumer The first four skandhas costitute the field the fifth constitutes the seed There are thus five rkandhas no more no less they are grosser than the other saskāras they are the cause of the process of defilement they are the food and the seasoningand they reign over the two spheres of existence ksksk One should now explain the order in which the six āyatanas or dhātus which are the six organsof consciousness the ogan of sight etc are enumerated Five beginning with the organ of sight are called the first because they bear only on present simultaneous objects The first four are the first because their object is solely derived or secondary matter sometimes primary elements sometimes derived matter sometimes both at the same time These four are arranged according to the range and speed of their activity Their activity is at a distance at a greater distance very rapid The organ of sight and the organ of hearing bear on a distant object But the activity of smell is more rapid than that of taste The organ of smell perceives the odor of food before the organ of taste perceives its taste The point of support or the place of the organ of sight that is to say the eye is the highest below that the place of the organ of hearing below that the place of the ogan of smell below that the place of the organ of taste Among the ten āyatanas included within vāpaskandha only one receives the name of rāpaāyatana Anṅd although all the āyatanas are dharmas only one is called dharmaāyatana A single āyatana is called rūpaāyatana with a view to diīstinguishing it from the others and by reason of its excel lence The āyatana which does pot bear any of these nine names and which is matter is sufficiently designated by the expression tūpaāyatana without there being any need to give it another name being subject to resistance it is deteriorated through contact with the hand etc by reason of deśanidarśfana  that which one understands in the world by rāpa is visible matter color and shape It incldes numerous dharmas sensations ideas etc it includes the best dharma that is to say Nirvāṇa According to another opinion visible matter is called rūpā yatana because it includes twenty varieties  and because it is the sphete of three types of eyes a fleshy eye the divine eye and the wisdom eye The Sūtras name other skandhasother āyataas aṇḍ other dhātus The eighty thousand dharmaskandhas thet the Muni promulgated depending on whether one regards them as voice or as name are included within the rāpaskaṇdhūi oṛ For the teachers who say The word of the Buddha ss by its nature voice these skandhas are inctuded within the rāpaskandha for those who consider the word of the Buddha as name these rhandhas are included within the seskāraskandha Accoding to some a dharmaskhandha iīs of the dimension of the Treatise t That is to say of the dimension of an Abhidharmma Treatise known by the name of Dharmaskandha which is six thousand stanzas long The exposition of the skandhas etc constitutes so many dharmaskandhas Eighty thousand dharmaskandhashave been preached by the Blessed One in order to cure them In this same way the other skandhas āyatanas and dhātus should be suitably arranged within the skandhas āyatanas and dhātus as described above by taking into account the charac teristics that have been attributed to them the first forms part of the rūpaskandha the others of the saskāraskandha The first eight kṛsṇāyatanas  being by their nature absence of desire form part of the dharmāyatana If one considers them along with their following they are by their nature five skanṇdhas and they are included within the manaāyatana and the dharmāyatana The five gates of entry into deliverance ae by their nature speculative knowledge  they are thus included within the ḍdharmāyatana In this same way the sixtytwo dhātus enumerated in the Bahudhā zuka should be arranged within the eighteen dhātus by taking their natue into cosideration Is the space elernent the same thing as all space the first of the unconditioned things  Is all consciousness the consciousness element Cavities are called the space element it is one says light and darkness According to the School  the void of the space element is light or darknessthat is to say a certain type of color of matteṛ  for that which one perceives in a cavity is light or darkness Being by its nature light or darkness the void will be day or night The void is called aghasāmantaka rāpa Oe should thus understand ggha as solid agglomerated matter void is agha because other matter does not stṛike it it is at the same time close to other matter it is thus both agha and samāntaka The consciousness element is an impure consciousness Why is it not called pure Because these sīx dhātus are The support of arising The six dhāus are given in the Sūtra as support as the raison dere of arising that is to say of the mind at conception and of all existence until the mind at death Of these six dhātus the first four are included within the tangible the fifth is incloded within visible matter and the sixth within the seven dhātus enumerated above  tssk Among the eighteen dhātus how many are visible capable of being pointed out Only rāpadhātu is visible The ten dhātar which are exclusively material are capable of being struck The ten dhātus which are included within the rāpaskandha are capable of being struck the quality that belongs to a body of making an obstacle to the aising of another body in the place where it itself is found impenetrability When a hand strikes a hand or a rock when a rock strikes a rock or a hand it is counterstruck or repelled There is an eye an organ of sight which is sttuck by water and not by dṛyness namely the eye of a fish there is an eye which is struck by dryness and not by water namely the eyes of humans in general  there is an eye which is sttuck by water and by dryness namely the eye of a ctocodile a crab a frog or fishermen there is an eye which is neither struck by water nor by dryness namely the eyes which are not of the preceeding categories There is an eye struck by night namely the eye of a bat an owl etc there is an eye which is struck by daylight namely the eye of humans in general  there is an eye which is struck by the night and by daylight namely the eye of a dog jackal a horse a leopard a cat etc there is an eye which is not struck by either night or daylight namely the eyes which are not of the preceeding categories Alambanapratighāta the striking of the mind and mentat states with their object Viṣaya is the place where the organ exercises its activity seeing hearing etc āambana is what is grasped by the mind and the mental states Why terrm striking or evolving the activity of the organ or the mind with respects to its viṣaya or ālambana Are the dharmas which are sapratigha through striking the sphere of action also sapratigha through impenetrability Four alternatives Let us now answer the second term of the question the dharmas which are sapratigha through striking the objectare also sapratigha through striking the sphere of action but there are dharmas which are sapratigha through striking the sphere of action without being at the same time sapratigha through striking the object namely the five organs kssk Among the eighteen dhāṣus how many are good how many are bad and how many are morally neutral  What are the eight These are the ten dhāus which are character ized as sapratśigha  Minus visible matter and sound the five material ogans odor taste and the tangible are neutral not being defined as good or bad or rather according to another opinion not being defined from the point of view of retribution The others are of three types The other dhātus can be according to the case good bad or neutral The seven dhātus are good when they are associated with the three good roots  bad when they are associated with bad roots and neutral in all other cases The dharmadhātu includes the good roots the dharmas associated with these roots the dharmas that issue from these roots and pratisakhyānirodha or Nirvāṇa the bad roots the dharmas associated with these roots the dharmas that issue from these roots and neutral dharmuas for example space Rūpadhātu and śabdadhātu the visible matter and the audible are good or bad when they constitute a bodily or vocal action that issued from a good or bad mind They are neutral in all other cases kskṣk Among the eighteen dhātus how many exist in each sphere of existence Kāmadhātu Rūpadhātu and rāpyadhātu  All exist in Kāmadhātu Fourteen exist in Rūpadhātu There are fourteen dhāeus in Rāpadhātu With the exception of odor taste the consciousness of odor and the consciousness of taste Odor and taste are lacking there for they are morselfood and no one is born into Rūpadhātu who is not detached from this food Tangible things should be lacking also for it is also tangible food by the mouthful No for tangible things are pot exclusively food One can reason in the same way with respect to odor and taste Odor and taste have no function outside of eating they are of no use to beings detached fromn food We think that if odor and taste are lacking in Rūpadhātu the ogans of smell and taste should also be lacking for they do not serve aay purpose The nose support of the subtle matter that constitutes the organ of smell suffices for beauty  the tongue the place of the ogan of taste suffices for elocation The membersnose and tonguewhich support the organ cannot be deprived of this organ One can well conceive that the sexual member is lacking when the sexual organ is lacking for stripped of this organ it serves no function but the nose and the tongue are useful independent of the organs of smell and taste But an organ can arise without having any use for example the organs of beings destined to perish in the womb Agreed The arising of an ogan can be without usefulness but it is never without a cause Thus there is no reason for the organs of smell and taste to appear among beings who are reborn in Rūpadhātu since these beings are detached from odors and tastes The sexual organ is a cause of ugliness Moreover it is not by reason of its utility that the sexual organ arises but rather by reason of its cause Given its cause it will arise even if it is ugly The Sūtra teaches that beings of Rūpadhātu possess complete all the organs Although odor and taste are lacking there the organs of smeil and taste exist in Rūpadhātu Thirst enters into action with regard to these six ogans of consciousness not by reason of the object of these six organs but by reason of the person himself In rāpyādhatu there is a mental organ an object of the mental consciousness and the mental consciousness Beings detached from matter arise in rūpyādhatu thus the ten dhātus which are material namely the five organs and their objects and the five consciousnesses which have for their point of support and for their objects a material dhāu  are lacking in rūpyādhatu The three dhātur which have just been named can be pure or impure The others are impure The other dhātus fifteen in number are solely impure Five consciousnesses aiways include viarka and vicara The last three dhāṭus are of three types The other dhātus are free from the one and the other The other dhātus are the ten material dhātus Not being associated with the mind they are free from both vitarka and vicāra ks But if the five sense consciousnesses are always accompanied by viṭarka and vicāra how ae they defined as free from vkalpa As for the other two vkalpas They are dispersed mental pvajñā mental mernory whatever it may be Mental prajñā that is the discernment of the dharmas associated with the mental consciousness but dispersed that is to say not concentrated not in the state of absorption  is either vikalpa of examination or by definition sks How many dhātus have an object that is to say are the subject of consciousness And also one part of the dharmadhātu That part which consists of the dharmas associated with the mind The other dhātus namely the ten material ḍhātus and the part of the dharmadhātu which is not associated with the mind  do not have an object t How many dhātus are nonappropriated How many are appropriated Nine are nonappropriated What are these nine The seven that have been mentioned which have an object together with onehalf of the eighth The eight that have been mentioned and sound the seven dhātus of mind  the dharmadhātu  and sound are never appropriated for example the physical mattercolor and shape of hair body hair pails and teethwith the exception of their roots which are bound to the body or to the organ of touch color and shape of excrement urine saliva mucus blood etc the color and shape of eath water fire etc What is the meaning of the expression appropriated That which the mind and the mental states grasp and appropriate to themselves in the quality of a support is called approprated Matter that the Abhi dharma calls appropriated is called in common language saceśanā or sensitive matter The tangible is of two types Tangibles are the four primary elements solidity fluidity heat and motion  and sevenfold secondary matter the soft the hard etc The other nine material dhātus are solely secondary matter The other material dhātus the five organs and the objects of the first four organs are solely secondary matter As is the part of the dharmadhātu which is materia The same for avñapti  which forms part of the dharma dhātu According to the Bhadanta Buddhadeva the ten āyatanas that is the five organs of consciousness and their objects are solely primaty matter The Sutra teaches in a limited manner that there are four primary elements and it defines them in a limited manner as being solidity fludity etc Oh Bhikṣus the eye the internal source of consciousness  a subtle matter derived from the primary elements material sources invisible capable of being struck and so on with respect to the four other material organs which are described in the same terms With respect to the first four objects The visible matter is an external sources of consciousness deriving from the primary elements material visible capable of being struck The same with respect to odor and taste Tangibles are an external source of consciousness the four primary elements and matter deriving from the four primary elements Eveything that is in the eye a ball of flesh is solid resistant Here the Sūtra refers to the ball of flesh which is not separable from the organ of sight and not to the organ itself So be it In fact the Sūtra then says that a person is the six points of support of the mental dharma called contact  that is to say the six ogans Would one maintain that the mental states are the mind and as a consequence are included within vrñānadhātu One cannot for the utra says Sensation and ideas are dharmas which are mental states dbharmas associated with the mind having the mind for their point of support and the Sūtra speaks of a mind possessing desire thus desire which is a mental state is not the mind Among the eighteen dhātus how many cut and how many are cut how many burn and how many are burned and how many weigh and how many are weighed Four external dhātus cat are cut Visible matter smell taste and tangible cut when they bear the name of axe etc they are cut when they bear the name of wood etc What is the dharma that is called to cut To cut is to produce the sectioning of the procress of an agglomeration the nature of which is to continue itself in an uninterrupted series The organs cannot be cut off For ekample when all of the parts of the organ of touch or the body are cut off they are not for all this mutiple the members which have been cut that is to say seperated from the trunk do not possess touch The organs themselves do not cut by reason of their translucidity like the sparkle of a jewel The same are burned and weighed Four external dhātus alone are burned According to some the same four external dhāur burn and are weighed According to othets only the primary element of fire burns when it menifests its own manner of being in the flame only weight which is one type of secondary matter  is weighed How many are conjoined with material substances Five internal dhātus are of fruition and accamulation Vipākaṭa f frnition or literally arisen from fruition instead of arisen from the cause of frnition  by ommis sion of the middle word the same way that one says oxcart for oxdrawṇ cart Or else in the expression vipākaja arisen from vpāka the word vipāka designates not the fruition but the ripened action the action aiving at the time period when it gives forth its fruit That which arises from ripened action namely the fruit of retribution is called arisen from vipāka The fruit is furthermore also called vipāka because it is cooked In fact a cause is often designated by the name of its effect the same way that an effect is often designated by the name of its cause The present six ogans are past action Aupacayika of accamulation that is to say that which is accumulated nearby through certain foods  certain actions  certain sleep or cetain absoptions Matter of accumulation protects the matter of retribution as a wall does by surrounding it The Prajñaptifāstra says This mark of the Mahā puruṣa which is called the voice of Brahmā rsults from the perfect practice of abstaining from harrmful language The eight dhātus free from resistance are of outflowing and also of fruitioṇ universal causes  retribution when they are produced by retributive causes The others are of three types kksk A single dhātu s real The unconditioned forms part of the dharmadhātu  the dharmadhātu is thus the single hātu which contains a real thing The last three dhātus are momentary The last three dhātus are the mental organ the object of mental consciousness and the mental consciousness This is why these three dhātus are called momentary because for a moment they do not proceed from this type of cause In the group under consideation the mind to which the kṛāṇti is associated is anodhātu aṇd manovijñānadhātu the dharmas which coexist with this mind are dharmadhātu Does he who obtains possession of the organ of sight where he had previously been lacking it also obtain possession of the visual consciousness And does he who obtains possession of the visual consciousness where he was previously lacking ir also obtain possession of the organ of sight He can obtain the otrgan of sight and the visual consciousness either separately or together a being of Kāmadhātu whose organs progressively appear  for before the organ of sight appears within him he is already in possession of his past and future visual consciousness  ad a being who dies in rūpyadhātu and who is reborn in the heavens of the three higher Dhyānas where the visual consciousness is lacking although the organ of sight exists there Is one who is endowed with the visual organ also endowed with visual consciousness Four cases are possible these three categories of beings are endowed with both the organ and the consciousness all other beingsbeings of rūpyadhātuare devoid of both the organ of sight and visual consciousness The taking possession of and possessien simultaneous or not of the organ of sight aṇd visible matter of the visual consciousness and visible matter of the organ of hearing and sound etc shall be defined as fitting in each case sksk How many are external Twelve are personal What are these twelve With the exception of visible matter etc Twelve dhātus are personal the six organs and the six conscious nesses six dhātus are external the six objects of consciousness visible matter etc  The mind is the object of the idea of self the mind is what persons falsely grasp for their self But can one say that the six consciousnesses are the point of support of the mind When the consciousnesses having perished becomes the point of support of the mind it is indeed these consciousnesses themselves which become the point of support thus before becoming a point of support they are not foreign to the quality of point of support If it were otherwise the mental organ would be solely past it would be neither present nor future Now it is well understood that the eighteen dhātus belong to the three time periods Moreover if the present or future consciousness does not have the characteristic of vanodhātu it is absurd to attribute this character istic to it once it is past The dhātu called dharmas is sabhāga An object of consciousness is qualified as sabhāga when the consciousness which constitutes its proper sphere arises or is destined to atise with respect to it Now there is no dharma with respect to which an unlimited mental consciousness has not arisen or is destined to arise All the Saints in fact necessarily produce the thought All dharma are impersonal It is true that this thought bears neither on itself nor on the dharmas which are coexistent with it  but this thought and the dharmas which are coexistent with it are the object of a second moment of a thought of universal irmpersonality all the harmas are thus included within the object of these two moments of thought Therefore the dharmaa dhātu the proper object of the mental consciousness is in its totality sabhāga active as an object The other ḍhātus are also tatsabhāga When they do not do their proper work they are sabhāga when they do their proper work The organ of sight which has seen does now see or shall see visible matter is temed sbhāga According to the Vaibhāṣikas of Kaśmiīr the organ of sight is ṭasabhāga in four cases the organ of sight which has perished which is now perishing which will perish without having seen and the ogan of sight destined to arise Visible matter which has been seen which is now seen or which will be seen by the organ of sight is sabhāga The organ of sight which is sabhāga or tatsabhāga īs such for everyone foṛ the petson to whom this organ belongs and for other persons But a certain visible thing is sabhāga for the person who sees it In fact the visible matter that a person sees can be seen by many for exrample the moon a stage performance or a contest whereas two peṛsons do not see by means of the same ogan Consequently since one organ of sight is not general it is though relationship with one person that it will be qualified as sabhāga or tatsabhāga the organ of sight is sabhāga when he sees a visible thing even though he has not seen does not now see or will not see another visible thing Granted one would say with respect to sound which like visible mmattet is perceived at a diṣtaṅce and can be perceived by many persons Consequently smells tastes and tangibles should be compared to visible matter and sounds What is the meaning of the expressions sabhāga and atsabhāga That which is not sabhāga but is nevertheless analogous to sabhāga is called tatsabhāga that is to say analogous to that  that is analogous to sabhāga How many ḍhātus can be abandoned by Seeing the Truths in other words by the Path of Seeing or through Seeing  How many can be abandoned by Meditation or repeated consideration of the Ttuths in other words by the Path of Meditation or by Meditation Ten and five ae abandoned through Meditation The ten material dhātus orgas and objects and the five sense consciousnesses ate abandoned through Meditation The last three are of three types Eightyeight anuśayas  with their coexistent dharmas whether these coexistents be of the sarprayukta class or of the viprayukta class are abandoed by Seeing with the prāptis of the said nuśayas abd the said coexistents with their following of the said prāptīs The other impure dharmas are abandoned by Meditation  Now the quality of Prthagjana and the action which causes a bad realm of rebirth are in contradiction with the Path of Seeing the Truths Thus according to us both are abandoned through Seeing Neither the undefiled nor matter are abandoned by Seeing the Truths  Nothing that is defiled that is bad nor defiledpeutral  and nothing that is material can be abandoned by the Seeing of the Truths Further if the quality of Pṛthagjana were abandoned by Seeing it would follow that it would exist in the first state of the Path of Seeingwhich is incorrect Arisen from the nonsixth is what has arisen from an ogan different from the sixth organ that is to say what has arisen from the five organs the organ of sight etc ṣkṅk Among the eighteen dhāus how many are view how many are not view The organ of sight and part of the dharmadhātu are view Eight parts The five false views of which the first is belief in a self and Worldly correct views that is to say prajñā associated with the mental consciousness good but impure In the manner in which visible matter is seen at night and in the daytime on a cloudy day and on a clear day in this same way the dharmas are seen by defiled worldly viewsfive false opinions by nondefiled worldly view or worldly correct views by aīkṣī views and by noAśaikṣī views Why are corect worldly views understood solely as prujñā associated with the mental consciousness The prajñā which arises with the five sense conscious nesses is not view because it is not judgment after deliberation Now the prajñā which arises with the five sense consciousnesses does not present this characteristic Thus it is not view For the same reason it happens that prajña even though mental defiled or nondefiled is not view when it is purely intuitive View is understood here as the seeing of visible matter It is the organ of sight which sees visible matter If an organ sees then the organ of a person occupied with hearing or touch consciousness would see When it is sabhāga The oṛgan of sight sees when it is sabhāga  that is to say when it is conjoined with visual cosciousness But then that which sees is indeed the consciousness which is supported by the organ of sight For obscured visible matter is not seen Such is the opinion of the Vaibhāṣikas visible matter obscured by a wall or any other screen is not seen Thus if the visual consciousness were to see it would see even the visible matter obscured by a screen The visual consciousness does not aṛise with respect to obscured visible rmatter not arising with respect to them it does not see them But why does it not arise with respect to these visible things In this hypothesis I would understand that the organ of sight being capable of being arrested does not see obscured visible matter you do not then have the right to say that being capable of being arrested it does not see obscured visible matter Moreover one sees obscured visible matter through a glass a cdloud a cṛystal and water how would you explain this fact I would say then that the visual consciousness sees it arises with respect to obscured visible matter when the screen does not form an obstacle to light it does not arise in the contrary case The Sūtra says Having seen visible matter through the organ of sight now this organ being past  does not discern it is through the mental consciousness that one discerns therefore if the text says through the mental organ it means by supporting itself on the mental organ the point of support of mental consciousness The same for sight and the organ of sight Oṇne can also admit that the Sūtra attṛibutes to the point of support to the organ the action which belongs to that which grasps this point of support that is to say to the consciousness We read that agreeable and disagreeable visible rmatter is discerned by the organ of sight The Sūtra also says The ogan of sight Oh Brahmiṇ is the gate of the sight of visible matter This text proves that the visual consciousness sees by this gate which is the organ of sight You would not maintain that gate signifies sight for it would be absurd to say The organ of sight is the sight of the sight of visible matter If the visual consciousness sees what it is that discerns  If the organ of sight sees what is then the separately existing action of seeing that you attribute to this organ the agent of this action In the same way that you would have it that the consciousness discerns without admitting any differ ence between the agent and the action in that same way we hold that an ogan sees According to another opinion it is the visual consciousness which sees but as the organ of sight is the point of support of this consciousness one says that it sees the same way one says that the bell rings because it is the point of support of the sound But according to this principle one should also say that the organ of sight discerns for it is the point of support of the visual conṇsciousness For in the world one agrees to give the name of seeing to the visual consciousness in fact when this consciousness is produced one says The color is seen one does not say that the color is discerned And the Vibhāṣā confirms One terms seen that which is attained by the organ of sight that which falls within its line of vision and is perceived by the visual consciousness One says then in the world that the organ of sight sees because it is the point of support of the viṣual consciousness which sees one does not say that it discerns because the function attributed to the visual consciousness is seeing and not disceṛnment One means that the consciousness discerns by itself that it is in and of itself diṣcernment in the same way that one says that the sun creates the day By reason of the organ of sight and of visible matter there arises the visual consciousness The eye sees and the consciousness discerns But one should not cling to these metaphors The Blessed One has said that one should not take them in the manner of popular speech that one should not setiously grasp an expression in use in the world According to the system of the Vaibhāṣikas of KaśmīT the ogan of sight sees the organ of hearing hears the organ of smell smells the organ of taste tastes the organ of touch touches and the mental ogan discens Is visible matter seen by one eye or by both eyes Visible matter is seen by the two eyes also as the clarity of sight demonstrates The bhidhārmikas say Seen also by the two eyes the two eyes being open sight is clearer Furthermore when one eye is covered and the other half closed oe perceives two moons but not when one completely closes or half closes that which was open or when one opens or completely closes that which has been half closed One should not conclude that the visual consciousness is twofold from the fact that its point of support is twofold for the consciousness is not material like pa not having a mass it is not situated in a place The organ of sight the organ of hearing and the mental organ know their object without attaining it The organ of sight sees visible matter at a distance it does not see the eyesalve placed on the eye the organ of hearing hears distant sounds If the organs of sight and hearing must necessarily enter into a close relationship with theit object then ascetics in dḥyāna would not attain divine sight or divine hearing in the same way that they do not attain a divine sense of smell Why does a magnet not attract all iron why does the organ of sight not see the eye salve the brush and all the objects with which it is in close relationship According to certain rnasters from the fact that one hears noise from the interior of the ear one can conclnde that the ogan of hearing hears the sound with which it is ia close relationship as it also hears distant sound The other three organs smell taste touch perceive an object with which they are in close relationship What does one mean when one says that the nose attains its object knows its object after having attained it But if there is no contact among the atoms how is sound produced if atoms were to touch one aother a hand in collision with a hand would dissolve into it a rock in collision with another rock would dissolve into it as gum dissolves into gum But if atoms do not touch one another why does an agglomeration of atoms not fall to pieces when it is struck Because the wind element holds it together A certain wind element has dispersion for its function for example the wind of the period of the destruction of the world a certain wind element has coṇcentration for its function for example the wind at the period of creation This is also what is meant by to attain Furthermore as agglomerations have parts there is no difficulty in agglomerations touching one another Anḍ fromn this point of view the definitions of the Vbhāṣā are justified Does a thingincontact arise having for its cause a thingin contact or does it arise having for its cause a thingoutsideofcontact Sometimes a thing outsideofcontact arises from a thingincontact as when a thingin contact falls to pieces ometimes a thingincontact arises from a thingoutsideof contact as when agglomerations come together And sometimes a thingoutsideofcontact arises from a thingoutsideofcontact for example the particles of dust suspended in the void of a window The Bhadanta Vasumitra says If atoms touched one another they would therefore endure two moments In fact if atoms were to allow an interval between themselves since this interval would be empty what would hinder the progress of atoms into this interval If you admit spatialdivision to the atom then an atom certainly has parts whether it enters into contact or not it is evidently thus when one sees the circle of fire delineated by an emberor else do the organs indifferently grasp an object of their dimension and of a different dimension The three organs of which the organ of smell is the first grasp an object of their dimension The same for sound one hears the buzzing of a mosquito the noise of thunder etc The atoms of the organ of sight are arranged on the pupil like the flower of the cumin that is to say on the surface they are covered again by a membrane of translucent colot which prevents them from dispersing According to another opinion they ate arranged in depth iike a pill being translucent like crystal they do not obscure one another The atoms of the organ of hearing are arranged in the interior of the bhūrja that type of birch leaf which is found within the ear The atoms of the organ of smell are arranged within the interior of the nostril The atoms of the organ of taste are arranged on the upper surface of the tongue in the form of a halfmoon In the middle of the tongue a space the dimension of the end of a hair is not occupied by the atoms of the organ Such is the opinion expressed in Scripture The atoms of the organ of touch have the shape of the body The atoms of the female ogan are like a drum The atoms of the male organ are like a thumb The atoms of the organ of sight can be sabhāga in their totality asabhāga in their totality some sabhāga others tatsabhāga But it does not occur that the atoms of the organ of touch are all sabhāga even when the body is enveloped in the flames of Pratapana hell  an infinite number of atorns are tatsabhāga for says the School the body would fall to pieces if all the atoms of touch were to work at the same time It does not occur that consciousness is produced by one atom of organ or by one atom of object In fact the five categories of consciousness have agglomerations for their support and their object It results from thiis that atoms are not perceived they are thus imperceptible The object of the fitst five consciousnesses is simultaneous with them the object of the sixth consciousness is either ealier than īit simultaneous with it or later than it in other words it is past present or future No it does not The sole point of support of the mental consciousness is the mental ogan this is the consciousness which has just perished The point of support of the first five is also simultaneous the sense organ organ of sight etc which is simultaneous with consciousness and  the mental organ which is past at the moment when the consciousness arises The five consciousnesses thus have two points of support ls that which is the point of support of the viṣual consciousness at the same time the immediately antecedent and parallel cause of this consciousness Four cases the organ of sight which is solely a poiat of support  sksk Visual consciousness depends on the organ of sight and on visible matte When the organ of sight is the object of attention  when it is injured by dust etc when it is alert when it is sluggish and weak consciousness reproduces modality Why is it designated by the name of its organ eye consciousness the organ of a certain person is the point of support of the visual consciousness of this person alone Visible matter on the contraty is general for a certain visible thing is perceived by both the visual consciousness and the mental coascious ness by one person and by another person We conclude that the consciousness is named according to its organ because the organ is its point of support and because the organ is its own thing Do the body the orgen of sight visible matter and consciousness belong to the same stage or to different stages All can belong to different stages When a being born in Kamadhātu sees by means of an organ of sight of his stage visible matteṛ When this being sees visible matter of his stage by means of an ogan of sight of the First Dhyāna then the body and visible matter are of Kamadhātu but his organ and consciousness are of the First Dhyāna if he sees visible matter of the First Dhyāna by means of the same ogan then only the body is in Kāmadhātu the other three are of the First Dhyāna When this being sees visible matter of Kāmadhātu by means of an organ of sight of the Second Dhyāna then the body and visible matter are in Kāmadhātu the organ is in the Second Dhyāna and conscious ness is in the First Dhyāna if he sees by the same organ visible matter of the Second Dhyāna then the body is in Kāmadhātu the ogan and visible matter are in the Second Dhyāna and consciousness is in the First Dhyāna Oṇe would explain in the same way these cases where a being born in Kāmadhātu sees by the organ of sight of the Third or Fouth Dhyāna visible matter of these same stages or of a lower stage When a being in the First Dhyāna sees visible matter of his stage by means of an organ of sight of his stage then body organ visible matter and consciousness are of the same stage if he sees visible matter of a lower stage by the same organ then the body organ and consciousness are of his stage the First Dhyāṇa When this being sees visible matter of his stage by means of an organ of sight of the Second Dhyna then three are of his stage  but the organ is in the Second Dhyāṇna if he sees by the same organ visible matter of Kāmadhātu then the body and con sciousness are of his stage  visible matter is in a lower stage and the organ is in the Second Dhyāna if he sees visible matter of the Second Dhyāna by the same organ then the body and consciousness are of his stage  but the organ and the visible matter are in the Second Dhyāna According to these same principles we can explain those cases where a being in the Second Third or Fourth Dhyāṇa sees by means of an organ of sight of his stage or of a different stage visbble matter of his stage or of a different stage The organ of sight is not inferior to the body The body the organ of sight and visible matter can belong to five stages Kāmadhātu aṇd the Four Dhyānas The consciousness of sight is of two stages only Kārmadhātu and the First Dhyāṇna Thus stated the organs of sight which a certain being uses can be of the stage to which the body of this being belongs that is of the stage where this being has arisen it can be of a higher stage but it ca never be lower Visible matter and consciousness through relationship to the organ is either of the same stage or lower but never of a higher stage Visible matter is not higher than the ogan Visible matter of a higher stage cannot be seen by an ogan of sight of a lower stage Nor cosciousness Visible matter in relation to consciousness and visible matter as well as consciousness through relation to the body is of all types Visible matter through relationship with the visual consciousness is either equal or higher or lower Visible matter and the visual consciousness through relationship to the body are as visible matter is through relationship to the consciousness this is to say equal higher or lower The same holds for the organ of hearing The organ of hearing is not lower than the body sound is not higher than the organ of hearing nor is auditory consciousness sound through relationship to this latter and sound and consciousness through relationship to the body can be of all types Three ogans belong to their own stage After having formulated this general rule the author mentions one exception The consciousness of touch is of its own stage or of a lower stage The body the organ of touch and tangibles are always of the stage where the being is born There is no restriction with respect to the mental organ Sometimes the mental organ is of the same stage as the body the dharmadhātu and the mental consciousness sometimes it is lower or higher If a body belongs to the first five stagesKāmadhātu and the Four Dhyānas then the mental organ the dharmadhātu and the mental consciousness can be in absoption or at conception of any stage all the stages not being moreover the same in each case We shall not speak here of this for the sake of brevity the profit being small and the pains great kxkṣk There are eighteen dhāus aṇd six consciousness Which dhātu is discerned by which consciousness Five external dhātus are discerned by two types of cosciousness Visible matter sounds odots tastes and tangibles are known respectively by the consciousness of sight hearing smell taste and touch They are all discerned by the mental consciousness The thirteen other dhātus not being of the sphere of the sense cosciousness are discerned by a single mental consciousness How many of the dhātus are eternal No dhātu is totally eternal Thus one part of the dharmadhātu is eternal The twelve internal dḥātus and one part of the dharma dhātu are indriyas A Sūtra eṇumerates twentytwo ndriyas organ of sight  faculty of memory  They do not place the mental organ after the organ of touch but after the vital organ for the reason that the mental organ the same as the ogans of sensation  also have an ālambana and not solely a visaya as do the organs of sense consciousness The five remaining dhātus and one part of the dharmadhātu are not ndriyas What is the meaning of the word ndriya According to the School five are predominate with regard to things i The organs of smell taste and sensation are predominating influences with regard to beauty as above with regard to protection through the consumption of solid foods  with regard to the production of their three coscious nesses and with regard to their special activities ie perceiving smells tasting tastes and touching tangibles Four ndriyas pamely the two sexual organs the vital organ and the mental organ are each a predominating influence with regard to two things The five ndriyas of sensation and the eight indriyas of faith and the three pure faculties ii c Five and eight with regard to defilement and to purification are tespectively predominant with regard to defilement and to purification Faith and the seven other faculties are predominant with regard to purification for it is by them that one obtains purity According to other masters  the sensations are also predominant with regard to purification so that the Sūtra says swkhiasya citta samādhīyate duḥkhopaniṣacchradḍhā aṇ naiṣkramyāfritaḥ saumamasyādhayaḥ Such is the explanation of the Vaibhāsikas the sense organs the eyes etc are not predominant with regard to the protection of the petson By reason of their predominance with regard to the perception of their special object with regard to all objects six organs The five organs the first of which is the organ of sight are predominant through their affinity to the five sense consciousnesses visual consciousness etc each one of which distin guishes its own object visible things etc The mental orga is predominant with regard to the mental conscionsness which dis tinguishes all objects It is in this way that the six sense organs are predominant But we might say the sense objects visibles etc are also predominant through their affinity to the consciousness and as a consequence should they not also be considered as ndriyas The same holds for the other sense organs and their objects It is by reason of their predominance in masculinity and femininity that one must distinguish two sexual organs within the body There are two separate sexual organs within the kāyendriya or the ogan of touch These two organs are not distinct from the kāyendriya they too cognize tangible things But there is a part of the kāyendriya that receives the name of male organ or female organ because this part exercises predominance over masculinity or femininity Femininity is the physical form the voice the hearing and the dispositions ptoper to women The same for masculinity Since the differences of these two natures are due to these parts of the body we know that these two paxts are predominant through their two natures It is by reason of their predominance with regard to the duration of existence to defilement to purification that one considers the vital organ the sensations and the five the first of which is faith as ndriyas The five sensations are predominant with regard to defilement for the Sūtra says Lust finds its shelter in the sensation of pleasure hatred in the sensation of displeasure confusionin the sensation of indifference By reason of their predominance with regard to ascending acquisitions with regard to Nirvāṇa etc the anājñātamājñās yāmīndriya the ajñendriya and the āgñātāvīndriya are likewise For there is no Patinirvāṇa when the mind is not delivered The word et cetera indicates that there is another explanation The first is predominant with regard to the extinctions of the defilements which are abandoned through Seeing the Truths The third with regard to blessednessinthislife that is the experience of the satisfaction aṇd the wellbeing that comes from deliverance from the defilements If you regard a pre dominating influence as an indriya ignorance and the other parts of pratityasamutpāda would be driyas for these causes are predominant with regard to their effects In the same way the voice hands feet the anus and the penis are predominant with regard to words grasping walking  exctetio and pleasure The support of the mind consists of the six organs of consciousness from the organ of sight to the mental organ These are the six internal yatanas which are the primary constitu ents of a living being This sixfold support is differenciated by reason of the sexual ogans It lasts for a time by reason of the vital organ It is defiled by reason of the five sensations Its purification is prepared by the five moral faculties faith etc It is purified by the three pure faculties The dharmas that possess the characteristic of being predominant with regard to the constitution the subdivision etc Or rather there are fourteen ndriyas support of transmigra tion origin duration enjoyment of this support the other indriyas have the same function with regard to Nirvāṇa The expression or rather introduces the explanation of other mastets The six organs  from the ogan of sight to the mental organ are the support the raison detre of sasāra It is through the vita ogan that the saḍāyatanas last It is through the five sensations that the saḍāyatanas ejoy The voice is not predominant with respect to words for wods suppose a certain instruction  Hands and feet are not pre dominant with regard to grasping and walking for grasping and walking are simply the hands and feet arising a secood moment in another place and with a new figure On the other hand we see that hands and feet are not indispensable for grasping and walking for example with snakes If you consider the hands the feet etc as driyas you must then place the throat the teeth the eyelids and the joints whose function it is to swallow to chew to open and close to fold up and to extend the bones among the ndriyas We shall examine here the organs of sensation and the pure faculties which are not found anywhere else Disagreeable bodily sensation is the driya of pain Disagreeable is that which does harm Agreeable is that which does good which comforts is beneficent In the Third Dhyāna agreeable mental sensation is also an nriya of pleasure greeable mental sensation of the Third Dhyāna is also called sukhendriya an indriya of pleasure This name moreover is reserved for agreeable bodily sensation but in the Third Dhyāṇna bodily sensation is absent because the five sense consciousnesses are not there Moreover it is satisfaction Moreover that is in the stages below the Third Dhyāna in Kāmadhātu and in the first two Dhyānas agreeable mental sensation is satisfaction or the ndriya of satisfaction In the Third Dhyāna agreeable mental sensation is calm and tranquil because the ascetic in this Dhyāṇna is detached from joy hence it is pleasure and not satisfaction Joy is not distinct frorn satisfaction Disagreeable mental sensation is dissatisfaction Intermediate sensation which neither comforts nor harms is the sensation neitherpainnorpleasure Is this seṇsation bodily or mental It is both For it has no vikalpana Accordingly as the agreeable or disagreeable sensations are bodily or mental they do good or harm according to a mode of operation that is special to them and they are not felt in the same way Nine ndṛiyas in the Paths of Seeing of Meditation and of the Aśaikṣa constitute three driyas On the Path of Meditation on the Truths the saint does not have anything new to know he is a wise one or iña But in order to cut off the defilemeats which remain in him he newly knows and often repeats the Truths that he already knows he obtains the knowledge that the Truths are known Possessing ājñātaava he is an ājñātāvi and his indriya is called the jñātāvīndriya in fact when the saint has obtained kṣayajñna aṇḍ anutpādajñāna  he knows in truth Pain is known I have nothing more to know and the rest We must explain their different natures How many are pure Three are clean ī The material organs the vital ogan and the two painful sensations are imputre The material organs are seven in number the five organs of seeing etc plus the two sexual organs for all these seven organs are included in rūpaskandha Nine are of two types The mental ogan the sensation of pleasure the sensation of satisfaction the sensation of equanimity and the five moral facalties are nine driyas that ca be either pure or impure This text is not proof for the Blessed One is speaking here of a person in whom the five pure moral faculties are absent Hence he is referring to only the five moral faculties belonging to the ryans that is pure Finally the Blessed One said If I do not know truly the origin the disappearance the advantages the disadvantages the escape of the five faculties of faith foṛce etc I shall not be liberated gone out disassociated delivered from the world of gods Māras and Brahmās of a worId wherein there are Brahmins and monks I shall not reṣide with a mind free from error Among the ndriyas how many are retribution  and how many are not retribution The vital energies that a Bhikṣu Arhat stabilizes or increases are evidently the vital organ An Arhat in possession of supernormal power  in possession of the mastery of mind ie one who is asamayavimukta  gives either to the Saṅgha or to a person things useful to life clothing pots etc May this action which should produce a retributioninjoy be transformed and produce a retribution inlifeP Then the action which should produce a retributioninjoy produces a retributioninlife How does a Bhiksu cast off the vital energies Along with the Sautṛāntikas we say that the Arhats through their mastery in absorption cause the projection of the constitutive primary elements of the organs for a certain period of duration a projection due to previous actions to cease inversely they produce a new projection born of absorption Why does the Arhat prologue his vital energies He sees that his life is going to end he sees that others are incapable of assuring these two ends Why does the Aṛhat cast off his vital energies he sees that his dwelling in this world has only a small utility for the good of others and so sees himself tormented by sickness etc As the stanza says If the religious life has been well practiced and the Way well cultivated at the end of his life he is happy as at the disappearance of sickness In the three Dvīpas  male or female a asamayavimukia Arhat who possesses prāntakoṭika Dhyāna  According to the Sūtra the Blessed One after having extended the jīvita saskāras casts off the saskāras of āyus One asks  what difference is there between the sarskāras of jāvita and of āyus and  Accoding to certain masters there is no difference In fact the Mūlaśāṣṭra says What is the vital organ It is the  in the Three Dhātus According to others the expression āyuḥsaskāras designates life which is the result of actions in a previous life the expression jāvitasaskāras designates life which is the result of actions in this life According to other masters the āyuḥsaskāras are that by which existence lasts the jñvitasaskāras are that by which life is prolonged for a little while On the second point The Sūtra uses the plura because the Saint extends or casts off many saskāras There is no advantage in fact in extending a moment or in casting off a moment According to another opinion the pilural condemns the teaching according to which the jāvita or the āyus is an entity susceptible of duratio Why does the Blessed One cast off and extend  With the aim of showing that he possesses mastery over death he casts off death with the aim of showing that he possesses mastery over life he extends it Any Bhikṣu who has well cultivated the four supernorrmnal powers  can live if he so desires a alpa or more The Vaibhāṣikas say Twelve are of two types Which twelve With the exception of the last eight and dissatisfaction With the exception of the vital organ which is always retribution and of the nine that will be mentioned below which are never retribution the remaining twelve are of two types sometimes retribu tio and sometimes nonretribution The seven material orgaṇs are not retribution to the extent that they arise from accumulation But we would say how can one affirm that dissatisfaction is never retribution In fact the Sūtra says There is an action liable to reṣult in satisfaction there is an action liable to result in dissatisfaction and there is an action liable to result in a sensation of equanimity Hence davrmanasyavedanīya action is action with which a sensation of dissatisfaction is associated It follows that a sarmanasyavedanīya action is an action with which the sensation of satisfaction is associated not an action liable to retribution in satisfaction and it folows that as a consequence the sensation of satisfaction is not retributio One could admit your interpretation of the Sūtra if there were no other issue that is if it had been rationally established that dissatisfaction is not retribution this is the case for satisfaction which wil consequently not be retribution If as you maintain dissatisfaction is retributio when a person has committed a serious transgression and then experiences with regard to it dissatisfaction and remorse  one could say that the transgression has already brought forth a ripened resultwhich is inadmissible But you admit that satisfaction is retribution and we would reason as you have just done when a person has accomplished a meritorious action and thereby experiences satisfaction then this action immedi ately brings forth a reṣult of retribution Persons detached from desire do not possess the ndriya of dissatisfaction now they possess the indriyas which are retṛbbution the organ of sceing etc hence the indriya of dissatisfaction is not retribution The fact is that persons so detached possess the ivriya of satisfaction which can be the nature of this ndriya whether it be retribution or not whereas dissatisfaction is never produced among them Hence the Vaibhāṣikas conclude the indriya of dissatisfaction is not retribution Eight indriyasthe five organs of sense consciousness the vital organ and the sexual organsare in a good rebiṛth the retribution of good action in a bad ṛebirth they are the retribution of bad action The sensations of pleasure of satisfaction and of equanimity are retribution for good actions The sensation of dislike is the retribution for a bad action To an androgyne in a good rebirth both organs are the retribution for good action but the quality of being an androgyne is obtained through bad action How many are without retribution Dissatisfaction always has retribution for on the one hand it is never neutral being the result of a concept  but on the other hand it is never pue never being produced in a state of absoption Ten are twofold The mental organ  and faith and its following  The mental organ the sensations of pleasure satisfaction and indifference have retribution when they are bad or goodimpure they are without retribution when they are neutral orpure Eight are good Eight faith etc the anājñāṭamājñasyāmīndāriya etc are only good Dissatisfaction is of two types Dissatisfaction is good or bad The mental organ and the sensationswith the excep tion of dissatisfactionare of three types The others of one type ksksk Among the twentytwo indriyas how many belong to each of the three spheres of existence Thus nineteen ndriyas excluding the last three are in the sphere of Kāmadhātu The sexual ogans and the two disagreeable sensations are absent from Rūpadhātut  Nevertheless the Sūtra says That a female being is Brahmā such does not happen that is impossible That a male being is Brahmāsuch happens that is possible The sensation of suffering is absent from Rūpadhātu because of the fluidity oṛ transparency of the body from whence there is absence of pain produced by hurt and because of the absence of bad actions liable to retribution from whence the absence of suffering arisen from retribution And all the material organs and the two agreeable sensations are absent from Arūpyadhātu How many through Meditation How many are notabandoṇed The mental organ the sensations of pleasure satisfaction and equanimity are of three types Dissatisfaction is abandoned through Seeing and through Nine aṛe abandoned through Meditation alone  Five are either abandoned through Meditation or are not abandoned  The five indriyas the first of which is faith are not soiled and hence are tot abandoned through Seeing being able to be pure they are able to be not the object of abandoning Three are not abandoed The last three are not aban doned because they are pure and dharmas without defects are not to be rejected l In the Kamas beings possess from their origins two indriyas that are from retribution The organ of touch and the vital organ With the exception of apparitional beings Why is not the mental organ and the sensation of equanimity counted herein How many do apparitional beihgs possess Some possess six  Or seven But can apparitional beings be bisexual In Rūpadhātu six Kāmadhātu is called the Kāmas because of the primary role that belongs in this sphere to the āmaguṇas or objects of desire Rūpadhātu is called the Rūpas because of the primary roḷle of the rāpas These calm deliverances beyond the rpas In Rūpadhātu beings from their origins possess six indriyas which are from retribution like apparitional beings without sex in Kāmadhātu Above one In this sphere of existence beings initially possess one indriya which is of retribution the vital organ Now how many ndriyas perish at death In rūpyadhātudying destroys the vital organ the metal organ and the sensation of indifference in Rūpadhātu it destroys eight indriyas In Rūpadhātu one must add the five organs of sense consciousness the organ of sight etc In fact apparitionai beings are born and die with all their organsn Kāmadhātu ten nine eight In Kāmadhātu death takes place either at one stroke or gradually O four when death is gradual In the second case four ndriyas die lastly and together the ogan of touch the vital organ the mental organ and the organ of indifference These four ndriyas die at the same time The preceding concerns the case where the mind of the dying person is soiled or notsoiledneutral In the case of a good death add all five riyas If ones mind is good one should in the three spheres of existence add the five moral feculties faith etc One obtains the two highest results through nine ndriyas The highest results are theresuilts of rotaāpanna and Arhat for these two results are the first and last The result of Srotaāpanna is obtained through nine indriyas it is through these two indriyas that one obtains the result of rotaāpaṇna for the first encourages the possession of disjunction from the defilements  the second supports and makes firm this possession The result of Arhat is obtained through nine ndriyas the mental organ either satisfaction pleasure or indifference the five moral faculties ñendriya and ājñātavīnāriya The two intermediary results through seven eight or nine In the fixst case he possesses seven indriyas The bhāyovūarāgawho is a Prthagjanaobtains the result of Sakrdāgāmin by means of nine idriyas The ānupārvaka obtains the result of Anāgāmin through seven or eight ndriyas according to whether he uses the worldly path or the Pure Path as the above ānuprvaka obtains the result of Sakrdāgārmin The vīarāga obtains the result of Anāgāmin through the com prehension of the truths through nine driyas as the above bhāyovī tarāga obtains the result of Sakrdīgāmin When he expels the defilements through the pure path that is through Meditation on the Truths one must add the āgñendriya as a ninth jnriya Through how many indriyas is the quality of Arhat obtained By eleven The āstra answers By eleven for it does not speak with reference to the acqnisition of the quality of Arhat but with respect to the person who acquires this quality It is said that the quality of Arhat is obtained through eleven ṝndriyas because a determined person can so obtain them But the three driyas never coexist The case is different It does not hold that the saint fallen from the result of Anāgāmin gains it again by means of the indriya of pleasure He who possesses the mental organ or the vital ogan or the organ of equanimity necessarily possesses three indriyas He who possesses these three orgaṅs may or may not possess the others A being born in rūpyadhatu does not possess the organs of seeing hearing smelling or taste A being born in rūpyadhātu does not posses the organ of touch A being born in rūpyadhātu or Rūpadhātu does not possess the female organ A being born in Kāmadhātu cannot possess it when he bad not acqnired it or when he has lost it A Prṛthagjana bo in the Fourth Dhyāna in the Second Dhyāna o in the rūpyas does ot possess the organ of pleasure A Prthagjana born in the Fourth Dhyana in the Third Dhyana or in the rūpyas does not possess the organ of satisfaction being born in Rūpadhātu or in rūpyadhātu does not possess the organ of displeasure A detached person does not possess the organ of dissatisfaction A person who has cut off the roots of good does not possess the five moral faculties faith etc Neither a Prṛthagjana nor a Saint in possession of a result possesses anājñātamājñāsyāmīndāriya The Pṛthagjana and the aikṣas do not possess ājñātavīndriya He who possesses the organ of pleasure or the organ of touch certainly possesses four organs He who possesses one of the organs of sense conscious ess necessaily possesses five ogans He who possesses the organ of sight also possesses the vital organ the mental organ the organ of indifference and the organ of touch The same for him who possesses the organ of hearing etc But one would ask what sort of organ of pleasure can a being possess who is born in the heaven of the Second Dhyāna and who does not therein cultivate the absorption of the Third Dhyāna i He possesses the organ of defiled pleasure of the Third Dhyāṇna d Whoever possesses the female organ etc necessarily possesses eight organs He who possesses a sexual organ necessarily possesses in addition to this organ seven ogans which have been specified in cd for this being evidently belongs to Kāmadhātu He who possesses the organ of dissatisfaction necessaly pos sesses in addition to this organ these same seven ogans He who possesses one of the moral faculties can be born in any of the three spheres of existence he necessarily ṇossesses the five moral faculties which are seen together plus the vital organ the mental organ and the organ of indifference He who possesses ājñendriya ot ājñatavīndriya becessarily possesses eleven ogans These are the vital organ the mental organ the organs of pleasure satisfaction and equanimity the five moral faculties and the eleventh which is either ājñendriya or ājñātavīndriya He who possesses ājñsyāmīndriya ṅeceṣsarily possesses thirteen ogans kskṣk What is the smallest number of organs it is possible for a being to possess A being who is lacking any good at all possesses a minimum of eight organs the organ of touch sensations the vital organ and the mental organ A being who is lacking good is one who has cut off the roots of good He possesses eight organs namely equanimity life the mental oga and the good orgas The good organs are the moral faculties faith etc He is not detached he can possess the moral faculties and he can possess all the organs of sense consciousness thus he necessarily lacks the pure organs The ryan not detached can possess all the organs The ryan who is not detached and hence a aikṣa and not an Arhat possesses at most nineteen ogans With the exception of a sexual organ and two pure organs In Kāmadhātu an atom into which there is no entry of sound and into which there is no entry of any organ is made up of eight substances By paramāṇu we do not understand here a paramāṇu in its proper sense a dravyaparamāṇu an atom or monad which is a thing a ṣsubstance  but a saghātaparamāṇu a molecule ie the most subtle among the aggregates of matter for there is nothing among the aggregates of matter which is more subtle In Kāmadhātu the molecule into which sound does not enter and into which no organ enters is made up of eight substances but of n less than eight namely the four primary elements  and the four derived elementsvisibles  odors tastes and tangibles When the organ of touch enters into it it is made up of nine substances  The molecule into which sound does not enter but into which the organ of touch enters admits of a ninth substance the dravya which is the organ of touch When any other organ enters into it it is made up of ten substances The molecule into which sound does not enter but into which all other organs other than the organ of touch enter consists of a tenth substance the dravya that is this other organ  in fact sound which is produced by the primary elements that form part of the organism does rot exist independently of the organs If the four primaty elements earth element etc are never disassociated but coexist in every aggregate or molecule how is it that in any given aggregate one perceives either solidity or viscosity or heat or movement and not these four substances or characteristics at one given time In the same way when one touches a pile of pieces of plants and needles one perceives the needles when oe eats some salted soup one perceives the taste of salt According to another opinion that of the Bhadanta rīlabha the aggregates ae made up of the four primary elements since given the action of certain causes solid things become liquid etc The fire element exists in water since this latter is more or less cold a fact which is explained by the presence of the element of fire in a more or less great quantity But we would say whether cold is more or less active does not imply that there has been a mixture of a certain substance  the cod with its opposite heat So too sound and sensation even though homogeneous vary in intensity According to another opinion the primary elements which are not perceived in a given aggregate exist in the state of potentiality and not in action and not in and of themselves Thus ṛthe Blessed One was able to say  There are many dhāus or mieral substaṅces in this piece of wood How does one prove the presence of colo in wind  This is an object of faith  and not of reasoning Or rather physical matter exists in the wind since one perceives smell by reason of the contact of the wind with an object possessing an odor now odor is never disassoci ated from physical matter We wil have six seven or eight substances and when sound intervenes seven eight or nine
