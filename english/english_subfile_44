Therefore I have said in the sutras that I made offerings to Sariputra and that Sariputra also made offerings to me But it was I not Sariputra who had gained more blessings Someone may say that the offenses that the recipient commits affect the giver This is not true And why is it not so It is to break On Miscellaneous Subjects suffering and not to cause him to commit offenses that the giver gives Therefore the giver should gain good results whereas the receiver who does wrong accepts the consequences which do not affect the giver If the giver gives pure things he gains pleasant features People like to see him his fame spreads he gains what he wishes and he will be born into a household of upper social standing These are not bad so how can it be said that the giver receives bad results After giving the giver becomes delighted without regret draws near to good people gains wealth and selfmastery is reborn in a noble family obtains worldly and heavenly happiness all the way up to unsurpassed happiness and is capable of severing all bonds of afflictions The giver gains wonderful rewards like these How can it be said that he receives bad results If the giver can give personally he will be reborn into a family of the upper class encounter beneficial friends have great wealth and abundant retinues which he can enjoy and give away and all sentient beings will like to see him After seeing him they respect and praise him The giver gains rewards like these How a can it be said that he receives bad results If the giver gives pure things because of this he will become rich be reborn in an upper class family have innumerable retinues and will be free from physical or mental suffering His wealth will not be taken away by the king robbers floods or fires Even if he were to lose his property he would never become sorrowful In innumerable lives he is peaceful and happy in body and mind Before giving he has faith  when giving he is delighted after giving he is happy He does not feel bitter when people come asking for gifts or when they keep and use the gifts He attains superior physical features if he gives clothes unsurpassed power if he gives food pure and wonderful eyes if he gives lamps happi ness if he gives carts and he gains what he needs if he gives houses The giver of such things gains such good rewards Furthermore the givers reward is determined after his offer ing to the Buddha is made no matter whether used Chapter XIX or not From gm n g to people and the Sangha two kinds of blessmgs are accrued from using the giftj and from receiving Aud why s tins When the giver gives he breaks his own stin ness and when the receiver makes use  he is breaking the giver s stinginess too Therefore it is said that through using  the blessing arises Furthermore through using people can make further use  and the Sangha can develop If one gives not for the sake o f seeking rewards but to avoid afflicins one can obtain tha unsurpassed pure result nirvana If a person resolves to make offerings of food to others before he himself takes the food but then goes against his own resolve he should make offerings to the Buddha Such giving is foremost d the person is called the foremost giver If a person gives according to the supplicants wish in innuf   WlU gt What he WisheS If his mind wealth and o essmg are all pure he attains immeasurable rewards If he provides food and clothes to his wife and servants with a joyful mind he attains immeasurable blessings in the future If when he sees rats and birds take grain from his barn he always feels compassion for them and realizing that they are able to live because o f him feels joyful and has no thought of harming them you should know that he will attain immeasurable blessings If he makes clothes and various kinds of ornaments for himself and feels happy about it and if he gives them away before using them b   o f  T g trr  in U ture     one can obtain good results without practicing giving Nor can it appen that there is giving without a gift without a recipient or with stinginess If one gives without being asked to gives when one is oneself m need gives more than asked for gives things of better quality than asked for has others ask him for things and gives personally you should know that one attains much wealth in u ore lives and even nonprecious things will become precious If one gives for the sake of having fun or gives without believing in the doctrine of cause and effect such kinds of giving On Miscellaneous Subjects are not real giving If one gives only to a good field of blessings and does not like to give frequently one will attain the result of not taking delight in giving in the future If a person has regrets after giving or robs others of things and gives them away although he might gain wealth in the future it will always be exhausted and not be accumulated If he gives away things gained through annoy ing his clan members although he might attain great rewards in the future he will often suffer from sickness If he does not support his parents annoys his wife and keeps servants in distress even if he gives he is still a bad person and his giving is false and cannot be called real giving Such givers have no compassion and no inclination to repay kindness and although they might attain wealth in the future they will always lose it will not be able to enjoy it and will constantly be in poor health If a person gives his wealth properly he attains immeasur able blessings and great wealth for his use in the future If he does not do it properly although he might still receive good results in the future he often has to depend on others If others are not available  he becomes poor A wise person perceives deeply that the pleasures enjoyed by a man a god or a universal king although subtle and wonderful are impermanent Therefore it should not be for worldly or heavenly pleasure that one gives Good son there are two kinds of giving the giving of wealth and the giving of the Dharma The giving of wealth is inferior whereas the giving of the Dharma is superior How does one practice the giving of the Dharma If a bhiksu bhiksunl upasaka or upasika teaches others to perfect faith morality and giving to listen and to perfect wisdom or if by employing paper and ink they have people copy or themselves copy the Buddhist scriptures and then give them to people to read this is called the giving of the Dharma To give the Dharma like this results in fine physical features in innumerable future lives And why is this Sentient beings who hear the Dharma eradicate their hateful thoughts Because of this the giver attains superior features in immeasurable future lives Sentient beings who hear the Dharma become compassionate and do not Chapter XIX in  become  ble  physical strength in infumerab  P      the Dharma get rid of lardty Because  b  Wh  happiness in innumerable future lives Sentie  glvr altains the Dharma eliminate ignorant t h o u g h t C u lT f M T  s because  this the giver gams unobstructed  beings who hear  D h a T Because of M s hgivet M d future lives a e same l f  lives And why is t  s

an animal o      t  f th Se it that only the hungry ghosts can attain  t t e b l   p B   hungry ghosts were formerly areedv l e bIessmsJ      P e m o u s h o a d d ih g e n fly c r e a t e m e r it o r io u s h ie s s in  t h l On Miscellaneous Subjects If one gives clothes food houses bedding or other necessities to sramanas Brahmans or poor beggars and chants prayers for them because of the power o f this giving hungry ghosts can attain great strength and receive whatever is offered to them And why is this Because of the state they are born into hungry ghosts eat different things Some eat pus some eat night soil and some eat blood spittle or saliva If someone makes offerings to them all become very delicious Even if one offers impure soup to hungry ghosts who are prevented from taking the food the giver will still attain blessings and virtue And why is this It is because the giver is compassionate Who is the bene ficiary if a sacrifice is offered If the sacrifice takes place near a forest the gods of the forest are the beneficiaries The same is true of houses rivers wells woods or mounds The person who offers the sacrifice can also attain blissful virtues And why is this It is because he makes the receiver of the sacrifice happy The virtue derived from offering a sacri fice protects the body and wealth of the doer If one says that blessings can be gained by the sacrificing of lives this is not true And why is this People do not grow a sandalwood tree by planting elapattra seeds likewise they do not gain blessings or virtues by taking the life of a sentient being One who wishes to offer a sacrifice should use incense flowers milk butter or medicine a There are three periods of time to create blessings for the deceased during the spring in the second month during the summer in the fifth month and during the autumn in the ninth month If a person gives away houses bedding medicine gardens wells cattle sheep elephants horses or other daily necessities the blessings and virtues from this giving always arise after his death no matter how long the gifts last The blessings follow him as a shadow follows an object And why is it not true Things do not lose their usefulness when their owner dies rather they are ruined as a result of being used day and night The worldly dharmas as well as worldtranscending dharmas are o be believed in If one often gives joyfully according to peoples likes and dislikes this is called the giving of all If one p v es away ones body and the things treasured by ones wife Z is cahed inconceivable giving vicious people S T o f f l t t r T T  f  the Unsrateftlin cause d effect forceful supplicants powerful people scolders hateful people deceitful hypocrites and wealthy noblemen Good son there are three fundamentals to all kinds of giving giving compassionately to the poor giving to foes without seeking rewards and giving joyfully and respectfully to the the T ta i  S   a r   Bh  WeaIthy perSon makes to the Three Measures for immmeasurable lives and thus gains immeasurable blessings it is not as good as exhorting others to cooperate in the practice o f givingl If one takes lightly ones few d inferior things and thus is too ashamed to give one increases ones poverty and suffering for future lives Ifpeople g J a w a y t t o u l  gi fleW  f  eSSingB and the thought o f giving are equal the results they attain will have no ference If the field of blessings rfe wsthe f bi  are and thought  of giving inferior but the gift is superior the result will be superior If the field of blessings and gift are inferior but the thought of giving is superior the result will also be superior I f both the field o j blessings and gift are superior but the thought of giving is inferior then the result will be inferior Why s this It is because he knows that a certain cause will definitely cause a certain result If a person has no compassion does not recognize others kindness does not desire sagely virtues Z a acheddeeply his that wealth bodK beings d lifeare ha will not give The wise perceive sentient On Miscellaneous Subjects ready to go to extreme lengths in order to seek wealth So if a man is wilhng to give away his wealth you should know that he will give his body and life too If he is stingy and will not give his wealth you should know that he will spare his body and life If he can give away his body and life and wealth you should know that he is a great giver If a person gains wealth but is stingy and would not give you should know that he plants the seed of poverty in future lives  b Therefore I said in a sutra that among the four continents the people of Jambudvipa are superior in three ways courage mindfulness and purity in conduct There are another three reasons fearing anothers reproach fearing suffering after the exhaustion of wealth and seeing others misfortunes after they have given There are two factors for drawing near benefi cial friends strong faith and wisdom There are two factors for not attaching oneself to wealth contemplating imperma nence and nonselfmastery Good son if the giver can contem plate and practice giving like this you should know that he can achieve the practice of the perfection of giving Therefore pre viously I said that there is giving that is not perfected there are that are not the perfection of giving there is perfected giving and there is giving that is neither giving nor perfected giving Chapter XIX Good son there are three kinds o f wisdom giving external things giving external and internal things  and  teaching sentient beings after giving external and internal things How does one teach  When one sees the poor one should first ask them Will you take refuge in the Three Treasures and take precepts If they say they will he first trans mits the Three Refuges and precepts and then gives them things hey say they cannot he should say to them If you cannot can you repeat after me All dharmas are impermanent nonself and Un the state of nirvana and tranquility If the answer is yes he s ould teach them and then give them things If they say that they can only understand two teachings but not the teaching of the dharmas being nonself he should say to them If you cannot undersfand that the dharmas are nonself can you understand that the dharmas are without selfnature If the answer is yes he  ouid teach them and then give them things If one can teLch others before he gives them material things one is called a great giver Good son if one can teach sentient beings regardless of their being fnends or foes one is called a great giver c Good son if a wise person is wealthy he should give like that If he is not wealthy he should teach other wealthy people to practice giving If other givers know the Dharma and do not need his teaching he should personally help them in the practice of giving If he is poor and has nothing to give he should recite curative mantras give inexpensive medicine to the needy sin cerely take care of the ill for recuperation and exhort the rich to provide various medicines whether in pill powder or tincture form If he happens to know medical remedies and can diagnose the problem he should provide treatment according to the diag nosis When he treats the patient he should know the skillful means Although he may have to cleanse impurities for patients he should not feel tired of it He should know when the condition of the patient worsens or becomes better which medicine or food worsens the condition of the patient and which medicine or food can eradicate the suffering of an illness If the patient asks for a medicine or food that will worsen his illness he should refuse and On Miscellaneous Subjects should skillfully persuade him otherwise For if he flatly refuses the patient may become very annoyed If he knows that the patient is dying he should not say so but instead teach him about the Three Treasures and have him take refuge in them He should also teach him to be mindful of the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha and how diligently to make offerings to them He tells the patient that suffering from a sickness is the result of previous unwholesome causes and that knowing that this is retribution he should repent Hearing this the patient might become angry or even scold him but he should keep silent and not forsake him Although he takes good care of him he should not expect payment After the recovery he should keep checking on him to prevent a relapse of the illness When he sees him become as healthy as before he should be happy and not demand compensation If the patient dies he should bury him and console and speak the Dharma to the patients family so as to relieve their pain If he gives food or medicine to a patient who is thus cured and happily gives gifts to him he may accept them but should then pass them on to the poor If one can take care of and treat the sick like this you should know that one is a great giver a true seeker of unsur passed enlightenment Good son when a wise person seeks enlightenment if he is i ia wealthy he should learn medicine He should build hospitals and provide the needed food and medicine for the sick If there are holes in a road he repairs them and broadens the road and cleans thorns dung and other filth from it At dangerous places he provides needed boards ladders or ropes In the wilderness he builds wells plants fruit trees and builds water channels In places where there are no trees he erects posts and builds sheds for animals He builds guest houses and supplies necessities such as washing basins lamps beds and bedding In places where there is dirty water he builds bridges He builds bridges over the rivers and provides rafts Those who cannot cross over he helps He personally helps the old the young and the weak to cross By the roadside he builds stupas and grows flowers and fruit trees Seeing animals who are in fear he helps and shelters Chapter XIX them and persuades hunters by providing them with material things and with kind words If he sees travelers traveling in a dangerous place he guides them away from it When he sees those who have lost their land or loved ones he properly consoles them with kind words He washes and massages the hands and feet of those who are tired from traveling and he provides them with beds If there is no bed he uses straw instead When it is hot he uses umbrellas and clothes to make shade When it is cold he provides heat and clothes to keep them warm He does all these things himself and teaches others to do likewise He teaches the merchants to make fair deals and not to deceive others for even a small profit When he sees travelers he tells them which route is safe and which is not The safe route is that which has abundant water and vegetation and has no thieves or robbers He tells them about the disasters on the unsafe route When he sees peoples shoes clothes or bowls worn out he mends washes or repairs them If there are rats snakes bees lice or poisonous insects he gets rid of them He provides people with ear picks he sews and washes goods for the Sangha and he provides clean water beans  clean ashes in the room and a toilet If he makes clothes or bowls he offers them to the Buddha before letting his parents teachers or monks use them When he makes offerings to the Buddha he offers flowers and incense Whatever food he has he offers to the sramanas and Brahmans first and he himself eats later Seeing people who come from afar he greets them kindly and provides water for taking a bath and ointment for their feet He also provides them with flowers willow branches cleaning beans ash oil fragrant water honey pippala and body oil After they have a bath he provides them with various flowers pills medicine powders foods and drinks as needed He also gives them razors filtering bags needles thread paper pens ink and so forth If it is not possible to provide all these daily they should be provided on ceremonial days Seeing the blind he helps by holding their hands or giving them canes and showing them the way Seeing those who suffer On Miscellaneous Subjects from having lost wealth or parents he gives them things consoles them with kind words and speaks of the Dharma and the two retributions of afflictions and blessings Good son if one can practice giving like this one is called a pure giver Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to be a pure giver but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XX On the Three Pure Refuges i ib Sujata said to the Buddha Previously the Buddha has said that one should teach supplicants to take the Three Refuges before one gives them things What are the Three Refuges Good son it is to eliminate suffering eradicate afflictions and attain unsurpassed blissful tranquility that one takes the Three Refuges Good son since you ask the Three Refuges refer to the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha The Buddha is the one who teaches the cause leading to the destruction of afflictions and the attainment of the correct way to liberation The Dharma is the teaching that destroys the cause of afflictions and to true liberation The Sangha are the ones who receive the teaching that destroys the cause of afflictions and who attain true liberation Some may say that if this is so there is only one refuge This is not right And why is this not true Whether the Tathagata appears in the world or not the true Dharma exists as always without any difference But when the Tathagata appears in the world he expounds the Dharma therefore one should separately take refuge in the Buddha Although the Dharma exists as always regardless of the Tathagata being in the world or not yet Buddhists will have no one to study with if the Sangha does not exist Therefore one should separately take refuge in the Sangha The true path of liberation is called the Dharma a selfenlightened one without a teacher is called a Buddha and the ones who can practice the Dharma are called the Sangha If there were not Three Refuges how could there be the four indestructible faiths There are the complete and the incomplete Three Refuges Good son all bhiksus bhiksunis upasakas and upasikas take the complete Three Refuges Good son just as the Buddha pratyekabuddhas and sravakas are different so are the Three Treasures How are they different They are different in terms o f aspiration adornment attainment of the way and in their natures So it is said that they are different Why is it said that the Buddha is the Dharma It is because the Buddha comprehends the Dharma Those who accept the exposi tion are called the Sangha If someone says that the Buddha is one member of the Sangha this is not right If the Buddha were one of the Sangha there would not be Three Treasures Three Refuges or four indestructible faiths Good son the Dharma of the bodhisattva is different from that of the Buddha loeic There are two kinds of bodhisattvas posthumous bodhisattvas and cultivating  To take refuge in the posthumous bodhisattva is to take refuge in the Dharma and to take refuge in cultivating is called taking refuge in the Sangha The Buddha is so called because he perceives the faults of all conditioned dharmas cultivates by himself and attains the sweetdew flavor  The Dharma refers to the whole undefiled unconditioned Dharmadhatu Those who keep the precepts and study and explain the twelve divisions of the scriptures are called the Sangha If someone asks how one takes refuge in the Buddha after the Tathagata enters nirvana this is how one does it Good son I have taught the Elder Trapusa the Asaiksa Dharma of the past Buddhas and to take refuge in the future Sangha  Likewise you can take refuge in the past Buddhas Because there are differences in the degree of blessings and rewards with respect to the Three Refuges they are categorized into three Whether the Buddha is in the world or has attained nirvana there is no difference in the rewards from making offerings to the Buddha When the Buddha is still in the world he establishes the rules for his disciples Even after the Buddha passes away the transgressors reap retributions just the same Likewise taking refuge with the past Buddhas For example when the Buddha is about to enter nirvana all men and gods make many offerings for nirvana At that moment the Tathagata has not yet entered nirvana He is still in the world and already accepts offerings for the future  The same is true of taking refuge in past Buddhas Take another example When ones parents are far away one commits offenses if one angrily scolds them in their absence and one attains blessings if one feels respectful and praises them The same is true with taking refuge in the past Buddhas There fore I say that the giver who makes offerings to me whether I am still in the world or after I have entered nirvana attains equal blessings without a difference Good son a man or a woman who can repeat the Three Refuges three times is called an upasaka or upasika Although all Buddhas take refuge in the Dharma the Dharma is revealed through their preaching Therefore one should first take refuge in the Buddha be earnestly mindful of the Buddha with pure physi cal action speech and mind With the recollection of the Buddha one can keep fear away and avoid suffering and affliction There fore one should first take refuge in the Buddha The wise should deeply perceive that the wisdom and liberation of the Buddha are the most supreme The Buddha can expound liberation and its cause gain unsurpassed tranquility and transcend the samsaric sea of suffering His manner is awesome His three actions of body speech and mind are peaceful The wise should deeply perceive samsara as an accumulation of great suffering that can only be cut off by the unsurpassed way Samsara is full of desires and hunger and can only be fulfilled by the unsurpassed sweetdew flavor of the Dharma Samsara is full of fear and disasters that can only be eradicated by the unsurpassed true Dharma Because of this one should take refuge in the Dharma The wise should deeply perceive that the followers of the heretics are shameless and remorseless and do not abide in the Dharma Although they also practice the way they choose the wrong path Although they seek liberation they cannot find its true essence and although they attain some worldly wholesome dharmas they stingily keep them to themselves and do not teach others Those of the Buddhist Sangha are serene and compassionate They have little desire are content and abide in the Dharma They cultivate the proper way and attain true liberation after attaining it they teach it to others Therefore one should next take refuge in the Sangha If a person pays reverence to the Three Treasures greets them or bids farewell to them with respect and praise and abides in the Dharma without doubt he is making offerings to the Three Treasures If he can take refuge in the Three Treasures although he might not take precepts he can cut off all evil and practice all good Although he may be still a layman he abides in the Dharma and can be called an upasaka Some may say that one cannot take precepts without first taking refuge in the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha Why is it not so After I say Come bhiksu even though there may be one who has not taken refuge in the Three Treasures he is replete with precepts Some people may say that if one does not take the complete precepts one cannot gain the essence of the precepts and that this applies to the eight precepts This is not a correct interpretation And why is this not so If one cannot receive precepts unless one takes them completely how can a preceptseeking upasaka receive pre cepts Actually he attains the precepts although he does not attain all eight precepts Although the incomplete precepts cannot be called fasting precepts they are still wholesome Good son if one can purify the actions of body speech and mind and take the upasaka precepts this is called the five On the Three Pure Refuges aggrcgfltes What are they They are not to accept deviant views not to speak of deviant views to accept correct views to speak of correct views and to cultivate the true Dharma These are called the five aggregates After taking refuge in the Three Treasures one loses them if one creates actions of stupidity accepts heretical teachings or follows the words of Isvaradeva If one is honest generous often cultivates remorseful thoughts and has little desire and is content one can quickly attain a tranquil body He who creates various miscellaneous karma practices wholesomeness for the sake of pleasure such as engaging in business but has no compassion for sentient beings cannot take refuge with the Three Treasures If one offers sacrifices to the gods for the reason of protecting ones home body and life one does not lose the refuge of the Three Treasures But if one sincerely believes that the heretics can save all from fear and worships them one loses the Three Refuges If one has heard that the gods have merits derived from seeing the Buddha and thus respects them one does not lose the refuges Likewise if one pays reverence to Isvaradeva as one does to kings noblemen elders and virtuous ones he will not lose b the refuges Although one may have respect for what teaches one should be careful not to accept it When making offerings to the gods one should arouse compassionate thoughts for it is for the purpose of protecting peoples bodies lives property and lands and freeing them from fear that one pays respects to the gods Why is it not proper to accept the incorrect teaching of the gods The wise should know that the heretics claim that all things are created by Isvaradeva If it is so why should one create good karma Others have even said that killing oneself by jumping into a river or a fire or fasting will end ones suffering Actually this being the cause of suffering how can it keep one away from suffering All sentient beings create either good or bad karma from which they themselves reap the result The wise clearly know the effect of karma How can it be that Isvaradeva decides the time and place If one s happiness and Chapter XX suffering depend on time and place then why is it that among many people in the world at the same time and place some suffer all hardships whereas others enjoy happiness Another discrepancy is that some are born as men and others as women There are gods and asuras who are bom at the same time and place but some gods are better off than some asuras and vice versa Also there are kings who are born at the same time and place and rule  but some kings lose their countries whereas some rule and keep their countries well The heretics also teach people to cultivate good so as to eradicate bad karma when a bad year or a bad star appears If it is time and place  how can the cultivation of good eliminate  Therefore how can the wise accept the erroneous views of the heretics Good son all sentient beings reap what they sow If one follows correct views one enjoys peace and happiness if one cultivates deviant views one suffers from afflictions He who cultivates good karma attains selfmastery and after he attains selfmastery people like to draw near him He explains to them the causal condition of good karma from which selfmastery is achieved All sentient beings attain peace and happiness through the cultivation of good not because they are born at a particular time and place Good son Ajatasatru and Devadatta fell into hell because of their bad karma not because of time or place Udraka Ramaputra will fall into hell because of his deviant views c Good son aspiration is the foundation of all good dharmas Because of aspiration one attains perfect enlightenment and the fruit of liberation one renounces home life breaks fundamental bad karma and the karma leading to cyclic existence takes precepts draws near to the Buddhas gives all to supplicants definitely eradicates bad retribution destroys great offenses attains definite concentration keeps away from the three obstructions and skillfully practices the way that destroys afflictions Because o f aspiration one takes refuge in the Three Treasures and after taking the Three Refuges one can take pre cepts After taking precepts one practices the stages of perceiving On the Three Pure Refuges and cultivating the way and surpasses the sravakas Even one who takes refuge in the Buddha out of fear of lions tigers wolves or other ferocious beasts can attain liberation how much more so those who bring forth the aspiration to transcend the world And why was this Because one has to take refuge with ones own words Although it is not complete one receives protection just the same Good son the heretics claim that all things are created by Isvaradeva and that illusion will appear in the world hundreds of kalpas in the future The illusion refers to the Buddha If Isvaradeva can create a Buddha why is it then that the Buddha is able to refute his teachings And if Isvaradeva cannot create a Buddha how can it be said that he created all The heretics also claim that Mahabrahma Mahesvara and Visnu are one but the places they were born are different Isvara is so called because he is eternal autonomous and substantial He is  also called Rudra and Siva He has different names and he has sought for liberation and gained liberation but what the heretics claim is not true And why is this not true If Isvaradeva could create sentient beings and other forms of existence he would create good and bad karma and their effects and he would also create greed hatred and stupidity to bind sentient beings Also they claim that after sentient beings are liberated they merge into his body therefore liberation is impermanent This is not true And why is it not true If it is impermanent how can it be called liberation For example the son of a Brahman has a life span there fore he cannot be called Isvara The three gods Mahabrahma Mahesvara and Visnu cannot be one And why is this It is because the Isana people are to be liberated by Visnu and Mahabrahma Therefore they are not one If liberation is impermanent it is an illusion The Buddha is not an illusion If one clearly and correctly perceives the true self this is called liberation Also the heretics say that perceiving the particles of dust is called liberation Also they say that perceiving the differences of nature and differences Chapter XX  a o f self is called liberation This is not true And why is it not true If one cultivates the way and perceives the Four Noble Truths one perceives nature and the self He who takes the Three Refuges can truly see the Four Noble Truths The Three Refuges are the foundations of immeasurably good dharmas all the way up to unsurpassed perfect enlightenment There are two kinds of bodhisattvas lay and ordained It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to take the Three Refuges purely but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XXI On the Eight Precepts Sujata said Worldhonored One what result does one get if one takes the Three Refuges and the eight precepts Good son you should know that he who takes the Three Refuges attains inexhaustible blessings Good son there is a treasure o f seven jewels called Pingala in the kingdom of Kalinga Even if all men and women young and old of that kingdom moved the treasure with carts elephants horses and mules for seven years seven months and seven days they could not move it all One who sincerely takes the Three Refuges and the eight precepts gains merits superior to that treasure Good son there is a treasure of seven jewels called Panraka in the kingdom of Videha Even if all the men and women young and old of that kingdom moved the treasure with carts elephants horses and mules for seven years seven months and seven days they could not move it all One who sincerely takes the Three Refuges and the eight precepts gains merits superior to that treasure Even if all the men and women young and old of that kingdom moved the treasure with carts elephants horses and mules for seven years seven months and seven days they could not move all of it One who sincerely takes the Three Refuges and the eight precepts gains merits superior to that treasure Good son there is a treasure of seven jewels called Elapatra in the kingdom of Gandhara Even if all the men and women young and old of that kingdom moved the treasure with carts elephants horses and mules for seven years seven months and seven days they could not move it all One who Chapter XXI sincerely takes the Three Refuges and the eight precepts gains merits superior to that treasure b Good son one who takes the Three Refuges and eight pre cepts three times from others can be called a full upasaka of one day and night At dawn he loses  Therefore one should not take the Three Refuges and the eight precepts from a Buddha statue but from a person of purity After taking the precepts one is purified in adornment contemplation mindfulness and retribution This is called the Three Refuges and eight pure fasting precepts Good son taking the eight precepts and refuges with a pure heart eliminates the five deadly offenses and destroys all other offenses Two people cannot take these precepts at the same time And why is this so If two people take the precepts at the same time what happens if one keeps them while the other violates them Because of the power of the precepts one will not commit crimes in future lives and if one does commit transgressions still the precepts can never be lost Suppose a man sends for or instructs another to kill someone but the hired assassin does not show up and before the murder is committed this man changes his mind and takes the precepts Then when he is taking the precepts the hired assassin comes and commits the murder Although the kill ing occurs after he has taken the precepts he is not in violation of the precept against killing Such is the power of the precepts If people in high positions who have often ordered others to do evil wish to take the fasting precepts they should first reveal and repent of their former wrongdoings Then the precepttaking should be performed If they take the fasting precepts without repentance it cannot be called fasting The person who wants to fast should specify where he wants to fast and during the period of the fast he must not kill or commit any offenses These are the eight precepts He who takes them with a pure heart and adheres to them as specified will attain immeasurable rewards all the way up to unsurpassed bliss To fast for one hundred years during Maitreyas time is not as good as fasting for one day and night when I am in the world And On the Eight Precepts why is this During my time sentient beings are in the five turbidities  Therefore I said to Mrgaramatr Good woman if the sdla tree can take the eight precepts it can attain mundane and heavenly bliss all the way up to unsurpassed bliss Good son the eight precepts are the orna ment that adorns unsurpassed enlightenment These precepts are easy to keep and they accrue immeasurable merits Not to prac tice what is easy to practice is being lax Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to teach sentient beings to purify the eight precepts but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why He who has sincere and indestructible faith draws near the Three Treasures and accepts the teaching of beneficial friends can take the Three Refuges The same is true of taking the updsaka precepts Anyone who can contemplate the updsaka precepts in the following ways can take the Three Refuges and the eight precepts and can avoid evil and unwholesome karma He perceives that the updsaka precepts accrue immeasurable merits and destroy innumerable bad dharmas and sufferings of sentient beings It is difficult to be reborn as a human Even if one is reborn as a human it is difficult to have defectless sense organs Even if one has defectless sense organs it is difficult to arouse faith Even if one has faith it is difficult to have beneficial friends Even if one has beneficial friends it is difficult to attain selfmastery Because of this the unwholesome actions of the body speech and mind are the causes of ones retribution Even if the three unwholesome karmas did not result in bad retribution one should not do evil in the present for the three unwholesome karmas result in bad physical features in the present life and cause remorse at the time of death The precepts taken without having taken the Three Refuges first are called worldly precepts which are not firm they are like a color that is not fixed with glue Therefore one should take refuge in the Three Treasures before taking precepts specifically the updsaka precepts or the eight precepts whether they are taken for a lifetime or for a day and night Worldly precepts cannot destroy previous unwholesome karma The Three Refuges and precepts can Even if one commits many great offenses the precepts are not lost And why is this It is because the power of the precepts is strong If two people commit an offense together and one has taken precepts and the other has not the formers offense is heavier and the latters offense is lighter And why is this There are two kinds of transgressions transgressions against a natural law and transgressions against a conven tional law These two kinds of transgressions in turn are sub divided into two categories major and minor Some people create great transgressions by light  whereas others commit light transgressions by serious  For example Ahgulimala took the worldly precepts whereas Elapattranaga took Buddhist precepts Although Ahgulimala transgressed a natural law he did not commit a serious offense Elapattranaga transgressed a con ventional law but committed a serious offense So some people by lght create great offenses whereas some by serious create light offenses Therefore it cannot be said that when the precepts are the same the retributions from violating them are the same The worldly precepts are those against killing and stealing The Buddhist precepts also include these but in addition ban taking intoxicants The worldly precepts are essen tially impure After taking them one is not purified and like wise adornment contemplation mindfulness and retribution are also not purified These are not ultimate precepts but just worldly precepts Consequently one should take true preceptsOn the Five Precepts b Good son if one person takes precepts in the future age when people will be eight feet tall and have a life span of eightyfour thousand years and if another takes precepts in this present turbid world the results they gain will be the same And why is this It is because the three roots of virtue are the same It is said that precepts only apply to those whose lives can be taken ie sentient beings And why is it not true Just as sentient beings and nonsentient beings are immeasurable so are the consequences of the precepts pertaining to them Good son among various kinds of giving the giving of fear lessness is foremost Therefore I say that the five great kinds of giving are the five precepts that keep sentient beings away from the five kinds of fear These five kinds of giving are easy to practice for not only do they free one from obstructions but they do not cost anything furthermore they reward those who practice them with immeasurable blessings and virtues Without practicing the five kinds of giving one cannot attain the fruition of a streamenterer all the way up to unsurpassed complete enlightenment Good son you should know that he who takes the precepts is respected and protected by men and gods He gains a good name and although he might encounter evil he is not annoyed Sentient beings like to draw near and follow him Although the son of the elder Anathapindika took precepts for the sake of eight thousand pieces of money he attained immeasurably virtuous rewards Good son one even gains benefit from taking precepts for wealth Good son there are five wholesome dharmas that surround the precepts and often make them increase like the water of the river Ganges What are the five They are He who can relinquish mistaken views and has a mind unclouded by doubts is replete with proper mindfulness pure adornment essential purity and contemplation free from evil Good son he who avoids the five kinds of bad conduct can be said to have taken precepts for he is free from all unwholesomeness If Chapter XXII someone says that it is possible to transcend samsara without the five precepts it is not true Good son anyone who wishes to cross over the sea of samsara should sincerely keep the five precepts four o f the five precepts become precepts of nonaction in future lives However it is difficult to accomplish for it is difficult to sever desire Therefore one should be careful not to get caught up in lustful desire and become lax When there are so many other serious offenses some may ask why the Buddhas of the past did not make precepts concerning them but only the precept against e use of intoxicants Good son taking intoxicants can result in destroying our sense of shame and fear of the three evil realms As a result one cannot keep the other four precepts Therefore the Buddhas m the past set up the precept against taking intoxi cants Some people may ask that since the Buddha has spoken of the ill effects of drinking in excess why did he not list it as the first of the five precepts Such a question is incorrect And why is this The precept against taking intoxicants is called a conventional precept not a natural precept The Tathagata set up the natural precepts first and then the conventional ones Good son following the heretics the Tathagata set three fasting days during the bright period and the dark period of the moon The heretics always offer sacrifice to the gods on these days erefore the Tathagata also set three fasting days Good son just as the window screen does not fall because of its rope neither does the system of the three fasting days Sentient beings who resolve to adhere to these fasting days will never fall into the three evil realms Good son when one practices giving makes offerings to e Three Treasures meditates cultivates good deeds reads sutras and makes offerings to ones parents one should first make this resolution If I do not exhort myself to practice I will punish myself This person will increase his blessings and virtues day and night like the water of the river Ganges If one On the Five Precepts takes and keeps the complete five precepts you should know that one attains these five kinds of fruition If an updsaka can often go to a monastery draw near to the bhiksus ask for instruction on the Dharma listen carefully to it receive and uphold it remember and distinguish its meaning and in turn teach it to others then he will be benefitting himself and others If an updsaka does not study in this way but slights bhiksus finds fault with them has no respect when listening to c their preaching honors and serves the heretics and acknowledges their virtues or believes in the astrology of the sun the moon the five planets and the various constellations he is not firmly abid ing in the Dharma Although one may be reborn as a human it is hard to have defectless sense organs and although one may have defectless sense organs it is hard to have right views Although one may have right views it is hard to have faith Although one may have Chapter XXII faith it is hard to encounter beneficial friends Although one may meet beneficial friends it is hard to hear the true Dharma Although one may hear the true Dharma it is hard to follow it He who contemplates these is truly called a human If one perceives the impermanence of the realms from the desire realm to the realm where there is neither thinking nor nonthinking one will not seek to be born in the three evil realms all the way up to the realm where there is neither thinking nor nonthinking After this contemplation one will perceive the three kinds of impermanence To change the impermanent body into a lasting body one should pay respect make offerings greet bid farewell and present gifts to the virtuous and serve them per sonally This is how one changes the impermanent body into a lasting body To change impermanent wealth into lasting wealth one should give away ones own food to the sick and to travelers and make offerings to sramanas Brahmans the poor the desti tute and so forth This is how one changes impermanent wealth into lasting wealth To change the impermanent life into a lasting life one should cultivate kindness compassion joy equanimity and the six kinds of mindfulness One should also realize the Four Noble Truths and perceive birth old age sickness and death One should also believe in retribution from good and bad karma and realize that one must eventually be separated from loved ones One should also realize that all sentient beings are not free that the power of samsara is enormous before the realization of the holy a path and that all worldly pleasure is always mixed with suffering One cultivates endurance and giving in order to benefit sentient beings and deeply contemplates that the nature of suffering and the nature o f happiness are the same On the Five Precepts Good son a person who being a human being has great wealth and selfmastery should make offerings to his parents teachers monks elders and Dharmapractitioners he should also provide whatever travelers need when they are sick He speaks gently and has a sense of humility He neither believes in nor onesidedly respects only one virtuous person When seeing those who are virtuous in a sagely way who keep the precepts and who have heard the Dharma he makes offerings to them with lodging food bedding clothes and medicine He believes that there are virtuous ones in the Sangha who cultivate the way attain the fruition of a streamenterer all the way up to the fruition of an arhat and cultivate the thunderbolt samadhi and the lightning samadhi After contemplating in this way he gives equally and attains immeas urable blessings Therefore in the Mrgaraputrasutra I told Mrgaramatr that the blessings derived from making offerings to the Buddha and the five hundred arhats were not as much as the blessings gained from making offerings to the Sangha Even to make offerings to a seemingly vicious bhiksu results in immeasur able blessings And why is this Although this bhiksu may be bad does not keep precepts has no learning or does not cultivate wholesome dharmas he teaches that there are causes and effects leading to the three kinds of enlightenment he does not slander the Treasures of the Buddha the Dharma or the Sangha but upholds the unsurpassed banner of the Tathagatas Dharma and has the correct view without mistake To make offerings to the Sangha is to make offerings to the two Treasures of the Buddha and the Dharma To contemplate the subtle merits of the BuddhaDharma is to make offerings com pletely to the Three Treasures He who does not seek reward from giving is making offerings to supreme enlightenment perfecting the practice of giving and cultivating the way of enlightenment He is able to gain immeasurable merit in the future and to benefit himself and others He can cultivate kindness and compassion by forsaking his own happiness in order to eradicate the suffering of others He is neither worried nor regretful that he has not yet attained enlightenment Although he hears that it is hard and Chapter XXII takes a long time to become enlightened he does not backslide Although he suffers for immeasurable lives for the sake of sentient beings he does not become weary Taking delight in the practice of the Dharma he does not seek worldly pleasure but likes to stay in quiet places and to leave the home life to practice the way Even if b he cannot leave the home life and remains a householder as a person seeking liberation he does not do evil He can attain three kinds of precepts the precept of precepts the precept of medita tion and the precept of nondefilement Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to practice according to the Dharma but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XXIII On the Perfection of Precepts Sujata said Worldhonored One how does a bodhisattva who aspires for enlightenment fortify his mind Good son the bodhisattva fortifies his mind through four means If a bodhisattva perfects these four dharmas he is aspiring for enlightenment and his mind is fortified After the bodhisattva perfects these four dharmas he realizes that the foundation of the way of enlightenment is a precept called the initial ground the guiding ground the even ground the equal ground the ground of kindness the ground of compassion the trace of the Buddha the root of all virtues and the field of blessings Therefore the wise never violate the precepts but adhere to them fervently Furthermore they understand that there are two rewards for precepts the bliss of heaven and the bliss of enlightenment The wise should seek the bliss of enlightenment not the bliss of heaven After taking precepts if one violates them in action or thought is lazy sleeps too much contemplates incorrectly engages in an inappropriate livelihood or makes bad vows one is staining the precepts After taking precepts if one feels regretful seeks mun dane and heavenly pleasures is lax or is without compassion one is staining the precepts If out of fear of poverty of losing wealth or of becoming a servant after taking the precepts one is driven to doubt them in order to save ones body and life to gain benefit or to satisfy desire one is staining the precepts Chapter XXIII ioc Good son if a person acts in the following ways he purifies the precepts he does not like to stay long in samsara sees its faults perceives no difference between the pleasures of men and gods and the suffering of the Avici hell extends compassion for sentient beings and holds correct thoughts He keeps the precepts without laxity for the sake of benefitting innumerable sentient beings perfects the supreme way of enlightenment and practices in accordance with the Dharma He concentrates on whatever he is doing and does not become lax After he has done it he does not become lax Even if he is not aware beforehand that he commits offenses he feels responsible for the offense Any loss of mindfulness temporary arising of afflictions or even becoming a little lax is a transgression of the precepts He always considers even small offenses as serious and feels remorse shame fear and sorrow as a result of committing them He then repents sincerely and as a result of repenting feels joyful and determines that he will not violate the precepts again It means that one recognizes what is unwholesome and understands that one receives retribution from creating bad karma and reward from good karma and that the bad karma is not annihilated for it definitely results in bad retribution If these two kinds of karma are not annihilated how can one deceive oneself Hence after taking the precepts one should not violate the precepts but adhere to them fervently This is what is meant by for the reason of oneself What does for the reason of others mean A wise person knows that some people in the world have obtained pure divine ears and eyes and the power to read the minds of others so that if he does evil they will hear and know it And if they know how can he On the Perfection of Precepts shamelessly do evil Furthermore aware that gods have immeasurable blessings supernatural power to appear in any place divine ears and eyes and the power of reading the minds of others so that they can hear and see from afar Even though the gods are near people people cannot see them So if he does evil the gods will certainly know And if they clearly see him  how can he shamelessly commit offenses A wise person sees that the Dharma of the Tathagata is pure and undefiled results in present benefits causes tranquility transports people to the other shore and liberates them regardless of time For the reason of the Dharma I should take precepts If I cannot first take the minor precepts how can I take the major ones Breaking the minor precepts increases suffering m the five cycles of existence whereas sincerely keeping them increases unsurpassed bliss I never received the precepts from the immeas urable Buddhas in the past so that I never realized liberation when I underwent transmigration Now that I have taken the precepts I shall definitely encounter Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the future Upon making such a deep contemplation I arouse great compassion and sincerely take pre cepts and after taking the precepts I should continue on the path of the unsurpassed complete enlightenment so as to benefit a innumerable sentient beings Good son whether a person is lay or ordained whether he takes the Three Refuges the eight precepts or the five precepts whether the precepts are perfected or not whether they are observed for one day one night one hour one instant of thought or one lifetime if he sincerely keeps the precepts he obtains great blessings and virtue Good son after taking precepts if he culti vates the three good karmas hears much of the Dharma practices giving meditation and wholesomeness and makes offerings to the Three Treasures he is adorning enlightenment After taking the precepts if he reads the twelve divisions of the Buddhist scriptures he becomes the storehouse of the unsurpassed great Chapter XXIII Dharma If he diligently and vigorously endeavors to adhere to the precepts the precepts are perfected and are called precepts of nonaction This is so even if he does not take them again in a future life Good son there are imperfect precepts there are perfections other than precepts there are perfected precepts and there are practices that are neither perfected nor precepts The unperfected precepts refer to those practiced by the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas The perfections other than that of precepts are the perfection of giving  The following example demon strates the practice of the perfected precepts Godamya a bodhisattva in a previous life did not stir when worms beasts and ants devoured his body neither did he harbor any resentment toward them A second example is that of a sage who also was a reborn bodhisattva He did not move for twelve years for the sake of sentient beings lest he should disturb the sparrows sitting on his head Good son when a bodhisattva mahasattva abides in the per fection of precepts who can tell what suffering he undergoes for the sake of sentient beings After taking some minor precepts if a man is satisfied and has little desire  and lacks compassion for suffering sentient beings he cannot perfect the practice of the precepts If he can practice endurance medita tion wisdom and vigor and take delight in hearing much of the Dharma he can increase the perfection of precepts and can adorn and realize the fruition of enlightenment Because such precepts are full of immeasurable good immeasurable rewards and immeas urable disciplines they adorn enlightenment Good son after the bodhisattva mahasattva takes precepts he neither speaks evil nor likes to hear it Likewise he does not like to speak about or hear of worldly affairs He never becomes caught up in bad contem plations nor does he stay close to bad friends Therefore these are called the serene and pure precepts If a bodhisattva sees precepttransgressors he does not feel disgusted with them Instead he adopts various skillful means to On the Perfection of Precepts discipline them And if they cannot be disciplined he feels compas sionate toward them He never breaks or forsakes the precepts save his own body and life After he takes food he has thoughts o shame and nonlaxity for it is to keep alive b if to cure a bad sore If he goes into a city it is like going  forest with a sword He regulates his sense organs summons proper mindfulness considers what is appropriate and inappro priate action and does not become lax Pp le cr e a te both blessings and offenses because of me Therefore  s W d n o t be delighted when receiving great offerings nor be hatef h the misfortune of suffering occurs When I receive a small offen g I should reflect that this is because I have only a little practice of faith of the precepts of giving of hearing the Dharma and practicing wisdom ave o w i t for a long time or even if I am reproached before receiving an offering I should blame myself it is notth efau of otheri but due to my own past offenses Therefore I should no become annoyed If after taking precepts I create offenses again others I should say to myself that this is not in accord with the way And why is this It is because the twelve divisions the Buddhist scriptures do not teach that wrongdoing enlightenment Consequently I undergo various retributions one can make reflections like this one can achieve the perfection  f PZ L n  if a person can regulate his sense organs in the four actions of his b od  Cie walking standing down then he does not commit offenses can endure offering and does not engage in an improper way of obtammg a living In this way he can achieve the perfection of precepts If he sees both m j r and minor precepts as being important does no vi minor precept in difficult times does not allow afflictions to defile his mind and cultivates endurance you should know that he can achieve the perfection of precepts If he avoids associating with Chapter XXIII bad friends helps sentient beings to stay away from deviant views recognises others kindness and repays their favors yon should know that he can achieve the perfection of precepts If he does not care for his own body and life in order to do good forsakes his own work in favor of helping others achieve their work and does not give  s e to vicious thoughts when scolded you should know Urat he can achieve the perfection of precepts He insists on keeping the precepts that have been exempted by p it  t h f f  t Care r  S  Wn b dy and life in  rder  I protect the lives o f sentient beings and does not violate even a minor precept in his whole life Although he may obtain the seven most precious things he is not attached to them and treats others with kindness out o f compassion rather than for reward After taking the precepts he wishes to see all sentient beings obtain the pure precepts You should know that such a person can achieve the perfection of precepts c lay and ordamed It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to hieve the perfection of precepts but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XXIV On Karma Sujata said Worldhonored One before all the Buddhas and Tathagatas appear in the world what does the bodhisattva mahasattva take as his precepts Good son before a Buddha appears in the world there are no Three Refuges There are only the ten virtues which the wise cultivate to seek the way of enlightenment Only the Buddhas can expound the ten virtues The Buddhas of the past have expounded and transmitted them down to today The Dharma of the ten virtues has never been lost and the wise accept and protect it Good son sentient beings in the past did not draw near to or seek instruction from the Buddhas consequently they are unable to accept or practice in accordance with the ten virtues Good son all sentient beings have random thoughts Because of their random thoughts they have various afflictions and because of various afflictions they create various karmas Because of the causal conditions of mixed karma they undergo various cyclic existences and from the various existences they take different forms of life Good son sentient beings take different forms of life and see miscellaneous things Seeing miscellaneous things they give rise to bad thoughts which are called ignorance From the seeking mind ignorance arises this is called craving Action done as a result of craving is called karma The wise realize that bondage is caused by internal afflictions and external causal conditions The cultivation of the ten virtues can undo the bondage Therefore just after the Tathagata attained unsurpassed complete enlightenment he expounded the doctrine of the ten virtues Because of the ten virtues one can see Chapter XXIV the differences between good behavior and bad behavior in the world good existence and bad existence up to liberation Hence sentient beings should sincerely discern and comprehend the way of the ten virtues It is because of the practice of the ten virtues by sentient emgs that the palace of the asuras the great earth the moun tains the abodes of hungry ghosts the animals the hell beings and the Four Heavenly Kings up to the Paranirmitavasavartin gods are supported by the wind the clouds and the great waters It is because of the practice of the ten virtues that the Wheel turning kings possess the four wheels of gold silver copper and iron and that seven groups of Buddhists take precepts and seek enlightenment It is also because of the ten virtues that the external and internal property and lives of sentient beings increase or decrease Therefore the wise should cultivate the ten virtues completely Just as in youth in the prime of ones life and m old age and in the seasons of spring summer autumn and winter people have different kinds of afflictions so the afflictions arising during the small medium and great kalpas are all difa ferent When sentient beings initially practice the ten virtues they obtain immeasurable lives form smell and taste but because of greed hatred and stupidity they are all lost Because of the ten nonvirtues the seasons the yearly cycles the stars the sun the moon and the four elements change If a person realizes the effect of practicing the ten virtues you should know that he can attain Because of suffering sentient beings bring forth faith i h faith they can distinguish good from evil And after knowing good and evil they cultivate the ten virtues They are called the ten paths because they comprise ten categories With regard to speech there are four coarse language lying deceptive language and meaningless language With regard to the mind there are three nonvirtuous actionsjealousy anger and deviance These ten nonvirtuous actions are the root of all offenses of sentient beings Just as there are different On Karma kinds of sentient beings different realms existences lives forms destinies and names so there are immeasurable nonvirtuous actions other than the ten mentioned Among the ten three can be called karma but not the way and the seven physical and verbal actions can be called karma and the way making ten in all Irrespective of whether the ten karmas are created by oneself by others or by both they will result in good or bad retribution They are the causes of the good and evil of sentient beings Therefore the wise should not even think  let alone actually do them By not keeping ones karmic afflictions and defilements in check one creates the ten nonvirtuous actions In contrast if one destroys afflictive defilements one keeps afflictive defilements under control and in so doing practices the ten virtues If a person at the beginning employs skillful means or unintentionally does something wrong this is not an offense The wise should diligently cultivate the ten virtues as well as the Four Noble Truths The action done with bad intentions is con sidered nonvirtuous Therefore the wise should practice the ten virtues When sentient beings practice the ten virtues they increase their life span and internal and external wealth Afflictions cause the ten nonvirtuous actions to increase Without the cause of afflictions the ten virtues increase Good son there are three aspects to each of the ten karmas root means and completion If a person takes something as someone or a living being and kills it with doubt whether he carries out the killing personally or orders others to do it this action is called the root  To sharpen the knife apply poison or attach a rope that is used to kill is called the means of killing The completion means that after having killed  one holds or weighs it eats it alone or with others gives it away casually or gladly eats it without shame or regret praises oneself or becomes very arrogant Breaking down walls using a ladder to break into another s house or looking  even if ones hands only touch them is called the means of stealing To send someone  to go to her personally to send mail to her to touch her or to make sexual remarks these are all the means  If after consummating the act one gives her jewelry shamelessly and unregretfully enjoys meals with her praises oneself or becomes very arrogant this is the completion  If in front of others one hides ones original characteristics and tells lies whether it is during the three periods or the two periods  this is called the root  If one makes light of ones faults says untruths or lets secrets be known to others this is called the means  If one gains profit as the result of a lie joyfully shares it with others has no feelings of shame or regret praises oneself  or becomes very arrogant this is called the completion  If one speaks of others faults and wrongdoings and claims that harmony is definitely impossible and disharmony is good this is called the means  After harmony is destroyed if one accepts reward  shares it with others enjoys the reward shamelessly or without regret praises oneself or becomes very arrogant this is called the completion  If one turns red and viciously scolds others this is called the root of coarse speech If one exaggerates the offenses of others that one hears of or spreads word of them wherever one goes this is called the means  If one gains profit as a result of scolding others joyfully shares it with others feels no shame or Oil Karma c regret praises oneself  or becomes very arro gant this is called the completion  If one engages in sexual talk or improper conversation this is called the root  To praise others with meaningless words or to act completely in accord with others wishes is called the means If one gains profit from teaching others meaningless speech accepts rewards for it joyfully shares it has no feelings of shame or regret praises oneself for doing it or becomes greatly arrogant this is called the completion  If one becomes greedy for others wealth this is called the root  The arising of afflictive thoughts is called the means If one receives wealth from greed joyfully shares it boasts about it has no feelings of shame or regret praises oneself or becomes very arrogant this is called the completion  If one scolds or beats others this is called the root  To use sticks or stones to beat others for their faults is called the means After beating others if one feels happy receives a reward for it joyfully shares or enjoys it has no feelings of shame or regret praises oneself for it or becomes arrogant this is called the completion  To refute the doctrine of karma cause and effect or the Noble Truths or to slander the sages is the root of ignorance To recite read copy believe in accept or praise the scriptures of the heretics is called the means After accepting the heretics teachings if one explains or preaches them to others to increase their deviant views or if one gains profit by spreading the heretics teachings joyfully shares or enjoys them has no feelings of shame or regret praises oneself or becomes very arrogant this is called the completion  With regard to the ten karmas one may create two karmas of telling lies and using deceptive language at the same time or the three karmas of telling lies using deceptive language and coarse speech at the same time or the other three karmas of deviant views coarse speech or telling lies at the same time Engaging in these unwholesome verbal karmas is idle talk which constitutes the fourth  The karmas of hatred and covetousness cannot coexist at the Chapter XXIV a same time whereas the other eight karmas can What does at the same time mean For example motivated by the six organs one does two things One is committing adultery with anothers wife The other is declaring no karmic result As soon as one carries out the action one creates the karma The ten unwholesome karmas are either mental or physical acts forms of action or forms of nonaction If they are not committed by some means or if they are not completed they are mental and not physical acts Killing ones own parents or apratyekabuddha stealing things belonging to the Three Treasures committing sexual misconduct with ones parent or a bhiksunl and slandering and harming the Sangha are the serious offenses To commit murder for material gain is an action of greed To murder a foe is anger To kill ones parents is stupidity To steal things belonging to a foe is anger To harm ones sub ordinates is stupidity To commit adultery for ones own lust is greed To violate a foes wife is anger and to commit sexual misconduct with ones mother is an action of stupidity There are three kinds of lying To lie in order to gain benefit for ones enjoyment is greed To lie to discredit ones foe is anger To lie for fear of death is stupidity There are three kinds of doubletongue To use double tongue to gain benefit is an action from greed to speak of a foes faults is anger and to break the harmony of the heretics is stupidity There are three kinds of coarse speech To scold women or children is greed To speak o f a foes faults deliberately is anger and to speak of On Karma the faults of previous generations is stupidity There are three kinds of meaningless speech To make resounding and noisy meaningless speech in order to have fun is greed to outdo others is anger and to increase deviant views is an action of stupidity Jealousy arises from greed anger arises from hatred and deviant views arise from stupidity With the cultivation of the ten virtues one will attain three liberations from each virtue whereas with the ten improbities one will definitely fall into the hells or become a hungry ghost or an animal The other retributions include having a short life as a man being poor having an unchaste wife not being believed having no close allies being often slandered not listening to good advice and suffering from the intangible deterioration of the four external elements strong winds and heavy rams ruimng and destroying things the ground being uneven and unable to produce the seven kinds of jewels yet full of rocks and sand and thorns the seasons and weather changing drastically and unpredictably and fruits being few and tasteless One has to practice the ten virtues sincerely in order to eradicate such retributions The ten virtues are present in the three continents They can be taken either as Buddhist precepts or not The beings m the northern continent Uttarakuru have only four kinds of whole someness the beings in the hells have five kinds of wholesome ness Hungry ghosts animals and gods have ten which are not taken as Buddhist precepts The beings in the six heavens of the desire realm do not need any means but only the fundamental root and the completion  Karma is accomplished in one thought If the killer and the killed both die the fundamental karmic result cannot be established If the preparation is completed but not the act of killing the killer only carries out the means of killing but does not commit the fundamental  After making the prepara tions and completing the act of killing one commits the funda mental offense of killing After the act of killing no matter whether the act is completed or not one commits the offense If the killer Chapter X X IV b dies after giving rise to the thought and the intended victim dies afterwards the killer does not commit the fundamental offense of killing If one sends someone else to kill the latter commits the offense of killing with action while the former commits the offense of killing without action Having incited others to kill with coarse speech the instigator commits both the offenses of killing and killing without action After killing even if the killer becomes benevolent or neutral  he com mits both the offenses of killing and killing without action Someone may say that since the past has already passed the future has not arrived yet and the present does not stand stiff how can there be killing One thought of killing does not destroy even a dust mote If one thought of killing is not possible neither are many thoughts of killing Consequently how can killing be possible Such an argument is incorrect And why is it incorrect Although at present no thought of killing arises it does not neces sarily prevent arising in the future Therefore there exists the fact of killing Accordingly one cannot deny killing in other places just because there is no killing in one place There are cases in which one can lose ones life by being stung on the hand yet survive when ones legs are cut off This is not true o f the head for by either being stung on the head or having it cut off one will certainly die Anyone who commits such an act commits a great offense This is called karma The three karmas involve oneself and the seven physical and verbal karmas involve oneself and others If there is no action there is also no nonaction Some may say that the three karmas of the body involve aspects of both action and nonaction but not the karma o f speech This is not true And why is it not true If the karma of speech did not involve aspects of both action and non action instigating someone to kill would not constitute an offense Therefore the karma of speech should involve aspects of both action and nonaction The karma of mind is not like this And why is this For sages do not commit offenses Why are they called the action and nonaction One who creates such karma faffs into the three evil realms Even if one is born as a human On Karma being ones life span is short and ones six organs constantly undergo suffering The auxiliary retribution is similar whereas the primary retribution may be similar or different The primary retribution takes place in the Equally Reviving hell and the Black Rope hell whereas the auxiliary retribution takes place in the three evil realms of hungry ghosts animals and humans If one makes preparations to kill one man but after the preparations two men are killed you should know that it is only against the intended victim that one commits an offense of killing with action or nonaction Someone may say that the aggregate of form is neutral neither good nor bad and so is life and as such how can there be the offense of killing Such an argument is not true And why is it not true Body and life are vehicles for good and bad minds To destroy the vehicle is to destroy future good or bad minds and therefore is an offense If the kings officials praise the kings order to kill the king and the officials commit the same offense The same is true of hunting One commits the offense of killing even when killing with a knife a person who is breathing his last breath But if the c person was dead before the action of killing the offense of killing is not committed If one plans to beat another but accidentally kills him the offense of killing is not committed If one causes death to an embryo by giving poisonous medicine to a pregnant woman one commits the offense of killing with and without action One who commits suicide does not commit the offense of killing And why is this so Someone may say that one commits an offense of killing whether ones mind is good bad or neutral just as anyone who is burnt by fire or takes poisons will certainly die even if the mind is good bad or neutral And why is it not Just as some people in the world do not die even if they are burnt by fire or take poison so one who kills without a vicious mind does not commit the crime Some doctors may argue that Vasu who killed men by putting spells on them and slew sheep as Chapter XXIV sacrifices to the gods did not commit the offense of killing This is not true And why is it not It is because he takes life out of stupidity If upon seeing someone killed one feels happy you should know that one commits the offense of the completion of killing The same is true if one feels happy on seeing someone kill and rewards the killer with money If one instigates someone to kill and the killer tortures the victim before the killing then the instigator commits the offense of killing with action and the killer commits both the offenses of killing with and without action If a man steals repeatedly and appropriates things that are entrusted to him or cheats during business transactions he also commits the offense of stealing Even though one does not steal oneself is not greedy and does not appropriate but instigates others to steal one commits the offense of stealing with and without action If a person wishes to steal gold but gets silver and after finding out the mistake returns the silver he does not commit the offense of stealing Supposing after stealing some gold a person thinks of impermanence and has regrets He wants to return the gold to its owner but has fears  By applying some skillful means he finally returns the stolen gold Even though the gold had been removed he does not commit the offense of stealing Suppose at first a servant has the thought of sharing his belongings with his master but later the servant becomes greedy and steals his masters things After having stolen he has doubts and escapes Later he again thinks of sharing the things Although the things were removed he does not commit the offense of stealing Suppose a traveler is robbed on a road After he reaches a village the head of the village says to him I Wl rePay yu for what you have lost  If the traveler asks for more than he lost he commits the offense of stealing Suppose a person has the thought of giving someone two robes If the receiver needs only one robe but keeps the other robe anyway he commits the offense of stealing Suppose someone plans to make offerings of lodging furniture medicine and other necessities to a On Karma bhiksu but before he makes the offerings he hears of another virtuous bhiksu coming from afar If he transfers these offerings  he commits the offense of stealing If someone steals a possession of a dead bhiksu by whom is he convicted If an assembly for monastic duty is held the attending a monks decide the sentence otherwise the sentence is given by monks from various places One who steals things belonging to the temple is judged and convicted by the stupakeeper This offense exists only in the three continents but not in the Uttarakuru continent If a monk has sexual intercourse with an animal another monk a prisoner a fugitive or his teachers wife he commits the offense of sexual misconduct It is by the ruler of the country to which he is connected that he is convicted If at a time of difficulty war tyranny or fear one has ones wife renounce the home life and later maintains a sexual relationship with her one commits the offense of sexual mis conduct If the contact involves the three organs the offense of sexual misconduct is committed If on the roadside or at a place beside a stupa temple or a place where people gather one engages in impure conduct either by oneself or with another one commits the offense of sexual misconduct Whether one is protected by ones parents ones brothers or a king whether one has set a date whether one promises or whether one is paid or invited if one engages in impure conduct beside statues or dead bodies one commits the offense of sexual misconduct If one has sexual intercourse with ones wife but thinks her another or thinks anothers wife is ones own one commits the offense of sexual misconduct That which is associated with serious afflictions is a Chapter XXIV b heavy offense whereas that which is associated with trivial afflic tions is a light offense Either with or without doubt if a man says things differently from what he sees hears or knows no matter if he has asked about it or not he tells a lie If he says something that he does not see hear or know this is also a lie for he is not telling the whole truth To say something without intending to dissemble is not telling a lie To say something perverting or to speak loudly and unclearly so as to cause misunderstanding is telling a lie If one uses deceptive or coarse language whether it hurts others or not one commits the same offense The same is true of engaging in idle talk These seven are pertinent both to karmic acts and to the way whereas the other three are pertinent to karmic acts but not to the way And why is this not true It is because they do not work by themselves and can harm oneself and others and thus cause grave offenses It is said that all particles exist momentarily and become extinct every instant After they become extinct they do not exist If they do not exist there is no action let alone nonaction Such a viewpoint is not correct And why is it not With regard to worldly dharmas if there is a cause there is an effect and if there is no cause there is no effect just as when one faces a water mirror there is a reflection Apart from the face there is no reflection The same is true of ones actions Actions are produced by the body and nonaction is produced by action When we face a water mirror there is a reflection It is the same for example as when a man arouses a vicious thought then vicious appearances will be mani fested And when a man arouses a virtuous thought wholesome appearances will be manifested The same is true with action and nonaction It is due to good karma that magnificent appearances are manifested It is due to bad karma that vicious appearances are manifested This is true in the case of both action and non action If you maintain that due to momentary existence and extinction there is neither action nor nonaction you are mistaken Like the analogies of the lamp and the river mentioned previously although become extinct every instant action and On Karma nonaction can be established through the principle of the two truths Although particles are not perpetual the dharmas within the domain of conventional truth cannot be denied Just as par ticles exist sequentially so do parents and arhats Anyone who kills them commits immeasurable offenses Although parents and arhats are no different from other people in terms of the aggregates the entrances and the realms of the senses yet because they are representing the field of blessings for repaying kindness killing them results in a grave transgression No one can say two words exactly at the same time however if they are not said together no sense can be made out of them Likewise although words become extinct every instant lies can be established through conventional truth As with shooting an arrow although the action becomes extinct every instant it is because of the power of the atoms physical action that the arrow reaches its target The same is true of action and nonaction Again as it is with enjoying dancing by oneself Although the act becomes extinct every instant it is because of the power of the atoms physical action that one can dance The same is true of action and nonaction As with turning a firewheel although the act becomes extinct every instant because of the power of the atoms physical action the fire forms a circle The initial aspiration expedient thought the thought at the time of action and the thought at the time of speaking are dif ferent from one another yet through the combination of various conditions action can be established The causes and conditions of action arise from nonaction For example when ones mind changes so does ones manner Because it is indestructible it is called nonaction After nonaction emerges from action whether the mind is wholesome unwholesome or neutral the karma it creates never disappears This is called nonaction If ones body does wholesome actions but the mouth does unwholesome actions one receives mixed retribution The wholesome physical karma is of action and nonaction while the unwholesome verbal karma is of action but not of nonaction You should be aware that such a Chapter XXIV person will receive good not bad retributions Therefore a sutra says that the seven kinds of karma are of both action and non action If a person is seriously ill he needs the combination of various medicines to cure his illness Lacking even one kind of medicine he cannot be cured Why is this It is because his illness c is serious The same is true of all sentient beings They are full of evils and need various precepts to counteract them Lacking even one precept they cannot do it Good son there are two kinds of sentient beings who commit offenses namely those who observe incorrect precepts and those who have not taken precepts Those who take incorrect precepts often commit the sin of killing when they kill only one sheep or even when they do not kill And why is this If those who have not taken precepts kill thousands of sheep they commit the sin of killing at the time when they are killing but not when they are not killing And why is this It is because they have not made the vow Hence it is the mind that is the root of all wholesome and unwholesome dharmas There are two kinds of transgressions made by bhiksus transgressions through the body and transgressions made through speech but not through the mind If the time and the conditions are not complete one does not attain the precepts For example in order to bore wood to make fire there should be the combination of a drill the action of boring and the dry wood Then you get fire No fire can be made if any one of these is missing The same is true in attaining precepts It all depends on the mind whether one attains forsakes keeps or violates the precepts The Tathagata clearly comprehended the nature of the dharmas so he established the precepts He who does not create any evil because of the powerful thought of good karma is following the precepts in accordance with the Dharma If he receives it from someone this is called taking precepts If one could gain merit without taking precepts all fierce animals such as lions tigers and wolves should receive merit But this is not so Therefore one who takes good precepts On Karma obtains immeasurable blessings whereas one who takes incorrect precepts obtains immeasurable faults Hence a sutra explains bad conduct as including raising sheep raising chickens raising pigs fishing catching fish killing cows being a jailor raising hunting dogs making bows being a hunter cursing dragons killing human beings being a thief using a doubletongue and torturing people by whipping shackling using iron nails burning and so forth Those who slander and disregard favors from the king or officials who are vicious in nature or in mind those who evade taxes and bhiksus who shamelessly break precepts are people of no prea cepts Although these conducts are not called nonvirtuous people commit grave offenses if they do them And why is this It is because they do them throughout their lives Such incorrect pre cepts are not valid if one has not made vows to take them from others The incorrect precepts can be forsaken on four occasions at the time of attaining the two organs at the time of death at the time of taking good precepts and at the time of eradicating the bondage of desires Some people may say that the incorrect precepts can be completed as the good precepts This is not true And why is it not true The incorrect precepts are easy to attain They are attained through one condition namely making the vow But the good precepts are not so made They are attained through five means the five organs Hence they are difficult to attain Someone may say that the upasaka precepts do not include the precepts against meaningless speech deceptive language or coarse speech and that therefore the eight upasaka precepts are not followed by sramaneras or bhiksus This is not true because they also keep the precept of pure speech If someone says that he takes the five precepts to purify the body speech and mind but his thoughts are not purified you should know that he cannot perfect the precepts For example if someone has taken incorrect precepts although he does not kill the incorrect precepts will often cause him to commit offenses This is equally true for a bhiksu who does the same And Chapter XXIV why is this It is because after the precepts are taken each of them results in many acts and consequences Just as sentient beings are immeasurable so are precepts Just as things are measureless so are precepts There are three kinds of good and incorrect precepts namely the superior medium and inferior If one does not take incorrect precepts although one might commit offenses this is not called incorrect precepts If someone asks why the five precepts should be kept for life while the eight precepts are kept for only one day and night the answer is that the Tathagata who knows well the characteristics of dharmas and comprehends them without obstruction taught it as such Good son there are two kinds of worldly fields of blessings the field o f meritorious virtue and the field of repaying kindness There are five atrocious offenses that violate these two kinds of blessings A person does not commit an atrocious offense even if he kills an arhat or his parents if it is done when insane But if he shamelessly does not think of repaying kindness does not show respect to his parents and commits only the means without the root of killing his parents which does not constitute an atrocious offense he will have to undergo serious retribution b Parents teach their children well have great love for them are patient do what is difficult to do and undergo great suffering for them They are called the fields of repaying kindness After one kills ones parents even if one cultivates wholesomeness it bears no good result Therefore I say that to have some shade even for a short time one should not break the branches and leaves of a tree Good son after I enter nirvana those who claim that one does not commit an atrocious offense if one kills ones own parents because of mistaken identity will belong to the Dharmaguptaka sect Those who claim that one who kills ones parents even when insane or because of mistaken identity commits an atrocious offense will belong to the Mahisasaka sect Those who claim that one commits an atrocious offense if one kills ones parents when On Karma insane or because of mistaken identity belong to the Sarvastivada sect And why is this Worldly truth is believable The reality of the parents cannot be changed If one kills them with a vicious mind one commits an atrocious offense However if at the time one kills ones parents one does not think of them as parents and does not have a vicious thought even if the parents die one does not commit an atrocious offense An why is this The act of an atrocious offense takes four conditions true parents and the thought of them as parents a vicious mind the thought of abandonment and regarding the parents as sentient beings The atrocious offense is committed if all of these four conditions are met If one gives ones parents a weapon to kill themselves although one oneself does not kill them out of pity or respect or out of fear or if one kills them because commanded to do so  or if to gain fame then even though one does not personally kill them one commits an atrocious offense If one is forced to kill ones parents and does it with grief the offense is not as heavy If one wants to kill ones parents but kills someone else by mistake one does not commit an atrocious offense If one wants to kill someone but kills ones parents by mistake one does not commit an atrocious offense either If one wants to kill ones mother but kills someone else looking like her and after the killing strikes ones mother when concealing the knife one does not commit the atro cious offense  In this kind of killing involv ing mistaken identity of the mother and accidental killing one only commits the offense of killing but not the atrocious offense of killing ones parent if one kills ones mother out of mistaken identity Of the five atrocious offenses the offense of matricide is heavier than that of patricide The offense of killing an arhat is heavier than that of matricide The offense of shedding the blood of a Buddha is heavier than that of killing an arhat The offense of destroying the harmony of the Sangha is heavier than that of shedding the blood of a Buddha An example of a heavy object and light thought is killing ones parents without a vicious thought An example of a light object and heavy thought is killing an animal while having a very vicious thought An example of a heavy object and thought is killing ones mother while having a vicious thought and an example of a light object and thought is killing animals while having a slightly vicious thought To bad karmic acts such as these there are cases in which the means is heavy and the root and completion of the offense are light the means and root light and the completion heavy the means and root heavy and the completion light and the root light and the means and completion heavy Good son if someone wishes to offer me food but if before he does so he gives it to a hungry dog I praise him as k great giver just the same One obtains immeasurable blessings and c virtues if one gives indiscriminately whether it is a field of bless ings or not And why is this It is because his mind is pure and good There are four kinds of karma that which bears result in the present that which bears result in the next life that which bears result in future lives and that which bears no result There are four kinds of karma that which is fixed in time but not fixed in retribution that which is fixed in retribu tion but not in time that which is fixed in both time and retribution and that which is not fixed in either time or retribution Fixed time refers to the present lifetime the next lifetime or future lifetimes in which one will undergo retribu tion  Karma that is not fixed in either time or retribution can be changed If the retribution is fixed then the future retribution of the karma can be changed to be carried out at present And why is this It is because of the power of a kind mind and wisdom that the fixed bad retribution can be made fight Why is it that some retributions are certain If some action is carried out frequently and without regret mindfully joyfully and with determination and the doer feels happy afterwards the retribution from the action is fixed Otherwise the retribution is not definite If one disciplines oneself and cultivates precepts the mind and wisdom although good or evil will certainly bear results one can change serious karma into light karma and be exempt from minor retribu tions If one encounters a field of blessings meets beneficial friends and cultivates the way and goodness one can change the serious retributions in future lives into minor ones in the present lifetime If a person has karmas from the desire realm after he attains the frontier of a nonreturner he can make future retributions mature in the present lifetime The same is true of the fruition of an arhat Good son if the wise can discipline themselves and cultivate precepts the mind and wisdom they can destroy the most serious karma just as the agada mantra or a poisonneutralizing jewel destroys deadly poison If a man initially commits a small offense but later it becomes greater it is because he does not discipline himself or cultivate precepts the mind or wisdom This is how a minor offense becomes a serious one Sentient beings may create one kind two kinds or various kinds  Some of the various actions of sentient beings are complete and some are not A complete action is that which is done after careful consideration An incomplete action is one that is done before careful consideration Also an incomplete action means that the action is complete but that the retribution from the action is not determined A complete action means that the action is complete and that the retribution is also determined Also there is another kind of incomplete action in which the retribution is determined but the time to undergo the retribution is not A complete action is one in which retribution and time are both determined An incomplete action is one that is done through keeping precepts and a correct view while a complete action is done through breaking precepts and holding deviant views An incomplete action is done through belief in cause and effect and complete action is done without belief in cause and effect An incomplete action means that when evil is being done it is also Chapter XXIV surrounded by good whereas a complete action is when evil is being done while aggravated by another evil An incomplete action means that although one does various evils one undergoes retribu tion in this world whereas a complete action means that one does various evils in this world but undergoes the retribution in hell An incomplete action is one that is done with proper thought whereas a complete action is one that is done with improper thought Also an incomplete action means that the doer feels regret for it during the three periods of the day whereas a com plete action means that the doer does not feel regret for it during any of the three periods of the day The same is true of the good After the body comes into existence two kinds of results arise mixed good and nongood This is the same for human beings and gods The physical existence of beings in hell is derived from unwholesome thought After their bodies come into existence their thoughts are nothing but evil The physical existences of hungry ghosts and animals are also derived from unwholesome thought After their bodies come into existence their thoughts are mixed with both good and non good The good or evil intermediate existence between death and rebirth is derived from good or evil thought After the body comes into existence it gains mixed retribution either good or bad From the time as an embryo to old age and death one undergoes mixed retribution of good and nongood Therefore a sutra says There are four kinds of karma namely bad karma with bad retribution good karma with good retribution mixed karma with mixed retribu tion and karma that is neither bad nor good resulting in no retribution The bad karma with bad retribution refers to the actions of beings in hell The good karma with good retribution refers to the actions of gods in the realm of form Mixed karma with mixed retribution refers to the actions of gods in the desire realm humans animals and hungry ghosts Good son he who does not comprehend the cause and condi tion of karma will undergo birth and death for immeasurable lives And why Because he does not understand the cause and condition of karma Even if he is bom in the heaven of neither thinking nor nonthinking he will be reborn in the three evil realms after the blessings of a life span of eighty thousand years is exhausted Good son there is no modifier that is more powerful than thought Thought shapes affliction which in turn shapes karma Because of hatred ones voice becomes harsh and one behaves violently As is hatred so is stupidity It is due to their karma that innumerable animals and b hungry ghosts fall into the one hundred thirtysix hells of count less worlds Likewise innumerable sentient beings attain liberation because of their karma Good son the ten virtues can achieve three things they can keep afflictions away they can develop wholesome thought and they can increase morality Likewise three things can neutralize poison namely agada medicine divine mantras and real jewels By cultivating well the practice of nonlaxity having a correct view and distinguishing good from bad one can definitely cultivate the ten virtues He who is lax shameless and faithless definitely creates the ten nonvirtues Diligently paying respect and making offerings to parents teachers and monks and greeting and speaking gently to the virtuous are the means After one has done  if one can cultivate joyful thought and does not regret it this is called the completion  To carry out with concentrated mind is called the root Good son there are three aspects to the ten karmas superior medium and inferior There are cases in which the means are superior the root medium and the completion inferior or the Chapter XXIV   c means medium the root superior and the completion inferior or the means inferior the root superior and the completion medium The ten karmas are linked to three dharmasthey are linked either with nongreed nonhatred and nonstupidity or with greed hatred and stupidity These ten karmas can be practiced either with precepts or without precepts There are six occasions in which one gives up the precepts when the root of virtue is severed when one attains the two organs at the time of death at the time of taking bad precepts at the time of forsaking precepts and when the body is forsaken in the desire realm Some people say that one loses the precepts when the Buddha Dharma is destroyed And why is it not so The disciplinary precepts refer to cutting off physical verbal and mental offenses The meditative precepts refer to the four fundamental dhyanas and the four primary dhyanas The four fundamental dhyanas the first dhyana and the other primary dhyanas are called the undefiled precepts After death never committing any evil in future lives is called the precepts of nonaction To regulate the senseorgans to cultivate proper mindfulness and not to become lax with regard to the senses of sight sound smell taste touch and mind are called the precepts of disciplining the organs Why is it that the precepts are so named Precept means a restriction that prevents all unwholesome dharmas It also means a narrow pass that blocks unwholesome dharmas Precept also means coolness for it fights against the heat of affliction not allowing it to enter Precept also means upward for it assists one to enter heaven even as far as the unsurpassed way Precept also means learning that is learning to subdue the mind wisdom and the sense organs Good son some people may perfect one kind of precept that is the pratimoksa or two kinds of precepts in addition to the meditative precepts or three kinds of precepts the previous two in addition to the undefiled precepts or four kinds On Karma of precepts in addition to the precepts dis ciplining the organs or five kinds of precepts in addition to the precepts of nonaction Good son the pratimoksa can be taken in the present life whereas the meditative precepts can be taken in the three periods  Good son if one can sincerely think of the faults of samsara and the merits of liberation and has a joyful mind at the time of taking precepts one can attain the precepts of action and nonaction at the same time which last as long as one lives If ones life is long they last long and if ones life is short they last for a short time The precepts of nonaction are lost for three reasons little adorn ment the mind being lax and the effort not being persistent Good son excluding the ten virtuous karmas the ten unwhole some karmas the good precepts and the incorrect precepts there are actions not included in the precepts of action There are wholesome and unwholesome dharmas They are of either action or nonaction Some people engage in both dharmas those of action and those of nonaction If one does good at that very moment there is both action and nonaction At the second thought both action and nonaction are completed After the action  there is only nonaction and no action For example if a person has taken precepts but commits transgressions he is doing two things in this present fife acting on unwholesome dharmas and not acting on wholesome dharmas His action and nonaction cease on two occa sions at the time when he finishes giving away his possessions and when he gives up unwholesome thought Action is accom plished in two periods of time the present and the future Non action is accomplished in three periods of time Another three occasions are At the time of regressing or attaining a higher existence the good karma of the mind is lost and when the root of virtue is severed the good karmas of body speech and mind are lost Good son he who is replete with the full precepts  the meditative precepts the undefiled precepts and the precepts of disciplining the organs comprehends the path of the ten karmas Good son because of the ten karmas the life span of sentient beings either increases or decreases The shortest life span is ten years and the longest is immeasurable years Those born in Uttarakaru have a life span of one thousand years those in this world one hundred years and those in the eastern and western continents two hundred fifty years If the life span in this world were immeasurable the life span in those a worlds would be immeasurable too The life span of the Four Heavenly Kings is nine million years Their destination is not certain The life span of the gods of the thirtythree heavens of the three world systems is eighteen million years Their destination is not certain Those in the Yama Heaven have a life span of thirtysix million years Their destination is not certain Except for the future bodhisattvas those in the Tusita Heaven have a life span of seventytwo million years Their destination is not certain The inhabitants of the Nirmanarati Heaven have a life span of one hundred fortyfour million years Their destination is not certain The inhabi tants of the Paranirmitavasavartin Heaven have a life span of two hundred eightyeight million years Their destination is not certain One year in the Paranirmitavasavartin Heaven is equal to one day and one night in the hot hells As in this world thirty days make a month and twelve months a year The inhabitants of the hot hells have a hfe span of two hundred eightyeight million years Their destination is not certain One year in the Nirmanarati Heaven is equal to one day and one night in the Hell of Big Noise Thirty days make a month and twelve months a year The life span in this hell is one hundred fortyfour million years Their destination is not certain One year in the Tusita On Karma Heaven is equal to one day and night in the Hell of Small Noise Thirty days make a month and twelve months a year The life span in this hell is seventytwo million years Their destination is not certain One year in the Yama Heaven is equal to one day and one night in the Uniting Hell Thirty days make a month and twelve months a year The life span in this hell is thirtysix million years Their destination is not certain One year in the thirtythree heavens is equal to one day and night in the Black Rope Hell Thirty days make a month and twelve months a year The life span in this hell is eighteen million years Their destination is not certain One year in the realm of the Four Heavenly Kings is equal to one day and night in the Equally Reviving Hell Thirty days make a month and twelve months a year The life span in this hell is nine million years Their destination is not certain The life span in the Avici Hell is one kalpa and that in the Hell of Great Heat is half a kalpa The life span in these two hells is fixed Five hundred years in the world of human beings are equal to one day and night in the world of hungry ghosts Thirty days make a month and twelve months a year The life span is fifteen thousand years Their destination is not certain The life span of animals except for Nanda and Upananda  is not fixed One year in the Avici Hell is equal to one day and night in the heaven of neither thinking nor nonthinking Thirty days make a month and twelve months a year The life span in this heaven is eighty thousand great kalpas in the Heaven of Non existence sixty thousand kalpas in the Heaven of Limitless Con sciousness forty thousand kalpas and in the Heaven of Limitless b Space twenty thousand kalpas He who arouses slight affliction and is attached to emptiness and meditative concentration will be reborn in one of the four heavens of the formless realm The life span starts at ten years then increases to eighty thousand years and then decreases from eighty thousand back to ten The time that it takes for this increasing and decreasing to occur eighteen times is called a middlesized kalpa The time that it takes to undergo three calamities of famine three Chapter XXIV calamities of pestilence and one calamity of weapons is called a small kalpa The calamity of wind follows five cycles of the two calamities of flood and fire The time that it takes to undergo five calamities of wind is called a great kalpa The life span increases because of nonkilling and it decreases because of steal ing There are two kinds of calamities namely the calamity of flood and the calamity of fire When the calamity o f fire takes place the beings in hells can be liberated if they can exhaust their karmic retributions If not they move to other big hells Only when there are no sentient beings in the eight great hells of this world can it be said that sentient beings have been liberated from hell Sentient beings in the four great seas can be liberated if they can exhaust their karma If not they move to other seas Only when there are no sentient beings in the seas can it be said that they have been liberated from the seas Fiveyoanas below Jambudvipa is a Yama city which is seventyfive thousand yojanas in diameter The hungry ghosts in this city can be liberated if they can exhaust their karma If not they move to another city ofYamas Only when there are no sentient beings left in his cities can it be said that they have been liberated They proclaim loudly The first dhyana is tranquil The first dhyana is tranquil Hearing this people practice contemplation and they all achieve the first dhyana They immediately forsake their human bodies and are reborn in the first dhyana heaven The second dhyana is tranquil Others who hear this practice contemplation and achieve On Karma the second dhyana They give up the physical existence of the first dhyana heaven and are reborn in the second dhyana heaven At that time there is not even one sentient being left in either the Avici hell or the first dhyana heaven c Good son outside of the four continents is the Yugamdhara where there are seven suns Because of the blessing and virtue of the inhabitants only one sun appears Depending on it grains grasses and trees are able to grow But when the calamity of fire takes place the seven suns all appear and bum up all grains grasses trees mountains rivers the earth and Mount Sumeru all the way up to the first and second dhyana heavens The sentient beings are frightened when seeing the fire Among the sentient beings those born earlier in the heaven say to those born later Do not be afraid We have seen fire like this before It will stop and not extend to here The heat will last as long as it takes to go a cycle of the life spans increasing from ten years to eighty thousand years and decreasing from eighty thousand years to ten years After that rain pours heavily from the middle dhyana heaven After one cycle of the life spans increasing and decreasing because of sentient beings karma seven layers of clouds emerge from it to hold the water The rain stops and a screen like rich milk grows on the surface of the water Gradually Mount Sumeru emerges from the center of the four continents The water is naturally full of all kinds of seeds At this time someone from the second dhyana heaven exhausts his blessings and shortens his life span Because of his karma he falls into the world where he enjoys a long life and selfillumination After staying in solitude for a long time he becomes distressed and has this thought I am now all alone If I still have any blessings I hope someone will be born here to keep me company After he has this thought those in the second dhyana heaven who have exhausted their blessings and whose life spans are coming to an end are reborn in this world due to the causes and conditions of their karma Seeing this he is happy and thinks These people have been transformed by me I created them and I have controlling power over them Each of these people also thinks I was transformed by him He created us Chapter XXIV and he has a controlling power over us Because of this all sentient beings give rise to the view of self Good son it is all because of the causal conditions of the ten karmas that the aggregates the realms the sentient and insentient worlds and so forth come into being Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to observe the path of the ten karmas but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XXV On Endurance a Sujata said Worldhonored One the Buddha has previously explained the perfection of giving and the perfection of precepts To endure hunger thirst cold heat suffering and happiness is called worldly endurance To endure faith precepts giving hearing of the Dharma wisdom and correct views without fallacy to be patient with the Buddha Dharma and Sangha to endure reproach beating coarse language bad things and others greed hatred and stupidity to bear what is unbearable give what is difficult to give and do what is difficult to do are called worldtranscending endurance Good son if people beat slight slander speak harshly to or scold a bodhisattva he does not think of revenge Although the bodhisattva can endure all these he does it not for present but for future benefit The evil that causes good result for the person to whom the evil is done does not reach him Good son there are imperfect endurance perfections other than that of endurance perfected endurance and that which is neither perfected nor endurance The imperfect endurance is worldly endurance which is practiced by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas A perfection other than that of endurance is the perfection of meditation The perfected endurance refers to the occasion in which if one has ones head eyes hands or feet cut off one does not arouse even one hateful thought The perfections of giving morality and wisdom other than that of endur ance Good son he who wishes to practice endurance should first break arrogant hateful and ignorant thoughts and should not perceive a self or things possessed by a self or their permanent value If he reflects as such you should know that he can cultivate endurance After this cultivation he will feel joyfiil When a wise person encounters scolding he should reflect The scolding words do not come all at once and when the first scolding word bursts out the second word has not come into existence When the second word is spelled out the first word is already gone If scoldin g words do not have existence all at once how can they be scolding It may just be like the blowing of the wind Why should I become angry The scolding is just like the blowing of the wind There are two kinds of wind internal and external wind I do not even become angry with external wind how much less with internal wind Worldly scolding is of two kinds true and false If I truly deserve the scolding why should I become angry And if someone makes false accusations against me he is the one who deserves scolding It has nothing to do with me so why should I become angry If I become angry I am creating unwholesomeness And why is this Because of anger one will be reborn in the three evil realms of existence To suffer in the three evil realms is my own doing and so I have to undergo retribution Therefore it is said that all good or evil depends on oneself b Good son there are five ways to bring forth endurance Good son he who achieves these five prac tices can cultivate endurance He who speaks gently purifies physical and verbal activities greets people with a peaceful and happy expression and contemplates the causes and conditions of On Endurance all suffering and happiness can cultivate endurance If a person practices the samadhi of emptiness perceives that sentient beings and sufferings are all impermanent and when being insulted sees the insulter as insane ignorant or unwise he can cultivate endur ance A wise person should reflect With those stronger than I I should not become angry when they reproach me And why is this If I do they might kill me With those who are not as strong as I am I should not avenge myself And why is this If I take revenge I am insulting myself For example if someone gives poison to others who refuse to take it and he himself then takes the poison people will laugh at him The same is true of me If I become angry with others I will undergo suffering in the future and be reproached by all sages Hence even if my body is cut up I should not become hateful instead I should reflect on my previous karma and cultivate kindness and compas sion with regard to all sentient beings If I cannot endure even a small insult how can I regulate sentient beings Endurance is the primary cause of bodhi and unsurpassed complete enlightenment is a direct result of endurance If I do not sow the seed how am I going to reap the fruit Good son the wise person who joyfully practices endurance always looks peaceful and happy and has a good sense of humor When a wise person sees a foe come with ill will he should make a goodwill wish I hope that my foe will become my parent brother or relative in future lives and never have ill will toward me He should further reflect It is due to hatred that people become handicapped ugly or poor How can I not practice endurance now Therefore the wise deeply cultivate the virtue of endurance Good son when a bodhisattva mahasattva practices endur ance he always looks into the faults of samsara happily cultivates the Dharma diligently reads and copies the Buddhist scriptures makes offerings to teachers elders and virtuous ones takes care of the sick and has compassion for all When he sees people suffer he helps free them from suffering He always likes to leave the Chapter XXV c home life to the end of his life He seriously keeps precepts and disciplines the six sense organs so as to prevent the arising of afflictions He would rather die than violate precepts He takes delight in helping others manage their business always has a sense of shame and happily praises others virtues In order to regulate sentient beings he is willing to endure suffering He is able to be patient with the vicious things done by foes let alone by dear ones He can endure two kinds of anger the anger of sentient beings and the anger of nonsentient beings He does not remember great ill will and never forgets small amounts of good He avoids hypocrisy and keeps silent about others shortcomings He speaks of the faults of afflictions so that others do not talk about unpleasant things behind peoples backs He purifies his body speech and mind and rids himself of offensive karma If he commits offenses out of adventitious afflictions he feels shame and regret Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to cultivate endurance purely but it is difficult for the lay bodhi sattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XXVI On the Perfection of Vigor a Sujata said Worldhonored One of the six perfections that the bodhisattva mahasattva practices which is the primary cause Good son if a good son or a good daughter diligently practices in order to sever aroused evil to prevent the appearance of evil that has not yet been aroused to arouse undeveloped good and to increase aroused good this is called vigor It can help one transcend the realm of all afflictions Good son he who endures the suffering of the three evil realms can truly cultivate the perfection of vigor with impartiality and without haste or tardiness There are two kinds of vigor the correct and the incorrect A bodhisattva should avoid the incorrect and cultivate the correct kind of vigor To cultivate faith giving morality hearing of the Dharma wisdom and compassion is the correct kind of vigor To practice sincerely during the three periods of the day without regret never to feel that one has had a surfeit of wholesome dharmas and to study worldly and worldtranscending dharmas are correct ways of vigor Although a bodhisattva does not spare his body and life in order to protect the Dharma he should care for his body and life He should always properly cultivate the four awesome deportments and should not become lax when cultivating good dharmas or reject the Dharma even at the cost of his body and life The cause of the achievement of the six perfections is vigor To practice vigorously for oneself is to read recite copy and ponder the twelve divisions of the scriptures To practice vigorously for others is to transfer ones practices so as to regulate sentient beings To practice vigorously for enlightenment is to cultivate the Chapter XXVI path of enlightenment To practice giving to keep precepts to hear much of the Dharma to practice wisdom to learn worldly dharmas to make offerings to parents teachers and virtuous ones to practice calmness and discernment  to read and copy the twelve divisions of the scriptures and to avoid greed hatred and stupidity all these are called correct vigor the primary cause of the six perfections Good son lazy people do not always practice giving keep precepts practice meditation vigorously endure hardship nor distinguish good from evil Therefore the six perfections are rooted in vigor Good son there are imperfect vigor perfections other than that of vigor perfected vigor and that which is neither perfected nor vigor Imperfect vigor is the incorrect vigor and the correct but imperfect vigor practiced by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas An example of the perfections other than that of vigor is the perfection of wisdom The perfected vigor is the vigorous practice of the five perfections of giving precepts endur ance vigor and meditation That which is neither perfected nor vigor is the good dharmas of giving precepts endurance medita tion wisdom and so forth practiced by common people sravakas and pratyekabuddhas Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to practice vigorously but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XXVII On the Perfection of Meditation Sujata said Worldhonored One a bodhisattva mahasattva culti vates the perfection of meditation What does meditation mean Good son meditation means morality kindness compassion joy equanimity leaving behind all defilements and cultivating good dharmas Good son one cannot achieve even worldly matters without concentration let alone worldtranscending ones Hence one should earnestly practice meditation The bodhisattva who wishes to achieve the perfection of meditation should first draw close to truly beneficial friends and practice the skillful means of samadhi and the precepts Through the practice of precepts we discipline the sense organs and remove improper ways of living One should abide in the Dharma follow the instructions of ones teacher never feel that ones practice of good dharmas is enough never take rest when cultivating wholesomeness always enjoy b quietness avoid the five obstructions take delight m contem plation and question the faults of samsara One should purify ones mind and body not associate with bad friends and avoid unwholesomeness and the enjoyment of worldly pleasures One should be aware of the time comprehend the Dharma understand oneself and know the ways of mental contemplation One should be aware of any feelings of joy sorrow hate softness or firmness in ones meditation just as a goldsmith is aware of cold and heat and remains detached from them One should not lose the pleasant sweetdew flavor of meditation Although one is involved in worldly matters one should not be disturbed by them just as Chapter XXVII Mount Sumeru is not moved by the four winds One should have a firm correct view and be aware of the faults of all that is condi tioned Anyone who joyfully and tirelessly cultivates samddhi in this way can accomplish the perfection of meditation just as fire is easily made by continuing to bore wood Good son there is no such thing as achieving worldly dharmas and worldtranscending bodhi without samddhi Good son samddhi is the basis of all good dharmas Hence one should concentrate one s mind just as when holding up a mirror one can see all good and bad Therefore samddhi is called the ornament on the path to enlightenment Physical and mental bliss is called samddhi neither increasing nor decreasing is called samddhi from the initial meditation on white bones up to the attainment of unsur passed complete enlightenment are all called samddhis Immeasurable blessings as well as all good are attained from these four conditions From these three conditions samddhi gradually arises Good son there are in the desire realm seeds of samddhi from which enlightenment is realized At the heaven o f the fourth dhydna samddhi is firm and strong From the heaven of the first dhyana to that of neither thinking nor nonthinking the upper heaven is superior to its next one There is bliss and happiness in the fundamental dhydna heaven but not in the medial stages of dhydna The same is true of the six super natural powers which are possessed in the fundamental dhydna heaven but not in other places Because of the practice of samddhi the bodhisattva attains the path of learning and the path of no more learning  the four immeasurable minds the three emancipations the immeasurable supernatural power that bene fits oneself and others the power of reading others minds that can On the Perfection of Meditation c subdue sentient beings immeasurable wisdom the five roots and concentration Those with dull become sharp and thus sever birth decay sickness and death They accomplish complete wisdom and perceive the nature of all dharmas as they see lohu  Good son a wise person should reflect like this All afflictions are my big enemies And why is this It is because they can destroy me and others Hence I should cultivate compassionate thought so as to benefit sentient beings and to obtain immeasurable pure good dharmas It is said that there is no such thing as achieving good dharmas without compassion Compassion can destroy unwhole someness and cause sentient beings to be free from suffering to enjoy happiness and to destroy the realm of desire The kindness that is tied with the desire realm is called the kindness of the desire realm Good son sentient beings who can accumulate compassionate thought will gain immeasurable merits When cultivating a kind mind if one provides safety for ones foes this is called the cultiva tion of kindness All these three are called the objects of ones kindness A cultivator of kindness usually wants to make his dear ones happy After this is done he extends his kindness to his foes Good son a kind mind arises from precepts or from giving To take foes as ones own sons is kindness Good son kindness can only increase affinity but cannot relieve suffering Compassion is not so It not only increases affinity but also relieves  Good son if a person can see even one hairs breadth of goodness in his foes rather than their unwhole someness you should know that he is practicing kindness When his foes are suffering from illness if he goes visiting takes care of them and gives them what they need you should know that he is cultivating compassion Good son you should know that the cultivation of tolerance is the causal condition of the cultivation of kindness which is the causal condition of all peace and happiness A cultivator of kindness can break all causal conditions of arrogance and can Chapter XXVII practice giving morality endurance vigor meditation and wis dom in accordance with the Dharma You should know that he who cultivates meditation is cultivating pure blessings and virtues from which he attains a pure body If a person perceives the faults of samsara and the merits of nirvana even the dirt under his feet should be saluted for he can endure what is hard to endure give away what is hard to give away and do what is hard to do and he can cultivate the four dhyanas the four emptinesses and the eight liberations  I shall undergo for sentient beings all their retributions of suffering from physical a verbal and mental evils in the future and I shall share with all sentient beings the good reward from my good karma The extent of kindness and compassion thus depends on the extent of the objects it reaches There are three kinds of kindness and compas sion namely superior medium and inferior Also there are another three kinds extending to the greedy extending to sentient beings and extending to nonsentient beings To extend like these is called samadhi The same is true of compassion joy and equanimity Good son there are imperfect meditation perfections other than meditation perfected meditation and the practices that are neither perfected nor meditation Imperfect meditation is worldly medita tion or the meditation practiced by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas Perfections other than meditation are giving morality endurance and vigor The vajrasamadhi is perfected medi tation that are neither perfected nor meditation are all the good dharmas arising from listening and thinking practiced by all sentient beings sravakas and pratyekabuddhas Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to practice pure meditation but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XXVIII On the Perfection of Wisdom Sujata said Worldhonored One how does a bodhisattva cultivate the pure perfection of wisdom Good son if a bodhisattva practices in the following way he will attain wisdom He keeps precepts is vigorous hears much of the Dharma has a right livelihood cultivates endurance has compassion toward sentient beings and a sense of shame and avoids jealousy He truly comprehends skill in means When suffer ing for others he does not become regretful He happily gives skillfully disciplines sentient beings and knows the major and minor offenses well He diligently exhorts sentient beings to create karma of blessings He knows words and their meanings but does not become arrogant Drawing near beneficial friends he benefits himself and others He pays respect to the Three Treasures teachers monks elders and virtuous ones He does not think lightly of selfenlightenment and can perceive the profound virtues of enlight enment He understands the nature of good and evil the worldly and worldtranscending theories of grammar and logic causes and their effects and skillful means and their basis To get meaning from words means wisdom arising from hearing To get meaning from think ing means wisdom arising from thinking To get meaning from cultivation means wisdom arising from cultivation Wisdom is obtained from studying the twelve divisions of the Tathagatas scriptures which disperse doubts and from reading the secular treatises which distinguish good from bad Wisdom is to discern well the twelve divisions of the scriptures the meanings of the Chapter XXVIII b causes and effects of the aggregates the realms  the entries the characteristics of calmness and discernment the inferior medium and superior forms the good bad and neutral the four errors the stage of beholding the truth and the stage of culti vating the way Good son a wise person seeks the ten powers the four fear lessnesses great compassion and the three mindfulnesses He always stays close to the Buddha and his disciples In the era of no Buddha Dharma he feels happy to leave the home life and studies with the heretics Although he follows a deviant path he likes to seek the right path He constantly cultivates the thought of kind ness compassion joy and equanimity and the five supernatural powers After having attained the five supernatural powers he contemplates impurity and impermanence talks about the faults of conditioned dharmas and has sentient beings study theories of grammar and logic for correct language He helps sentient beings eradicate physical and mental diseases enjoys teaching secular studies to others and excels in what he does such as in mantras or medicine After acquiring wealth he manages it and gives it away in proper ways Although he is very knowledgeable he is not arro gant Gaining great meritorious virtues he does not feel satisfied He teaches sentient beings to have faith giving precepts learn ing and wisdom He comprehends wholesome unwholesome and neutral and skillful means and he understands well the stages of learning and practice He knows the path to enlight enment and its adornment He also knows the superior medium and inferior faculties of sentient beings and secular theories of grammar and logic but he is not attached to them He knows the right time to discipline sentient beings Good son there are imperfect wisdom perfections other than wisdom practices that are both perfect and wisdom and practices that are neither perfect nor wisdom Imperfect wisdom is worldly wisdom or the wisdom practiced by sravakas andpratyekabuddhas On the Perfection of Wisdom There is no such thing as a perfection that is not wisdom The practices that are both perfection and wisdom are all of the six perfections neither perfect nor wisdom are those of giving precepts and vigor that are practiced by sravakas andpratyekabuddhas Good son he who diligently culti vates these six perfections is making offerings to the six directions and can increase his wealth and life Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to cultivate pure wisdom but it is for the lay bodhisattva And why is this Lay people are bound by more unfavorable conditions When had spoken this Dharma Sujata and thousands of updsakas aroused the aspiration for unsurpassed complete enlightenment After having aroused the aspiration they rose from their seats bowed to the Buddha and withdrew to their own places The Book of Bodhisattva Precepts Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Northern Liang Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Dharmakṣema from India I take refuge in Rocana Buddha And Buddhas who are indestructible like vajra in the ten directions I also make obeisance to the author of the source treatise The honored Maitreya Bodhisattva the next Buddha to come Bodhisattvas hear me recite the Bodhisattva precepts in the three clusters The precepts are like a huge bright lamp Which can dispel the darkness of the long night The precepts are like the precious true mirror Which reflects all without omission The precepts are like the wishfulfilling jewel Which rains down things to relieve the poor Therefore Bodhisattvas should diligently protect and uphold it Refusing to Accept Repentance If a Bodhisattva out of harming and terrifying anger refuses to accept his offenders repentance uses abusive speech and not feeling satisfied hits him with hands clubs or stones it is called the third parājika Maligning or Adulterating the True Dharma If a Bodhisattva maligns Bodhisattva teachings or pronounces supposedly similar dharmas and pretentiously establishes himself on such dharmas which come from his own or someone elses understanding it is called the fourth parājika If a Bodhisattva overcome by his afflictions commits any of them and loses a corresponding Bodhisattva precept he must receive it again  Now I ask you Great Ones Are you pure with respect to these parājikas Great Ones because you are silent you must be pure In this way you should observe the precepts against these parājikas If in one day and one night he fails to present offerings large or small make one obeisance praise the virtues of the Three Jewels with one stanza or even think one pure thought as homage to a living Buddha a Buddhas memorial pagoda the Dharma in the store of sūtras and the store of mātṛkās the Saṅgha or great Bodhisattvas in worlds in the ten directions it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas If the reason is disrespect indolence or negligence the transgression arises from affliction taint If the reason is forgetfulness the transgression does not arise from affliction taint However it is not a transgression for Bodhisattvas on the Ground of the Pure Mind and bhikṣus with indestructible purity because they always make Dharma offerings to the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha Disrespecting a Peer in the Dharma Suppose a Bodhisattva sees someone worthy of respect who has seniority or distinctive virtue or is a peer in the Dharma If the reason is indolence negligence absentmindedness or forgetfulness the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Moreover it is not a transgression if in the midst of a Dharma assembly or discussion group one does not stop to pay respects to another because one is expounding the Dharma listening to the Dharma or engaging in discussions or because a speaker is expounding the Dharma or engaging in discussions Refusing to Accept Alms Suppose an almsgiver offers various kinds of treasures such as gold silver pearls jewels and aquamarine to a Bodhisattva If out of anger arrogance or defiance the Bodhisattva refuses to accept anything it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint If out of anger stinginess or jealousy the Bodhisattva refuses to pronounce the Dharma it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint If the reason is indolence negligence or forgetfulness the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Because a Bodhisattvas lovingkindness and compassion go deeper for an evil person than for a good person Observing VoiceHearer Precepts with Little Benefit Among the prātimokṣa precepts in the Vinaya there are precepts against sins by decree to protect people to make nonbelievers believe and to make believers believe even more Because if voicehearers who mainly deliver themselves learn these precepts to protect others to make nonbelievers believe and to make believers believe even more Bodhisattvas who deliver themselves and others in accord with the highest truth should learn these precepts as well However the WorldHonored One has also instituted for voicehearers precepts against certain sins by decree precepts with little work little skillfulness and little benefit to others Bodhisattvas should not learn these precepts as voicehearers should Why not Because voicehearers mainly deliver themselves and abandon others so they should abide by precepts with little work little skillfulness and little benefit to others Bodhisattvas deliver themselves and others so they should not abide by such precepts To benefit people a Bodhisattva may ask for clothing from a Brahmin or a layperson who is neither a relative nor a neighbor He may accept offerings such as clothing or a begging bowl according to the almsgivers financial ability When he begs for clothing he may ask a weaver who is neither a relative nor a neighbor to weave cloth and make clothes for him If a Bodhisattva out of resentment observes voicehearer precepts with little work little skillfulness and little benefit to others it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint Remaining in an Evil Livelihood If a Bodhisattva with a sycophantic mouth and body seeks benefits through an evil livelihood acting or criticizing with no sense of shame or dishonor and is unable to quit it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint If the reason is forgetfulness the transgression does not arise from affliction taint They should neither fear their afflictions nor seek to eradicate them Why not Because Bodhisattvas should seek the great bodhi through birth and death for three asakhyeya kalpas Making such a statement is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint Because how much voicehearers deeply delight in nirvāṇa and fear their afflictions is a billion times less than how much Bodhisattvas deeply delight in nirvāṇa and fear their afflictions While voicehearers seek selfbenefit Bodhisattvas seek benefits for all sentient beings How they train to realize the untainted mind surpasses how Arhats have trained and they remain untainted in the midst of their afflictions Failing to Guard against Criticism Suppose a Bodhisattva fails to guard against or clear himself of criticism or slander ignoring its severity If it is because he has faults and fails to correct them it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint If out of fear of causing them distress he fails to do so it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint However it is not a transgression if one perceives that not subduing them will bring them benefit rather than distress However it is not a transgression if it is a skillful means to tame that person if one knows that he would accept ones apology only for an impure offense if one knows that he antagonistic by nature would be angered by ones apology or if ones knows that he gentle and loving would be embarrassed by ones apology However it is not a transgression if one seeks to use skillful means to end ones resentment even as one cannot help feeling resentful time and again Raising Retinues out of Greed If a Bodhisattva raises retinues out of his greed for their service it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint Greedy for Sleep If a Bodhisattva indolent and negligent enjoys sleeping at the wrong time or does not know the right duration it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint Discussing Worldly Affairs for a Long Time If a Bodhisattva with an afflictiontainted mind discusses worldly affairs for a long time it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint However it is not a transgression if one to protect the state of mind of someone in conversation with others listens to them for a short while or if one gives a short answer to someone asking about things unknown to him If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Unaware of the Five Coverings If a Bodhisattva is unaware that his mind is captured by the five coveringsgreed anger torpor restlessness and doubtit is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint Captivated by Worldly Meditation If a Bodhisattva considers being captivated by the taste of worldly meditation to be a merit it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint Maligning the VoiceHearer Dharma Suppose a Bodhisattva states his view Bodhisattvas should not hear the Dharma in voicehearer sūtras They should not accept it or learn it Bodhisattvas have no use for the Dharma given to voicehearers Making such a statement is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint Because Bodhisattvas should even hear nonBuddhist statements much more the Buddhas words Turning Away from the Mahāyāna to the Hīnayāna If a Bodhisattva abandons Bodhisattva teachings failing to learn them by skillful means and instead always collects and learns the Dharma in voicehearer sūtras it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas but the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Refusing to Learn the Buddhas Teachings If a Bodhisattva abandons the Buddhas teachings refusing to learn them and instead studies worldly texts or nonBuddhist doctrines it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint However it is not a transgression if one is exceptionally intelligent and can learn anything quickly  if one has long learned  not forgetting it if one ponders and understands the meaning  if one has penetrated the Buddha Dharma and acquired unwavering wisdomknowledge or if every day one spends two thirds of ones time on studying Buddhist texts and one third on studying other texts Disbelieving in the Profound Dharma Suppose a Bodhisattva denies the infinite spiritual power of Buddhas and holy Bodhisattvas and rejects and maligns the profound true meaning contained in Bodhisattva teachings claiming that these teachings are not given by the Tathāgata and that they do not benefit people and cannot give them peace or joy The Tathāgata who has the wisdomeye gives people provisional teachings according to their capacities How could I malign His words This Bodhisattva is ignorant If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Failing to Admonish an Evildoer Suppose a Bodhisattva sees someone do evil karmas in this life with a view to receiving benefits in the next life However it is not a transgression if it is a skillful means to tame that person if one offers to requite his kindness but is declined or if one is unable to find means to requite If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Failing to Give Material Goods as Alms Suppose someone asks a Bodhisattva for food drink or clothing If out of anger the Bodhisattva refuses it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Treating Students Improperly If a Bodhisattva accepts students and out of anger fails to teach them in accordance with the Dharma and to provide for them regularly by asking Brahmins or laypeople for food and drink bedding medicine and housing it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint If the reason is indolence negligence or distraction the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Refusing to Support Others If a Bodhisattva out of resentment refuses to support others it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint If the reason is indolence or negligence the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Refusing to Express Sympathetic Joy Suppose a Bodhisattva knows someones merits If out of resentment he neither praises those merits nor tells others about them or if he fails to say very good in his praises it is called a transgression of the precepts against duṣkṛtas a transgression arising from affliction taint If the reason is indolence negligence or distraction the transgression does not arise from affliction taint Failing to Censure Someone Suppose a Bodhisattva sees someone who should be rebuked censured or conquered If the reason is indolence negligence or distraction the transgression does not arise from affliction taint However it is not a transgression if ones display can cause people to be captivated to form the wrong views to go insane or suffer or cause nonBuddhists to slander the holy ones If a Bodhisattva has violated the precept against a duṣkṛta he should repent of his duṣkṛta If he does not repent his transgression becomes a hindrance to observing the Bodhisattva precepts Now I ask you Great Ones Are you pure with respect to these duṣkṛtas Great Ones because you are silent you must be pure Great Ones I have recited the four parājikas and numerous duṣkṛtas  These Bodhisattva precepts the restraining precepts the precepts for doing good dharmas and the precepts for drawing in sentient beingsare pronounced together by Maitreya Bodhisattva in the mātṛkā  They enable one to take the Bodhisattva actions and complete the Bodhisattva Way Those who observe these precepts do not think that the Dharma has reached the Dharmalikeness age or the Dharmaending age They can kindle its true meaning even at its Dharmalikeness age and they can enable the Dharma never to end Their minds truly abide in the Buddha Dharma and they teach and transform sentient beings never tiring They will complete all good karmas and quickly attain Buddha bodhi Having renounced the things of the world It is the seat of all the qualities It is foremost among all the assemblies I prostrate to this Assembly that is pure and full of merits Having venerated the Three Jewels wholeheartedly I also supplicate the saviors of the world Maitreya etc āriputra foremost among sages Subhūti who practices the araṇāsamādhi Now according to my skill I wish to explain The true meaning of Mahāprajñaparamitā I would wish that all people of great merit and noble wisdom Give their full attention to my words Question For what reasons did the Buddha preach the Mo ho pan jo po lo mi king  The Buddhas do not preach the Dharma without a reason or for a futile motive  It is like the Siu mi  king of mountains  which does not tremble without a reason or for a futile cause What then are these solemn reasons that determined the Buddha to preach the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra Answer In the Tripiṭaka the Buddha developed many kinds of comparisons  but when he preached to the śrāvakas he did not speak about the bodhisattva path  It is only in the Tchong a han pen mo king  that the Buddha predicted to bodhisattva Mi lo  Later you will become the Buddha with the name of Maitreya But even there he said nothing about the various bodhisattva practices  Here the Buddha wishes to explain the bodhisattva practices to Maitreya etc and this is why he preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra Moreover there are bodhisattvas who cultivate the concentration of recollection of the Buddhas  In order that they progress in this samādhi the Buddha preached the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra to them Thus in the first chapter of the Prajñāpāramitā it is said Manifesting the basis of his miraculous power  the Buddha emits golden rays that light up in the ten directions universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges  Showing his great body of pure light and of various colors  he fills all of space  In the middle of the assembly  the Buddha is upright  beautiful  peerless  like Sumeru king of the mountains in the center of the great ocean The bodhisattvas seeing this miracle of the Buddha progress ever further in the recollection of the Buddha Furthermore at the moment of his birth  the Bodhisattva emits great rays of light that fill the ten directions  takes seven steps and contemplates the four directions  proclaiming the lions roar  he utters this stanza I have been born my births are ended This is my last existence Central Asian sources I have attained liberation Henceforth I will save beings He decided to leave his parents and left home in order to cultivate the unsurpassed path  In the middle of the night he woke up and considered the ladies of honor and the courtesans of his harem  their bodies appeared like rotting corpses He ordered Tch ni to saddle his white horse At midnight he passed through the ramparts traveled twelve miles and came to the hermitage where the ṛṣi Po kie po  lived With a knife he cut his hair  and exchanged his beautiful garments for a rough cloak He practiced asceticism for six years on the banks of the Ni lien chan river he ate only one sesame seed or one rice grain each day Nevertheless he said to himself This way of life is not the good way  Then the Bodhisattva gave up the practice of asceticism  went to the foot of the tree of enlightenment and sat down on the diamond seat  Māra with his troupe of eighteen nayutas of warriors came to overcome him but the Bodhisattva defeated Māras army  by the power of his wisdom and his qualities  Then he attained supreme perfect enlightenment  The lords of the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhatu ie the Brahmakāyikadevas and their king Che ki  the gods of Rupadhātu Che yi jouan yin  the gods of Kāmadhātu with the Cāturmahārajikas went to the Buddha and invited the Bhagavat to turn the wheel of Dharma  Remembering his former vow of great compassion  the Bodhisattva accepted their invitation and proclaimed the Dharma ie the profound dharmas and the Prajñāpāramitā This is why the Buddha preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra  Furthermore there are people who think that the Buddha is not omniscient  Why The dharmas are infinite and innumerable  how could a single person know them all The Buddha abides in the true Prajñāpāramitā pure as space  in infinite and innumerable texts he himself has given the assurance I am omniscient  I wish to destroy the doubts of all beings  This is why he preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra Furthermore there are beings who could be saved Nevertheless since the great qualities and the great wisdom of the Buddha are immense  hard to understand and hard to fathom  these beings are deceived by evil masters Lapsing into false doctrines  they do not enter into the right path Towards them the Buddha produces a mind of great lovingkindness  he grasps them with the hand of his great compassion and introduces them into the buddhadestiny  This is why he manifests his marvelous qualities and exhibits his great miraculous power  as is said in the first chapter of the Prajñāpāramitā The Buddha enters into the concentration called King of Concentrations  Coming out of that concentration and considering the universes of the ten directions with his divine eye he smiles from all the pores of his skin Wheels with a thousand spokes mark the soles of his feet he sends forth six hundred nayutas of multicolored rays From all parts of his body from the toes of his feet to his cranial protuberance he sends out six hundred nayutas of multicolored rays that in the ten directions light up innumerable and incalculable buddhauniverses as numerous as the sands of the Ganges the Buddha wishes to teach the true nature of all dharmas and cut through the bonds of doubt of all beings This is why he preached the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Furthermore there are evil people given up to feelings of envy  who slander the Buddha by saying The wisdom of the Buddha does not surpass that of men it is just his magic that deceives the world In order to destroy this scornful arrogance and false pride  the Buddha manifests the immense power of his miraculous power and wisdom  My miraculous power has immense qualities and surpasses the threefold world  it is meant for the welfare of all  To form a bad opinion of it is to commit an immense sin  to give pure faith to it is to be assured of the happiness of gods and men and to reach the fruit of nirvāṇa definitively  Furthermore in order that people accept his doctrine the Buddha says to them I am the great teacher  I possess the ten strengths and the four fearlessesses  I am established in the abodes of the saints  my mind enjoys the masteries  Uttering the lions roar I turn the wheel of the Dharma  in all the universes I am the supreme being  Moreover it is for the joy of beings that the Buddha preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra He says to them You should experience great joy Because all beings enter into the net of false views  they are all deceived by bad heretical teachers  I have escaped from the deceptive net of all bad teachers The great teacher who possesses the ten strengths is difficult to find Today you have found him I will reveal to you the basket of the profound dharmas  ie the thirtyseven wings of enlightenment  etc you will gather them as you wish  Furthermore all beings are afflicted by the sicknesses of the fetters  In the course of beginningless transmigration  never has anyone been able to cure these sicknesses that are misunderstood by the bad heretical teachers Today I have appeared in the world as the great king of physicians  I have compounded the medicine of the Dharma  and you should take it This is why the Buddha preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra Furthermore there are people who think The Buddha is just like ordinary people like them he is subject to transmigration  he really experiences the pains of hunger  thirst  cold and heat  old age and sickness  In order to suppress such concepts the Buddha preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra and says My body is inconceivable  Brahmā king of the gods etc the gods and the ancients for periods as numerous as the sands of the Ganges have tried to measure my body and find the range of my voice  they were unable to test it and still less my wisdom and my samādhi Some stanzas say The true nature of dharmas Brahmā devarāja All the gods and princes of the earth Misunderstand it are unable to understand it The profound marvelous Dharma Noone can test it The Buddha has come to reveal it Its light is like the brilliance of the sun Moreover when the Buddha turned the wheel of the Dharma  bodhisattvas from foreign regions came to examine the Buddhas body which surpasses space and the immense buddhafields  Having come from the universe of the Buddha Houa chang  they saw the body of the Buddha and exclaimed Space is infinite So are the qualities of the Buddha To want to measure his body Would be an endless task He surpasses the world of space And the immense buddhafields To see the body of the Lion of the ākyas Is just that and none other The body of the Buddha is like a mountain of gold He sends out great rays He is adorned with the major and the minor marks Like a garland of lotuses in springtime If the Buddhas body is immense  so also are his rays  his voice  his morality  his samādhis his wisdom and his other buddha qualities  Refer to the three mysteries explained in the Mi tsi king  on which it will be necessary to enlarge Furthermore at the time of his birth the Buddha came down to the earth took seven steps and spoke some words then was silent But why was the Buddha born if before birth he was already able to talk and walk and afterwards he could not the Buddha manifests human behaviors and adopts the human positions so that beings will believe in his profound Dharma If the Bodhisattva were able to walk and talk as soon as he was born people would say This man that we see is extraordinary  he must be a god  a nāga or a demon  The doctrine which he professes is certainly not within our reach Transmigrating and fleshly beings as we are in the grasp of the activities of the fetters  we do not have the capacity for it who among us could attain such a profound Dharma Victims of their own modesty these people cannot become firm adepts of the holy Dharma  It is for them that the Buddha is born in the Lan pi ni yuan  Although he might have gone directly to the tree of enlightenment and become Buddha there he pretended by skillful means to act as a child  as an adolescent  as a youg man and as a grown man childish play  study of the arts  householders duty  enjoyment of the five objects of desire  Endowed with human faculties he contemplates the painful spectacle of old age  sickness and death and experiences revulsion  for them In the middle of the night he passed outside the ramparts left home and went to the ṛṣis Yu to ie and A lo lo  Having always had the superknowledges  he recalled his former existence when at the time of the Buddha Kia cho  he followed the path of discipline  nevertheless for the moment he pretended to practice asceticism and searched for the path for six years Although he reigns over the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu the Bodhisattva pretended to destroy Māras army and attain the supreme path  It is in order to conform to the human condition that he manifested all these transformations  But here in the Prajñāpāramitā he manifested the great power of his superknowledges and wisdom  in that way people will know that the Buddhas body is incalculable and surpasses all the worlds  Moreover there are people who could be saved but who sometimes fall into the two extremes  whether out of ignorance  they seek only bodily pleasures  or whether by the path of activity  they give themselves up to asceticism  From the absolute point of view  these people lose the right path of nirvāṇa In order to extirpate these twofold extremes and introduce people into the middle path  the Buddha preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Furthermore he preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra to mark the difference in retribution between worship of the body of birth and the worship of the body of the Dharma  Furthermore he preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra so that future centuries will honor the Prajñāpāramitā and in order to predict the Three Vehicles  Thus the Buddha said to A nan  After my nirvāṇa this Prajñāpāramitā will go to the south  from the south it will go to the west  in five hundred years it will go to the north  There will be many believers there The sons and daughters of good family will offer flowers  incense  garlands  standards  banners  music  lamps  jewels and other riches  They will write it preach it study it listen to it reflect on it meditate on it and worship it in the usual ways For this reason these people will enjoy all kinds of worldly happiness  will obtain the three vehicles without delay and enter into nirvāṇawithoutresidue  Furthermore the Buddha preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra to explain the absolute point of view  in the Buddhadharma there are realities of mundane order realities of individual order realities of antidotal order and realities of absolute order Real dharmas resulting from causes and conditions exist but do not have a nature distinct from these causes and conditions A mind is able to save a mind another man is able to save a mind the practice of good and wisdom is the best savior Also the Buddha has said in the Ping cha wang ying king  From the night when he acquired the Path to the night of the parinirvāṇa every teaching given by the Buddha is true and not false Now if the individual did not Pāli truly exist why would the Buddha say  With my divine eye I consider beings Question The absolute point of view is true and because it is true it is called absolute the other points of view cannot be true Answer That is not correct The true nature  the nature of phenomena  the summit of existence  do not exist from the mundane point of view but they do exist from the absolute point of view In the same way individuals exist from the mundane point of view but do not exist from the absolute point of view When the five aggregates that are the causes and conditions for the individual exist the individual exists Just as when the color  odor  taste and tangible that are the causes and conditions for milk exist the milk exists If milk did not really exist the causes and conditions for milk would not exist either But since the causes and conditions for milk really do exist it too must exist Since the causes and conditions for a second head or a third hand do not exist in humans it is out of the question for them Such characterizations consitute the mundane point of view b What is the individual point of view  Thus a sūtra says As a result of actions of different retribution  one is reborn in different universes  one experiences different contacts and different feelings  On the other hand the Po kiun na king says How do these two sūtras agree Answer There are people who doubt the hereafter  who do not believe in sin or merit  who commit evil acts and who fall into the wrong view of annihilation  In order to cut these doubts  to suppress these bad practices and uproot this Later it was accepted that the Bhagavat teaches by an instaneous emission of voice  or even that he does not speak at all cf But Phālguna himself believed in the existence of a soul  the existence of the purusa  and had fallen into the wrong view of eternalism  Venerable One  who is it that experiences sensation If the Buddha had replied Characteristics such as these are called the individual point of view c The antidotal point of view  There are dharmas that exist as counteragents but do not exist as true natures  Thus hot  fatty  acidic  salty plants and foods are a counteragent in illnesses of wind  but are not not a remedy in other sicknesses Cold  sweet  bitter  acrid plants and foods are a counteragent in illnesses of fire but are not a remedy in other illnesses Acidic  bitter  acrid and hot plants and foods are a countergent for chills but are not a remedy in other illnesses It is the same in the Buddhadharma to remedy sickness of the mind  Contemplation of the disgusting  is a good counteragent in the sickness of attachment  it is not good in the sickness of hatred and is not a remedy  Aśubhabhāvana is the contemplation of bodily defects  if a hateful man contemplates the faults of his enemy he increases the flame of his hatred Meditation on lovingkindness is a good remedy in the sickness of hatred  it is not good not a remedy in the sickness of attachment  Lovingkindness consists of seeking reasons for love for others and contemplating their qualities  If a person full of attachment seeks the reasons for love and contemplates the qualities  he increases his attachment  The contemplation of causes and conditions is a good counteragent in the sickness of delusion  it is not good not a remedy in the sicknesses of hatred and attachment  Because it is as a result of previous wrong contemplation that wrong view arises Wrong view is delusion  Question In the Buddadharma it is said that the twelve causes and conditions are profound  Thus the Buddha said to nanda This dependent arising is profound  difficult to see  difficult to understand  difficult to discover  difficult to penetrate  knowable only by a sage of subtle and skillful avoids hurting them with the teeth of the heresy of self as a real thing The comparison of the tigress is from Kumāralābha in Kośa IX p mind  If a fool can barely understand superficial phenomena how could he understand profound causes and conditions Then why do you say that the fool should contemplate the law of causes and conditions Answer The word fool does not mean stupid in the manner of an ox or sheep  The fool is a person who is seeking the true path but who as a result of wrong thoughts and contemplations produces all kinds of wrong views  For him contemplation of causes and conditions is a good counteragent But for people prey to hatred or passion who voluntarily seek pleasure or are angry with their neighbor such a contemplation is not good is not a remedy it is contemplation of the disgusting or contemplation of lovingkindness which would be a good remedy for them Because these two contemplations are able to uproot the poisonous thorn of hatred and attachment  Furthermore there are beings attached to the erroneous thesis of eternalism  who are ignorant of the series of similar moments  For such people contemplation of the transitory nature of the dharmas is of therapeutic order and not of absolute order Because all dharmas are empty of self nature  Thus a stanza says To see the permanent in the transitory That is a mistake In emptiness in the point of the transitory How could permanence be seen there Question Conditioned dharmas  by virtue of the marks of arising  duration and cessation  first arise then last and finally perish why do you say that the trasitory is unreal Answer Conditioned dharmas cannot have these three marks  Because these three marks are not real If birth duration and cessation were marks of the conditioned these three marks would equally have to be present at the arising of the conditioned for arising is a mark of the conditioned In the same way these three marks each would equally have to be present separately everywhere which would be absurd It would be the same for duration and cessation Since birth duration and cessation taken separately do not each have birthdurationcessation they cannot be called marks of the conditioned  Why Because the marks of conditioned dharmas do not exist Consequently the transitory nature of dharmas is not of the absolute order Furthermore if every real entity were transitory  retribution of actions could not take place Just as as a rotten seed cannot produce a fruit  thus there would be no action and the act not existing how could there be retribution  Now every good doctrine accepts retribution That which should be believed by a person of good knowledge should not be denied Therefore the dharmas are not transitory For innumerable reasons of this kind we say that the transitoriness of the dharmas cannot be affirmed What is said here about the alleged transitory characteristic of the dharmas is also true for their nature of suffering  of nonself  etc Characteristics of this kind are called the therapeutic point of view Every essence  every category of speech  every dharma and adharma may be subdivided  broken into pieces and scattered  one after the other but the true Dharma  the domain of the buddhas pratyekabuddhas and arhats can neither be broken apart nor scattered By understood is meant the absence of any defect  unchangeability  invincibility  Why If the refusal to accept the system of another Is the action of a fool  Then all the teachers Are in truth fools If being based on personal views In order to produce futile nonsense Constituted pure knowledge Literature II p It is said that ordinary people depend on wrong views  on systems  on theories and therefore stir up quarrels  Futile nonsense is the origin of quarrels and futile nonsense gives birth to wrong views  A stanza says Because one adopts systems there are quarrels If noone accepted anything what could they discuss By accepting or rejecting views People are all divided The yogin who knows this does not accept any system  does not accept any nonsense  adheres to nothing and believes in nothing Not really taking part in any discussion  he knows the taste of the ambrosia of the Buddhadharma To act otherwise is to reject the doctrine If all of those who do not accept the systems of others  who do not know them and who do not adopt them were ignoramuses then all the masters would be ignoramuses Such for example are the mundane penal laws  by virtue of which executioners carry out punishments  executions and impurities of all kinds Worldly people accept them and hold them to be absolutely pure whereas others pravrajitas and āryas consider them to be impure According to the ccustoms of the tīrthikas and the pravrajitas one stays between five fires one stands on one leg one tears out ones hair etc What the Ni kien tseu hold as reasonable other people call foolishness In the various systems of the tīrthikas pravrajitas śvetābaras brāhmanas etc each considers good what his neighbor denigrates In the Buddhist system as well there are Tou tseu bhikṣus who say Just as there is a dharma eye by the coming together of the four great elements  so there is a dharma individual  from the coming together of the five aggregates  In the Tou tseu a pi tan it is said The five aggregates are not separate from the pudgala and the pudgala is not separate from the five aggregates Furthermore the eighteen elements  the twelve bases of consciousness and the five aggregates truly exist but the pudgala is not found among them On the other hand in the Buddhist system the adepts of the Fang kouang say This is true the rest is false idam eva saccaṃ mogham aññaṃ It is their own system that they accept it is their own system that they respect  it their own system that they practice  these teachers were pure and attained the absolute good then there would not be any impure teachers for they are all of them attached to a system Question Answer It is the path that transcends all discourse  the arrest and destruction of the functioning of the mind  the absence of any support  the nondeclaration of the dharmas  the true nature of the dharmas dharmāṇāṃ satyalakṣaṇam the absence of beginning middle and end  indestructibility  inalterability  The end of discourse The arrest of the functioning of the mind Nonarising and nondestruction Dharmas similar to nirvāṇa Speaking about subjects promoting action  Those are mundane systems Everything is true everything is false Everything is both true and false at the same time Everything is both false and true at the same time That is the true nature of the dharmas In various sūtras of this kind it is said that the absolute point of view has a profound meaning difficult to see  difficult to understand  The Buddha preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra to explain  Furthermore the Buddha has preached the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra because he wanted the brahmacārin Tchang tchao  and other great masters  eg Sien ni po tso kiu to lo  and Sa tch kia mo kien ti  to have faith in the Buddhadharma These great masters of Yen feou ti said that all the treatises can be refuted all the confused affirmations and all the twisted beliefs  and consequently there is no true religion deserving of belief or respect  āriputas uncle  called Mo ho kiu tche lo  in a discussion with his sister Ch li  reflected thus My sister is not very strong she may become pregnant with a sage who would borrow his mothers mouth in order to speak If he is wise before he is even born what will he be like after birth when he is grown up This thought hurt his pride and in order to increase his knowledge he left home and became a brahmacārin He went to southern India and began to study the great treatises  People asked him I want to study the eighteen great treatises in depth They replied Previously I acted out of pride because I was outshone by my sister again today these men are covering me with shame  For two reasons I take an oath henceforth not to cut my nails before I have exhausted the eighteen treatises Seeing his long nails people called him the brahmacārin Long Nails  By the wisdom that he derived from treatises of all kinds this man refuted by every means Dharma and Adharma compulsory and optional true and false being and nonbeing Like an enraged mighty elephant whose raging trampling cannot be directed the brahmacārin Dīrghanakha having triumphed over all the teachers by the power of his knowledge returned to Mo kie to  to Wang ch in the public square  From the age of eight years your nephew has exhausted the study of all the treatises  When he was sixteen his learning triumphed over everybody But a monk of the Che clan  called Kiu tan made him his disciple At this news filled with scorn and disbelief  Dīrghanakha exclaimed If my nephew is so intelligent  by what trick has this Gautama succeeded in shaving his head for him and in making him his disciple Having said this he went at once to the Buddha At that moment having been ordained a fortnight ago  Ch li fou was standing behind the Buddha fan in hand  fanning the Buddha The brahmacārin Dīrghanakha saw the Buddha and having exchanged salutations with him  sat down to the side He thought All treatises can be refuted all refutation can be confounded and all beliefs can be overcome Then what is the true nature of the dharmas What is self nature  Such questions are tantamount to wanting to empty the depths of the ocean He who attempts them will be a long time without discovering a single reality capable of affecting the intellect By what teaching was this Gautama able to win over my nephew Having reflected thus he said to the Buddha No thesis is acceptable to you then even this view is not acceptable to you The Buddha meant You have already drunk the poison of false views  Now expel the traces of this poison  You say that no thesis is pleasing to you but this view does not please you Then like a fine horse which on seeing the shadow of the whip  rouses itself and goes back to the proper route in the face of this shadow of the whip that is the Buddhas speech  the brahmacārin Dīrghanakha collected himself and laid aside all pride  shameful and with drooping head he thought If I adopted this view that would be a manifest lie  a gross nigrahasthāna known to many people The second nigrasthāna is more subtle  I will adopt it because fewer people know it Having reflected thus he said to the Buddha Completely pure  he suppresses all subjects of debate  he has attained the great and profound Dharma  he is worthy of respect  The purity of his mind is absolute  And as the Buddha by preaching the doctrine to him had cut through his wrong views  Dīrghanakha at once became free of dust and defilements and acquired the perfectly pure Dharmaeye  Also at that moment āriputra who had been following this conversation became an arhat The brahmacārin Dīrghanakha left home and became a monk  he became a very powerful arhat If the brahmacārin Dīrghanakha had not heard the Prajñāpāramitā preached the powerful doctrine excluding the four alternatives  and dealing with the absolute  he would not have had faith Therefore it is in order to convert the great teachers and men of sharp faculties that the Buddha preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra Furtherrnore the Buddhas have two ways of preaching the Dharma they take into account the minds of their listeners and adapt themselves to the beings to be converted   the nature of the dharmas Here the Buddha preaches the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra in order to speak about the true nature of the dharmas Thus it is said in the chapter of the Siang pou siang that the gods asked the Buddha This Prajñāpāramitā is profound  what is its nature  The Buddha repied to the gods It is empty  Again there are two ways of preaching the Dharma  dealing with argumentative subjects   dealing with pacifying subjects  In dealing with argumentative subjects one will refer back to what has been said in other sūtras Here the Buddha preaches the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra to shed light on pacifying subjects the Prajñāpāramitā has a nature of existence and of nonexistence  it is both substantial and nonsubstantial  with support and without support  offering resistance and not offering resistance  lower and higher  cosmic and acosmic Question With his predisposition of great lovingkindness and compassion  the Buddha should deal exclusively with pacifying subjects  why does he also speak about contentious subjects  Answer The pacifying points of the doctrine are all without nature  eternal  calm  ineffable  Here the Buddha preaches on generosity and the other  on the transitory dharmas suffering  emptiness  etc All these subjects are calm and are omitted in fruitless discussions  that is why he preaches them People of sharp faculties understand the Buddhas intention do not stir up quarrels  People of weak faculties do not understand the Buddhas intention grasping at characteristics  attached to their own ideas  they seek to quarrel with this Prajñāpāramitā But since these dharmas are absolutely empty  there is no subject to quarrel with there If absolute emptiness could be grasped it would not be absolute emptiness That is why the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra is called a pacifying subject  for with its twofold characteristic of existence and nonexistence  the Prajñāpāramitā is peaceful  Furthermore the dharmas are often arranged in other sūtras into three categories good  bad and nondefined  Here the Buddha wishes to speak about the nature of dharmas which is neither good nor bad nor nondefined that is why he preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra It is the same for the other categories of three dharmas The bodhisattva who attributes an eternal function to color is not practicing the Prajñāpāramitā It is the same for all groups of six seven eight or an infinite number of dharmas Just as the Mahāprajñāpāramitā is infinite and unlimitled  so are the reasons for preaching also infinite and limitless for such material is vast Answer The Buddhadharma is a great sea  faith is its entry  knowledge is its ferryman  Evam is a synonym for faith Furthermore the Buddhas doctrine is profound and distant it requires a Buddha to understand it Without being a Buddha the believer can enter into the Buddhas doctrine by the power of faith  Thus Fan tien wang invited the Buddha to turn the wheel of the doctrine  He invited him with this stanza In Jambudvīpa at one time there appeared Many impure doctrines Open the gate of immortality Preach the pure path The Buddha replied with this stanza My doctrine is very difficult to grasp It is able to cut through the fetters Those whose minds are attached to the desire of the triple world Are unable to understand it Brahmādevarāja said to the Buddha O Venerable One  in the universe  knowledge is of superior middling or inferior category People of sensitive and upright mind can easily obtain salvation If these people do not hear the doctrine preached they fall into grave difficulties It is like the lotus in the water some are born some ripen some remain within the water without emerging If they do not have sunlight  they do not expand  The Buddha is like  sent forth by his great loving kindness and great compassion  that he might have pity for beings and preach the doctrine The Buddha recalled the qualities of the buddhas of the three times  past  future and present  all of whom preached the doctrine in order to save beings I too said he must do the same After having had this thought  he accepted Brahmādevarājas and the other gods invitation and preached the doctrine The Bhagavat replied with this stanza Now I open the gate to the immortal The faithful shall obtain joy I preach the wonderful doctrine to men I do not preach in order to harm anyone beautiful of all forests  In this stanza the Buddha does not say that it is the generous person who will obtain joy or the person with knowledge  morality  patience  energy  dhyāna or wisdom  The Buddha is speaking only of the faithful His intention is the following My supreme profound doctrine is subtle  immense  incalculable  inconceivable  immoveable  without support  without attachment and without perceived object  But it is not true that the omniscient one is unable to explain it That is why in the Buddhas doctrine the power of faith is primordial It is by faith that one enters into it and not by generosity  discipline  patience  energy  dhyāna or wisdom  Thus some stanzas say In this world the mind of beings is changeable They love the rewards of merit But they dread meritorious action They seek existence and avoid destruction First they listen to doctrines from wrong views Their mind becomes attached to it and they penetrate it deeply My doctrine is very profound Without faith how can it be understood Thus the great disciples Ti po ta  Kiu kia li  etc not having faith in the Dharma fell into the evil destinies  These men had no faith in the Buddhas doctrine and were unable to discover it by their own wisdom  Because the Buddhas doctrine is profound  Thus Brahmādevarāja uttered this stanza to Kokālika You want to measure the incommensurable doctrine The wise man has nothing to measure He who wants to measure the incommensurable doctrine Is nothing but a dull worldling  The person whose mind in animated by correct faith can understand the doctrine Otherwise he understands nothing A stanza says The listener of pure and clear attention Attentively follows the discussions Leaping for joy he hears the doctrine his mind full of joy That is the sort of person to whom it should be preached Present happiness  future happiness  the happiness of nirvāṇa  all happiness has its roots in very powerful faith Furthermore all religious heretics imagine that their own doctrine is subtle and absolutely pure  These people exalt the doctrine that they practice and denigrate that of others That is why here below they quarrel and argue after death they fall into hell and suffer immense pain of all kinds A stanza says Attached to their own doctrine They blame that of other people Even by observing moral conduct They do not escape from the torment of hell In the Buddhas doctrine all attachment  all false views  all pride of self  is abandoned and cut one becomes detached from them If you have understood the sermon on the comparison with the raft  you must abandon the holy Dharma and a fortiori adharma The Buddha himself is not attached to the Prajñāpāramitā why then would he be attached to other doctrines That is why Buddhist texts begin with the word Evam The intention of the Buddha is as follows My disciples will not love the doctrine will not become attached to the doctrine will not have factions  They will seek only freedom from suffering  deliverance  the nature of dharmas free of empty discussions  Thus in the A ta po ki king  Mo kien ti nan spoke this stanza To defined dharmas Various notions are wrongly applied Rejecting inner and outer How will the Path be attained The Buddha replied It is not by view  tradition  knowledge Or morality that it is attained It is not by absence of view tradition etc Nor by absence of morality that it is attained It is by abandoning all this chatter By also rejecting the me and the mine  By not grasping any real nature  That the Path can be attained If it is not by view tradition etc Nor by morality that it is attained If it is not by absence of view tradition etc Nor by absence of morality that it is attained Then according to my reasoning It is by observing a doctrine of silence that the Path is attained The Buddha replied You are depending on wrong views I am aware that you are deluded about the Path You have not seen the deceptive notion Consequently you will be silent Furthermore to say My doctrine is true  the other doctrines are deceptive  my doctrine is absolute  the others are wrong  Here the term Evam designates a doctrine free of quarreling listening to the words of others it declares This man is not wrong That is why the Buddhist sūtras begin with Evam Let us now speak about the word Mayā Question In the Buddhas doctrine it is said that all dharmas are empty and without a substantial self  Why do the Buddhist sūtras begin with the words Thus have I heard Answer Although the disciples of the Buddha understood the nonexistence of self  they conform to current usage and speak of a self  But this ātman is not a true ātman Thus there is nothing ridiculous in exchanging copper coins for gold coins  In a system the anātman we can talk about the ātman by conforming to current usage  we do not incur any blame Thus a stanza of the Tien wen king says If he is an arhat bhikṣu Whose impurities have been destroyed And who is in his very last existence Can he say It is I The Buddha replies An arhat bhikṣu Whose impurities have been destroyed And who is in his very last existence Can say It is I In current usage  we speak of the ātman but not from the absolute  true point of view for all dharmas are empty and devoid of substantial self  The first two are impure  the third is pure  In all worldly people  the three types of language wrong views pride and convention exist In the śaikṣas on the path of seeing  there are two types of language that of pride and that of convention Rejecting the wrong views of the world  they conform to usage and avoid quarrels  thus they reject the other two impure roots of language By conforming to the world they use only one kind of language ie conventional language The Buddhas disciples who speak about the ātman by conforming to usage are not committing a fault If according to you all dharmas are truly without substantial self  how can you say Thus have I heard But here the disciples of the Buddha do not cling to emptiness and the nonexistence of all dharmas Neither do they cling to the real nature of dharmas nor a fortiori to the doctrine of anātman That is why they cannot be reproached or asked why they speak of self Thus in the Tching louen  some stanzas say If there were something nonempty There should be something empty But if the nonempty does not exist How would the empty exist The fool who sees the nonempty Then sees the empty as well Not having positive views or negative views Is truly nirvāṇa Nonduality  the gates of security  The destruction of wrong views The domain surveyed by the Buddhas That is the doctrine of anātman Let us now speak about the word rutam Question Does it mean by means of the earorgan  or by means of the auditory consciousness  or by means of the mental consciousness  If it is the earorgan that hears that being without intellect  the earorgan cannot hear If it is the auditory consciousness that hears the objection will be made that lasting but a moment  the auditory consciousness is incapable of concept and cannot hear If it is the mental consciousness that hears the objection will be made that the mental consciousness in turn cannot hear The first five consciousnesses visual auditory olfactory gustatory and tactile consciousnesses recognize the five gross objects ie color sound odor taste and tangible it is only afterwards that the mental consciousness recognizes  The mental consciousness is unable to cognize the five gross objects actually present  it cognizes only those that are past or future  If the mental consciousness could cognize the five gross objects actually present blind people and deaf people could cognize colors and sounds  Because their mental consciousness is not destroyed Answer Neither the earorgan  nor the auditory consciousness  nor the mental consciousness are able to hear sounds The coming together of many causes and conditions is necessary to be able to hear sounds It cannot be said that one single consciousness this was heard by virtue of a consciousness commonly called auditory activity mayā savanakicca viññāṇasamaṅginā puggalena viññāṇavasena laddhasavanakiccavohārena sutaṃ dharma hears sounds The earorgan lacking intellect  cannot hear sounds the consciousnesses both auditory consciousness as well as mental  being nonmaterial  offering no resistance and outside of space  are not able to hear sounds Sound itself lacking intellect and lacking the organ  cannot hear sounds But if the earorgan is intact when the sound reaches the auditory field and when the manas wants to hear the coming together of the object and the manas determines the arising of an auditory consciousness  Following this auditory consciousness there arises a mental consciousness that can analyze all types of causes and conditions and succeeds in hearing sounds This is why the objection cannot be made The nonexistence of the agent  of the action and of the fruit Is the absolute and profound law That the Buddha was able to discover There is emptiness but not annihilation  Continuity  but not eternity  Sin and merit  and not destruction  Let us now speak about Ekasmin Question In the same way the Buddha spoke about oneness in many places Therefore it must exist Furthermore it is by association with the dharma oneness that a substance is said to be one If the dharma oneness did not truly exist why does a single substance invoke the notion of oneness unity and not of duality or threeness Why do two substances evoke the notion of duality and not of oneness or of threeness Why do three substances evoke the notion of threeness and not of duality or of oneness If numbers really did not exist a single substance would be able to evoke the notion of twoness two substances would be able to evoke the notion of oneness and similarly for three four five six etc That is why we know with certainty that a substance one possesses the dharma oneness and that by association with this dharma this substance one engenders the notion of oneness Answer There is a fault both in the case that oneness is identical with substance and in the case that oneness is different from substance Question If are the same what is the fault Answer If a vase is synonymous with oneness in the way that Yin ti li is synonymous with Che kia  then wherever there is oneness there must be a vase as everywhere where there is Indra there must be akra Henceforth all substances cloth  etc will be vase and oneness Since the vase is oneness wherever there is oneness there must be vase and not only vase but also cloth etc because all of them being single substance they are not different  Furthermore oneness being a numberdharma  the vase also must be a number Since the nature of the vase involves five attributes  oneness also will involve five attributes  wherever there is oneness there is no question of the vase It is not necessary that the vase be oneness since to speak of oneness is not to include the vase therein and to speak of the vase is not to include oneness therein Finally if the vase and oneness were not different then to speak of oneness one would be talking about the vase and to speak about the vase one would be talking about oneness Question If were identical those would be the faults But if they are different where is the fault Answer If oneness were different from the vase the vase would be that which is not oneness ie it would be multiple aneka If the vase were different from oneness oneness would be everything that is not the vase If the vase united with oneness is called one why is oneness united with the vase not called vase This is why we cannot say that the vase is different from oneness Question It is because it is united with the number one that the vase is one but oneness does not make the vase Answer Numbers begin with oneness oneness is different from the vase that is why the vase is not oneness Since oneness does not exist plurality does not exist either Because oneness precedes plurality Thus the difference or the identity cannot be established In both cases if we look for a dharma oneness we cannot find it and since we cannot find it how could it be included in the list of aggregates  elements and bases of consciousness  Only so as to conform with current usage do the disciples of the Buddha speak of oneness but their minds do not truly cling to it they know that the dharma number has a conventional existence  This is why when the Buddhist texts talk about a man ekaḥ pudgala a teacher a time  they do not fall into the error of wrong views  Let us now speak about Samaye Why does the Buddha say samaya and not kāla Answer If he said kāla there would be uncertainty Question For ease of elocution he ought to have said kāla because kāla has only two syllables whereas samaya has three and is harder to pronounce Answer It is in order to avoid wrong views that he said samaya and not kāla Indeed some say that all beings in heaven and earth have kāla as cause Thus some stanzas in the Che king say Time passes and beings ripen Time passes and beings grow Time can understand men That is why time is cause The universe is like the wheel of a chariot Time revolves like the turning wheel Man also is like the chariot wheel Furthermore some say Even if all beings in heaven and on earth and all substances are not created by time nevertheless time is immutable  That is why it truly exists Although time is not seen it is possible to know its existence for it is by seeing the effect that one knows the existence of the cause  That is why a dharma time exists and as this dharma time is immutable  it is eternal  Answer Present time is like a ball of clay  past time like the dust of the earth and future time like the vase  Since time is eternal  the past does not make the future for according to your texts time is a single substance  This is why the past does not make the future or the present for they are confused with the past In the past there is no future That is why there is no future or present Question You accept that that the past to the dust of the earth If there is a past there must necessarily be a future Answer You have not understood what I have just said The future is the vase the past is the dust of the earth The future does not make the past because by falling into the characteristics of the future it becomes future and then why would it be called past That is why the past does not exist Question Why should time not exist There must necessarily be a time The present has the characteristics of the present the past has the characteristics of the past and the future has the characteristics of the future Answer If the three times each had their own characteristics  they would always be present and there would be neither past nor future If the future existed presently it would not be called future but indeed present That is why your thesis does not hold Question The past and the future do not function with the nature of the present the past functions with the nature of the past and the future with the nature of the future That is why there is a time for each nature separately  Answer If the past has passed it loses the nature of the past if the past has not passed it does not have the nature of the past It is the same for the future That is why the dharma time is not real How could it produce the beings of heaven and earth flowers  fruits and other substances  do not speak about kāla but about samaya in order to dispel wrong views of this kind We speak metaphorically about time with regard to birth  the elements and bases of consciousness  but there is no distinct time  That is why mundane conventional dharmas of purely nominal existence must be excluded Question If time does not exist why is it permissible to eat at the proper time and forbidden to eat at the wrong time  Those are common disciplines  Answer there is a time but it is not a real dharma You cannot object to that Besides the disciplines imposed by the Vinaya are true for the world without having the nature of an absolute real dharma  for the ātman and the dharmas do not really exist  But in order to moderate the impatience of the community  in order to protect the Buddhist doctrine and ensure its longevity  in order to regulate the disciples rituals the Bhagavats of the triple world have set up prohibitions the subject of which one should not question whether it is true or conventional  what is associated or dissociated  what is a dharma with such and such a characteristic or without that characteristic That is why no objection can be made there Question Why not say samaya Lay people do not understand the expression in the Vinaya how then could the heretics understand it Everybody understands the expression samaya in the other texts Therefore by saying samaya they are prevented from producing wrong views Samaya is a contrived word kāla likewise is a metaphorical expression  Besides in the Buddhist texts the word samaya is often used and rarely the word kāla Since its use is rare no objection can be made The meaning of the five words Evaṃ mayā śrutaṃ ekasmin samaye has thus been explained in brief  Now let us explain the expression Evaṃ mayā śrutam ekasmin samaye as a whole  Thus have I heard at one time Question The Buddhas are omniscient  independent and without a teacher  they do not follow the teaching of others  they do not adopt the doctrines of others  they do not use borrowed systems  They preach the Buddhadharma without having heard it from another How can they say Thus have I heard  Answer  As you have said the Buddha is omniscient independent without a teacher he preaches the Dharma without having heard it from another But the Buddhist doctrine is not the only utterance that has come from the mouth of the Buddha  it is also all the truths and all the good words propagated in the world  Skillful words  well spoken come forth everywhere in the Buddhadharma Thus the Buddha said in the Vinaya What is the Buddhadharma the Che ti t tao king  the Buddha said to Kiao che kia  The truths  good words  words that are skillful and well spoken spread throughout the world all constitute my doctrine Finally it is said in the Tsan fa kie  The good words in the world Are all derived from the Buddhadharma These good words are faultless And are no different from the words of the Buddha Although they are found elsewhere These are good words faultless They are all Fragments of the Buddhadharma Even among heretics There can be good words Thus the insect that gnaws wood Soon takes on the name  The doctrine of beginning middle and end sanction Dharmagupta Vinaya Sseu fen liu T  k a The destruction of specific and general characteristics Is like the iron that comes out of the gangue Then we would believe That the works of heretics Themselves contain good words Good and true words All come from the Buddha Like the perfume of the sandal wood Comes from Mo li chan Withhold Mo li chan And there would be no more sandalwood Similarly withhold the Buddha And there would be no further good words Furthermore the phrase Evaṃ mayā śrutam is an expression used by the disciples of the Buddha such as A nan  etc Since it partakes of the marks of the Buddhadharma it is called Buddhadharma Thus the Buddha at the time of his parinirvāṇa was at Kiu yi na kie between two Sa lo trees lying with his head to the north the Buddha was about to enter into nirvāṇa At that time nanda still under the influence of the afflictions  had not yet dispelled or eliminated passion  His heart was plunged into a sea of sadness from which he was unable to come out Then the sthavira A ni lou teou said to nanda You keeper of the basket of the Buddhist texts you ought not to founder in a sea of sadness like an ordinary person  All conditioned dharmas are transitory in nature  You should not be sad Moreover the Buddha has entrusted the doctrine to you and now in your despair you forget the task which he entrusted to you Therefore ask the Buddha the following questions After the Buddhas parinirvāṇa what path shall we follow Who will be our teacher  our critic and our guide  What words will we place at the beginning of our Buddhist texts You should ask the Buddha about these things to come  When nanda heard this advice his sadness decreased a little and he found the strength to think about the path He helped the Buddha to lie at the edge of the bed and asked him these questions The Buddha said to nanda Henceforth after my departure you yourself will be your own refuge  the Dharma will be your refuge  and you will have no other refuge  How O bhikṣu will you be your own refuge how will the Dharma be your refuge and how will you have no other refuge The bhikṣu considers his own body  he always dedicates to it his full attention  his wisdom  his zeal  his energy and he rejects the worldly desires and resulting dissatisfactions  The same for the smṛtyupasthānas of feeling  mind and dharmas Then it can be said that this bhikṣu is himself his own refuge goes to the Dharma for refuge and has no other refuge Henceforth the Kiai to kiai king will be your great teacher  You should carry out bodily activities and vocal actions according to the instructions of the Pratimokṣasūtra After my Nirvāṇa your guide  O bhikṣu will be the punishment according to the rule of Brahmā  If someone is in a state of mind of panic  he should be taught the Chan to kia tcgan yen king  then he will be able to obtain the Path When the Buddha entered into nirvāṇa the earth trembled six times the rivers reversed their courses a violent wind blew up in a tempest black clouds arose on the horizon in the four directions There was thunder and lightning hail and rain came down in floods here and there stars fell Lions and other wild beasts began to howl gods and men uttered great moans all wailing The Buddha has passed into Nirvāṇa the eye of the world is extinguished At the same time plants forests grasses trees flowers and leaves suddenly split open Sumeru king of mountains trembled from its very base Waves rose up in the sea the earth quaked terribly Mountains and cliffs crumbled trees snapped and smoke arose from the four quarters of the horizon There was great panic Ponds and rivers became soiled with mud The stars appeared in full daylight People began to wail the gods lamented the goddesses choked with their tears The śaikṣas suffered in silence the aśaikṣas told one another that all conditioned dharmas are transitory  Thus the gods mānuṣas yakṣhas rākṣasas gandharvas kiṃnaras mahoragas and nāgas all felt great sadness The arhats who had crossed the sea of old age  sickness and death said to one another We have crossed the river of worldly passions We have destroyed old age sickness and death with disgust We have seen that the body is a chest containing four great serpents Now let us enter into the nirvāṇa of cessation without residue The great arhats everywhere gave up their bodies at will in the mountains and forests near rivers and springs in the valleys and ravines and entered into parinirvāṇa Other arhats took their departure into the sky like the king of the swans  Then after their parinirvāṇa the devas from those of the six realms of desire up to those of the pure abodes  seeing that the arhats had all entered into nirvāṇa had this thought The sun of Buddha has set The disciples who cultivate all kinds of dhyāna samādhi liberations and wisdom their light too is extinguished Beings suffer all kinds of sickness desire  hatred and stupidity  Now that these physicians of the Dharma hasten to enter into nirvāṇa who then will heal them Like the lotus  the disciples arisen in the immense ocean of wisdom are now withered The tree of the Dharma has been cut down the cloud of Dharma has dissipated The king of elephants of great wisdom has withdrawn the offspring of the elephants follow after him The merchants of the Dharma have gone from whom can we request the jewel of the Dharma  A stanza says The Buddha has gone to rest forever he has entered into Nirvāṇa The multitude of those who have destroyed the bonds has likewise departed Thus the universe is empty and without knowledge The shadows of ignorance thicken the lamp of knowledge is extinguished Then the devas prostrated at the feet of Mahākāśyapa and uttered this stanza You have given up desire  anger and pride  Your body is like a column of red gold  From head to toe you are majestic marvelous peerless The clarity of your eye is pure like the lotus Having praised him thus they said to Mahākāśyapa O venerable Kāśyapa The citadel of the Dharma is crumbling The ocean of the Dharma is drying up The standard of the Dharma is being turned upside down The lamp of the Dharma is about to be extinguished In your great lovingkindness  it is necessary to found solidly the Buddhadharma Then the Great Kāśyapa whose mind is like a clear tranquil ocean replied You have spoken truly It is truly as you have said Before long the universe will be without knowledge and plunged into shadows Then Kāśyapa the Great by his silence accepted their invitation The devas prostrated at the feet of Kāśyapa the Great at once they disappeared and returned home Then after some time Kāśyapa the Great thought What shall I do so that this great doctrine acquired with difficulty by the Buddha during three incalculable periods  will remain for a long time Having pondered thus   I know how to ensure a long life for this doctrine it is necessary to compile the Sieou tou lou  the A pi tan and the Pi ni and make the three baskets of the Dharma  In this way the Buddhadharma will last for a long time and the people of the ages to come will receive it and practice it Why is that From age to age with painful effort and out of compassion  the Buddha exerted himself to acquire this doctrine and has proclaimed it to men We must likewise comply respectfully with the Buddhadharma spread it and develop it Then having pronounced these words Kāśyapa the Great went to the top of Mount Sumeru Keep well the memory of the Buddha We must recognize the benefits of the Buddha Do not enter into nirvāṇa The sound of the gaṇḍī and the sound of the words of Kāśyapa the Great spread throughout the entire trichiliomegachiliocosm and all heard him The disciples endowed with miraculous powers assembled around Kāśyapa the Great who said Those of his disciples who know the Dharma  retain the Dharma and recite the Dharma  have all entered nirvāṇa along with the Buddha Now that the Dharma is about to be lost it is necessary to have the greatest compassion for beings to come Having lost the eye of wisdom  they will be stupid and blind In his great kindness and great compassion  the Buddha has had pity for beings We should respectfully comply with the Buddhas doctrine Then Kāśyapa the Great chose a thousand individuals to king Ajātaśatru Give us food Let someone bring us our food each day We are about to compile the baskets of the texts here and we will be unable to occupy ourselves with anything else In this place at the time of the summer retreat  the fifteenth day of the third month at the time of the recitation of the precepts  having gathered together the saṃgha Kāśyapa the Great entered into samādhi With his divine eye  he contemplated to see if in the present assembly there was someone who had not yet completely subdued the afflictions whom it was necessary to expel nanda was the only person who had not completely subdued them The other  had already destroyed the impurities  they were pure and stainless  Kāśyapa the Great coming out of samādhi led nanda by the hand out of the assembly and said to him Here in this pure assembly they are going to recite the baskets of the texts Your bonds are not yet suppressed you must not stay here Then nanda wept with shame and thought For twentyfive years I accompanied the Bhagavat I served him I was at his disposal When the Buddha was about to enter into nirvāṇa he came to the city of Kiu yi na kie  He was suffering from a backache Four upper robes were laid down one on top of another he lay down and said to you I need some water You did not give him any In that you committed a duṣkṛta fault nanda replied At that time five hundred chariots were crossing the stream making the water turbid and impure This is why I did not take any Kāśhyapa the Great again said Exactly if the water was impure the Buddha had miraculous power strong enough to purify an ocean of impure water The Buddha summoned you a man learned in the practice of the four bases of miraculous power could remain in this world for a kalpa or a fraction of a kalpa You remained silent without answering He questioned you three times and you remained silent If you had answered him the Buddha learned in the practice of the four bases of miraculous power would have remained in this world for a kalpa or a fraction of a kalpa Because of you the Buddha has prematurely entered into nirvāṇa In that you have committed a duṣkṛta fault nanda said Māra fo pao ngen king T  k It was not out of maliciousness that I did not answer the Buddha Again Kāśyapa the Great said You have stepped on the saṃghāṭi of the Buddha In that you have committed a duṣkṛta fault nanda said At that time a great wind arose and there was noone to help me While I was holding the robe the wind blew and it fell beneath my foot It is not out of disrespect that I stepped on the Buddhas robe Again Kāśyapa the Great said You showed the women the mark of cryptorchidy of the Buddha after he entered into parinirvāṇa Is that not shameful In that you have committed a duṣkṛta fault nanda said At that time I thought if the women see the Buddhas mark of cryptorchidy they will feel ashamed of their own female body and want to obtain a male body so as to plant the roots of merit with the view of realizing Buddhahood This is why I showed the women  It is not out of impudence that I have broken the precepts  Kāśyapa the Great said You have committed six kinds of duṣkṛta faults You must confess these faults completely in the saṃgha nanda said that he agreed and that he would follow the instructions of the āyuṣmat Mahākāśyapa and the saṃgha Then nanda fell to his knees joined his palms together uncovered his right shoulder  took off his leather sandals and confessed his six kinds of duṣkṛta faults Kāśyapa the Great took nanda by the hand out of the saṃgha and said to him Completely destroy your impurities and then you can reenter Do not return until your last bonds are broken Having spoken thus he himself shut the door Then the arhats deliberated in these terms The ayuṣmat A ni lou teou said Under Ch li fou  the second Buddha there was an excellent disciple called Kiao fan po ti  Gentle and kind he dwells constantly in closed retreat He abides in the calmness of the mind  Now he abides in the heavens of the Che li cha chou yuan  Let a messenger be sent to ask him to come Kāśyapa the Great said to a recently ordained bhikṣu Are you under the orders of the saṃgha The recently ordained bhikṣu answered What does the saṃgha command Kāśyapa the Great said The saṃgha requests you to go to the heavens of the irīṣavana to the dwelling of the arhat Gavāmpati Carried away with joy the bhikṣu received the orders of the saṃgha He said to Kāśyapa the Great When I have reached the arhat Gavāmpati what shall I say to him Kāśyapa the Great said When you arrive there you will say to Gavāmpati Kāśyapa the Great and the other arhats who have destroyed the impurities have all assembled in Yen feou ti  There is great business for the saṃgha related to the doctrine Come quickly The recently ordained bhikṣu prostrated himself before the saṃgha  and circumambulated it three times to the right  Like the bird with golden wings  he took his leave into space He came to Gavāmpati prostrated and said to him O venerable one gentle and kind you have few desires  you know how to be content with little  you are ever in contemplation  Kāśyapa the Great addresses himself to you in these words Now there is great business for the saṃgha related to the doctrine Hasten to come down to see the assembly gathered jewels Then Gavāmpati had some doubts he said to this bhikṣu Does not the saṃgha have some quarrelsome subject  that it calls upon me Are there not some schisms in the saṃgha  Has the Buddha this sun been extinguished The bhikṣu said It is truly as you have said My upādhyāya Ch li fou  the chief  who could turn the wheel of the Dharma like the Buddha where is he now He replied Mo ho mou kie lien  where is he now The bhikṣu said Since the Buddhas nirvāṇa the āyuṣmat nanda weeps with sorrow and despair Gavāmpati said nandas remorse comes from the fact that he is still in the bondage of passion and the separation gives rise to suffering What has become of Lo heou lo  He replied Having obtained arhathood Rāhula has neither grief nor sorrow He contemplates only the nature of impermanence of the dharmas Gavāmpati said It is difficult to break the afflictions and having broken them to be without sadness Gavāmpati said My upādhyāya and the great teachers all have entered nirvāṇa I can no longer go down to Jambudvīpa May I remain here in order to enter into parinirvāṇa Having spoken these words he entered samādhi and leapt into space His body emitted light rays and water and fire With his hands he touched the sun and moon and manifested all kinds of miracles  From his mind there emanated flames that consumed his body From within his body came water which flowed in four streams as far as Kāśyapa the Great From the water there came a voice that pronounced this stanza Gavāmpati salutes by bowing his head To the saṃgha of venerable ones the excellent supreme saṃgha I am leaving in my turn Thus when the great elephant departs the little one follows him Then the recently ordained bhikṣu carrying the robe and bowl returned to the saṃgha At that moment nanda reflected of dharmas and sought to exhaust his last impurities  During the night he sat in dhyāna walked to and fro and sought the Path anxiously and zealously nandas wisdom was great but his power of samādhi was weak That is why he did not obtain the Path immediately If his power of concentration had been equal to his wisdom he would have quickly obtained  Finally when the night was almost over and he was very tired he lay down Now on lying down to reach his pillow  just as his head touched it suddenly he attained enlightenment Thus when one with ones hand paints space space is not filled In the same way the mind of an arhat who is at the center of all dharmas is not affected The āyuṣmat Aniruddha said There is the āyuṣnmat nanda Among the Buddhas disciples he has always served the Buddha and lived close to him He has heard the texts has been able to remember them and the Buddha has constantly praised him and approved of him This nanda could compile the texts Then the āyuṣmat Mahākāśyapa touched nandas head and said to him The Buddha entrusted you to keep the basket of the Dharma You should be grateful for the blessings of the Buddha In what place did the Buddha first explain the Dharma The great disciples of the Buddha who were able to to keep the basket of the Dharma have all entered nirvāṇa There is only you Now in accord with the Buddhas mind and out of compassion for beings you must compile the basket of the Buddhadharma Then prostrating before the saṃgha nanda sat down on the lionseat  Then Kāsyapa the Great recited these stanzas The Buddha is the holy king of the lions nanda is the son of the Buddha Seated on the lions seat He contemplates the assembly lacking the Buddha Just as the assembly of the venerable ones Lacking the Buddha has lost its power  So in the moonless night The constellations are without charm O great sage speak Son of the Buddha you must explain In what place the Buddha spoke for the first time You must reveal it now Then the āyuṣmat nanda with onepointed mind  joined his palms turned towards the place of the Buddhas nirvāṇa and spoke thus When the Buddha preached the Dharma for the first time I did not see it Thus have I heard by tradition  The Buddha was living at Vārāṇasī jñāta Kauṇḍinya Were the first to attain the vision of the Path A multitude of eighty thousand devas All penetrated into the course of the Path likewise Having heard these words the thousand arhats rose up into space to the height of seven to lo trees They all said The power of impermanence is great In the same way as we saw with our own eyes the Buddha preaching the Dharma here now he is speaking and we are listening Then they uttered these stanzas We have seen the marks of the Buddhas body Like a mountain of fine gold That is why it is necessary by every possible means To endeavor to leave the three worlds By accumulating zealously the roots of good Nirvāṇa is the supreme happiness Then the āyuṣmat Aniruddha uttered this stanza The universe is impermanent Like the moon and like the banana tree The one whose merits fill the three worlds Has been destroyed by the wind of impermanence Then Kaśyapa the Great also uttered these stanzas Neither skillful words nor marvelous jewels Nor lies nor strenuous protestations  Like a fire that consumes everything Such is the law of impermanence Kāśyapa the Great said to nanda From the Tchouan fa louen king up to the Ta pan nie pan  the collection forms the four A han  This is what is called the Basket of the Dharma of the Sūtras  The great arhats asked further Who can clearly bring together the basket of the Vinaya  They all said Of the five hundred arhats he is foremost of those who maintain the discipline  Let us invite him now Then they invited him with these words Get up and sit on the lionseat and tell us in what place the Buddha first enunciated the Vinaya and collected the precepts  Upāli received the orders of the saṃgha Seated on the lionseat he said Thus have I heard once the Buddha was at Pi ch li  At that time Siu ti na son of the householder Kia lan to conceived a lustful desire for the first time The Explanations relative to the  Precepts in three sections  the Seven Precepts  the Eight Precepts  the Pi kieou ni pi ni  the Tseng yi  the Yeou po li wen  the Tsa pou  these  sections form the Basket of the Discipline  Again the arhats had this thought Who can clearly bring together the basket of the A pi tan  They thought Among the five hundred arhats the āyuṣmat nanda is the foremost of those who explain the sūtras Let us invite him Then they invited him with these words Get up and EMDSK in Fen pie kong t king  go to sit on the lionseat  In what place did the Buddha first preach the Abhidharma nanda received the orders of the saṃgha Seated on the lionseat he said Thus have I heard once the Buddha was dwelling in the city of Ch po li  At that time the Buddha said to the bhikṣus Those in whom the five fears  the five sins and the five hatreds have not been suppressed and extinguished experience innumerable evils in this life in their bodies and their minds for this reason and in subsequent lives they fall into the bad destinies  Those who do not have the five fears the five sins and the five hatreds for this reason are in this life happy in every way in body and mind and in subsequent existences they are reborn in the heavens or in a pleasant abode  What are the five fears that must be discarded alcoholic drinks  All of this is called the Basket of the Abhidharma  When the three baskets of the doctrine were brought together the devas asuras nāgas and devis made offerings of all kinds They rained down celestial flowers  perfumes  banners  parasols and heavenly garments  to pay homage to the doctrine Then they recited this stanza Out of compassion for the universe The three baskets of the Dharma hve been collected The omniscient one who has the ten strengths  The wisdom of his words is the lamp that destroys ignorance Question What is the origin of the Pa kien tou a pi tan Aṣṭagranthābhidharma the Lieou fen a pi tan  and the others Answer When the Buddha was in this world the doctrine did not meet any opposition After the Buddha had departed when the doctrine was recited for the first time it was still as it was in the time when the Buddha was alive A hundred years later king A chou kia brought together a great assembly of five hundred and the great masters of the dharma debated As a result of their differences two distinct sects subsequently developed having a name A pi tan kien tou louen  T  translated at Lo yang in  by Saṃghadeva and Tchou fo nien first chapter deals with the supreme worldly dharmas  Subsequently his disciples made from it a Pi po so for people of ages to come who could not completely understand the Aṣṭagrantha   In the Lieou fen a pi tan  the third part in eight chapters pin  parivarta is called Fen pie che tchou  this is the third part of the Leou tan king in six parts it is the work of Maudgalyāyana chapters  four are the work of the bodhisattva Po siu mi and four others the work of the arhats of Ki pin  The other five parts are the work of the Louen yi che  Some say When the Buddha was in this world āriputra composed the Abhidharma in order to explain the words of the Buddha Later the Tou tseu monks recited  To this day this is what is called the Chou li fou a pi tan   During the lifetime of the Buddha Mahākātyāyana explained the words of the Buddha and composed a Pi le  boxcollection in the language of the Tsin It is used even today in southern India As all these works are commentaries on the words of the Buddha when it is said All this is what is called the Abhidharma Furthermore there are seven tendencies of defilement  anuśaya of attachment to pleasure  anuśaya of hostility  anuśaya of attachment to existence  anuśaya of pride  anuśaya of ignorance  anuśaya of wrong view  anuśaya of doubt vicikitsā or vimati these are the seven anuśayas Some are the anuśayas of the desire realm  some are the anuśayas of the form realm  others are the anuśayas of the formless realm  Some are abandoned by seeing the truths  others are abandoned by meditation  some are abandoned by the seeing of suffering  others are abandoned by seeing the origin  others are abandoned by seeing the cessation by seeing the Path  The ten knowledges  are  knowledge of dharma   subsequent knowledge   worldy knowledge   knowledge of the mind of another   knowledge of suffering   knowledge of its origin   knowledge of its cessation   knowledge of the Path   knowledge of the cessation   knowledge of no further rebirths  These are the ten knowledges Some are causes belonging to the desire realm  some are causes belonging to the form realm  some are causes belonging to the formless realm  others are causes belonging to no realm  When the four fruits are acquired some are attained others are lost To analyze all dharmas in this way is what is called Abhidharma Secondly in six parts the abbreviated text consists of  words Thirdly the Piṭaka the abbreviated text consists of  words In the word bhagavat bhāga means quality and vat indicates its possession Skillful in analyzing the general and specific characteristics of the dharmas he is called Bhagavat  Thus this word means the one who possesses glory Noone else has as much glory as the Buddha The noble cakravartin kings are fettered by bonds  the Buddha has broken the bonds The noble cakravartin kings are sunk in the mire of birth  old age  sickness and death  the Buddha has transcended them The noble cakravartin kings are enslaved by their passions  the Buddha has eliminated them The noble cakravartin kings dwell in the womb of the calamities of the human jungle  the Buddha has escaped from it The noble cakravartin kings dwell in the shadows of ignorance  the Buddha lives in the supreme light The noble cakravartin kings often reign over the four continents   the Buddha reigns over countless universes  The cakravartin kings have mastery over wealth  the Buddha has mastery over mind  The noble cakravartin kings covet heavenly bliss  the Buddha covets nothing having reached the wellbeing of the summit of existence  The cakravartin kings seek their happiness from others the Buddha rejoices in his own heart This is why the Buddha surpasses the noble cakravartin kings He also surpasses all the other beings Indra Brahmā the lokapālas who are even inferior to the noble cakravartin kings The person who can crush desire  hatred and stupidity is called Bhagavat Question The arhats and pratyekabuddhas are also able to destroy attachment hatred and stupidity in what do they differ from the Buddha Answer Although the arhats and pratyekabuddhas have destroyed this threefold poison  they have not entirely eliminated the latent predispositions of poison It is like perfume in a vase  when the perfume is removed a trace of the odor remains Or it is like kindling  the fire burns the smoke disappears but the ash remains for the strength of the fire is decreased On the other hand in the Buddha the threefold poison is eliminated without residue It is like at the end of a kalpa when the fire burns Mount Meru and the entire earth these disappear completely without leaving smoke or charcoal  for example the traces of hatred in āriputra the traces of attachment in Nan to and the traces of pride in Pi ting kia po tso  They are like a man in fetters who as soon as he is released begins to walk unceasingly At that time the Buddha having come out of samādhi set out to walk followed by Lo heou lo  The Buddha asked Rāhula Why are you so thin  Rāhula replied with this stanza Whoever eats oil gains strength Whoever eats butter gains good color Whoever eats bad vegetables has neither color nor strength The venerable Buddha should know that The Buddha asked Rāhula Who is the Elder in this community Rāhula replied It is the upādhyāya āriputra The Buddha said āriputra eats impure food  Then āriputra who had returned and had heard these words immediately spit up his food and made the following oath Starting from today I will no longer accept any invitations  Then king Po sseu ni and the āyuṣmat Siu ta to  went to āriputra and said The Buddha does not accept invitations without reason Venerable āriputra also does not accept invitations How will we lay people acquire the great purity of faith  āriputra answered My great teacher the Buddha has said that I eat impure food Henceforth I will accept no further invitations Then Prasenajit approached the Buddha and said to him The Buddha never accepts any invitations and neither does āriputra How will our minds gain great faith  We would like the Buddha to order āriputra to accept invitations again The Buddha replied It is not possible to change them Then  the Buddha cited this episode from one of his previous lives  Once there was a king who was bitten by a poisonous snake  As the king was going to die doctors were called to cure the poison The physicians said The snake itself must swallow the very last drop of poison that it has injected Then with the help of magical formulas  the doctors brought to the king the snake that had bitten him and gathering kindling they started a fire and ordered the snake to swallow its poison or else to enter into the fire The snake said to itself I prefer death Thinking this it persisted in its decision and entered into the fire This snake was none other than āriputra In his turn the āyuṣmat Pi ling kia po tso always suffered from eye disease To beg his food he usually crossed the Ganges river  Having come to the edge of the river he snapped his fingers and said to  Stop flowing Then he crossed the river between two walls and went to beg his food The goddess of the Ganges went to the Buddha and said The disciple of the Buddha Pilindavatsa always insults me by saying Vatsala stop flowing The Buddha said to Pilindavatsa Apologize for your fault to the goddess of the Ganges Then Pilindavatsa joining his palms said to the goddess of the Ganges Vatsala little slave dont be angry Do you see this Pilindavatsa who with his palms joined confesses his fault to you He apologizes and it is not out of malice that he calls you this Know that it is not his fault For five hundred years this man has always taken birth in a brahmin family always haughty he has reviled other men He has retained the language he formerly used but his heart is free of scorn Thus although they have destroyed the fetters  the arhats still keep the traces  But the Buddha Bhagavats whether their arms are slashed with a knife or whether they are anointed with sandalwood oil  do not blink an eye and their heart is as free of hatred as it is of love  for they  The brahmani Tchan tch with her wooden disc slandered the Buddha and in the midst of the great assembly said to him You have made me pregnant Why do you pitilessly refuse me clothing and food  She did this shamelessly to deceive the others The five hundred brahmin masters at once raised their hands and shouted That is true we know this affair The Buddha did not change color at this event and did not redden with shame When this trick was discovered the earth trembled and the devas honored the Buddha by overwhelming him with praise and with flowers But when the devas glorified the Buddhas qualities he did not take on the appearance of joy When the Buddha ate oats  he expressed no anger but when the king of the gods offered him food of one hundred flavors  he felt no joy In all things whatever they may be food and drink  robes and clothing  beds and seats  praise and blame  mistrust and respect  the Buddhas mind remains indifferent It is like pure gold which even when burned melted beaten or polished shows no increase or decrease On the contrary the arhats although they have broken the bonds and have found the Path still retain the traces  this is why they cannot be called Bhagavat Answer Since the qualities of the Buddha are innumerable  his epithets also are innumerable These epithets include all his glory for people understand it in many ways He preaches the natures of the dharmas in the way that he has understood them In the way that the Buddhas have gone by the path of safety  thus the Buddha is going and will not go on to new existences  The Buddha is also called A lo ho  Why is he called Arhat The expression therefore means killer of enemies Some stanzas say The Buddha has patience as his armor  Energy as his helmet  Discipline as his great steed  Dhyāna as his bow  Wisdom as his arrows  Outwardly he destroys the army of Māra  Inwardly he destroys the passions  his enemies He is called Arhat The expression means therefore unborn The seeds of the mind of the Buddha do not arise in the field of rebirths  for ignorance in him has been dissolved Finally Arhat means worthy of receiving worship  The fetters have been cut in the Buddha he has attained omniscience  therefore he merits receiving the worship of beings in heaven and on earth This is why the Buddha is called Arhat He is also called San miao san fo to  The expression thus means He who understands all dharmas perfectly and completely  Question How does he understand perfectly and fully Answer He understands suffering as suffering  He understands the origin as origin He understands cessation as cessation He undertands the Path as the Path Therefore he is called Samyaksambuddha Furthermore he knows that all the dharmas are truly unchangeable  without increase or decrease When the functioning of the mind is stopped and destroyed  when the path of speech is cut he understands that dharmas are motionless  like nirvāṇa itself This is why he is called Samyaksaṃbuddha all the dharmas of this kind he knows in detail one two or three generations ten a hundred a thousand or ten thousand kalpas even  kalpas but beyond that their memory stops and they know no more of future generations likewise  On the other hand the Buddha knows the time of arising  duration and cessation contained in a single moment  the time of arising of the fetters  the time of their duration and the time of their cessation He knows which fetters are cut during the stage of patient acceptance of suffering and the patient acceptance of the cognition of suffering  He knows that by freeing oneself thus from the fetters  liberation of conditioned dharmas is obtained in such and such a place and liberation of unconditioned dharmas is obtained in another place and so on up to the patient acceptance similar to the Path and the fifteen mindmoments of the path of seeing the truths  All of this is unknown to the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas because their time is limited It is thus that the Buddha knows the history of past beings and the destruction of their impurities  He knows the future and the present in the same way This is why he is said to be endowed with the knowledges and the practices By practices we mean here physical and vocal acts kKāyavākkarman For the Buddha alone physical and vocal acts are perfect  in all others they present faults Su means good and gata means either to go or speaking  The Buddha has transcended by all kinds of deep concentrations and numberless great wisdoms  Thus a stanza says The Buddha has omniscience as his chariot By means of the eightfold noble Path he has gone to nirvāṇa This is why he is called Sugata wellgone He is Sugata wellspoken because he preaches the doctrine according to the true nature of the dharmas and without being attached to the doctrine Taking into account the degree of wisdom of his disciples he uses every skillful means and the power of his superknowledges to convert them  He alone knows who can be saved who is sick or weakened what each one needs to be saved to whom it is suitable to preach generosity or discipline or nirvāṇa to whom he can expound the system of the five elements  the twelve causes or the four truths  etc in order to introduce them into the Path It is under aspects such as these that he knows the extent of knowledge of his disciples and that consequently he preaches the doctrine He is also called Lou kia pai  Loka means world and vid means to know Question How does he know the world Answer He knows two kinds of worlds the animate world  the inanimate world in their true nature  He knows the world  its cause  its destruction and the supraworldly Path  Furthermore his knowledge of the world is not like conventional knowledge or like heretical knowledge  he knows that the world is suffering because it is transitory  and nonsubstantial because it is suffering Finally he knows that the world by its nature is neither eternal nor noneternal  neither finite nor infinite  neither changing nor unchanging  He is not attached to such characteristics  Pure  eternal  unalterable  is like space  This is why he is called Lokavid Nirvāṇa is the highest dharma The Buddha alone knows this nirvāṇa he has not learned it from another Besides he guides beings and leads them to nirvāṇa Just as nirvāṇa is without superior among all the dharmas so the Buddha is without superior among beings All the systems of the heretics can be refuted and destroyed because they are false and impure  But the doctrine of the Buddha cannot be either refuted or destroyed because it escapes any discussion  it is true and pure  The expression thus means Leader of the caravan of men to be converted With his great loving kindness  his great compassion and his great wisdom he uses a voice that is sometimes sweet  sometimes harsh  sometimes lukewarm so that the caravan does not lose its way Finally if one said that the Buddha is the leader of the caravan of women  this would be disrespectful When The king is coming one knows that he is not coming alone but is accompanied by his retinue  in the same way when one speaks of men  one includes hermaphrodites  asexual beings and women  For these reasons the Buddha is called Puruṣadamyasārathi āstā means teacher deva means gods and manuṣyāṇām means men  Why is he called teacher of gods and men The Buddha shows what should be done and what should not be done what is good and what is bad  Those who follow his instructions do not abandon the doctrine of the Path and acquire liberation from their passions as reward  Thus he is called Teacher of gods and men Question Just as when a man is white in color even if he has black stains on his face he is not described as a negro because the black is insignificant The Saddharmapuṇḍarikā p  retains this rule but modifies its formulation slightly Furthermore the fetters among men are light and detachment is easy to attain  Wisdom is sharp among the gods This is why the Path is easily found in these two states This is not the case in the other destinies  Furthermore by saying gods all the heavenly beings are included by saying men all the beings on the earth are included Because in the heavens the gods are the principal beings and on earth men are the principal beings Therefore by saying gods all the beings in the heavens are included and by saying men all the beings on the earth are included Furthermore among men moral discipline  the path of seeing the truths  the path of meditation  and the fruits of the path are found On the other hand they are easy to obtain and very frequent among gods and men This is why the Buddha is the teacher of gods and men Finally among men the causes of happiness are frequently cultivated among gods the fortunate reward is common The causes of happiness are all the good dharmas  happiness is the reward of these good dharmas In destinies other than those of gods and men the causes of happiness and fortunate reward are rare This is why the Buddha is the teacher of gods and men He is also called Fo to  What dharmas does he know He knows all dharmas past  future and present  animate and inanimate  permanent and impermanent  He knew them all completely under the bodhi tree  This is why he is called Buddha Quesion Other individuals also know all the dharmas e he has eight arms  three eyes and he is mounted on a white bull  Or also the god Wei nieou in the language of Tsin Pien wen Univeral Eye he has four arms  holds a conch and a wheel  and rides a goldenwinged bird  Or also the god Kieou mo lo  he holds a cock  a bell  a red standard and is mounted on a peacock     Answer They cannot be omniscient Because their mind remains attached to hatred and pride  Some stanzas say Gods of painting and sculpture Gods of tradition and the hymns These four kinds of gods All of them brandish a weapon in one hand Out of weakness they fear others Or out of spite they dread them Whether they fear others from necessity Or they dread them from weakness The gods are all eternal cowards Unable to escape from the suffering of death Those who revere and honor them Can fall into a sea of misery Those who distrust and scorn them Can enjoy good fortune here below We should know that these gods are false unreal Beings in the world Wander about as a result of their actions By virtue of merits they are reborn in the heavens By virtue of mixed actions they are reborn among humans The destiny of the world depends on causes and conditions This is why the wise man does not depend on the gods no longer have any inclination to act make no effort to do this and avoid it  continues as follows This is why only the Buddha can bear the name Buddha One must pay homage to the Buddha take the Buddha as teacher and not serve the gods b tr Legge p Moreover the Buddha possesses two things great qualities and the power of the superknowledges  and an absolutely pure mind and the destruction of the fetters  Although the gods have an accumulation of merit and miraculous power  their fetters are not destroyed and consequently their mind is not pure Since their mind is impure their miraculous power is decreased Among the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas the fetters are destroyed and the mind is pure nevertheless as their accumulation of merit is reduced their power is weak In the Buddha the two qualities merit and purity of mind are perfected  This is why he is called Sarvanarottama Superior to all men Bhagavat means endowed with qualities as has been said above His parents named him Si ta to in the language of the Tsin Profitrealized one When he found the Path and understood all dharmas he was called Buddha When he accepted the worship of gods and men he was also called by the names Bhadanta rīguṇa Thus in various ways names are given to him according to his qualities Question You are a partisan of the Kṣatriya clan Answer Not at all Rather it is you maliciously are jealous and slander the Buddha The omniscient one truly exists Among all beings the Buddha is unequaled for his beauty  grace and perfection  By his characteristics  his qualities and his brilliance  he surpasses all men  Humble people who saw his physical marks recognized him to be omniscient and a fortiori the Great Man  Thus in the Fang nieou pi yu king  it is said The king of Mo kie to  Pin po so lo invited the Buddha and his five hundred disciples for three months The king required fresh milk and cream to offer to the Buddha and the assembly of monks  He ordered the cowherders to establish themselves in the neighborhood and to bring fresh milk and cream every day At the end of the three months the king out of compassion for these cowherders said to them Come and see the Buddha and then you can go back and keep your herds The cowherders while coming to the Buddha talked to one another along the way We have heard it said that the Buddha is omniscient  We are lowly and humble how could we judge if he is really omniscient The brahmins who love cream always come to visit the cowherders they are friendly to us Through them the cowherders have heard speak of all kinds of works and brahmanical texts He can fulfill those who contemplate him And cause them to find supreme happiness By seeing him one has absolute conviction That he is certainly omniscient Having thought thus they greeted the Buddha and sat down They asked him How many rules for the cowherder should be kept so that his herd prospers  how many rules should he neglect for his herd to decrease and lose its prosperity  The Buddha answered If he observes eleven rules the cowherder is able to make his herd prosper ekādaśabhir aṅgaih samnvāgato gopālako bhavyo gogaṇaṃ pariharitum spjātīkartum He knows what the herd needs  He knows the fords  He knows the good pasturs  He knows how to milk them  He knows how to pay respect to the leaders of the herd ye ca te ṛṣhabhā gavāṃ patayas tān atirekapūjāya pūjayitā hoti The cowherder who observes these eleven rules can make his herd prosper In the same way the bhikṣu who knows eleven rules can make his good dharmas progress  bhikṣu chases away the insects of perverse views that drink the blood of the roots of good and aggravate the wounds of the mind  When he has chased them away there is safety  benefitted each day Similarly when the farmers and the lay people give the bhikṣu garments and food  he knows how to stay within bounds and not deplete them entirely Thus the generous patrons are content their faith remains intact and the  Question There is no Omniscient one because the things that he must know are numberless The dharmas are innumerable and infinite  If many men together cannot know them how could one single man know them Therefore there is no Omniscient one Answer If the dharmas are innumerable the wisdom of the Buddha itself is immense  It is like an envelope if the letter is big the envelope is large if the letter is short the envelope is small Question The Buddha himself has preached the Buddhadharma but he has not spoken about the other sciences medicine  geography  astronomy  arithmetic  politics  etc If he is omniscient why has he not spoken of all these sciences Therefore we know that he is not omniscient Answer He knows everything but he talks about it when it is useful and does not talk about it when it is useless If he is questioned he speaks if he is not questioned he says nothing Furthermore he has spoken of everything in general as being of three types conditioned phenomena  unconditioned phenomena  inexpressible phenomena  These three categories include all the dharmas Question We know that the Buddha is not omniscient because he did not reply to fourteen difficult questions What are these fourteen difficult questions Are the world and the self eternal Are they noneternal Are they both eternal and noneternal Are they neither eternal nor noneternal Are the world and the self finite Are they infinite Are they both finite and infinite Are they neither finite nor infinite Is it false that he both exists and does not exist after death Sa jīvas tac charīram anyo jīvo nyac charīram If the Buddha is omniscient why did he not answer these fourteen difficult questions Answer These questions are futile and that is why the Buddha did not answer them The eternity of the dharmas is unnecessary  their cessation is even more unnecessary This is why the Buddha did not answer If it is asked how many liters of milk is given by a cows horn that is not a proper question and it is not necessary to answer it Besides the universe has no end  Furthermore there is no advantage in answering these questions but there is the disadvantage of leading into error The Buddha knows that these fourteen difficult points hide the four truths and the true nature of the dharmas endlessly If there are noxious insects at a ford people should not be invited to cross there A place should be safe and without danger so that people can be invited to cross Furthermore some say that these questions can be understood only by the Omniscient one since men cannot understand them the Buddha does not reply  Furthermore some people call existent that which is nonexistent  and call nonexistent that which is existent They are not omniscient The Omniscient one does not call nonexistent that which exists does not call existent that which does not exist he preaches only the true nature of the dharmas The sun does not create the mountains and the valley nor does it create the plains but it does illuminate everything uniformly In the same way the Buddha does not make nonexistent that which exists does not make nonexistent that which does not exist He always speaks the truth and the brilliance of his wisdom illuminates all the dharmas He is like a unique path  When people ask the Buddha if the twelvemembered law was created by the Buddha or by another the Buddha answers I have not created the twelvemembered law nor has anyone else created it Whether Buddhas exist or do not exist birth is the cause and condition of old age and death  that is the eternal and enduring law The Buddha teaches that birth is the cause and condition of old age and death and coming to the end  that ignorance is the cause and condition of the formations  Furthermore to reply to the fourteen difficult questions would be to commit a fault Furthermore these fourteen difficult questions are wrong views  are not realities  Now the Buddha is occupied only with realities This is why he stops and does not answer Finally to be silent and not answer is an answer There are four ways of answering  Here the Buddha answers by not replying You say that there is no omniscient one Such a statement is absurd and consitutes a serious falsehood  In fact the Omniscient one exists Because he has attained the ten powers  he knows what is possible and what is impossible  he knows the causes and conditions and the retribution of actions  he knows the samādhis and the deliverances  he knows the good or bad faculties of beings  he knows the various kinds of deliverances from desire  he knows the innumerable lineages sing  and  of all the types of universes  he knows all the abodes and their paths  he knows the conduct and the thoughts in their previous existences  he has acquired the discrimination of the divine eye  he knows the cessation of all the impurities  he distinguishes old age and death suffering and moaning sadness grief and despair cease Bhāmatī ad II   Tantravārtitika clearly between good and bad he preaches a supreme doctrine in all the universes he has acquired the taste of ambrosia  he has found the middle path  he knows the true nature of all conditioned or unconditioned dharmas he has rejected forever all desire of the three worlds  It is for these reasons that the Buddha is omniscient The Omniscient one exists but who is it Answer It is the supreme one  the Great Man  the one who is venerated in the three worlds  he is called Buddha Thus the Tsan fo kie say Firstborn and king cakravartin The Buddha is like the light of the sun and moon He belongs to the noble line of the ākyas He is the crown prince of king uddhodana At the moment of his birth he moved three thousand Sumerus and stirred up the water of the ocean In order to destroy old age sickness and death Out of compassion he came to the world At his birth he took seven steps His rays filled the ten directions My births he cried are finished Having become Buddha I will preach a marvelous doctrine I will beat the drum of the Dharma loudly By that I will awaken beings And the world out of the sleep of ignorance In many forms such were the miracles that appeared Gods and men Seeing them rejoiced The Buddha had a body adorned with the marks A great light shone on his face All men and women Could not get enough of seeing him When the child was nursed and fed His strength surpassed that of a nayuta of gandhahastin The power of his ṛddhipāda was extreme That of his prajñā immense The great rays of the Buddha Illuminated his body outwardly In the midst of his rays the Buddha Was like the moon in its splendor The Buddha was criticized in many ways He experienced no sorrow from that The Buddha was praised in many ways He experienced no joy from that His great maitrī is extended to all Enemies and friends alike without distinction All classes of intelligent beings Know all the effects of that In order to save beings From age to age he accepts the effort and the pain His mind is always concentrated On doing good for beings He has the ten powers of knowledge And the four fearlessnesses  He possesses the eighteen special attributes And a treasury of immense qualities  Such are the innumerable Powers of his prodigious qualities Like a fearless lion He destroys the heretical systems He turns the peerless wheel of Dharma He saves and delivers the threefold world His name is Bhagavat The meaning of this word is immense and if one wanted to explain it fully other points would have to be neglected Question Why is it said that the Buddha was dwelling at Rājagṛha instead of describing the teachings of the Prajñāpāramitā directly Answer The author mentions the place  the time and the individuals so that people will trust his story What is meant by dwelling The four bodily positions  sitting  lying  walking and standing are called dwelling The Buddha takes up these positions to frighten Māras troops and so that his disciples will rejoice and enter into all kinds of dhyānas Furthermore there are three dwellings divine abodes  the abode of Brahma and the abode of the saints  The divine abodes are the abodes of the six classes of the gods of desire  The brāhmavihāras are the abodes of the Brahmā gods etc up to the gods who are neither with nor without perception  The abodes of the saints are the abodes of the Buddhas the pratyekabuddhas and the arhats Of these three types of abodes the Buddha chooses the āryavihāra But  out of compassion for beings  he abides in the city of Rājagṛha Furthermore three things generosity  discipline and good thoughts constitute the divyavihāra The four limitless minds  lovingkindness  compassion  joy and equanimity constitute the brāhmavihāras The three samādhis namely emptiness  signlessness and wishlessness are called āryavihāra The Buddha dwells in the āryavihāras Finally there are four kinds of abodes divyavihāra brāhmavihāra āryavihāra and buddhavihāra We have already spoken about the first three As for the buddhavihāras these are the innumerable samādhis such as the heroic walk  the ten powers  the four fearlessnesses  the eighteen special attributes of the Buddha omniscience and wisdoms of all kinds It is also the  baskets of the Dharma  the means of saving men These various Buddhaqualities are the places inhabited by the Buddha the Buddha abides there Question The great cities such as Ch po ti  Kia pi lo po and Po lo nai are all royal residences  Why does this city alone bear the name of Rājagṛha Answer  Some people give the following explanation A king of Mo kie to had a son who although he had but a single head had two faces and four arms The people took this as a bad omen the king therefore cut off the babys head and abandoned the body in the jungle  Li lo rejoined the two parts of the body and nursed the child with her own milk In the course of time he grew up and became a man his strength was so great that he was able to conquer the kings of other kingdoms he owned the whole world and took all the kings in the number of  men and estabished them in the midst of five mountains by means of his great power he governed Yen feou ti  This is why the inhabitants of Jambudvīpa give these mountains the name City of the kings residence   Others say the following In the city in which the king of Magadha lived there were fires each time the city burned down it was rebuilt This happened seven times The people of that country were overwhelmed by the work imposed upon them Saddened and fearful the king assembled all the wise men and asked their advice Some said that he should change the location of the city The king therefore sought out a place where he could settle he saw these five mountains which formed an enclosure like a wall he built his palace there and settled in the center of this place This is why this place is called City of the kings residence   Here is another explanation In times past there was in this kingdom a king called Po seou who renounced worldly things  went forth from home and became a recluse  At that time the brahmins who were still householders and the hermits who had left the world had a debate The gṛhastabrāhmaṇas said According to the sacred texts in the offerings to the gods  living beings must be killed and their flesh must be eaten  The pravrajitarṣis answered When sacrifices are made to the gods living beings must not be killed and their flesh should not be eaten The debate went on betweeen them The pravrajitarṣis said There is a great king here who has left the world to become a recluse Would you trust him The gṛhasthabrāhmaṇas replied that they would trust him and the others said We will take this man as arbitrator and tomorrow we will go to question him That same night the gṛhastatabrāhmaṇas went in advance to the hermit Vasu and after having asked him all the questions about customs they said to him In tomorrows discussion you must help us Thus the next day at dawn at the beginning of the discussion the pravrajitarṣis asked the hermit Vasu In the sacrifices to the gods should or should one not kill living beings and eat their flesh The hermit Vasu answered The rule of the brāhmans is that living beings must be killed in sacrifices to the gods and their flesh eaten  The pravrajitarṣis replied According to your own judgment should living beings be killed and their flesh eaten or not The hermit Vasu answered As it is a matter of sacrifice to the gods one should kill living beings and eat their flesh indeed these living beings having died in sacrifice to the gods will be able to be reborn in the heavens The pravrajitarṣis exclaimed You are greatly mistaken Criminal disappear Immediately the hermit Vasu sank into the earth up to his ankles because he had been the first to open the door to great sins  The pravrajitarṣis said to him You should speak the truth if you persist in lying your whole body will sink into the earth The hermit Vasu answered I know that it is not a sin to kill sheep and eat their meat when it is done for the gods Immediately he sank into the earth as far as his knees  In this way he disappeared gradually as far as his thighs  then up to his neck  The pravrajitarṣis said Now your deceitful speech has received its punishment in this world If however you decide to speak the truth even though you are under the ground we can pull you out and allow you to escape from punishment Then Vasu thought thus As a noble person I should not say two different things Besides in the Wei to of the brāhmans the sacrifices to the gods are made in all kinds of different ways If I myself die would that be worthwhile Then he said singlemindedly  In the sacrifices to the gods it is not a sin to kill living beings and eat their flesh The pravrajitarṣis shouted You are a hardened sinner From that time until today the rule given by the recluse Vasu has always been observed When a sheep is killed in the sacrifices to the gods at the moment when the knife descends on the animal one says to it Vasu is killing you Vasus son was called Kouang tch  He succeeded his father as king In turn he also renounced worldly things but he did not become a monk  Then he thought My father the former king was swallowed alive by the earth even though he had gone forth from home if I continue to rule the world I might render myself guilty of a great sin again Where then should I goAt the moment he had this thought he heard in the air a voice that said to him If as you travel you see an extraordinary place that is hard to reach you should establish your home there When these words had been spoken the voice was silent A little later having gone out into the country to hunt the king saw a deer that fled as swift as the wind he ran after it but was unable to reach it As he pursued it without resting the members of his retinue were able to stay with him In front of him he saw a place where five mountains formed a steep and wellsheltered basin the ground there was level and produced fine soft grass beautiful flowers covered the earth there were forests of all kinds of perfumed trees which bore flowers and fruits in abundance hot springs and cold pools everywhere presented their purity this was a marvelous place On all sides there grew celestial flowers with heavenly perfumes and celestial music was heard When the gandharva musicians saw the king they all withdrew This is where I should establish my residence When he had thought thus all his ministers and his officials who had been following him arrived The king declared The voice that I heard in the air told me If you see on your journey an extraordinary place that is difficult to find that is where you must establish your residence Now I have just discovered this extraordinary place it is here that I must establish my residence Then he abandoned the city where he had lived previously and settled in these mountains This was the first king to become established there and starting with him his successors one after the other lived there Since this king first had a palace built there thence came the name City of the royal residence The explanation of the origins of Rājagṛha in summary is finished on the Ki ch kiue chan  the Vulture Peak mountain āstra Gṛdhra means vulture and kūta means peak Question Why is it called Vulture Peak mountain Answer The summit of this mountain resembles a vulture and the inhabitants of Rājagṛha because of this resemblance agreed to call it Vulture Peak mountain This is why it is called Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata Furthermore south of Rājagṛha in the Che to lin  there were many corpses vultures commonly came to devour them and then went to perch on the peak of the mountain The people then named it Vulture Peak mountain It is the highest of the five montains  It abounds in precious forests and waters The āryas live there Why does the Buddha dwell at Rājagṛha The custom of the Buddhas is to show their lovingkindness towards all It is like the sun that illuminates everything  there is nothing that does not receive its light All these great cities are populous and wealthy and nevertheless the Buddha did not reside there Why did he stay often in the cities of Wang ch  and Ch po ti  Although he stayed sometimes at Po lo nai  at Kia pi lo po  at Tchan po  at So tche to  at Kin chan pi  at Kieou leou  etc nevertheless he of Gandhāra refer to A How do we know that he stayed especially in these two places We see that the Buddhist sūtras are mostly located at these two cities and rarely in another Answer Although the great lovingkindness of the Buddha reaches all equally the great cities like Ujjayinī etc are frontiercountries  That is why the Buddha does not reside there  Moreover criminals are numerous there and as their roots of good are not ripe   Thus some stanzas say The suns rays shine equally  The mature flowers bloom at once But the flowers not yet in bloom Do not necessarily open up In the same way when the Buddha Preaches the Dharma with the same feelings to all The roots of good that are already ripe blossom at once Those that are not so do not open up This is why the Bhagavat Resides amongst those who show the three following qualities Keen knowledge  ripe roots of good  Reduced fetters and reduced afflictions  Furthermore it is out of gratitude that the Buddha frequently resides at Rājagṛha and rāvastī Question Why is it out of gratitude that he often stays in these two cities Answer The kingdom of Kiao sa lo is the native land of the Buddha This is why the Buddha one day replied to king Pin po so lo with these stanzas There is a wondrous country Situated on the borders of the Himavat Opulent and rich in various treasures It is called Kośala Being of the solar clan and ākya family I was born in that place Filled with disgust with old age sickness and death I have left home to search for Buddhahood Moreover the leader of Kośala king Pu sseu ni  lived in the great city of rāvastī and the Buddha in his quality of king of Dharma also lived in that city for the two leaders should live in the same place Furthermore Kośala is the country of the birthbody of the Buddha and it is out of gratitude that the Buddha often lives in rāvastī Question If it is out of gratitude that he often lives in rāvastī why does he not often live also in Kapilavastu which is closer to his birthpace Answer Among the Buddhas clinging has been extinguished there are not even traces of it left When he goes to visit his parents  he feels no emotion nāsti nānātvasaṃjñā On the other hand the majority of his ākya disciples have not eliminated their desire and when they go home to their relatives they feel attachment  Question Why then does he not protect his disciples who are natives of rāvastī but on the contrary often stays in rāvastī Answer The disciples to Kapilavastu were numerous When the Buddha returned for the first time to his own country the Kāśyapa brothers as well as the thousand bhikṣus who originally had followed the brahmanical rule and practiced austerities in the mountains had a sad appearance King  the Buddhas father seeing them found that these monks were not looking bright enough Then the Bhagavat made a choice among the ākya dignitaries and they were joined to the other less vigorous monks Their families sent a message to restrain them from becoming monastics Some of them welldisposed tasted the joy of the Path others found no joy in it these ākya monks from Kapilavastu were not authorized to return to their native land but this was not the case for the disciples originally from rāvastī This is why the Buddha often resided in rāvastī but seldom in Kapilavastu Moreover according to the rules of the anchorites  it is forbidden to have access to ones relatives for attachment to relatives is like a fire or a snake  If the disciples of the brāhmins staying at home are unable to dwell in their native land during their training  what then can be said of the śrāmaṇas who have gone forth from their home  Furthermore Kapilavastu is not as big as rāvastī which has  households If the Buddha stayed there only seldom he could not have saved many people This is why he stayed there often Furthermore in Kapilavastu the Buddhas native land the inhabitants had practiced for a long time their roots of good were ripe and their wisdom keen  The Buddha stayed there only a short time to preach the Dharma He did not have to stay there long and once his work of salvation was done he went away But at rāvastī some inhabitants had just started to practice others had practiced for a long time among some the roots of good were ripe among others they were not some had sharp faculties  others did not Many of them by the study of treatises of all kinds had crushed their minds while trying to sharpen them and had entered into the stream of all kinds of wrong views  they had served all kinds of teachers and venerated all kinds of gods  People of mixed practice were numerous  This is why the Buddha stayed among them for a long time If a physician who is caring for an ulcer determines that the ulcer is already ripe  he breaks it open extracts the pus and having given a medication  he goes away If the ulcer is not yet ripe he stays for a long time to smear it with ointment  The Buddha acts in the same way If his disciples have roots of good that are ripe he converts them by means of his Dharma then he goes elsewhere But if the disciples whom he must save have unripe roots of good he must remain with them for a long time If the Buddha appears in the world  it is precisely to save beings and lead them to the element of nirvāṇa  to safety and to the blissful abodes  This is why he frequently resides in rāvastī and rarely in Kapilavastu The Buddha attained supreme perfect enlightenment and took on the dharmakāya in the kingdom of Mo kie to on the banks of the river Ni lien cha in the village of Wou leou louo  This is why he frequently resides in Rājagṛha Question Now we know the reasons why the Buddha often stayed in Rājagṛha and rāvastī But of these two cities why did he reside more often in rāvastī Answer It is out of gratitude for the benefits of his native land that he stayed in rāvastī frequently All beings think about their birthplace A stanza says All the teachers who teach Are attached to the system that they know In the same way every person loves his homeland Even having gone forth from home  they still want it It is to repay the benefits of the country of his dharmakāya that the Buddha often stays at Rājagṛha A stanza says The Buddhas of the past and the future And the Buddhas of the present Honor their dharmakāya And pay homage to it and venerate it Since the dharmakāya prevails over the body of birth  it is at Rājagṛha that the Buddha resides more often Furthermore because the Tso chan and the Tsing ch are more numerous there than elsewhere Thus Rājagṛha has five vihāras There are not as many vihāras in the other places a At rāvastī there is a stoppingplace called Tche houan tsing ch  There is another called Mo kie lo mou tang  But there is no third stoppingplace the first is called Mo ho pan and the second Mi heou tche ngan  d At Kieou chan mi there is a stoppingplace called Kiu che lo yuan  In all these regions there was either a stoppingplace having a vihāra or an empty forest But Rājagṛha had many vihāras suitable for meditators  and since these stoppingplaces were in safe areas the Buddha stayed there frequently Furthermore at Rājagṛha there were six heretic teachers Fou na lo  who claimed to be omniscient and were rivals of the Buddha There were also the brahmacārins Tchang chao  Po tso sing  Kiu kia na ta  etc all the great heretical teachers  Finally there was the āyuṣmat Che li kou to  Ti po ta to  A ch che  etc who wished to harm the Buddha did not believe in the Buddhadharma and were filled with jealousy  Since these individuals were at Rājagṛha the Buddha often stayed there In this way near a place where poisonous herbs grow there must be a medicinal herb  Some stanzas say If the lion  King of all the wild beasts Roars out against small insects  He is laughed at by all If it is against the tigers  wolves And other ferocious beasts That he roars so powerfully He is valued by the experts The teaching masters are like the ferocious tigers But in their midst fears nothing These great sages have seen much heard much  But amongst them is foremost Since these great sages and great learned one live at Rājagṛha the Buddha often stays there Furthermore king Pin po so lo had gone to Kie ye sseu ch to see the Buddha and his followers the  Kie fa who arhats Then the Buddha preached to the king who attained the state of Siu to houan  After that the king invited the Buddha in these words I would like the Buddha and his community to come to my city of Rājagṛha and accept for their lifetime the clothing  leather  food  beds and seats and medicines that I will furnish for them The Buddha accepted his invitation and that is why he frequently resides at Rājagṛha  Furthermore of the four directions in Yen feou ti  the east is the foremost because the sun rises there next are the south  west and north  In the west the country of Magadha is the most powerful In the country of Magadha the city of Rājagṛha is the most powerful it contains  households After the Buddhas nirvāṇa king A ch che  whose lineage had weakened abandoned the great city of Rājagṛha and built a small city one yojana in size nearby called Po lo li fou to lo  If the latter prevails over all the other cities what then should be said of Rājagṛha Furthermore at Rājagṛha there are many intelligent people learned and wise which is not the case in the other lands Furthermore some men before attaining the Path wait for the time the place and the wishedfor individual The Buddha knows in advance that Che to houan yin and  devas should attain the Path at Magadha in the Rock Cave  That is why he often stayed at Rājagṛha Furthermore this land is wealthy when one begs for ones food one obtains it easily This is not the case in the other lands This wealth is the result of three causes King Bimbasāra had given orders that food always be provided near his palace for  bhikṣus ii Chou ti kie  born among humans nevertheless possessed the wealth of a god iii A po lo lo  king of the nāgas was converted because of a good thought and became a disciple of the Buddha To prevent famines  he caused an unceasing beneficial rain to fall That is why this country is wealthy Thus after the nirvāṇa of the Buddha the sthavira Mo ho kia ch  wishing to gather together the scriptures looked for a wealthy country where begging would be fruitful and where the scriptures could be quickly collected After reflecting he thought of Rājagṛha where under the order of king Bimbasāra food was always prepared for  bhikṣus At Rāhagṛha food was easy to find and the scriptures could easily be collected there In other countries this was not always the case When the almsround is made the heretics would come to engage in debates if one debated with them the gathering of the scriptures would suffer if one did not engage in debate with them they would say These śramanas are not good for us  For all these considerations Mahākāśyapa chose  great arhats and went to the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata to compile the basket of the texts there For these three reasons we know that begging was successful in the land of Magadha  and the dragon Ho lo  and   says that at Ch po ti also there were famines But this is not the case for Magadha This is why we know that Magadha is wealthy and that begging there is successful Finally between two mountains Rājagṛha is a wellprotected retreat In the other lands the monasteries are on level ground numerous crowds enter leave and come and go as they please In the mountains of Rājagṛha there are many vihāras contemplatives and āryas who all love sheltered retreats settle there in great numbers The Buddha chief of contemplatives and āryas frequently resides at Rājagṛha These are the various reasons why he often stays at Rājagṛha Question If it is true that the Buddha resides preferentially at Rājagṛha why does he dwell more often on the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata rather than at Veṇuvana Answer I have already answered that question the āryas and contemplatives are happy in sheltered places Question But at Rājagṛha there are four other mountains the Pi po lo po nou  Why does he stay less often there than at Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata Answer Of the five mountains  the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata is the best Why is that Because its monastery is close to the city but difficult of access this is why the crowds do not go there But as it is near the city begging is not tiring That is why the Buddha resides frequently on the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata and not elsewhere Moreover it is on the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata that the sthavira Mo ho kia ch compiled the three baskets of the Dharma  When he had saved the beings who could be saved he wanted like the Buddha to enter nirvāṇa In early morning  having taken his bowl and his cloak  he entered Rājagṛha to beg  Then he ascended Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata and said to his disciples Today I will enter nirvāṇawithoutresidue  Having spoken thus he enterd his house and seated crosslegged paryaṇkam ābhujya he perfumed his body with pure absorptions  The disciples of Mahākāśyapa entered Rājagṛha and said to the officials Do you know that the sthavira Mahākāśyapa has today entered into nirupadhiśeṣanirvāṇa At these words all the officials felt very sad They said That same night the sthavira Mahākāśyapa came out of his concentration samāpatter vyutthāya entered the assembly and sat down All conditioned dharmas  the results of causes and conditions  are impermanent nonexistent yesterday existent today tomorrow they return to nonexistence therefore they are impermanent Being impermanent they are suffering  Being suffering they are without substance  As they are without substance the sage should not be attached to me and mine  If he is attached to me and mine he experiences immense sadness and suffering The mind should experience disgust in the presence of all the universes and seek renunciation  Proclaiming in every way the suffering at the heart of the universes  he freed his mind in order to enter into nirvāṇa When he had finished preaching he put on the robe that he had received from the Buddha once more and taking his robe  his bowl and his staff  he rose up into space like the goldenwinged bird  the four bodily postures  seated lying down walking and standing In his one body there appeared innumerable bodies that filled the universes of the east then these innumerable bodies became one single body again From the upper part of his body there came forth fire  while from the lower part there came forth water  then from the upper part there cameforth water while from the lower part there came forth fire And he repeated the same phenomenon in the directions of the south the west and the north When Mi l becomes Buddha my skeleton will reappear and with him I will save beings Having reflected in this way he penetrated right into the rock forming the mountain summit as if entering soft mud and after he had penetrated into it the mountain closed up once more In future generations the human lifespan will be  years and a mans height  feet When the Buddha Maitreya comes the height of the Buddha will be  feet his face will measure  feet and his halo will be  li Then when beings learn that the Buddha Maitreya has appeared in the world  all together will embrace the religious life to follow the Buddha When the Buddha will proclaim the Dharma in the assembly for the first time  prabhedas of human beings will attain the state of arhat and will be endowed with the six superknowledges  in the second great assembly  prabhedas of human beings will attain the state of arhat in the third there will be  prabhedas These in turn will save innumerable men At that time people will often be lazy and the Buddha Maitreya seeing men in that state will strike Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata with his fingers then the skeleton of Mahākāṣyapa clothed in his saṃghati will appear and prostrate at the feet of Maitreya rise up into space and manifest the transformations described above Then the disciples of Buddha Maitreya full of astonishment will ask Who is this man He is dressed in monks robes and can accomplish the transformations The Buddha Maitreya will reply This man is a disciple of the past Buddha ākyamuni He is called Mahākāśyapa He is the foremost of the bhikṣus who dwell in the forest  who have no desire  are content and follow the strict observances  He is a great arhat who possesses the six superknowledges and the deliverances  Some will become arhats nonreturners  oncereturners  enterers into the stream  others will plant the roots of good which will make them pratyekabuddhas others will acquire the patient acceptance of unborn dharmas and will become irreversible bodhisattvas  finally others will be reborn among gods and men and enjoy all kinds of happiness From that we know that the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata is a blessed and propitious place The āryas love to reside there The Buddha the chief of the āryas frequently resides on the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata Moreover the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata is the residence of Buddhas of the past  the future and the present  Thus it is said in the Fou leou na mi ti li tseu king  The Buddha said to Pūrṇa When the trichiliomegachiliocosm will will be burned up the kalpa I will return and will always stay on this mountain But weighed down by their fetters and unable to see the qualities of the Buddha beings will not see me   Moreover the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata is pure and fresh It welcomes the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times No place is equal to it That is why the Buddha stays there often Moreover the Mahāyāna sūtras were most often preached at the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata rarely elsewhere Because this place is pure and constitutes a marvelous retreat The Buddas of the three times and the bodhisattvas of the ten directions praise and honor this place The devas nāgas yakṣas garudas gandharvas kiṃnaras mahoragas and other very powerful deities protect  honor and venerate this place A stanza says This Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata Is the residence of the Buddhas The refuge of the ārya It protects them all Suffering is abolished there Alone it keeps the true Dharma Finally it is there that the innumerable bodhisattvas of the ten directions wise marvelous and very powerful come to see the Buddha ākyamuni greet him pay their respect to him and listen to his Dharma This is why the Buddha preaches the Mahāyānasūtras so often on the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata The Prajñā is the most important of these sūtras and since he wishes to preach it today why should it not be on the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata We have just explained in summary why the Buddha resides on the Gṛdhrakūṭaparvata Accompanied by a great saṃgha of bhikṣus  Sārdham accompanied by indicates the identity of place  time  mind  discipline  views  path and deliverance  Mahat in the language of the Tsin means great numerous  or superior   This saṃgha is great because it surpasses all the others because it has broken all the obstacles and because the gods  kings and other great individuals respect it  This saṃgha is numerous because there are five thousand members The bhikṣu is a mendicant He is called bhikṣu because of his pure means of livelihood  Thus it is said in a sūtra āriputra entered the city to beg his food when he had obtained it he sat down against a wall kuḍyaṃ niśrāya nyaṣidat to eat Then a brahmacariṇī named Tsing mou came to see āriputra and asked him O ramaṇa are you eating I am eating ramaṇa are you eating with your face down  No sister he answered Are you eating with your face up in the air  Are you eating with your face turned in the four cardinal directions  No not that Then ucimukhī said to him There are four ways to eat I have asked you and you answer in the negative I dont understand āriputra said to her There are monks who compound medicinal herbs  plant grain and cultivate trees etc Those who follow these impure means of livelihood eat with their face down There are monks who observe the stars  the sun and the moon  the wind and the rain  the clouds and the clear sky  the thunder and lightning Those who follow these impure ways of livelihood eat with their face up in the air There are monks who flatter important people carry their messages in the four directions of the horizon and solicit their favor with specious words Those who follow these impure ways of livelihood eat with their face turned in the four cardinal directions There are monks who study all kinds of magical spells  curses charms etc As for me I do not want any of these four impure ways of getting my food I follow this pure way of livelihood which consists of begging my food  Then hearing him speak of this pure food conforming with the Dharma  ucimukhī rejoiced and had faith  āriputra attained the state of srotaāpanna for having preached the Dharma Therefore one is called bhikṣu in accordance with this pure means of livelihood which consists of begging ones food The person who has cut the afflictions is called bhikṣu  Furthermore the who has gone forth from home is called bhikṣu Furthermore the one who says from ordination onward I the bhikṣu soandso will observe the precepts for my whole life  Furthermore bhi means to frighten and kṣu means ability  The one who has the power to frighten Māra and his followers  When the monk goes forth from home  shaves his head puts on the saffron robe and receives the precepts  Māra is frightened because he thinks This man will definitely enter into nirvāṇa in time It is as the Buddha said The man who shaves his head puts on the saffron robe and resolves to accept the precepts will know how gradually to cut the bonds and decrease suffering he will enter into nirvāṇa What does saṃgha mean In the language of the Tsin saṃgha means assembly The gathering together of many bhikṣus in one place is called saṃgha In the same way a group of large trees is called a forest  Taken separately the trees do not make up a forest but if they are cut down one by one there is no longer a forest In the same way taken separately the bhikṣus do not make up a saṃgha but if they are removed one by one there is no longer a saṃgha The bhikṣus must be gathered together to constitute a saṃgha There are four types of saṃgha  the assembly having shame   the shameless saṃgha   the assembly of dumb sheep   What is the saṃgha having shame This assembly observes the precepts without transgressing them its body and speech are pure  it knows how to distinguish the beautiful from the ugly but has not attained the Path What is the shameless saṃgha This assembly violates the precepts its body and speech are impure there is no evil that it does not commit What is the assembly of dumb sheep This assembly does not violate the precepts but its faculties are dull and it lacks wisdom  It is unable to discern the beautiful and the ugly the light and the heavy that which is sinful and that which is not sinful  If there is some business in the saṃgha where two people are arguing it is not capable of cutting through the question and remains silent without saying a word like a white sheep that cannot make a sound until it is butchered What is the true assembly The true assembly is that of the śaikṣas and the aśaikṣas who reside in the four fruits and practice the four paths leading to them āstra What is meant by very numerous We call a which increases and rarely decreases very numerous In a numerous assembly if a group is taken out there is a section Here in an assembly of ten thousand bhikṣus a section of five thousand men is taken Hence the expression section of five thousand men All were arhats āstra What does arhat mean He who has destroyed all these enemies that are called the afflictions is called an arhat Furthermore the arhats who have destroyed all the impurities deserve veneration by the gods and men of all the universes  He who will never again be reborn in future generations is called arhat They have destroyed the impurities āstra They are called kṣīṇāsrava because they have completely eliminated the three impurities of the threefold world They were free of the afflictions āstra They are called niṣkleśa because they have destroyed all the fetters  the attachments  the bonds  the obstacles  wrong views and the envelopment of desire  Answer The heretics who have renounced pleasure acquire liberation of mind on one single point and by a single path but they are not freed from all the obstacles  This is why the arhats alone are called suvimuktacitta and suvimuktaprajña Furthermore the arhats have acquired liberation of mind by a twofold path the path of seeing the truths and the path of meditation  this is why they are called suvimuktacitta As for the aikṣas while they have acquired deliverance of mind they are not yet completely liberated because they still retain a residue of the fetters  Furthermore the dharmas auxiliary to the path are not complete in the heretics  They seek the path by cultivating one single quality or two qualities but they are unable to find the path According to them the person who is seeking purity by almsgiving alone or by sacrificing to the gods can escape from grief and be reborn in a land of eternal bliss  Finally some heretics consider only almsgiving and discipline as pure others almsgiving and dhyāna yet others almsgiving and the pursuit of wisdom  The person who calls the absence of any quality or just a few qualities purity will be able to attain liberation of mind to a certain degree but he will not be completely liberated  for in him the path of nirvāṇa is not complete  A stanza says The man who lacks qualities will be unable to cross The ocean of birth old age sickness and death The man endowed with a few qualities will not be able to do more The Path of good practices has been proclaimed by the Buddha The brahmacārin Subhadra  years old and possessing the superknowledges  was on the shore of lake A na po ta to  During the night in a dream he saw everybody without eyes with bodies naked and deep in shadow the sun had disappeared the earth destroyed the ocean dried up and Sumeru toppled over by windstorms My life has reached its end since the teachers of heaven and earth are about to fall Perplexed he could not understand why he had had this bad dream Formerly he had a goddess friend  She came down from the sky and said to Subhadra Fear not there is an omniscient one called Buddha who during the last watch of the night will enter into nirvāṇa without residue  the dream which you have had is not about you at all The next day Subhadra went to the forest of Kiu yi na kie  He met nanda and said to him I have heard that your teacher teaches a new path to nirvāṇa and today during the watch of the night he is going to undergo cessation  Today in the middle of the night the Tathāgata will enter into nirupadhiśeṣanirvāṇa I was nineteen years old When I left home to seek the Path of the Buddhas Since I left home More than fifty years have passed In pure morality dhyāna and wisdom Heretics have no share in these Having not the slightest share How then would they be omniscient In a system where the eightfold noble path does not occur the first second third and fourth fruits are missing in a system where the eightfold noble path is found the first second third and fourth fruits are present O Subhadra in my doctrine there is the eightfold noble path and consequently the first second third and fourth fruits are present The other systems those of the heretics  are all void  they contain neither the Path nor the fruits nor the śramaṇas nor the brāhmaṇas Therefore in my great assembly there is the true lions roar  Having heard this doctrine  the brahmacārin Subhadra immediately attained the state of arhat He said to himself I must not enter nirvāṇa after the Buddha Having had this thought he sat down opposite the Buddha with crossed legs and then by means of his miraculous power  he emitted fire from his body which consumed it entirely This is why the Buddha said Without qualities  or with a few rare qualities the auxiliary dharmas to the Path are not complete  one cannot find salvation The Buddha has said When all the qualities are complete one is able to save disciples In the same way a lesser physician who has only one or two kinds of medicine at his disposal is unable to cure serious sicknesses  whereas a great physician who has all the medicines can cure all the sicknesses Question If it is by elimination of all the afflictions of the threefold world that the mind finds liberation  why did the Buddha say that the mind finds its deliverance by elimination of grasping  Answer Grasping is capable of fettering the mind because of its great power This is why the Buddha spoke about it without saying anything about the other afflictions  When grasping is cut the other afflictions are also cut by the same fact Moreover when it is said The king has arrived we know that he is necessarily accompanied by his retinue  It is the same for grasping Or again when the head is seized the rest of the body follows It is the same for grasping When it is cut we know that all the other afflictions are also cut Finally all the fetters depend on craving or on wrong view  The afflictions that depend on grasping fetter the mind  those that depend on wrong view fetter wisdom  And so when grasping is eliminated all the fetters dependent on it are also eliminated and one attains deliverance of mind  when ignorance is eliminated all the fetters dependent on wrong view are eliminated and one attains deliverance of wisdom  Furthermore these five thousand arhats are irreversible and have attained the knowledge relative to nonproduction of dharmas  this is why it is said that their mind is completely liberated as well as their wisdom  for they do not regress attained arhathood The arhats susceptible of regression obtain an occasional liberation  thus Kiu ti kia  etc although they attained liberation were not completely liberated  as a result of the possibility of regression  Sūtra Their minds were tamed āstra Their minds remain even and indifferent to marks of respect and worship  as well as to hatred curses and blows Whether precious jewels or paving stones are thrown at them they consider them as absolutely the same Whether their hands and feet are cut with a knife or their body anointed with sandalwood  it is the same and indifferent to them Furthermore their minds are tamed because they have cut passion  hatred  pride and delusion at the root Finally these arhats do not like what is pleasant do not hate what is hateful are not deceived by what leads to error They are watchful over their six sense organs This is why their minds are tamed A stanza says The man who watches over the six sense organs Is like a welltrained horse This true sage Is honored by the gods That is why the arhats are called ājāneya They were great nāgās āstra Mahat means snake or elephant Among the innumerable other arhats these five thousand arhats are extremely powerful this is why they are compared to a snake and an elephant In the water the snake is very strong on earth the elephant is very strong A great elephant  well trained can destroy a great army  it marches right up to it and does not turn back it does not fear weapons  does not turn back before water or fire it does not swerve it never turns back when death comes it does not avoid it In the same way the arhats who cultivate the dhyānas and wisdom are able to destroy Māras army and the fetters  their enemies Whether one insults them or strikes them they feel no anger or hatred They have no fear and do not dread the fire and water of old age and death  The great nāga coming out of the ocean and mounted on a great cloud  covers space  Emitting a great lightning bolt that lights up heaven and earth he lets fall an abundant rain that waters everything In the same way the arhats coming out of the ocean of dhyāna and wisdom  mounted on the cloud of lovingkindness and compassion  water the beings who can be saved Manifesting great light and all kinds of emanations  they proclaim the true nature of dharmas and rain down on the minds of their disciples so that the latter can bring forth the roots of good  They were accomplished and complete  Answer They are kṛtya because they have obtained the good dharmas such as faith  discipline  equanimity  concentration  etc They are kṛta because they have obtained the good dharmas such as wisdom  energy  the deliverances  etc Having these two types of dharmas in full they are called kṛtakṛtya Furthermore the afflictions are of two kinds  those that depend on craving   those that depend on wrong views  The arhats are kṛtya because they have cut the afflictions that depend on craving they are kṛta because they have cut the afflictions depending on wrong views Furthermore they are kṛtya because the see clearly the material dharmas  they are kṛta because they see clearly the nonmaterial dharmas  visible and invisible  offering resistance and not offering resistance  etc Furthermore they are kṛtya because they have cut the bad and the morally undefined dharmas they are kṛta because they meditate on the good dharmas  Furthermore they are kṛtya because they are endowed with the wisdom that comes from hearing and the wisdom that comes from contemplating  they are kṛta because they are endowed with the wisdom that comes from meditation   It is the same for all triads of drams Furthermore they are kṛtya because they have attained heat  peak  acquiescence or patience and the highest of worldly dharmas  they are kṛta because they have attained the acquiescence or patience producing right knowledge of suffering and the other pure roots of good  They are kṛtya because they have attained the path of seeing the truths  they are kṛta because they have attained the path of meditation  They are kṛtya because they have acquired the path of the aspirants  they are kṛta because they have acquired the path of the masters  They are kṛtya because they have obtained liberation of mind  they are kṛta because they have obtained liberation of wisdom  They are kṛtya because of destruction of all the impurities  they are kṛta because they have attained total liberation They are kṛtya because they have destroyed all the fetters  they are kṛta because they have obtained definitive deliverance  They are kṛtya because they have assured their own personal interest  they are kṛta because they have assured the interest of others  These are the meanings of the epithet kṛtakṛtya They had set down the burden but were capable of carrying it āstra Thus the Buddha said What is the burden The five skandhas are the burden The arhats are said to be apahṛtabhāra because they have set down this burden In the Buddhadharma two burdens of qualities must be borne that of the interest of oneself and that of the interests of others  The interest of oneself is destruction of all the impurities  definitive deliverance and other similar qualities  The interest of others is faith  discipline  equanimity  concentration  wisdom and other similar qualities The arhats are called bhārasaha because they are capable of bearing their own burden and that of others Furthermore just as a vigorous ox can carry heavy loads so these arhats who have acquired the faculties  the powers  an awakening and a path that is free of defilements can bear the heavy load of the Buddhadharma What is meant by personal interest and personal disadvantage Personal interest is the practice of the good dharmas  Personal disadvantage is the opposite irreligion  Furthermore faith  discipline  equanimity  concentration  wisdom and the other qualities surpass all wealth  win present future and eternal happiness  and lead to the city of immortality  For these three reasons they are called personal interest Thus it is said in the Sin pin  The person who acquires faith and wisdom Possesses the foremost of treasures All the other wealth of the world Is not equal to this treasure of the Dharma Furthermore the attainment of present happiness  future happiness and the eternal happiness of nirvāṇa is called personal interest The rest is personal disadvantage The world knows all kinds of strange doctrines on the path It behaves just like cattle It is necessary to seek the right knowledge and doctrine of the path In order to escape from old age and death and enter into nirvāṇa Finally the noble eightfold path and the fruit of the religious life are called the personal interest of the arhats As these five thousand arhats have obtained the Path and its fruit and enjoy this twofold personal benefit they are described as anuprāptasvakārtha They had completely broken the fetters of existence āstra There are three types of existence  existence of desire  existence in the world of form and existence in the formless world  this is what is called kāmabhava existence  it is the same for the rūpaand ārūpyabhava These fetters are nine in number attraction  aversion  pride  ignorance  doubt  wrong view  unjustified esteem  avarice and envy  These saṃyojanas encompass all of existence and this existence encompasses all the saṃyojanas Question The fetters have indeed been broken in the arhats for they have eliminated all the afflictions  but their existence cannot be cut  Indeed as long as they are not nirvanized they are still furnished with the five aggregates  the twelve bases of consciousness and the eighteen elements of existence  Answer This is not a difficulty for by mentioning the result here we mean to speak of the cause  life  color  strength  pleasure and intelligence  food does not necessarily give these five things there are wellnourished people who die others who are insufficiently nourished who nevertheless live food is the cause of the five benefits given this is why the Buddha said that by giving food five things are given A stanza says By withdrawing all food death is certain But even if one eats death is always possible This is why the Buddha has said By giving food five things are given Thus also a man can eat five pounds of gold although gold is not edible by means of its power of purchase it is the cause of food This is why one says eating gold The Buddha also said that women are defilers of morality  Actually women are not the defilers of morality rather they are the cause of defiling of morality and this is why it is said that they are the defilers of morality If a man falls from on high even before he has reached the ground it is said that he is dead Although he may not be dead  we know that he will die that is why it is said that he is dead In the same way when the arhats have broken their fetters  we know that their existence also will necessarily be broken That is why it is said that they have completely broken the fetters of existence  They were completely delivered by means of complete knowledge āstra Compare the brahmacārin Mo kien ti  His disciples were carrying his corpse on a litter through the city  While they were walking through the crowd they proclaimed Those who see the body of Mākandika with their eyes will all obtain the path of purity  all the more so those who will venerate and honor it Many people believed their words Having heard of this the bhikṣus addressed the Buddha Bhagavat what is this about The Buddha replied with these stanzas To seek for purity in the contemplation of an abject individual Is neither knowledge nor the true path When the fetters and afflictions fill the mind How could one find the pure path in one single glance If one glance sufficed to attain the path Of what use would wisdom and the treasury of the qualities be It is wisdom and the qualities that lead to purity To seek for purity by one glance is not reasonable Question The arhats who have done what is needed to be done should have no need to look for company Why then are they always near the Buddha and not elsewhere so that they save beings Answer If all beings of the ten directions without exception should honor the Buddha the arhats from gratitude for the benefits they have received should honor him doubly How is that These arhats have received immense qualities from the Buddha knowledge  destruction of the fetters  increase in the mind of faith  This is why these very virtuous arhats stay close to the Buddha to taste the blissful taste of the qualities  to venerate him  serve him and recognize his benefits Because they surround the Buddha their buddhaqualities increase The Brahmakāyikadevas surround Brahmā devarāja the Trāyastriṃśadevas surround akra devendra the asuras surround their god Vaiśramaṇa the minor kings surround the noble cakravartin king the sick and the convalescents surround the great physician  in the same way the arhats keep close to the Buddha and because they surround him and venerate him their buddhaqualities increase Question The arhats who have done what needed to be done and assured their personal interest have no need to listen to the Dharma Then why is the Buddha accompanied by five thousand arhats when he preaches the Prajñāpāramitā Answer Although the arhats have done what needed to be done the Buddha wants to put them to the proof with the doctrine of profound wisdom  The Buddha said to āriputra In the Po lo yen king  in the question of A ki to  it is said  There are all kinds of aspirants And people who have experienced the truth  The doctrine practiced by these people I would like that you to tell it to me precisely But āriputra remained silent Three times the Buddha asked him the same question three times āriputra remained silent Then to prompt him to the right answer the Buddha said to āriputra That which arises  that which arises must also perish  He who practices the teaching of the arising of the conditioned is called śaikṣa But the one who has found the teaching of the nonproduction of things by means of wisdom is called Saṃkhyātadharma This sūtra has been cited at length here Furthermore the arhats stay close to the Buddha and listen to his doctrine because those who have not yet attained the impure or pure dhyānas wish to attain them and those who have already attained them wish to deepen them Furthermore to enjoy the bliss of his presence  Thus in the Nan to kia king  it is said Just now I am listening to the Dharma  Furthermore the arhats who stay close to the Buddha can never get their fill of listening to the Dharma Thus in the Pi lou ti kia king  āriputra says to Pilotika In my Dharma one never gets enough of listening to the doctrine  Furthermore if the Buddha the great teacher himself listens attentively to the Dharma preached by his disciples it is not necessary to ask why the arhats quite perfect though they may be in turn listen to the Dharma  If a satiated person starts to eat again when he finds exquisite food how could a famished man not eat it This is why the arhats although they have done what needed to be done  always stay close to the Buddha to hear the Dharma Finally the Buddha as well as the arhats dwell in the state of deliverance  Endowed with these dharmas of dwelling  they are surrounded and mutually adorned  Thus it is said in the Tchan tan pi yu king  When there is a forest of candana  the eraṇḍas surround it When there is a forest of eraṇḍas the candanas surround it If there are candanas the candanas are considered to be the forest if there are eraṇḍas they serve as the entourage  It is the same for the Buddha and the arhats The Buddha abides in the good dharmas and in deliverance and so do the arhats Endowed with the dharmas of abiding  they surround and adorn one another mutually The Buddha surrounds the great assembly like Sumeru king of the mountains is surrounded by ten precious mountains like the white king of the elephants in rut is surrounded by white elephants in rut like the king of the lions is surrounded by lions In the same way the Buddha a field of merit  is surrounded and accompanied by his disciples Except for nanda who being on the level of the śaikṣas was a streamenterer ekapudgalaṃ sthāpayitvā yad utāyuṣmananta nandaṃ śaikṣaṃ srotaāpannam Answer Because nanda is not among the arhats whom we have just praised above He is of the rank of śaikṣa and has not yet eliminated desire  Question The venerable nanda is the third patriarch  head of the great assembly for numberless kalpas he planted the seeds of nirvāṇa  he always stays near the Buddha he is the keeper of the baskets of the Dharma  How is it that this venerable one who ha with sharp faculties  has been able to come so far without having eliminated desire and is not yet a śaikṣa Answer I wish to be the foremost of those who have heard much   because of their buddhadharmas the arhats who have done what needed to be done can no longer serve or venerate anyone Having accomplished the grand business in the Buddhadharma the destruction of the afflictions  they remain seated with the Buddha on the palanquin of deliverance  Furthermore the sthavira nanda who has listened retained and meditated on all kinds of sūtras has vast wisdom  whereas his concentration of mind is average Yet both of these qualities are necessary to obtain the state destruction of the impurities This is why the sthavira nanda is just a streamenterer Furthermore out of love for the Buddhas service nanda was his servant  and he said to himself If I should attain the state that involves the destruction of the impurities too soon I would distance myself from the Buddha and I could no longer be his servant This is why nanda who could have been an arhat had decided not to take up this state The thousand arhats were not on the Gṛdhrakūtaparvata the place fixed  the time of the Bhagavats death had not yet come the sthavira Po ki tseu was not present This is why the sthavira nanda does not destroy his impurities In order that nanda be able to destroy them and  three conditions were necessary the Bhagavat must die the assembly that is to be entrusted with compiling the Dharma must be assembled and Vṛjiputra must address the official exhortations   Finally the venerable nanda is in no way comparable to other men in his disgust for the things of the world  From birth to birth nanda is of royal lineage  his beauty is incomparable and his merits are immense  A close relative of the Bhagavat he always accompanied the Buddha as servant  Inevitably he said to himself I am the Buddhas servant I know the precious baskets of Dharma  I am not afraid to let to let go of the destruction of the impurities  With this motivation he was not in a hurry  Question What is the origin of the venerable nandas name Is it of ancient origin  Is it a name given to him by his parents Does it rest on reasons Answer This name is of ancient origin it was also given to him by his parents and it rests on good reasons Why is this name of ancient origin In one of his earlier lives the Buddha Che kia wen was a potter called Ta kouang ming  At that time there was a Buddha called ākyamuni his disciples were called Ch li fou  Mou kien lien and A nan  The Buddha and his disciples went to the house of the potter to spend the night On that occasion the potter gave three things a seat made of straw  a lamp and honey syrup and he made a gift of them to the Buddha and the community of monks  Then he made the following vow  Later after five unfortunate generations of old age  sickness and death  I will be Buddha I will be called ākyamuni like the present Buddha and my disciples will bear the names of the present disciples of the Buddha By virtue of this vow of the Buddha is named nanda Furthermore from birth to birth nanda had made the following vow Among the disciples of the Buddha I will be the foremost of those who have heard much  by the name nanda c Finally from birth to birth by the virtue of patience  nanda had expelled all hatred  this is why he was always reborn very beautiful  Because of this beauty which made all who saw him rejoice his parents named him nanda which in the language of the Tsin means Joy This was his name according to the old traditions Why did his parents give him the name nanda Once there was a king of the solar clan named Che tseu kia  This king had four sons  Tsing fan   Po fan   Hou fan   Kan lou wei  King uddodana had two sons  Fo the Buddha  Nanto  King uklodana had two sons  Po ti   Yi cha  King Droṇodana had two sons  Ti po ta to   A nan  King Amṛitadana had two sons  Mo ho nan   A ni lou teou  As for his daughter Amṛitārasa she had a son called Che po lo  Then the bodhisattva Si ta to grew up renouncing the state of cakrvartin king he went forth from home in the middle of the night and went to the country of Ngeou leou pi lo on the banks of the river Ni lien chan where he practiced asceticism for six years But king uddhodana who loved his son regularly sent messengers to ask about him and bring back news of him Has my son attained the path Is he sick Is he dead The messenger came back to tell the king The bodhisattva is nothing but skin bones and sinews to hold it all together He is very weak Today or tomorrow will be the end of him The king experienced great sadness at these words he plunged into the ocean of grief My son has renounced becoming a cakravartin king and now he will not succeed in becoming buddha Is he then going to die without attaining anything The king grieved greatly But the bodhisattva renouncing asceticism partook of the milk soup of a hundred flavors and his body recovered its strength Having bathed in the waters of the Nairañjanā river he went to the Bodhi tree sat down on the diamond seat and proclaimed the following oath I will remain seated with crossed legs until I realize omniscience until I have attained omniscience I will not rise from this seat Then king Māra at the head of a troop of eighteen koṭis of warriors came to the Bodhisattva and tried to bring about his ruin But by the power of his wisdom  the Bodhisattva destroyed Māras army Since the Bodhisattva is invincible I will torment his father He went to king uddhodana and said to him slyly Your son died today in the second part of the night  At these words the king was stunned and collapsed on his bed like a fish on hot sand Weeping miserably he utred this stanza Then the deity of the Bodhi tree  Ta houan hi  by name came to king uddhodana holding a celestial flower and said the following stanza to him Ken pen chouo His brilliance is like the rising sun He lights up the ten directions The king replied First a god came to tell me that my son was dead and now you come to tell me that he has conquered Māra and attained the Path These two pieces of news are contradictory whom should I believe The deity of the tree answered The god who previously came to tell you the lie that you son was dead was Māra full of jealousy  he came to make you grieve Today all the devas and nāgas offer flowers and perfumes  they are hanging silk cloths from the sky  Your sons body emits a brilliant light that fills heaven and earth At these words the king was freed from all his sadness and said Although my son may have renounced becoming a cakravartin king today he has become the king who will turn the wheel of the Dharma  He has surely attained great benefit and lost nothing The kings mind experienced great joy  At that moment a messenger arrived from the palace of king Droṇodana to say to king uddhodana Your noble brother has had a son The kings mind felt great joy He said This child should be called nanda That is why his parents called him nanda How does this name rest on good reasons nanda was handsome and graceful like a clear mirror  His body was pure When women saw him their passions were aroused this is why the Buddha ordered nanda to wear a covering over his shoulders  As he gladdened the mind and the eyes of all who saw him he was called nanda Great Joy On this subject the Tsao louen tch tsan says His face is like the full moon His eye like a blue lotus flower The water of the ocean of the Buddhas Dharma Flows in the mind of nanda Contes III p  Ken pen chouo   Ta tche tou louen T  He brings forth great joy In the minds and to the eyes of those who see him Those who come to see the Buddha He introduces without any flaw in ceremonial Thus although nanda could have attained the state of arhat he did not destroy the impurities in order to continue to serve and honor the Buddha Because of these great qualities and although he himself was not aśaikṣa he dwelt among the aśaikṣas although he had not eliminated desire he resided among those who had eliminated it  Also since among the five thousand members of the assembly he was not really an arhat the text says that except for nanda The Buddha was also accompanied by five hundred bhikṣuṇis  five hundred upāsakas lay men and five hundred upāsikās  all had seen the holy truths pañcamātrair bhikṣuṇīśatair upāsakair upāsikābhiś Answer In women  wisdom is often deficient while the afflictions and defilements are serious  Almost always seeking happiness and pleasure  they are rarely capable of breaking their fetters and obtaining deliverance  And so the Buddha said This teaching of dependent origination is supreme  profound and difficult to grasp  but the destruction of all the afflictions  renunciation and the attainment of nirvāṇa are even more difficult to find  That is why women attain it more rarely than the bhikṣus Having families the upāsakas and the upasīkās have impure minds unable to destroy their impurities  they are content with understanding the four noble truths and acting as aspirants  Thus a stanza says Despite its splendid body the peacock Cannot fly as far as the swan  In the same way the layman  despite his wealth and nobility Is not the equal of the monk whose qualities are eminent Thus although the bhikṣuṇīs have gone forth from home and renounced worldly activities  their wisdom is deficient This is why there are only five hundred bhikṣuṇīs who have attained arhathood  In the two lay assemblies who live at home and are busy there those who have found the Path are rare  Each of them consists also of five hundred members Question Why does the sūtra not praise these three communities as it has the five thousand arhats Answer Because the praise of the great assembly is also valid for the others Moreover if the three communities were praised separately the heretics would ask why the bhikṣuṇīs in particular were praised and would slander them If the lay people were praised they would say it was to flatter them That is why the sūtra does not praise them Question In other Mahāyānasūtras the Buddha is accompanied by a great assembly of bhikṣus numbering eight thousand sixty thousand or a hundred thousand Yet this Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra is the most important of the sūtras Thus it is said in the Tchou lei pin  Losing the other sūtras as a whole is a light sin  but losing a single word of the Prajñāpāramitā is a very grave sin From this we know that the Prajñāpāramitā is the most important sūtra A very numerous assembly would be needed at this most important sūtra why is the number of its auditors restricted to five thousand bhikṣus and to the groups of five hundred each of bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās Answer If the size of the crowd of listeners is restricted it is because the sūtra is very profound and hard to fathom  In the same way when a king possesses real jewels  he does not tell this to ordinary people  but he does announce it to great individuals his confidants When a king holds council he deliberates with his ministers his confidants his experts but he does not admit the lesser officials Furthermore  individuals  have all attained the Path although they do not understand all of the profound Prajñāpāramitā nevertheless they believe in it and are able to acquire the fourfold faith of pure knowledge  In other sūtras the auditors are more numerous but not all have obtained the Path Finally we have praised the ten million arhats amongst whom the five thousand best were selected It was the same for the bhikṣuṇīs the upāsakas and upāsīkās Being difficult to find  these victorious ones are not numerous If the order of seniority is followed the bodhisattvas come first then the bhikṣus the bhikṣuṇīs the upāsakas and the upāsīkās for the bodhisattvas come right after the Buddha If the reverse order were followed first would be placed the upasīkās then the upāsakas the bhikṣuṇīs the bhikṣus and finally the bodhisattvas Why are the bhikṣus mentioned first here then the three assemblies bhikṣuṇī upāsaka upāsīkā and then last the bodhisattvas Answer Although the bodhisattvas come right after the Buddha they have not destroyed all their afflictions  this is why the arhats are spoken of first In the arhats wisdom is small but they are already ripened  in the bodhisattvas wisdom is rich but they have not destroyed their afflictions That is why the arhats are spoken of first There are two kinds of Buddhist doctrine the esoteric and the exoteric  In the exoteric the Buddhas pratyekabuddhas and arhats are all fields of merit because their afflictions have been destroyed without residue In the esoteric it is said that the bodhisattvas have obtained acquiescence in the teaching of the nonarising of dharmas  that their defilements are destroyed that they possess the six superknowledges and that they work for the benefit of beings It is from the exoteric point of view that the sūtra places the arhats before the bodhisattvas Furthermore by the power of skillful means  the bodhisattvas appear enter into the five destinies  experience the five passions with the view of influencing beings If they were placed above the arhats gods and men would be worried and have doubts Answer Although the four assemblies have not completely destroyed their impurities  they will destroy them without further delay this is why they are presented under the name of auditors  To place the bodhisattvas among these four assemblies would be unsuitable Thus the bhikṣuṇīs who have received innumerable disciplinary rules  should come after the bhikṣus but before the novices  however as the Buddha did not bestow any ceremonial on them they come after the novices It is the same for the bodhisattvas they should be placed at the head of the three classes of śaikṣas but as that would not be suitable they are placed at the tail end Furthermore some claim that because of their wisdom and their qualities  the bodhisattvas surpass the arhats and pratyekabuddhas and for this reason they are mentioned separately Question In the sūtras of the śrāvakas  four assemblies only are spoken of Why is an assembly of bodhisattvas added here separately Answer There are two types of Path  that of the śrāvakas and that of the bodhisattvas  The four assemblies bhikṣu bhikṣuṇī upāsaka upāsīkā form the path of the śrāvakas the bodhisattvamahāsattvas form the path of the bodhisattvas For this reason in the texts of the śrāvakas the beginning of the sūtra does not say that the Buddha was dwelling in such and such a place with such and such bodhisattvas it simply says that the Buddha was dwelling in such and such a place with such and such bhikṣus The Buddha was dwelling in Vārāṇasī with five hundred bhikṣus The Buddha was dwelling in the land of Gayā with a thousand bhikṣus The Buddha was dwelling in rāvastī with five hundred bhikṣus This is the way all their sūtras begin they never say that the Buddha is accompanied by any number of bodhisattvas whatsoever Question There are two kinds of bodhisattvas those who have gone forth from the world and those who stay in the world  The gṛhastha bodhisattvas are usually cited among the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs Why does the sūtra cite them separately here Answer Although they are usually ranked in the four assemblies it is fitting to cite them separately Because if the bodhisattvas are necessarily included in the four assemblies the four assemblies do not necessarily include the bodhisattvas Why is that Furthermore the bodhisattvas having obtained faith in the doctrine of nonarising of dharmas  have suppressed all these names and conventions that characterize saṃsāra and have left the three worlds they are not ranked in the number of beings  If the śrāvakas who have become arhats and are nirvāṇized are not counted in the number of living beings what can be said about the bodhisattvas Thus in the Po lo yen to the Question of Yeou po che  a stanza says  After cessation  is it impossible to reappear He who has disappeared is not reborn Having entered into nirvāṇa does one remain there always The Buddha answered He who has disappeared cannot be defined He escapes from causes and conditions  from names and characteristics  He has gone beyond the way of all speech  In one moment he disappears like an extinguished fire If the arhats have destroyed all names and conventions  all the more so are the bodhisattvas able to destroy all dharmas Do they not destroy them by knowing their true nature and by attaining the dharmakāya This is why the Mahāyāna mentions the bodhisattvas separately from the four assemblies Question At the beginning of the Mahāyāna sūtras why are two assemblies mentioned bodhisattvas and śrāvakas whereas at the beginning of the sūtras of the śrāvakas only the assembly of bhikṣus is mentioned and not that of the bodhisattvas Answer It is in order to distinguish the two Vehicles the Vehicle of the Buddhas and the Vehicle of the listeners  The rāvakayāna is narrow  the Buddhayāna is broad  the rāvakayāna is that of personal interest  action for oneself the Buddhayāna is that of benefit for all Furthermore the rāvakayāna teaches in particular the emptiness of the individual  whereas the Buddhayāna teaches both the emptiness of the individual and the emptiness of dharmas  These are the differences that distinguish the two Vehicles The Mahāyāna sūtras speak of the two assemblies śrāvaka and bodhisattva Thus it is said in the Tsan mo ho yen kie  he is he is not he both is and is not or he neither is or is not The practitioners of the Mahāyāna Are able to bring joy to all They bring benefit by means of the true Dharma And cause the supreme Path to be found The practitioners of the Mahāyāna Have compassion for all They give their head and their eyes And sacrifice them like a wisp of straw The practitioners of the Mahāyāna Observe the pure precepts  Like the plowox that loves its tail But has no cares about its own life The practitioners of the Mahāyāna Have attained supreme patience  To slash their body To their eyes is like cutting grass The practitioners of the Mahāyāna Are zealous and untiring Their effort is ceaseless Like sailors on the high seas They have acquired the pure vaśitās The practitioners of the Mahāyāna Discern the characteristics of dharmas They do not destroy true wisdom When they are endowed with it Their knowledge is inconceivable The power of their compassion is immense Without entering into distinctions They consider all dharmas in the same way The carts of the ass horse camel and elephant Although similar are not comparable In the same way the bodhisattva Vehicle differs from that of the śrāvaka The one is great the other is small Great lovingkindness is its axletree Wisdom is its two wheels Energy is its steed Discipline and the samādhis are its nails Patience and shame are its timbering The dhāraṇīs are its reins The Vehicle of the Mahāyāna Can cross over anything Question At the beginning of the sūtras of the śrāvakas only the assembly of the bhikṣus is spoken of In the sūtras of the Mahāyāna why is not the assembly of bodhisattvas the only assembly spoken of Anawer It is because the Mahāyāna is broad and all the Vehicles enter into it whereas the Vehicle of the śrāvakas is narrow and does not contain the Mahāyāna Thus the Ganges does not contain the great ocean because it is narrow whereas the great ocean can receive all the rivers because it is vast A stanza says The Mahāyāna is like the sea The Hīnayāna is like the water contained in the hoofprint of an ox  The small cannot contain the great This comparison is applicable here Question What do the words bodhi and sattva mean Bodhi is the path of the Buddhas  sattva is either a being or a great mind The bodhisattva is the being who is going to obtain the mind indestructible and infrangible like a diamond mountain  of the qualities of the Path of the Buddhas Some stanzas say All the Buddhaattributes Wisdom  discipline and meditation That are profitable to all Are called bodhi The unshakeable mind Able to patiently accomplish the dharmas of the Path Indestructible and infrangible  This mind is called sattva Furthermore sat means to praise the holy Dharma tva means the essential nature of the holy Dharma The bodhisattva is so called because his mind is beneficial to himself and to others because he saves all beings because he knows the true nature of all dharmas because he travels the Path of supreme perfect enlightenment and because he is praised by all the āryas Why is that Among all the attributes  that of the Buddha is foremost and because the bodhisattva wishes to attain it he is praised by the āryas Furthermore the bodhisattva is so called because he seeks to gain the Path in order to liberate all beings from birth  old age and death  Furthermore three kinds of Paths are called bodhi the Path of the Buddhas ii the Path of the śrāvakas iii the Path of the pratyekabuddhas That of the pratyekabuddhas and of the śrāvakas while leading to a bodhi are not however qualified as bodhi But the bodhi contained in the qualities of Buddha are qualified as Bodhi This is what is called bodhisattva Question For how many reasons is he called Bodhisattva Answer The Bodhisattva is so called for three reasons he possesses the great vow  his mind is unshakeable and his energy is irreversible  Furthernore some say that he is called Bodhisattva starting from the first production of the mind of bodhi  when he made the vow to become Buddha and to save all beings A stanza says When at the moment of the first cittotpāda He made the vow to become Buddha He has surpassed all the universes And is worthy to be venerated by men He is called Bodhisattva during the interval starting from the first production of mind up to the ninth uninterrupted path when he enters into the diamond concentration  There are two kinds of bodhisattvas with regression or without regression  as is the case for the arhats who are susceptible of falling back or not susceptible of falling back  The nonregressing bodhisattvas are called the true bodhisattvas for they are it truly the others the bodhisattvas susceptible of falling back are called bodhisattva  In the same way those who have found the fourfold Path  are called the true assembly for they are really it the others those who have not found the Path are called assembly  Question How do we know whether a bodhisattva is with regression or without regression Answer In the Prajñāpāramitā in the chapter of the A pi po tche  the Buddha himself defined the characteristics  regression has such and such characteristics nonregression has other characteristics If the bodhisattva practices or meditates on one single dharma he is called a nonregressing bodhisattva What is this one single dharma It is said that by resolutely accumulating good dharmas the Buddhas have attained supreme perfect enlightenment  Furthermore the bodhisattva who possesses one single dharma is without regression What is this one single dharma It is right effort  Thus the Buddha asked nanda What are these two dharmas Knowing that all dharmas are empty and never abandoning beings The person who does that is a nonregressing bodhisattva  Resolutely he has made the vow to become Buddha and this resolution is unshakeable and infrangible like diamond   His compassion for all beings penetrates his bones and marrow   He has attained the samādhi of wisdom and sees all the Buddhas of the present  He who has awakened himself and then awakens others is called bodhisattva he who necessarily will become Buddha is called bodhisattva Bodhi is the wisdom of the saint who has destroyed the impurities  The person born from this wisdom protected by the sages and served by the sages is called bodhisattva They also say that he is called bodhisattva as soon as he has produced the nonregressing mind  They also say that he must have eliminated five dharmas and gained five dharmas in order to be called bodhisattva What are these five dharmas The third asaṃkhyeya goes from the Buddha Dīpaṃkara to the Buddha Pi po che  After these three asaṃkhyeyakalpas the Bodhisattva accomplishes the actions producing the thirtytwo marks Question In what place are the actions producing the thirtytwo marks accomplished Answer In the realm of desire and not in the form realm or in the formless realm  Of the five destinies of the desire realm they are accomplished in the human destiny  Of the four continents  they are accomplished in Jambudvīpa He accomplished them in the epoch in which the Buddhas appear not in an epoch when there are no Buddhas He accomplished them with the view of Buddhahood and not with any other goal Question Are the actions producing the thirtytwo marks bodily actions  vocal actions or mental actions  Answer They are mental actions and not bodily or vocal actions Because mental action alone is profitable Question Mental action concerns the six consciousnesses  Are the actions producing the thirtytwo marks accomplished by the mental consciousness or by the other five consciousnesses Answer They are accomplished by the mental consciousness and not by the other five consciousnesses Because the five consciousnesses are incapable of discernment  Which mark is set in place first Answer According to others the mark fixed first is that which consists of having deeply set black eyes  for it is with an eye of this kind that the One with great lovingkindness looks upon beings These two opinions whatever may be said about them are incorrect When the causes and conditions of the marks are gathered there is a first realization for all the marks together so how could the feet well planted be the first Question Answer Thirtytwo different volitions accomplish the thirtytwo marks by reason of one volition for each mark But each mark taken separately is adorned with a hundred merits  Question What is the extent of each of these merits Answer According to some each merit is equivalent to that which assures the cakravartin king power over the four continents  A hundred merits of this kind would realize one single mark According to others each merit is equivalent to that which gives Che ti houan yin mastery over two classes of gods According to others each merit is equivalent to that which gives the king of the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods the power over the world of desire  According to others each merit is equivalent to the merit that has as its fruit the enjoyment of all beings with the exception of the bodhisattva close to bodhi  According to others each merit is equivalent to the collective merit of all the beings of earth and heaven at the end of a kalpa merit which has as its retribution the formation of a trichiliomegachiliocosm  It is equivalent to that which one person would gain by caring for and healing all the beings of a trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu in the case where these would all be blind and without eyes or where they had all been poisoned and he took care of them and cured them or where they were about to die and he was able to save them and deliver them or where they had all lost their discipline and he was able to teach them and bring them back to pure discipline and right view According to yet others this merit is immeasurable and incomparable  When the Bodhisattva has entered the third asaṃkhyeya his mind and his volition have a great activity he accomplishes the actions producing the thirtytwo marks This is why his merits are immense and only the Buddha can know them Question During how long a time does the Bodhisattva accomplish the the thirtytwo marks Answer During a hundred kalpas if he goes slowly during ninetyone kalpas if he goes quickly The Bodhisattva ākyamuni realized the thirtytwo marks in ninetyone kalpas Thus it is said in a sūtra Once in times gone by there was a Buddha named Fou cha  at the same time there were two Bodhisattvas the first named ākyamuni and the second Maitreya The Buddha Puṣya wanted to see if the mind of the Bodhisattva ākyamuni was pure or not He examined it and saw that his mind was not pure but that the minds of his disciples were pure As for the Bodhisattva Maitreya his mind was pure but that the minds of his disciples were not pure Then the Buddha Puṣya said to himself It is easy to change quickly the mind of a single man but it is difficult to change quickly the mind of a crowd Having had this thought wanting the Bodhisattva ākyamuni to become Buddha quickly the Buddha Puṣya climbed the Himavat mountain  found a rock cave filled with jewels  and there entered into the concentration of fire  At the same time the Bodhisattva ākyamuni who then was a heretical sage  climbed the mountain gathering herbs He saw the Buddha Puṣya seated in the jewelcave in the concentration of fire emitting a great brilliance At this sight he experienced great joy  he had faith and paid homage Standing erect on one leg his palms joined towards the Buddha he considered him attentively Without blinking his eyes for seven days and seven nights he praised the Buddha with one single stanza Either in heaven or on earth there is no equal to the Buddha In the universes of the ten directions there is noone comparable to him For seven days and seven nights he contemplated the Buddha thus without blinking his eyes This is how he freed nine kalpas and reached supreme perfect enlightenment in ninetyone kalpas Question The Bodhisattva ākyamuni intelligent and welllearned was capable of composing all sorts of marvelous stanzas Why then does he praise the Buddha with one single stanza for seven days and seven nights Answer The Bodhisattva ākyamuni valued his mental intentions and valued the fact of not chattering If he had praised the Buddha with still more stanzas his mind would now and then have been distracted  This is why he praised the Buddha with the same stanza for seven days and seven nights Question Why was the Bodhisattva ākyamunis mind impure whereas that of his disciples was pure Why was the mind of the Bodhisattva Maitreya impure whereas that of his disciples was pure Answer The Bodhisattva ākyamuni was totally preoccupied with the good of beings and but little with himself whereas the Bodhisattva Maitreya preoccupied himself much with his own person and little with other beings During the ninetyone kalpas from the Buddha Pi po che to the Buddha Kia ch  the Bodhisattva accomplished the actions producing the thirtytwo marks and when he had accumulated them his six virtues were perfected  The six virtues What are the six virtues  He gives everything unrestrictedly and when he has given even his body his heart feels no regret for example king Che pi who gave his body to the pigeon  In one of his previous lives the Buddha ākyamuni was a king named ibi this king was reverent  had received refuge and was very energetic and full of lovingkindness and compassion  he considered all beings with the love of a mother for her child The life of Che ti houan yin was exhausted and about to end Where is there an omniscient Buddha I have some problems in various subjects and I have not been able to cut through my doubts  He knew there was no Buddha and returning to the heavens he sat down sadly A skillful magician  the god Pi cheou kie mo asked him Devendra why are you so sad akra answered I was looking for someone who is omniscient and I have been unable to find him There is a great bodhisattva endowed with generosity  discipline meditation and wisdom  Before long he will be Buddha akra replied with this stanza Bodhisattvas who produce the Great Mind Eggs of fish and flowers of the mango tree These three things are rather common But it is rare that they bear fruit Viśvakarman replied This king ibi of the Yeou che na clan is disciplined very kind very compassionate meditative and wise before long he will be Buddha akradevendra then said to Viśvakarman Let us go to examine him to see if he possesses the marks of a bodhisattva You will change yourself into a pigeon and I will be a falcon  You will pretend to be afraid and will take refuge in the kings armpit I will chase you Viśvakarman answered Why torment the great Bodhisattva in this way akradevendra replied with this stanza In the same way that real gold must be tested It is necessary to test this bodhisattva in this way And find out if his resolve is strong When akra had spoken this stanza Viśvakarman changed himself into a pigeon with red eyes and red feet while akradevendra changed himself into a falcon The falcon pursued the pigeon swiftly the latter flew directly to take refuge in the kings armpit trembling with fear with troubled eyes it uttered moans Then a numerous crowd Declared at this sight This king is very kind All beings trust him This pigeon this little bird Has taken refuge in him as in its nest That is the mark of a bodhisattva He will be Buddha before long Then the falcon perched on a nearby tree said to king ibi Give me my pigeon The king answered It is I who took it first it is not yours Since I have produced the Great Mind I welcome all beings and I wish to save all beings The falcon said O king you want to save all beings am I not part of them Why should I be the only one not to enjoy your compassion Would you deprive me of my daily food The king replied What do you eat I have made the vow to protect every being that takes refuge in me What food do you need I will give it to you The falcon answered I need fresh meat The king began to think That is difficult to find without killing animals Must I then kill something to give it to him Reflecting thus his decision remained firm and he spoke this stanza The flesh of my own body Subject to old age sickness and death Will start to rot before long I will give it to him Having had this thought he called a servant to bring a knife cut the flesh of his thigh and gave it to the falcon The falcon said to the king O king you are giving me fresh meat but in all fairness you should give me a weight of flesh equal to the weight of the pigeon Make no mistake The king said I will use my scales  He placed of flesh on one side and the pigeon on the other but the pigeon was heavier than the flesh of the king Then he ordered the servant to cut his other thigh but that too was still too light Then his ministers and his family put up a curtain and sent away those who were present because the king could not be seen in that state But king ibi said to them Do not send the people away let them come in and watch and he added these stanzas May the gods men and asuras Come and contemplate me A great mind an extreme resolve is necessary To attain Buddhahood Whoever is seeking Buddhahood Must bear great suffering If one cannot maintain ones resolution One should give up the vow  Then the Bodhisattva with bloody hands took the scales and wanted to climb up on them he maintained his resolve to balance the weight of the pigeon with his whole body The falcon said to him Great king that is very difficult Why are you doing that Rather give me the pigeon The king answered The pigeon has taken refuge in me I will never give it to you At the price of my body I want to attain Buddhahood With his hands he took the scales but as his flesh was exhausted and his muscles torn he could not make his way there and trying to climb up he fell down Reprimanding his own heart he said  You must be strong and not anxious All beings are plunged into an ocean of suffering You yourself have sworn to save them all Why be discouraged The pain is small the sufferings of hell are great If they are compared yours do not make up a sixteenth part If I who am wise full of energy disciplined and meditative if I suffer such pain what about people without wisdom who are plunged into hell Then the Bodhisattva resolutely trying to climb up took the scales and gave the order to his servant to help him At that moment his resolve was strong and he regretted nothing The devas nāgas asuras piśacas manuṣyas praised him greatly They said To act in this way for a little pigeon is extraordinary  Then the great earth trembled six times the great sea swelled its waves  the dead trees began to blossom the gods caused a perfumed rain to fall and threw flowers The goddesses sang his praises He will surely become Buddha Then the devarṣi came from the four directions  saying This is a true Bodhisattva who will soon become Buddha The falcon said to the pigeon In the garden of compassion He has planted the tree of omniscience We must pay homage to him He should not be caused any more pain Then Viśvakarman said to akradevendra Devendra you who possess miraculous power you should make this king whole in body again akradevendra replied The king himself is going to swear that his great heart was joyful he sacrificed his life and gave it so that all beings could seek Buddhahood akra then said to the king When you cut off your flesh and you were suffering so cruelly did you feel any regret The king answered My heart was joyful  Who could believe that you did not feel anger or irritation Then the Bodhisattva made this vow When I cut my flesh and when my blood flowed I felt neither anger nor irritation I was resolved and without regret for I was heading to Buddhahood If I am speaking the truth may my body become as it was before Hardly had he pronounced these words than his body became as it was before At this sight men and gods became very joyful and cried out at this miracle This great Bodhisattva will surely become Buddha We must honor him wholeheartedly and wish that he will become Buddha soon He will protect us Then akradevendra and Viśvakarman returned to the heavens Answer By not sparing his life when it is a question of keeping the pure precepts  Thus king Siu to siu mo  for the sake of the great king Kie mo cha po to went so far as to offer his life but did not violate the precepts There was once a king called Sutosoma seizing a serpent in midocean The women lamented and wept in the garden in the city within and without there was turmoil and consternation Kalmāṣapāda carrying the king traveled through space and came to his home where he set Sutasoma down amidst the ninetynine kings  I wish to keep my promise today Rather lose ones life than break it My heart feels no regret Having reflected in this way the king departed and returned to Kalmāṣapāda who seeing him from afar rejoiced and said to him You are a man of your word who does not break his promises Every man seeks to save his own life You had the chance to escape from death but you came back to fulfill your promise You are a great man  Then Sutosoma praised faithfulness to ones word Listening to him Kalmāṣapāda developed pure faith and said to king Sutosoma You have spoken well in return I will release you you are free I grant you also the ninetynine kings  May they return each as he will to their own countries When he had spoken thus the hundred kings returned  Answer When people come to insult him strike him beat him slash him tear off his skin cut him to pieces and take his life his mind feels no hatred  Thus when king Kia li cut off his hands  feet  ears and nose  the bhikṣu Tchan kept a strong mind without emotion  Question Answer When he possesses great exertion of mind Thus the bodhisattva Ta che  putting his life at the disposal of all  swore to empty the water of the ocean until it was completely Pāli sources Khantivādajātaka no This is how the Bodhisattva fulfills the six virtues Sojourn in the Tuṣita heaven The Buddha became a disciple under the Buddha Kāśyapa observed the pure precepts  practiced the qualities and was reborn in the heaven of the Teou chouai  Question Why was the Bodhisattva born in the Tuṣita heaven and not above or below it Possessing great power  he could have been reborn wherever he wished Answer Furthermore at a level lower than that the fetters are too heavy in a higher level they are too light In the heaven of the Tuṣitas the fetters are neither too heavy nor too light for there wisdom is safe  If he were born in a lower level where the lifespan is short  his life would be over before the time of his coming as Buddha if he were born in a higher level where the lifespan is long  his life would be prolonged beyond the time of his becoming Buddha But among the Tuṣita gods the span of life coincides with the period when Buddhas appear  Finally the Buddha always dwells in a middling destiny  they surpass three classes of gods the Caturmahārājakāyikas and are below the other three classes the Nirmāṇaratis the Paranirmitavaśavartins and the Brahmakāyikas Having come from the Tuṣitas the T RhysDavids Dialogues II p What is the examination of the mother The bodhisattva asks himself who is the mother who will be able to bear a bodhisattva as strong as Nārāyaṇa When this examination is finished he determines that only the family of king uddhodana residing in Kapilavastu in Madhyadeśa is capable of conceiving the Bodhisattva Having thought thus he descends from Tuṣita heaven and enters the womb of his mother without loss of his fullmindedness Question Why do all the Bodhisattvas in their last birth come from heaven and not from among men Answer Because they have climbed up to the supreme destiny and of the six destinies  that of the gods is the highest Furthermore coming from heaven they possess all kinds of beauty and miracles which they would not have at their disposal if they were to come from a human destiny Finally because men venerate the gods Question All people have a disturbed mind at the moment of reincarnation when they enter the womb of their mother  Why then is it said that the Bodhisattva has an undisturbed mind when he enters his mothers womb Answer According to some at the moment of reincarnation  all beings have a disturbed mind  but since the Bodhisattva has no loss of mindfulness nāsti bodhisattvasya muṣitā smṛtiḥ it is said that he enters his mothers womb with an undisturbed mind When he is in the stage of the Ko lo lo  he knows that he is in the kalala stage ie when seven days after conception the semen and blood coagulate  When he is in the stage of the Kie na  he knows that he is in the ghana stage ie three weeks after conception he resembles frozen cream This woman and I will make love on the other hand he experiences hostility towards his father  This man and I will make love and on the other hand she experiences hatred for her mother The Bodhisattva does not have these thoughts of aversion or of attraction  he knows in advance who his mother and father are This mother and father will nourish my body Being based on them I will take birth and will attain supreme perfect enlightenment  It is with this pure mind that he thinks of his parents and at the moment of reincarnation  he enters into the womb  Birth and the thirtytwo lakṣaṇas At the end of ten months with correct mind and without loss of mindfulness the Bodhisattva left his mothers womb took seven steps and uttered these words This is my last birth  Look and see if my son has the thirtytwo marks of the Great Man  If he has these thirtytwo marks he will have two possibilities if he stays at home  he will be a cakravartin king if he goes forth from home  he will be a Buddha The experts said The crown prince really does have the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man if he stays at home he will be a cakravartin king if he leaves home he will be a Buddha The king asked What are the thirtytwo marks The experts replied Supratiṣṭhapādataḥ The soles of his feet are well set down The soles of his feet are set down on the ground without a gap not even a needle could be inserted On the soles of his feet are two wheels with a thousand spokes a hub and a rim and having three perfections He has obtained this mark spontaneously  it was not made by an artisan The divine artists like Viśvakarman are not able to make such a perfect mark Question Why could they not make it Answer Because these divine artisans such as Viśvakarman do not achieve the depth of wisdom  This mark of the wheel is the reward for good actions  Although the divine artisans have obtained their knowledge as a reward of their life this mark of the wheel comes from the practice of the roots of good and wisdom  The knowledge of a Viśvakarman is  keśalomāvasthā   indriyāvasthā   Kośa III p  Bukkho daijiten p the result of one single existence but this mark of the wheel comes from a wisdom extending over innumerable kalpas This is why Viśvakarman could not make it and still less the other divine artisans He has long fingers His fingers are slender and straight their arrangement is harmonious and the joints are accentuated  He has a broad heel  The digits of his hands and feet are webbed He is like the king of the swans  when he spreads his fingers the webs show when he does not spread his fingers the webs do not show  His hands and feet are soft and delicate Like fine cotton cloth sūkṣmaṃ karpāsakambalam these members surpass the other parts of his body He has a prominent instep When he treads on the ground his foot neither widens nor retracts The soles of his feet are like a red lotus in color between the toes there is a membrane the ends of his feet are the color of real coral  the toenails have the color of polished red copper  the upper side of his feet are golden in color and the hairs covering it are the azure of lapislazuli  These colors are marvelous one would say an assortment of jewels a varicolored necklace Aiṇeyajaṅgaḥ He has the limbs of an antelope His legs taper gradually as in Aiṇeya the king of the antelopes  Standing upright without bending over his arms reach down to his knees Without bending or straightening up again he can touch his kness with the palms  The secret part of his abdomen is concealed within a sheath as in an elephant of good birth or a highbred horse  Question Then why did his disciples see his secret parts when the Bodhisattva attained supreme complete enlightenment  Answer He showed them his sexual organs to save beings and dissipate the doubts of the crowd Besides according to some the Buddha manifested an elephant or a wellbred horse and said to his disciples My sexual organs are like that  Like the nyagrodha tree the Buddhas body is rounded and is of the same size on all four sides rdhvāgraromaḥ His hair rises up On his body his hair curls upwards tasya kāye keśaromāṇi ātāny ūrdhvam ākuñcitāni Ekaikaromaḥ From each of his pores there arises a single hair tasyaikaromakūpebhya ekaikāni romāṇi jātāni his hairs are not disarranged  they are blueblack  of the color of lapislazuli  curved to the right and standing up  What is this golden color Answer Placed beside gold  iron has no brilliance The gold of today compared to the gold of the time of a Buddha has no brilliance The gold of the river Jambū compared with the golden sand of the great ocean  on the path of a cakravartin king has no brilliance The golden sand compared with the golden mountain has no brilliance The golden mountain compared with Sumeru has no brilliance The gold of Mount Sumeru compared with the gold of the Trāyastrimśa gods necklaces has no brilliance Such is this mark of the golden color Vyāmaprabhaḥ He has an aura the breadth of an armspan He has an aura the breath of an armspan on all four sides In the center of this aura the Buddha has supreme beauty his splendor is equal to that of the king of the gods   Sūkṣmacchaviḥ He has fine skin Dust does not adhere to his body  he is like the lotus leaf that holds neither dust nor water When the Bodhisattva climbs a mountain of dry earth the earth does not stick to his feet When the wind blows up a storm to destroy the mountain which becomes dispersed as dust not a single dust grain sticks to the Buddhas body Saptotsadaḥ The seven parts of his body are welldeveloped Seven parts of the body the two hands  the two feet  the two shoulders and the nape of his neck are rounded of fine color and surpass all other bodies The bottom of his armpits are welldeveloped They are without bumps or hollows Siṃhapūrvārdhakāyaḥ The front part of his body is like that of a lion  His body is broad and straight Of all men his body is the broadest and the straightest His shoulders are completely rounded He has no peer amongst those who straighten their shoulders Catvāriṃśaddantaḥ He has forty teeth neither more nor less Other men have thirtytwo teeth their body consists of more than three hundred bones and the bones of their skull are nine in number The Bodhisattva has forty teeth and his skull is a single bone In him the teeth are numerous but the bones of the skull are few among other men the teeth are few but the skull bones are numerous This is how the Bodhisattva differs from other men His teeth are closely spaced No coarse or fine material can get in between his teeth People who do not know the secret mark of his teeth say that he has but one single tooth One could not introduce a single hair between them ukladantaḥ His teeth are white they surpass the brightness of king Himavat He has the jaw of a lion Like a lion king of the beasts his jaw is straight and broad  Rasarasāgraprāptaḥ He has the best of all tastes Some say When the Buddha puts food into his mouth  all foods take on an exquisite flavor  Because in all these foods there is the essence of exquisite flavor People who do not possess this mark cannot give off this essence and as a consequence do not have this exquisite taste Others say When the Buddha takes food and puts it in his mouth the ends of his throat secrete ambrosia which concentrates all flavors  As this food is pure we say that he possesses the best of all tastes  Prabhūtajihvaḥ He has a broad tongue When the Buddha sticks his great tongue out of his mouth it covers all the parts of his face up to the top of his hair sarvaṃ mukhamaṇḍalam avacchādayati keśaparyantam But when he puts it back in his mouth is not filled up Brahmasvaraḥ He has the voice of Brahmā Five kinds of sounds come from the mouth of Brahmā king of the gods i deep as thunder ii pure and clear able to heard from afar and delighting the listeners iii penetrating and inspiring respect iv truthful and easy to understand v never tiring the listeners These are also the five intonations from the mouth of the Bodhisattva He has the voice of a sparrow  his voice is pleasant like the song of the kalaviṅka bird He has the voice of a drum  his voice is deep and powerful like that of a great drum Abhinīlanetraḥ His eyes are deep blue like a beautiful blue lotus  Gopakṣmanetraḥ His eyelashes are like those of an ox Like the king of the oxen his eyelashes are long  beautiful and wellarranged  His head is crowned with a protuberance The Bodhisattva has a bony chignon like a fist on his head  He has a tuft of white hairs A tuft of white hair grows between his eyebrows ūrṇā cāsya bhruvor madhye jātā neither too high nor too low It is white  whorled to the right  growing easily and at the height of five feet The experts in marks added In earth and heaven the youg prince possesses the thirtytwo marks of the Great Man which all Bodhisattvas possess Question The cakravartin king also possesses these thirtytwo marks In what way are those of the Bodhisattva different Answer The marks of the Bodhisattva prevail over those of the cakravartin king in seven ways The marks of a cakravartin king do not have these qualities Question Why are they called marks  Answer Thus water which is different from fire is recognized by its marks Why does the Bodhisattva have thirtytwo marks neither more nor less Some say The Buddha whose body is adorned with the thirtytwo marks is beautiful and wellarranged  Thanks to the thirtytwo marks he is beautiful and wellarranged Their number cannot be increased or decreased The bodily marks are like the other attributes of the Buddha which cannot be increased or decreased Question Why does the Bodhisattva adorn his body with marks Answer Some people have attained purity of faith by seeing the bodily marks of the Buddha This is why he adorns his body with marks Finally some say that supreme perfect enlightenment resides in the body of the Buddhas but that if the corporeal marks did not adorn their body anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi would not reside in them Thus when a man wishes to marry a noble maiden the latter sends a messenger to him to say If you wish to marry me you must first decorate your house remove the filth and the bad smells You must place in it beds covers linen curtains drapes wallcoverings and perfumes so as to decorate it Only after that will I enter your house In the same way anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi sends wisdom to the Bodhisattva to say to him Only after that will I reside in you If they do not adorn your body I will not reside in you This is why the Bodhisattva cultivates the thirtytwo marks and adorns his body with them to attain anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi Enlightenment and Buddhahood Then the Bodhisattva gew up gradually and having seen an old man a sick man he experienced disgust for worldly things At midnight he left his home and practiced asceticism for six years Then he ate some sweetened milkbroth of sixteen restorative qualities offered to him by the brāhmanī Nanto and under the tree of enlightenment  he defied Māras army of  koṭis of warriors and attained supreme perfect enlightenment  Question What qualities must he have to attain in order to be called Buddha Answer He is called Buddha when he has acquired the knowledge of cessation and the knowledge of nonarising   According to others he is called Buddha when he has acquired the ten strengths  the four fearlessnesses  the eighteen special attributes  the three knowledges  the penetrations  the three smṛtyupasthānas or equanimities i When one listens to the Dharma and one respects it the Buddha feels no joy When one does not listen to the Dharma and one scorns it the Buddha feels no sadness When one both respects and scorns the Dharma the Buddha feels no emotion great lovingkindness and great compassion  the thirtyseven auxiliaries to enlightenment profound Prajñāpāramitā to realize the true nature  the summit of all dharmas and attain anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi Why is he called Bodhisattva as long as he has not attained Buddhahood and loses this name when he has acquired Buddhahood Answer  As long as he has not attained Buddhahood his mind remains subject to desire and attachment  he seeks to secure anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi this is why he is called Bodhisattva But when he has attained Buddhahood and acquired the various great qualities of the Buddhas he changes his name and is then called Budda Thus a prince is called prince as long as he is not king  but when he becomes king he is no longer called prince Since he is king he is no longer called prince even though he is the son of a king In the same way as long as the Bodhisattva has not attained Buddhahood he is called Bodhisattva but when he has attained Buddhahood he is called Buddha In the rāvaka system the disciples of Mahākātyāyanīputra define the Bodhisattva in the way that we have just described The practitioners of the Mahāyāna say The disciples of Kātyāyanīputra are beings in saṃsāra they do not recite and do not study the Mahāyānasūtras they are not great bodhisattvas they do not recognize the true nature of dharmas By means of their keen faculties and their wisdom  they have theories about the Buddhadharma they define the fetters  cognition  samādhi the faculties  etc If they commit errors in these various subjects what would happen if they were to give us a theory regarding the Bodhisattva If a weak man who wants to jump across a little brook does not succeed in crossing over what would he do if he comes to a great river except to sink and drown and be lost Question How is he lost The disciples of Mahākātyāniputra have said that one is called bodhisattva after three asamkhyeyas But already in the course of these three asamkhyeyas the bodhisattva has experienced no regret in giving his head  his eyes  his marrow and his brain such a sacrifice could not be attained by the arhats or the pratyekabuddhas Thus at one time the Bodhisattva the great chief of a caravan was voyaging on the ocean Take hold of my head  my hair  my hands and my feet and I will take you across When the merchants took hold of him he killed himself with his knife  As a general rule the ocean does not retain corpses  a brisk wind began to blow and brought them to the shore Who would dare to deny that this was an act of great compassion  When he had finished the second asamkhyeya and not yet entered into the third the Bodhisattva received from the Buddha Dīpaṃkara the prophecy that he would be Buddha Then he rose up into the sky  saw the Buddhas of the ten directions and standing up in space he praised the Buddha Dipaṃkara The Buddha Dīpaṃkara had said to him In one asamkhyeya you will be Buddha with the name ākyamuni Since he did indeed receive this prophecy  could one say without committing a grave error that he was not already Bodhisattva The disciples of Kātyāyanīputra have said that during the three asamkhyeyas the Bodhisattva did not possess the marks of the Buddha and did not yet accomplish the actions producing the thirtytwo marks   how would they know that he is Bodhisattva Everything must first manifest its characteristic marks it is only later that one can recognize its reality If it has no marks one does not cognize it Receiving the prophecy that one will be Buddha rising up into the sky seeing the Buddhas of the ten directions these are not the great marks What was predicted by the Buddha is that one will act as a Buddha The fact of acting as Buddha is the great mark You ignore this mark and you adopt the thirtytwo marks  But the cakravartin kings also possess these thirtytwo marks devas and also mahārājas produce them by transformation  Nan to  Ti po la  etc possessed thirty Po po li  had three the wife of Mo ho kia ch had the mark of the golden color  Even people of our generation have one or two of these marks such as deep black eyes  long arms  the upper part of the body like a lion  etc These various marks are encountered more or less frequently So why do you attach so much importance to them In what sūtra is it said that the Bodhisattva does not accomplish the actions producing the marks during the three asaṃkhyeyakalpas Nan to had given a bath to the Buddha Pi po che and wished to obtain pure beauty  On the stūpa of a pratyekabuddha he had painted a wall blue and while drawing the image of the pratyekabuddha he made the vow  I wish to obtain the mark of the golden color always Finally he built the steps on the stūpa of the Buddha Kāśyapa favorable complex of conditions and time they bear fruit for their creator na praṇaśyanti karmāṇi kalpakoṭiśatair api sāmagrīṃ prāpya kālaṃ ca phalanti khalu dehinām a With this stock of merit  he was reborn at Kapilavastu into the ākya clan as younger brother to the Buddha He possessed thirty marks of the Great Man and pure beauty He went forth from home and became arhat The Buddha has said that of his five hundred disciples the bhikṣu Nanda was foremost in beauty These marks are thus easy to obtain  Then why do you say that the Bodhisattva must plant them during ninetyone kalpas while others obtain them in one single lifetime  That is a serious error In the course of the first asaṃkhyeyakalpa the Bodhisattva does not know whether or not he will become Buddha In the course of the second asaṃkhyeyakalpa he does indeed know that he will be Buddha but does not dare to announce it At the end of the third asaṃkhyeyakalpa he does indeed know that he will be Buddha and he announces it to men Where did the Buddha say that In what sūtra did he teach that Is it in the Three Baskets of the Listeners  or is it in the sūtras of the Greater Vehicle  The disciples of Kātyāyanīputra Although the Buddha did not say it in the Tripiṭaka it is reasonable and plausible Moreover it is what the A pi tan pi po cha teaches in the chapter on the Bodhisattva  Thus when the bodhisattva A tch lo  in the presence of the Buddha Tchang cheou  first produced the mind  he attained the diamond seat and immediately acquired buddhahood errors and impure thoughts do not arise in him the first received the prophecy without having produced the thought of bodhi the second received the prophecy at the moment when he was about to produce the thought of bodhi before the third one recieved it the others all knew that he would be Buddha but he himself did not know it before the fourth one received it the others and he himself knew it Then why do you say that in the course of the second asaṃkhyeyakalpa the Bodhisattva knows the prophecy but does not dare to proclaim  Besides the Buddha has said that for innumerable kalpas the Bodhisattva realizes the qualities in order to save beings In these conditions why do you speak of three asaṃkhyeyakalpas which are finite and limited Although it is a matter in the Mahāyānasūtras we do not believe in them entirely That is a grave error for are the true Buddhadharma coming from the very mouth of the Buddha Moreover you derive your orgin from the Mahāyāna how can you say that you do not entirely believe it The Bodhisattva accomplishes the actions producing the thirtytwo marks in the desire realm and not in the realm of form or in the formless realm   in the ārūpyadhātu there is neither body nor form and as these thirtytwo marks are bodily adornments it is not possible to accomplish the actions that produce them in the ārūpyadhātu In the rūpadhātu there are the great Brahmārājas who usually invite the Buddhas to turn the wheel of the Dharma  Wise and pure they are capable of seeking Buddhahood Why do they not accomplish the actions producing the thritytwo marks You also say Thus So kie tou long wang  the daughter of Sāgara king of the nāgas is a bodhisattva of the tenth level  the nāga king A na po ta to is a seventhlevel bodhisattva  and the king of the asuras Lo heou is also a great bodhisattva Why do you say that the Bodhisattva cannot accomplish the actions producing the thirtytwo marks in destinies other  You also say But why could they not accomplish them in the other two continents Kiu to ni and Fou po tI where merit  wisdom and duration of life are much greater than in Jambudvīpa You also say A volition is necessary to accomplish each mark But in the time of a finger snap the mind arises and ceases sixteen times in one thought there is neither duration nor parts  how could it accomplish a mark of the Great Man  a mark of the Great Man cannot do without a mind for its accomplishment Therefore coming together of many volitions can accomplish one single mark In the same way in order to carry a heavy load one single man is not enough the united strength of several men is necessary Similarly in order to accomplish a mark a great mind is necessary and to this effect the joining of many volitions is indispensible Therefore it is called the mark of one hundred merits  If other things cannot be accomplished by a single volition what can be said of the mark of one hundred merits Why do you say that the mind of the Bodhisattva ākyamuni was impure whereas that of his disciples was pure that the mind of Bodhisattva Maitreya was impure whereas that of his disciples was pure Where was that said We cannot find anything like that in the Tripiṭaka or in the Mahāyāna This statement is your imagination You believe that only the Bodhisattva ākyamuni saw the Buddha Puṣya in his cave of precious stones and praised him with one single stanza for seven days and seven nights But the Bodhisattva Maitreya also praised the Buddha Puṣya in every way Then you add that the mind of Maitreyas disciples was pure that is a complete contradiction  the Bodhisattva gives everything without feeling regret like king ibi who to save the pigeon gave his flesh to the falcon without feeling any regret To give wealth is a lesser gift  to give ones body is a middling gift  to give anything whatsoever provided that the mind is detached is the highest gift   why do you praise the middling gift as if it were the complete perfection of the virtue of generosity  Although its intention may be lofty and full of loving kindness and compassion  this is like a man who would sacrifice his body for his parents his family or his teacher Since he knows that he is sacrificing his life for a pigeon his generosity is middling Although he sacrifices himself for all beings his mind is impure  for he does not know that he himself is nonexistent  he does not know that the one who receives his gift is not a person is not his teacher he does not know that the thing given by him is in reality neither the same as or different from him Since his mind is attached to the three concepts  it is impure  It is in this world that he will receive the reward of his merit  he will not be able to go directly to Buddhahood Thus it is said in the Prajñāpāramitā that the three things donor recipient and the thing given are nonexistent  and that he should not be attached to them  to divide the great earth the cities towns and villages and to make seven parts of it is the perfection of the virtue of wisdom  To divide the earth is only ordinary mathematics  it is a modest part of conventional wisdom  like one or two drops of water in the ocean The true prajñāpāramitā is called the mother of the Buddhas of the three times  it reveals the true nature of all dharmas  This prajñāpāramitā has no point of coming or point of going it is like a magic show  an echo  the moon reflected in water which one sees and which immediately disappears Out of compassion and although this wisdom has but a single nature  the āryas define it using all kinds of conventional expressions as being the precious treasure of the wisdom of the Buddhas  You add that that the Buddha appears in the world when the human lifespan is         years But if the Buddhas always have compassion for beings why do they appear only at these eight times and not at others Just as a good medicine once swallowed cures the sickness  so the Buddhadarma does not depend on time Although the Bodhisattva has compassion for beings and although the Buddhas do not depend on time when the lifespan surpasses  years longlived people revel in pleasures  their fetters lust desire etc On the other hand when the lifespan is less than  years people have a short life and are overcome with suffering  their fetters hatred etc are thick  This period of pleasure when the lifespan is more than  years and this period of suffering are not times favorable to finding the Path  This is why tha Buddhas do not appear  This is why even when the human lifespan is greater than  years the Buddhas must appear in the world At this time people are not sick and their minds are joyful consequently their faculties are keen and they are virtuous As a result of their virtues and their keen faculties they can easily find the Path Furthermore under the Buddha Che tseu kou yin wang  the human lifespan is  years under the Buddha Ming wang  it is  asaṃkhyeyakalpas under the Buddha A mi to  it lasts innumerable asaṃkhyeyakalpas How can you say that the Buddhas do not appear when the human lifespan is longer than  years These teachings are in the Mahāyānasūtras but in our system it is not a question of the Buddhas of the ten directions but only of the one hundred Buddhas of the past  ākyamuni Kiu tchen jo  etc and the five hundred Buddhas of the future  Maitreya etc  In the Mahāyānasūtras we speak of the Buddhas of the three times and the ten directions for various reasons In the universes of the ten directions all the torments rage old age  sickness and death  lust  hatred and delusion  etc this is why the Buddhas must appear in these regions It is said in a sūtra If old age sickness death and the afflictions did not exist the Buddhas would not appear Furthermore wherever there are many illnesses  there should be many physicians  In one of your rāvaka texts the Tchang a han  king Pi cha men addresses the following stanza to the Buddha I bow before the Buddhas past future and present I take refuge in the Buddha ākyamuni In this sūtra of yours it is said that the king bows down before the Buddhas of the past  the future and the present and that he takes refuge in Buddha ākyamuni Thus we know that in the present there Buddhas other  If the other Buddhas did not exist why would the king first bow down to the Buddhas of the three times then afterwards take refuge specially in ākyamuni This king had not yet renounced all desire  but he was at the side of ākyamuni and as a result of the affection and respect he had for him he took refuge in him As for the other Buddhas he bowed down before them Place of appearance of the Buddhas  The Buddha said Two Buddhas do not appear simultaneously in the same world  just as two cakravartin kings do not appear simultaneously in the same world Therefore it is wrong that presently there are other Buddhas  namastu te mahāvīra The Buddha means that two Buddhas do not appear simultaneously in the same trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu  he does not say that in the universes of the ten directions there are not actually Buddhas Thus two cakravartin kings do not appear simultaneously in the same caturdvīpika  for these very powerful beings have no rival in their domain In the same way two Buddhas do not appear simultaneously in one single trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu If you believe that there are cakravartins in the other cāturdvīpakas why do you not believe that there are Buddhas in the other trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātus  Furthermore one single Buddha cannot save all beings If one single Buddha could save all beings there would be no need for other Buddhas and only one single Buddha would appear But the qualities of the Buddhas  who save beings to be converted  perish as soon as they arise like the flame that is extinguished when the candle is used up indeed conditioned dharmas are transitory and empty of self nature  Thus in the present there must be yet other Buddhas  Finally beings are numberless and suffering is immense This is why there must be magnanimous bodhisattvas and numberless Buddhas who appear in the world to save beings It is said in the sūtra that the Buddha appears from age to age after a number of years as immense as the flower of the Ngeou tan po lo tree which appears once at regular times If the ten directions were full of Buddhas the Buddha would appear easily he could easily be found and we would not say that it is difficult to meet him It is in one single mahāsāhasralokadhātu that the Buddha usually appears after an immense number of years It is not a question of the ten directions Because sinners do not know how to honor him and do not seek the Path  we say that the Buddha appears from age to age after an immense number of years Moreover as punishment for their sins  these beings fall into the evil destinies where for innumerable kalpas they do not even hear the name of Buddha pronounced and still less see one Due to these people the appearance of the Buddha is said to be rare If there really are numerous Buddhas and bodhisattvas in the ten directions why do they not come to save all beings from sin and suffering  faults and very serious taints for innumerable asaṃkhyeyakalpas Although they have accrued all sorts of other merits  they do not possess the qualities required to see a Buddha Some stanzas say When the reward for merits is far off When sins are not erased For that time one cannot see The Bhadanta the man endowed with power Among the ārya bhadanta Their intentions are unchangeable Out of loving kindness and compassion for all men They want to save them at all times But it is necessary that the merits of beings be ripe That their wisdom and their faculties be keen That they thus fulfill the conditions of salvation In order they may then attain deliverance In the same way that the great nāga king Makes the rain fall in accordance with wishes So it is in accordance with his former actions sins or merits That each man is recompensed  the Buddha is able to save men full of merits and endowed with wisdom but does not save men deprived of merits and wisdom If that is so men full of merits and endowed with wisdom do not derive their salvation from the Buddha These merits and this wisdom do indeed derive their origin from the Buddha If the Buddha did not appear in the world the bodhisattvas would teach as Path the ten good causes  the four limitless ones  and the various causes and conditions that assure the retribution of sins and merits in the course of rebirths  If there were no Bodhisattva this is the admonition found in all kinds of sūtras The person who practices this doctrine carries out meritorious actions Furthermore whatever the merits and the wisdom of men if the Buddha did not appear in the world men would receive their reward in this world but they would not be able to find the Path   if the Buddha appears in this world men find the Path and this is a great benefit Thus although a person has eyes he sees nothing if the sun does not rise light is necessary so that he can see something I have eyes of what use are they to me The Buddha has said Two causes two conditions give rise to right vision  hearing the Dharma from anothers mouth  reflecting properly oneself Thanks to these merits a man can be assured of a wholesome mind  sharp faculties and wisdom and thus reflect correctly This is why we know that men derive their salvation from the Buddha The person who is able to accomplish a great work without regressing or turning back in his bravery is called mahāsattva Moreover he is called mahattva because he is the chief of many beings Furthermore he is called mahāattva because he feels great loving kindness amd great compassion for many beings he establishes them in the Greater Vehicle he travels the great Path and attains a very high place Furthermore he is called mahāsattva because he is endowed with the marks of the Great Man  The characteristics of the mahāsattva are described in the Tsan fo kie  Only the Buddha is the unique man the foremost Father and mother of the threefold world the omniscient one Among all beings he has no peer Homage to the Bhagavat who is unequaled Common people practice loving kindness in their own personal interest The Buddha in his great loving kindness has no such goal He is as beneficent towards his enemies as towards his friends Furthermore he is called mahāsattva because he must preach the Dharma and destroy the great wrong views and the afflictions  such as great craving  pride  great attachment to the self  etc in all others as well as in himself Finally like the great ocean  beings are without beginning and without end  A skillful teacher of arithmetic who would keep track for numberless years would not reach the end of them This is what the Buddha said to the bodhisattva Wou tsin yi  If all the universes of the ten directions to the ends of space formed a single body of water and innumerable and incalculable beings came each with a hair and took away one drop of it there would still remain an incalculable number of beings If by thus removing a drop on the end of a hair they succeeded in completely emptying this great body of water the number of beings would still not be exhausted This is why the number of beings is limitless  immense  incalculable and inconceivable  The wishes to save them all free them all from suffering and establish them all in the happiness of unconditioned safety  He is called mahasattva because he has made this great resolution to save these numerous beings called anabhilāpyaanabhilāpya and equal to  followed by  zeros They do not produce the thought of bodhi just to save a number of beings equal to that of the atoms contained in one country or in two or three up to ten or one hundred a thousand ten thousand one koṭi one ayuta one nayuta up to anabhilāpyānabhilāpya countries They do not produce the thought of bodhi just to save a number of beings equal to that of the atoms contained in Jambudvīpa or in Godānīya Uttarakuru and Pūrvavbideha They do not produce the thought of bodhi just to save the number of beings equal to that of the atoms contained in one sāhasracūḍikalokadhātu  or in one dvisāhasramadhyamalokadhātu  or in one trisāhasramahāsāharsralokadhmatu  or in two three up to ten a hundred a thousand ten thousand one koṭi one ayuta one nayuta and up to anabhilāpyānabhilāpya trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātus They do not produce the thought of bodhi to adorn one single buddhafield  or even a number of buddhakṣetra equal to that of the atoms contained in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of tris They do not produce the thought of bodhi to know in detail one single Buddha assembly  or even a number of buddhaparṣanmaṇḍala equal to that of the atoms contained in an anabhilāpyānabjilāpya number of tris They do not produce the thought of bodhi to remember one single preaching of the Buddha  or even a number of tathāgatadharmacakra s equal to that of the atoms contained in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya number of tris But here are the aspirations of the bodhisattvamahāsattvas By means of this wisdom and knowledge the bodhisattvas adorn all the buddha fields śā said  O son of noble family  thus would I like to have a universe where all beings are completely pure and where all the afflictions are cut through  Sudhana asked What is deliverance  ṣā answered I know this single gate of deliverance  but I am unable to understand these bodhisattvas their great mind is like the ocean for they are in possession of all the buddhadharmas ete bodhisattvāḥ sāgarasamacittāḥ sarvabuddhadharmasaṃpratīcchanatayā their mind is unshakeable like Mount Sumeru  they are like the king of physicians for they are able to cure all the sicknesses of the afflictions  they are like the sun for they are able to scatter all the shadows  they are like the earth for they are able to support all beings dhāraṇīsamāḥ sarvasattvāśrayapratiṣṭhānabhūtatayā they are like the wind for they can strengthen all beings  they are like fire for they can burn away the afflictions of all the heretics  they are like cloud for they can make the rain of Dharma fall they are like the moon for the rays of their merits light up everything  they are like akradevendra for they protect all beings  The practices of the bodhisattvas are very profound  how could I be know them all The bodhisattvas are called mahāsattva because they make the great vow  because they want to do the great work and because they want to arrive at the great place Finally in the Mahāprajñāpāramitasūtra Mo ho sa to siang  Text of the sūtra commented on in this chapter  Bodhisattvaiḥ sārdhaṃ sarvair dhāraṇīpratilabdhaiḥ samādhipratilabdhaiḥ śūnyatānimittāpraṇihitagocaraiḥ samatākṣāntipratilabdhair asaṅgadhāraṇīpratilabdhair pañcābhijñair Question We understand the reason for the order followed here but what is it that is called a dhāraṇī What is a dhāraṇī Answer In the Tsin language dhāraṇī means capable of holding or capable of preventing  Capable of holding Joining all sorts of good dharmas  dharāṇī holds them so that they are not dispersed or lost It is like a good vessel filled with water from which the water does not leak out Detesting the roots of evil  dhāraṇī prevents them from arising It prevents the committing of evil by those who would want to commit it That is what is called dhāraṇi This dhāraṇī is associated with mind or dissociated from mind  impure or pure  nonmaterial  invisible  not offering resistance  it is contained in one element  one basis of consciousness and one aggregate  namely dharmadhatu dharmāyatana and saṃskāraskandha Nine knowledges cognize it Note it is outside the knowledge of destruction of the afflictions  One single consciousness is aware of it Note the mental consciousness  According to the Abhidharma this is the definition of dhāraṇī Furthermore the bodhisattva who possesses dhāraṇī is able to retain and not forget all the teachings that he has heard by the power of his memory Furthermore dhāraṇī accompanies the bodhisattva always Like a chronic fever it never leaves him like a ghost it always follows him Furthermore dhāraṇī prevents the bodhisattva from falling into the two chasms of the earth It is like the kind father who rescues his son as he is about to fall into a ditch Finally when the bodhisattva has the power of the dhāraṇīs neither king Māra his family nor his warriors can unsettle him destroy or conquer him He is like Mount Sumeru which the worldly wind cannot shake Question How many types of dhāraṇī are there Answer There are many types thorny he puts on his shoes if it is very cold he makes a fire when it is hot he looks for water He looks for a remedy for all these troubles without getting irritated about them acts in the same way with regard to insults and nastiness It is only by lovingkindness and compassion that he puts an end to them he never experiences anger In all  there are five hundred dhāraṇīs If they were all described in detail it would be endless That is why it is said that the bodhisattvas have acquired the dhāraṇīs  The three concentrations are those of emptiness  wishlessness and signlessness  Or to nonexistence This is aparaṇihitasamādhi What is ānimittasamādhi All dharmas are free of marks  Not accepting them not adhering to them is ānimittasamādhi A stanza says When words are stopped The functioning of the mind also ceases This is nonarising  noncessation The similarity with nirvāṇa Furthermore in the Prajñāpāramitā in the Mo ho yen yi chapter  the  samādhis are enumerated as a whole samāsataḥ the first is the Hiu kong pou tche pou jan san mei and the last is the Hiu kong pou tche pou jan san mei  If they were to be enumerated in detail there are innumerable samādhis This is why the sūtra says that the bodhisattvas have acquired the concentrations and course in emptiness wishlessness and signlessness  Question The sūtra says first of all that the bodhisattvas have obtained the concentrations  why does it then say that they course in emptiness wishlessness and signlessness  Answer First the sūtra speaks about samādhi but says nothing about its characteristics Now it wants to speak about its characteristics and it enumerates emptiness wishlessness and signlessness When someone courses in emptiness wishlessness and signlessness it can be said that they have acquired the true samādhis  Some stanzas say He who observes the purity of the precepts Is called a true bhikṣu He who contemplates emptiness Has truly obtained the samādhis He who demonstrates zeal Is called a true devotee He who has attained nirvāṇa Is called truly blessed Question What are the equalities and what are the patiences Answer There are two kinds of equalities  equality toward beings and equality toward dharmas  There are also two types of patiences  patience towards beings and patience towards dharmas  Furthermore in regard to beings is not attached to a nature of any kind of nature beings are empty of characteristics  from this point of view they are identical  equal  without difference  Seeing this is sattvasamatā The person who maintains an unfettered equality of mind toward them enters directly into the absence of regression  he is called samatākṣāntipratilabdha The bodhisattva who has acquired the equalities and the patiences experiences no hatred or anger toward beings He loves them like a loving mother loves her son A stanza says To consider sounds as echoes And bodily actions as reflections  The person who sees things thus How could he not be patient This is what is called sattvasamatākṣānti āstra Question The sūtra has already said that the bodhisattvas have obtained the dhāraṇīs  why does it repeat here that they have obtained the dhāraṇī without obstacles  Answer   Because the asaṅgadhāraṇī is very important Just as the samādhi called King of Samādhi is the most important of all the samādhis in the way that a king is relative to his subjects just as the Deliverance without Obstacles Note this is the deliverance acquired when one reaches Buddhahood is the most important of all the vimokṣas so the asaṅgadhāraṇī is superior to all the dhāraṇīs ddhyabhijñā is the result of the development of the four bases of miraculous power  Having a material object  ṛddhipāda and abhijñā are produced successively and cannot be acquired simultaneously Abhijñā of the divyacakṣus or divine eye A pure form derived from the four great elements that occurs in the eye is called divyacakṣus It is able to see beings and substances that occur in the six destinies of its own level and of lower levels The divine eye is never incapable of distinguishing between a nearby and a distant form  between a coarse and a subtle form There are two kinds of divyacakṣus the one that comes from retribution and the one that comes from practice  In so far as it makes up part of the five abhijñās the divyacakusus comes from practice and not from retribution Because it is acquired by continual attentiveness to all types of lights  Furthermore some say that the bodhisattvas who have acquired acquiescence in the doctrine of nonarising are not limited to the six destinies  It is solely in order to convert beings by virtue of their dharmakāya that they appear in the ten directions  In the bodhisattvas of the threefold world who have not yet attained the dharmakāya the divyacakusus results sometimes from practice and sometimes from retribution The qualities of the bodhisattvas surpass those of the arhats and the pratyekabuddhas Why praise their divine eye of lesser quality which is shared with ordinary people and not praise their eye of wisdom  their Dharma eye or their Buddha eye  AnswerThere are three kinds of gods  i the metaphorical gods  ii the gods by birth  iii the pure gods  The great bodhisattvas and the Buddhas know an unlimited number of kalpas Such is the pūrvanivāsānusmṛtyabhijñā What is the abhijñā of paracittajñāna or knowledge of others minds It is knowing if anothers mind is stained or stainless  The practitioner first considers in its arising  its duration and its destruction  By ceaselessly reflecting on it he succeeds in discerning in others the signs of joy  of hatred and of fear  Having seen these signs then he knows the mind This is the first gate of the knowledge of others minds We have finished the explanation of the five abhijñās Their words are worthy of faith  āstra The devas manuṣyas nāgas asuras and all great men accord faith to their speech and this is the reward for their language that is free of frivolity  The punishment for those of frivolous speech is that nobody believes them even if they speak the truth Some stanzas say They fall among the pretas Flames shoot out of their mouth On all sides they utter loud cries This is the punishment for their sins of speech They have heard much and seen much  They preach the Dharma in the great assemblies But as a result of their lack of good faith Nobody believes them The person who desires vast renown And wishes to believed by people Should therefore show straightforwardness And avoid frivolous discourse  āstra In householders  laziness ruins wealth and merits  among monastics  it ruins celestial happiness and the bliss of nirvāṇa  in both ones good name is lost Even great culprits and great thieves avoid laziness A stanza says Laziness ruins good minds The shadows of ignorance replace the light of wisdom All good resolutions disappear Apagatalābhayaśaścittaiḥ they have renounced greed and ambition  āstra Greed is like a thief it destroys the root of the qualities  Just as a heavy frost destroys the five grains so greed and ambition destroy the young shoots of the qualities and prevent them from prospering The Buddha made the following comparison  Just as a horsehair rope binds a man tears his skin and breaks his bones  so the greedy man destroys the root of the qualities Some stanzas say Those who enter into a forest of sandalwood Gather up only leaves  Or who go into the sevenjewel mountain Collect only crystals   some men having entered into the Buddhas Dharma Do not seek the bliss of nirvāṇa But turn back to the pursuit of wealth and honors They are cheating themselves This is why the disciple of the Buddha Who wants to taste the taste of ambrosia  Must abandon this blend of poison And zealously seek the bliss of nirvāṇa Just as a heavy frost Destroys the five cereals So the man attached to wealth and pleasures Destroys respect and discipline  From now on in this life he burns up the roots of good In the next life he falls into hell They preached the Dharma disinterestedly  āstra It is out of lovingkindness and compassion that they preach the Dharma to beings without greed for robes  food  fame or power  If they preach the Dharma it is with great lovingkindness and great compassion because their minds are pure and because they have attained acquiescence in the doctrine of the nonarising of phenomena  Some stanzas say The learned preacher rational skillful in speech Who preaches the Dharma well and stimulates peoples spirits But who transgresses against the doctrine and commits wrongdoings Is like a cloud that thunders but cannot produce any rain The accomplished person learned and wise But reticent clumsy in speech and not eloquent Cannot reveal the precious treasure of the doctrine He is like a small shower without thunder The undisciplined person without wisdom Who preaches badly and lacks good behavior Is an evil teacher without shame He is like a little cloud with no thunder and no rain The learned person wise and eloquent Who preaches the Dharma skillfully and stimulates peoples spirits Who observes the doctrine fearlessly with an honest heart Is like a great cloud that thunders and rains abundantly The great leader of the doctrine guardian of the mirror of the doctrine Who illuminates the Buddhadharma treasury of wisdom Who guardian and propagator of the sayings who rings the bell of the doctrine Is like an oceangoing ship that assures to all the crossing of the sea Like the king of the bees gathering nectar He preaches according to the counsel and intentions of the Buddha He helps the Buddha illuminates his doctrine and saves beings Such a teacher of the doctrine is very difficult to find They have crossed over to the other shore of the patience relating to the profound dharmas  āstra What are the profound dharmas  Here the Fan wang king should be discussed fully Answer the vaiśāradya of the Buddha and the vaiśāradya of the bodhisattva These bodhisattvas do not possess the vaiśāradyas of the Buddha but they have acquired those of the bodhisattva Question What are the four vaiśāradyas of the bodhisattva Answer   He preaches the Dharma in the assembly with assurance because he remembers everything that he has heard because he has acquired the dhāraṇīs and because he always remembers without forgetting These your armies No person in the world Or any god Can destroy them By cultivating concentration and wisdom I will smash your army O Mara Like a clay pot  With a mind solely cultivating wisdom I will save the world My disciples full of energy Ever mindful will cultivate wisdom Following my example they will progress in accordance with the Dharma And will certainly reach nirvāṇa Even though you do not want to let them They will go where you cannot go Then king Māra on hearing this Angry and confused departed And the evil army of māras Also disappeared and vanished Such is the māra of the fetters  Question Where are the five aggregates  the eighteen elements and the twelve bases of consciousness named māra Answer On Mount Mo kiu lo  the Buddha taught to the disciple Lo to  The form aggregate is māra feeling  perception  formation and consciousness are also māra Wishing to create for oneself a material existence in the future is to seek an unstable sphere  wishing to create a nonmaterial existence is again seeking an unstable sphere wishing to create an aware nonaware neither aware nor nonaware existence is still seeking an unstable sphere This instability is a bond of Māra  stability is the elimination of bonds deliverance from evil At this place the Buddha said that the skandhas dhātus and āyatanas are māra It goes without saying that the vaśavartin devaputramāra the mārakāyikas and the mārajanas are māra  and Question Why is he called Māra Answer He is called Māra because he carries off the āyuṣmat and because he destroys the good root of the dharmas of the Path and of the qualities The heretics call him Yu tchou  Houa tsien or also Wou tsien  In the Buddhist texts he is called Māra because he destroys all good works His actions and works are called mārakarman What are the works of Māra Answer   They are defined in the chapter of the Kio mo  Answer Of these three obstacles action is the greatest Once accumulated  actions last for hundreds of koṭi of kalpas without being lost changed or deteriorating they produce their fruit of retribution without loss of time when these longlasting actions meet the favorable complex and time  they produce their fruit of retribution They are like rice grains that have fallen on the ground which at the proper time germinate without being lost or deteriorating That is of the omniscient buddhas worthy of respect by all If Sumeru king of the mountains cannot reverse his actions what can be said about an ordinary person  Some stanzas say The wheel of transmigration drags man along With his afflictions and his fetters  Very powerful it turns freely Nobody can stop it Actions carried out during previous lifetimes Change into all kinds of forms The power of action is very strong It has no equal in the world The wheel turns by the power of actions It turns in the sea of saṃsāra The waters of the ocean can dry up The earth of Sumeru can be exhausted But the actions of previous lifetimes Are never used up never exhausted Actions accumulated for a long time Follow their creator Like a creditor Relentlessly following his debtor Nobody can escape The fruit of the retribution of action There is no place to escape it One cannot escape it by asking for pardon Action relentlessly pursues The beings of the threefold world It is like the Ko li lo tcha This action was defined by the Buddha Wind does not penetrate into solids The waves do not turn back in their course Space suffers no harm Neither does nonaction Actions have tremendous power Which is never ineffectual When the time of retribution has come One cannot escape from it one cannot avoid it From the earth rise up to the sky From the sky one can penetrate the Himavat From the Himavat one can plunge into the ocean Nowhere will one escape from action Action forever follows us Never does it leave us It goes straight on it does not miss its time Like the tide which follows the moon They were skilled in teaching dependent origination  āstra They are capable of teaching the twelvemembered  in different ways  Affliction  action and basis arise one after the other according to a continuous development  this is called the twelvemembered pratītyasamutpāda Three of these are called affliction  ignorance  craving and grasping  two members are called action  formations and coming into existence  the other seven are called bases  In general  the three categories affliction  action and suffering are mutual and reciprocal causes and conditions   Kleśa is cause and condition for karman   karman is cause and condition for duḥkha   duḥkha is cause and condition for duḥkha because vijñāna precedes nāmarūpa nāmarūpa precedes ṣadāyatana ṣadāyatana precedes sparśa sparśa precedes vedanā jāti precedes jarāmaraṇa  duḥkha is cause and condition for kleśa  Since kleśa is cause and condition for karman karman cause and condition for duḥkha and duḥkha cause and condition for duḥkha it is a matter of mutual and reciprocal causes and conditions Avidyā ignorance is all the afflictions of past existence  From avidyā there arise actions which realize fruition in a universe  From saṃskāra there arises a defiled mind  initial cause of the existence Because it is aware in the way that a calf is aware of its mother it is called vijñāna consciousness This vijñāna produces both the four formless aggregates perception  feeling  volition  consciousness  and form which serves as base them This is name and form nāmarūpa From this nāmarūpa there arise the six sense organs eye etc The meeting of organ  object and a consciousness is called sparśa contact Within vedanā there arises an adherence of mind called craving or thirst tṛṣṇā The tendency caused by tṛṣṇā is called upādāna grasping attachment From this upādāna comes action which brings about the new existence which is called bhava the act of existence As a consequence of this bhava one reassumes the five aggregates of the new lifetime  This is called jāti birth The decay of the five skandhas coming from this jāti is called jarāmaraṇa oldageanddeath If the purity of the true nature of dharmas is considered onepointedly  ignorance vanishes When avidya has disappeared the formations also vanish and as a result until the entire mass of suffering vanishes The person who by means of these soteriological means and by not being attached to wrong views  is able to teach people is said to be skillful  Also said to be skillful is the person who examining these twelve causesandconditions rejects any system and refuses to adhere to it so as to understand only the true nature underlying the pratītyasamutpāda Thus in the Prajñāpāramitā in the chapter entitled Pou ko tsin  the Buddha says to Subhūti Avidyā is indestructible like space the saṃskāras are indestructible like space and similarly and the mass of suffering are indestructible like space The bodhisattva should know that The person who understands that cuts off the head of ignorance without falliong into it The person who sees the twelvemembered pratītyasamutpāda in that way will sit on the throne of bodhi and will become omniscient  Sūtra The meaning of the word asaṃkhyeya has already been explained above in the chapter on the Bodhisattva As for the word kalpa the Buddha defined it by the following comparisons Suppose there is a rocky mountain four thousand li to which a venerable monk comes once every hundred years  brushing against it with his silk robe  this great rock mountain would be worn out before a kalpa passes Suppose there is a great city of four thousand li full of mustard seeds  unsorted and not leveled out and that a venerable monk comes once every hundred years and takes away one seed the mustard seeds would have disappeared before a kalpa would have passed During innumerable kalpas of this kind the bodhisattva has formed the great vow to save all beings This is what is called the vow of the Great Mind In order to save all beings the fetters must be cut through and supreme perfect enlightenment must be realized This is what is called vow Because they have uprooted hatred  chased away envy  nd always practice great lovingkindness  great compassion and great joy  because they have avoided the four kinds of evil speech  they have acquired a pleasant face With such generous inclinations The state of Buddhahood is quite close The person who avoids the four sins of speech Lying  slander  Harmful speech and frivolous speech Gains a magnificent reward The kind gentle person who seeks the Path Wishes to save beings And avoids the four sins of speech Is like a harnessed horse In the great assembly they are endowed with the fearlessnesses mahāparṣanmadhye vaiśāradyasamanvāgataiḥ āstra As a result of their great merits their firm qualities and their wisdom they have acquired a supreme dhāraṇī of eloquence and in the midst of the great assembly they enjoy the fearlessnesses  Some stanzas say Inwardly his mind his wisdom and his merits are slender Outwardly he resorts to fine words He is like a bamboo without pith That shows only its exterior Inwardly his mind his wisdom and his merits are vast Outwardly he makes use of true words He is like a beautiful diamond The inner and outer power of which are complete Having nothing to fear this is why they are fearless in the midst of the great assembly Some stanzas say The person of little merit and without wisdom Is unable to occupy a high seat He is like a wolf in the face of a lion That crouches down and does not dare to come out The great sage is without fear He can occupy the lions seat He is like the lion whose roar Makes all the beasts tremble Having accumulated immense and infinite wisdom and merit they have nothing to fear Some stanzas say The person who has destroyed all his faults And succeeds in avoiding the minor sins A great virtuous person of this kind Has no vow that cannot be realized This person of great wisdom Is free of suffering in this world Because for such a person Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are identical Finally they have acquired only the fearlessnesses belonging to the bodhisattva Thus in the Pi na po na wang king it is said that the bodhisattvas acquire only the four fearlessnesses  This has been said above For innumerable koṭi of kalpas they have been skilled in preaching the Dharma and in surpassing  This was not for just one two three or four lifetimes but indeed for innumerable asaṃkhyeyakalpas that the bodhisattvas have accumulated qualities and wisdom  A stanza says They have produced the great thought for beings The person who disdains and scorns them Commits an unspeakably grave sin How much more guilty the person who wants to harm them Moreover for incalculable and immeasurable kalpas the bodhisattvas have cultivated their body practiced discipline  exercised their mind and their intelligence  understood themselves arising and cessation  the bonds and deliverance  intractability and adaptability  they understand the true nature of dharmas  they possess the three kinds of analysis  namely of text  of meaning and of acquisition  they understand the various sermons without difficulty  in order to preach the doctrine they use the virtue of skillful means and the virtue of wisdom  all the words of these bodhisattvas are the words of the āryas to whom it is appropriate to accord faith Some stanzas say The person who is intelligent but who lacks knowledge Does not know the true nature He is like an eye that can see nothing In complete darkness The learned person who has no wisdom Also does not know the true meaning He is like a lamp in full daylight Where the eye would be absent As for the learned person of keen wisdom His words merit trust The person who has neither wisdom nor knowledge Is just an ox in a human body The sūtra should say that the bodhisattvas for innumerable koṭi of kalpas are skilled in preaching the doctrine why does it also say in surpassing  Among teachers of mediocre knowledge they diminish themselves among the śaikṣa and the learned  they welcome objections with courage and joy Thus a stanza in the Tien houei king  says His face his eyes and his teeth gleam And light up the great assembly He outshines the brilliance of all the gods Who all disappear This is why it is said that for innumerable koṭi of kalpas the bodhisattvas have been skilled in preaching the doctrine and in surpassing       alātacakranirmāṇasvapnamāyāmbucandrakaiḥ dhūmikāntaḥ pratiśrutkāmarīcyabhraiḥ samo bhavaḥ Existence is like a burning brand brandished in a circle a creation a dream a magic show the moon reflected in water a fog an echo in the midst  a mirage a cloud E Question If all dharmas are empty like a magic show  why are they seen  heard  felt  tasted  touched and known  If they truly did not exist how could one see them  and know them Furthermore if they are seen out of error although they do not exist why do we not see sounds and hear colors  If all dharmas are equally empty and nonexistent  why are some of them visible and others invisible  Being empty dharmas are like a finger of which the first nail is nonexistent and likewise the second Why is it that we do not see the second nail and we see only the first Therefore we know that the first nail which really exists is visible whereas the second which does not really exist is invisible Answer Although the nature of dharmas is empty we can distinguish visible dharmas and invisible dharmas  Take for example magical elephants and horses and other things of this kind we know very well that they are not real and yet we see their color we hear their sounds they correspond to the six senseobjects and they are not mixed up one with the other In the same way although dharmas are empty we can see them we can hear them and they are not confused one with the other Daśabhūmika p Ninth equality sarvadharmamāyāsvapnapratibhāsapratiśrutkodakacandrapratibimbanirmāṇasamatā this is

the previous lifetime to the present lifetime and from the present lifetime to the following lifetime if it does not have a true nature how can ignorance be the condition for the formations and so on up to this accumulation of this mass of suffering  O Bhagavat it is as if a tree has no root  how could it produce a trunk  knots  branches  leaves  flowers and fruit  The Buddha replied The nature of dharmas is emptiness Thus if the affliction did not truly exist there would be no actions of body speech and mind and we would not experience suffering or pleasure Do you not see do you not hear the musical instruments produced by magic Yes I see them and I hear them Then continued the Buddha if the magic show is empty  deceptive and without reality how can one get musical instruments by magic Bhagavat although the magic show has no basis one can hear it and see it Well said the Buddha it is the same for ignorance It is not internal it is not external it is not both neither is it neither internal nor external It does not pass from the past lifetime to the present lifetime nor from the present lifetime to the next lifetime it has no true nature it has neither birth nor cessation However ignorance is the cause and condition for the formations and so on up to the accumulation of this mass of suffering  When the magic show is over the products of magic vanish In the same way when ignorance is destroyed  the formations also are destroyed and so on up to the complete disappearance of the mass of suffering Moreover this example of the magic show demonstrates that among beings all conditioned dharmas are empty and without solidity  And so it is said that all the formations are like a magic show that deceives little children they depend on causes and conditions  they are powerless and do not last for a long time  This is why the bodhisattvas regard dharmas as a magic show Like a mirage When the light of the sun and the wind stir up the dust  there is a mirage in the desert  it appears as if there were gazelles and on seeing them not knowing we assume the presence of water  It is the same for the characteristics of male and female  when the sun of the fetters and the afflictions has heated up the dust of the formations and the wind of bad thoughts swirls in the desert of transmigration  the person without wisdom asserts the characteristics of male and female  This is a mirage Furthermore if the sight of the mirage from afar calls up the notion of water  from close up this notion disappears In the same way when the ignorant person is far away from the holy doctrine  he is ignorant of the nonexistence of self  the emptiness of dharmas  and attributes to the aggregates  the elements and the bases of consciousness the characteristics of a person male or female  But when he has come close to the holy dharma he discovers the true nature of dharmas and scatters the illusions and false notions  This is why the bodhisattvas regard dharmas as a mirage Like the moon reflected in water Actually the moon is situated in space but its reflection appears in the water  In the same way the moon of the true Dharma is in the space of suchness and the peak of existence  but its reflection the wrong notions of me and mine appear in the water of the minds of fools  gods or men This is why are like the moon reflected in water Furthermore when a little child sees the moon reflected in the water he is happy and wants to grab it but the adults who see it make fun of him In the same way the ignorant person seeing his body believes in the existence of a personal self  lacking true knowledge he sees all kinds of dharmas and having seen them he is happy and wants to grasp the characteristics of male or female  etc but the āryas who have found the Path make fun of him A stanza says Like the moon reflected in water like the water of a mirage Like attainments in a dream death and birth are like that Finally it is in clear water that one sees the reflection of the moon when the water is disturbed the reflection vanishes In the same way it is in the pure water of an ignorant mind that the pride of self and the reflections of the fetters appear but when the stick of wisdom stirs up the water of the mind one no longer sees the self or the other reflections of the fetters This is why the bodhisattvas think that dharmas are like the moon reflected in water Like space Space is just a name and not a real dharma Space is invisible but looking at it from afar the eye perceives a light blue color In the same way dharmas are empty and nonexistent  the person who is still far away from pure true wisdom does not discover its true nature but sees in it ātman men and women  houses and cities  all kinds of different things  and his mind clings to them When a little child looks at the blue sky he says that he sees a real color  but those who fly up very high and come closer assert that we see a blue color It is the same for dharmas This is why the sūtra says that they are like space Moreover space is always pure by nature  but when it is overcast and covered by clouds people say that it is impure  In the same way the dharmas are always pure by nature but when they are obscured by desire  hatred and delusion  people declare them to be impure Some stanzas say During the summer months  there is thunder lightning and rain Dark clouds cover the sky the weather is not calm In the same way in ignorant ordinary people  All sorts of afflictions cover over the mind In a wintry sky sometimes the sun shines But usually it is dark and clouds cover it over In the same way the person who has acquired the first or second fruit Is still darkened by the defilements of desire In a spring sky the sun is about to shine forth But is still covered by dark clouds In the same say in the person who has renounced desire and has acquired the third fruit Residues of ignorance and pride still hide the mind In autumn  the sun is not covered by clouds The sky is pure like the water of the oceans Having accomplished what had to be done  being of an immaculate mind The arhat also is completely pure Space is beginningless without middle and without end and it is the same with dharmas This text should be cited in full This is why it is said that dharmas are like space Question Space is a truly existent dharma If space were not a real dharma it would not have the activity of rising up or lowering going or coming bending or spreading out leaving or entering etc since it would not have the room in which to move Answer  i If space were a truly existent dharma it should have an abode  Because without an abode there are no dharmas If space resides in holes space would reside in space therefore space does not reside in cavities If it resided in any reality whatsoever this abode would be real and not empty and thus space would be unable to reside there and would have nothing to accommodate it ii Moreover you say that space is the place of abiding  but in a stone wall which truly exists there is no place of abiding If there is no place of abiding there is no space Since space has no abode there is no space iii Finally space does not exist because it has no specific characteristic  Each dharma has its own characteristic and it is because of this characteristic that we recognize its existence Thus earth has solidity as its characteristic water  humidity  fire  heat  wind  movement consciousness  intellection  wisdom  insight  nirvāṇa cessation  Not having such a characteristic space does not exist Question Space has a characteristic but as you do not cognize it you say that it does not exist The characteristic of space is absence of rūpa  Answer That is not correct Absence of rūpa means elimination of matter but that is not a separate dharma any more than the extinguishing of a lamp is not a distinct dharma This is why space has no selfnature Moreover space does not exist You speak of rūpa by saying that the absence of rūpa is the selfnature of space if that were so insofar as rūpa does not arise the specific nature of space does not exist Finally you say that rūpa is an impermanent dharma  but that space is a permanent dharma Before rūpa existed there should have therefore been a dharma called space since it is eternal If rūpa is not absent the selfnature of space does not exist and if this nature does not exist space does not exist either This is why space is a mere name without any reality The dharmas are also like space they are mere names without any reality Consequently the bodhisattvas believe that dharmas are like space Like an echo In a narrow valley a deep gorge or an empty house when a sound or a noise is made from this sound another sound arises that is called an echo The ignorant person thinks that there is somebody who is repeating his words but the wise person knows that the echo is not due to a third person and that it is solely by a reverberation of the sound that there is a new sound called an echo The echo is empty of reality but it is able to deceive the ear organ  In the same way when a person is about to speak there is a wind in his mouth called Yeou to na that passes to the nostrils  when it strikes the nostrils an echo is produced and at the moment that it comes out it strikes in seven places and subsides That is language  Some stanzas say The wind called udāna Strikes the nostrils and rises up This wind then strikes in seven places The nape of the neck the gums the teeth and the lips The tongue the throat and the chest Thus language is produced The fool does not understand that Hesitant obstinate he produces dveśa and moha The person endowed with wisdom Is not worried does not cling And does not commit any mistake He adheres solely to the nature of dharmas How would anyone know That this skeleton this bundle of nerves Would be able to produce language Like molten metal ejects water This is why the bodhisattvas regard dharmas as an echo Like a city of the gandharvas When the sun rises we see a city of buildings with stories  palaces  with people coming in and going out The higher the sun rises the more indistinct this city becomes it is just an optical illusion without any reality People who have never before seen it and who discover it some morning in the east believe in its reality and hurry towards it but the closer they come the more unclear it becomes and when the sun is high it disappears Tormented by hunger and thirst  the people who perceive a haze like a herd of gazelles believe in the presence of water and hasten towards it but the closer they come the more the illusion becomes blurred Exhausted worn out they come to a high mountain or a narrow valley they utter cries and groans and the echo replies to them they believe in the presence of inhabitants and try to find them but they tire themselves out in vain and find nothing Finally when they have reflected and understood their illusion disappears In the same way the ignorant man thinks he sees an ātman and dharmas in the aggregates  the elements and the bases of consciousness which are empty of any reality Prey to desire  anger and obstinacy  they wander in the four directions to satisfy their desire Lost and deceived they are plunged into poverty and misery But when they have recognized the nonexistence of the ātman and real dharmas by means of wisdom  their mistake disappears Furthermore the city of the gandharvas is not a city it is the mind of the person who sees it as such In the same way fools conceive of that which is not a body as a body and as a mind that which is not a mind Question Answer  i We have already answered this question that the Mahāyāna is like the waters of the ocean and it contains absolutely all dharmas Since the Mahāyāna multiplies the arguments  the large number of comparisons is not a fault ii Moreover the bodhisattvas have profound and sharp knowledge  it is by means of all kinds of teachings  reasonings and comparisons that they eliminate dharmas In order that people should understand it is necessary to multiply the examples iii Finally in the texts of the śrāvakas we never find the example of the city of the gandharvas but there are all kinds of other comparisons to illustrate impermanence  Form is like a ball of foam  feeling like a water bubble  perception like a mirage  volition like the trunk of a banana tree  consciousness like a magic show and a magic net  In the sūtras these are the comparisons used to illustrate emptiness Since the city of the gandharvas is a different comparison it is mentioned here Question In the śrāvaka texts the body is compared to a citywhy is the example of the city of the gandharvas given here Answer In the example of the city used by the śrāvakas the subject of comparison exists as such  whereas the city has merely nominal existence  But in the city of the gandharvas the subject of comparison itself is nonexistent it is like the burning brand flourished in a circle  that deceives the human eye In the śrāvaka texts the example of the city is used only to refute the ātman Here we use the example of the city of the gandharvas so that the bodhisattvas of keen faculties penetrate the emptiness of dharmas deeply which is why these are compared to a city of the gandharvas The text of the Tsa a han has thus been contaminated by the Pāli version Like a dream There is no reality in a dream but nevertheless we believe in the reality of the things seen in a dream After waking up we recognize the falsity of the dream and we smile at ourselves In the same way the person deep in the sleep of the fetters clings to the things that do not exist but when he has found the Path at the moment of enlightenment he understands that there is no reality and laughs at himself This is why it is said like in a dream Moreover by the power of sleep  the dreamer sees something there where there is nothing In the same way by the power of the sleep of ignorance  a person believes in the existence of all kinds of things that do not exist eg me and mine  male and female etc Moreover in a dream we enjoy ourselves although there is nothing enjoyable there we are irritated although there is nothing irritating there we are frightened although there is nothing to be afraid of there In the same way beings of the threefold world  in the sleep of ignorance are irritated although there is nothing irritating enjoy themselves although there is nothing enjoyable and frightened although there is nothing to be afraid of Finally there are five types of dreams i In the case of physical unbalance  when the hot vapors predominate one dreams a lot one sees fire  yellow and red  ii when the cold vapors predominate one sees especially water and white  iii when the windy vapors predominate one sees particularly flights and black  iv when one has thought a lot and reflected well on what one has seen and heard  one sees all of that again in dream v finally the gods send dreams to teach about future events These five types of dreams are all without reality they are false visions It is the same for people  beings who are in the five destinies see the ātman in four ways because of their material visions i the form aggregate is the ātman ii form belongs to the self  to the me  iii in the ātman there is rūpa iv in rūpa there is ātman But when they have found the Path and true wisdom has awakened them they know that has no reality Question You should not say that the dream has no reality Because every mind depends on causes and conditions in order to be produced and in the dream consciousness has all sorts of conditions  Without these conditions how could consciousness arise Answer  Its nothing of the sort in dream we see something although we should not see it We see for example a human head with horns or dead bodies flying through space  Actually people do not have horns and dead bodies do not fly Thus the dream has no reality But human heads really exist and in addition horns also exist it is by a mental confusion that we see a human head with horns There really is space and there really are beings that fly it is by mental confusion that we see dead bodies that fly Answer Even though there are truly human heads and even though there are truly horns a human head with horns is nothing but a false vision Question The universe is vast and in the course of previous lifetimes  the causes and conditions have been varied There may be strange lands where the heads of people grow horns where the people have but one hand or one foot or where they are but one foot tall or where they have nine heads What is strange about humans having horns Answer It is possible that in other lands people may have horns but in a dream one sees only what one knows in this very land where people with horns do not occur Moreover some see in dreams the limits of space or the limits of the directions and of time  How are such things true In what place could space directions and time be absent This is why in a dream we see as existent things that do not exist You were asking how consciousness could be produced in the absence of conditions  Even though the conditions the five sense objects were lacking the conditions necessary for the production of dharmas arise by the efficacy of thinking and of the mind If somebody tells you about a man with two heads this statement would produce a concept and in a dream you will see as existent that which does not exist It is the same for the dharmas they are nonexistent and nevertheless they are seen  heard and cognized  All dharmas Are like A dream a magic show A city of the gandharvas This is why the bodhisattvas believe that dharmas are like a dream Like a shadow A shadow is visible but cannot be grasped It is the same for dharmas the organs and the sense objects are seen  heard  cognized and felt  but their reality is ungraspable A stanza says True wisdom Ungraspable on all four sides Cannot be touched Like a blazing inferno Dharmas are impregnable They must not be grasped Moreover it is necessary that light be intercepted so that the shadow appears without this interception the shadow would be absent In the same way it is necessary that the fetters and the afflictions hide the light of correct seeing so that the shadow of the ātman and of dharmas appear Moreover the shadow walks when the person walks the shadow moves when the person moves the shadow stops when the person stops In the same way the shadow of good or bad actions moves when the past existence moves but it remains stationary when the present existence is stationary because the retribution of actions has not been cut When the sins and merits are ripe  the shadow disappears Some stanzas say Action follows through the air It pursues him among the rocks It accompanies him in the depths of the earth It enters the waters of the ocean with him It pursues him always and everywhere The shadow of actions is indissoluble This is why dharmas are like a shadow Finally the shadow is empty  nonexistent  one may search hard for its reality but one can never find it Similarly all dharmas are empty and without reality Question It is not true that the shadow is empty and without reality It is said in the A pi tan  Blue  yellow  red  white  black  deep red light blue light and shadow  Moreover bodily action and the three kinds of derived matter are called visible or rūpāyatana Why do you say that the shadow does not exist Furthermore the shadow truly exists because it has causes and conditions  its cause is the tree  its condition is light  when these two principal come together the shadow is produced Why do you say that it does not exist If there is no shadow the other dharmas that also possess causes and conditions would not exist either Finally this shadow has a visible color Long or short  big or small  thick or thin  crooked or straight  when the shape moves the shadow also moves All of that is visible This is why the shadow must exist You quote a passage from the Abhidharma but the interpretation that you give it is that of a person People often mistreat the meaning of scriptural texts and take their inventions as reality The atoms are subtle indestructible and incombustible therefore they are eternal And again The dharmas of the three times pass from the future to the present  and from the present to the past without deteriorating   Conditioned dharmas  arising and perishing ever anew do not last  This text favors nihilism  Because no longer exists after having existed Thus in the Abhidharma there are all sorts of statements that contradict the words of the Buddha We cannot resort to it to establish that the shadow is a type of material dharma  When a rūpadharma arises it necessarily has a smell  a taste  tangibility  etc This is not the case for the shadow Therefore it does not exist The jug  for example is cognized by two organs  the eye organ and the organ of touch  If the shadow existed it should be cognized by these two organs But that is not the case and consequently the shadow has no true substance If one takes a burning brand and flourishes it rapidly in a circle one draws a circle in the air with it but this circle has no reality If it were a true substance it could be destroyed or made to disappear hut as long as its screen is intact the shadow is indestructible This is why it is empty Finally since it depends on a screen and has no independence  the shadow is empty But even though it is empty its notion exists and the eye sees it This is why dharmas are compared to a shadow Like a reflection in a mirror The reflection in the mirror is not produced by the mirror  nor by the face  nor by the person holding the mirror  nor by itself  but it is not without causes and conditions  i Why is it not produced by the mirror Because there is no reflection if the face does not come in front of the mirror Thus it is not produced by the mirror ii Why is it not produced by the face Because there is no reflection without the mirror iii Why is it not produced by the person holding the mirror Because there is no reflection without mirror or face iv Why is it not produced by itself Because in the absence of the mirror and the face there is no reflection Thus the reflection is not produced by itself How is it not lacking causes and conditions If it were without causes and conditions it would exist eternally If it existed eternally it would be produced even in the absence of the mirror and the face Thus it is not without causes and conditions It is the same for the dharmas they are not produced by themselves  nor by another  nor by both together  but they are not without causes and conditions i Why are they not produced by themselves They are not produced by themselves because the ātman does not exist because all dharmas come from causes and are not sovereign and because dharmas depend on causes and conditions ii They are not produced by another If they do not themselves exist their neighbor would not exist either Creation by another would suppress the efficacious rle played by sins and merits  Creation by another is of two types good or bad  the good must produce happiness  the bad must produce unhappiness  If there is a mixture of bad and good what is the cause and condition from which the happiness arises and what is the cause and condition from which the unhappiness arises iii If happiness and unhappiness arise without causes and conditions the person would be eternally happy and free of all unhappiness If there is neither cause nor conditions the person could not realize the cause of happiness or escape the cause of unhappiness All dharmas are necessarily from causes and conditions It is stupid to ignore that Thus a person gets fire from wood  water from earth  and wind from a fan  Each of these things has its causes and conditions The causes and conditions of this mass of unhappiness and happiness are the following the actions of the past lifetime are the causes and the good or bad behavior of the present lifetime are the conditions from which suffering and happiness come These are the different causes and conditions of suffering and happiness In truth there is no agent or any enjoyer  The five aggregates are without activity or enjoyment  The ignorant person who finds happiness enjoys it and clings to it if he finds unhappiness he feels irritation when his happiness disappears he tries to recover it A child seeing reflection in a mirror  is happy and becomes infatuated with it but when this wellloved reflection has disappeared the child breaks the mirror to try to recover it wise people make fun of it In the same way those who having lost their happiness try to regain it are mocked by the āryas who have found the Path This is why dharmas are like a reflection in a mirror Moreover the reflection in a mirror is truly empty  without arising  without cessation  but it deceives the eyes of fools  In the same way dharmas are empty without arising without cessation but they deceive the eyes of worldly people  Question The reflection in the mirror is the result of causes and conditions If there is a face a mirror a person holding the mirror and a light provided these causes are brought together the reflection is produced Thus the reflection is both cause and result  Why do you say then that it is empty of reality without arising or cessation Answer Being the result of causes and conditions the reflection is not independent therefore it is empty  A truly existent dharma cannot be the result of causes and conditions If the cause preexists in the cause there is no effect  if the cause does not preexist in the cause there is no result either Thus if cream preexists in milk  the milk is not the cause of the cream for the cream preexists If the cream does not preexist in the milk everything would happen as in water where there is no cream the milk is not the cause of the cream If the cream existed without cause why would water not produce cream If the milk is the cause of the cream the milk which itself is not independent also comes from a cause it derives its origin from the cow  the cow takes its origin from water and grass  and thus there are infinite causes This is why it cannot be said that the result exists in the cause  or that it does not exist na bhavati in the cause or that it both exists and does not exist  or that it neither exists nor does not exist in the cause Dharmas resulting from causes and conditions do not have selfnature  They are like a reflection in a mirror Some stanzas say If dharmas come from causes and conditions They are truly empty of selfnature If these dharmas were not empty They would not be the result of causes and conditions It is like reflections in a mirror They do not come from the mirror nor from the face Nor from the person who holds the mirror Nor from themselves but they are not without cause are neither existent nor nonexistent Not both existent and nonexistent To refuse to accept these theses Is what is called the Middle Way That is why dharmas are like the reflection in the mirror that of kāmadhātu and that of the first dhyāna In the second dhyāna three minds viz that of kāmadhātu that of the first dhyāna and that of the second dhyāna In the third dhyāna four minds viz that of kāmadhātu and those of the first second and third dhyānas In the fourth dhyāna five minds viz that of kāmadhātu and those of the first second third and fourth dhyānas These fourteen minds of metamorphosis accomplish eight kinds of nirmāṇa being single and becoming many  being many and becoming single  passing through stone walls  walking on water  walking in space  touching the sun and the moon with ones hand  transforming the four great elements ie changing earth into water and water into earth fire into wind and wind into fire stone into gold and gold into stone In the realm of desire  substances can be transformed by means of herbs  precious objects and magical means beings endowed with the superknowledges can transform substances by their magical power  the devas nāgas asuras etc can transform substances by means of the power of retribution of their lifetimes beings rewarded in a lifetime in the form realm can transform substances by the power of concentration  a These imaginary creatures are not subject to birth  old age  sickness and death  they experience neither unhappiness nor happiness and thus are different from humans This is why they are empty and nonexistent In the same way all dharmas are without arising  duration and cessation  this is why they are compared to nirmāṇas Furthermore the products of nirmāṇa have no fixed substance  only insofar as they arise from the mind do they have an activity  but they do not truly exist It is the same for human lifetimes for origin they have no cause they come from the minds citta synonymous here with karman of the past existence giving rise to the existence of the present life which is absolutely without reality This is why dharmas are compared to a nirmāṇa When the nirmāṇa mind has vanished the manifestation vanishes as well It is the same with dharmas when the causes and conditions have disappeared the fruit disappears as well for it is dependent as is the product of nirmāṇa Although they are empty of reality the nirmāṇas can cause beings to experience joy  hatred  sadness  suffering or confusion  In the same way although dharmas are empty and unreal they can cause beings to experience joy  hatred  sadness  fear  etc Moreover the products of metamorphosis lack beginning middle and end  it is the same with dharmas When the nirmāṇas arise they do not go anywhere when they vanish they do not go anywhere It is the same with dharmas Finally the nirmāṇas are pure like space  they are not attached to nor defiled by sins or merits  It is the same for the dharmas for suchness  the true nature or the summit of existence is itself always pure  Thus the four great rivers of Jambudvīpa each of which has five hundred tributaries have their waters polluted in various ways but when they flow into the great ocean they are perfectly clear Question It cannot be said that the nirmāṇas are empty Because the mind of metamorphosis on which it is dependent comes from the development of a samādhi Whether it is a man or a thing this nirmāṇa has a cause and produces an effect  How can it be empty Answer We must repeat the answer that we have already given with regard to the shadow  It is as empty as the speech that comes out of the mouth Even though the mind and the mouth produce this word it does not exist by the fact of the mind and the mouth alone The object designated by this word may just as well exist as not exist If we talk about a second head dvitīya śīrsaka or a third hand  we cannot say that this head or this hand exists even though they arise from the mind  Thus the Buddha said By examining that which does not arise  one is freed from that which arises by being based on the unconditioned  one is freed from the conditioned  Although the nonarisen dharma does not exist it can play the rle of cause and condition  and it is the same for the unconditioned  Although the nirmāṇa itself is empty it can itself give rise to a mind As with the other nine points of comparison  magic show  mirage  etc it can engender all sorts of minds even though it does not exist Furthermore the nirmāṇa cannot be included in the six causes and the four conditions  As it is not associated with them it is empty  Finally empty are not empty because they are invisible but because they lack true activity  This is why dharmas are compared to a nirmāṇa belongs Question Any dharma whatsoever is as empty as the ten points of comparison used here in the sūtra why does the sūtra limit itself to these ten comparisons and not give as example mountains  rivers  stone walls  etc Answer Although all dharmas are empty there are differences among them emptiness is harder to see in some than in others Here the sūtra compares dharmas the emptiness of which is hard to see  the emptiness of which is easy to see Moreover there are two types of dharmas those that are the object of an erroneous judgment and those that are not the object of an erroneous judgment  Question Why are the ten points of comparison not the object of erroneous judgment Answer Because these ten points do not last for a long time and because they arise and perish easily This is why they are not the object of an erroneous judgment Moreover there are people who know that these ten points bring about auditory and visual delusions but who do not know that dharmas are empty This is why the sūtra compares dharmas here If people believed in the reality of the ten points of comparison  they would not understand the various objections because they would hold the magic show the mirage etc to be real If these ten points of comparison do not fulfill their rle in the discussion we would need to resort to yet other demonstrations  They have acquired the unhindered fearlessnesses  āstra Their mind encounters no obstacle  neither exhaustion nor cessation  in regard to the various aggregates  elements  bases of consciousness or causes and conditions  Thus they have unhindered fearlessnesses  Question The sūtra said above that in the midst of infinite assemblies the bodhisattvas are endowed with the fearlessnesses  why does it repeat here that they have unhindered fearlessnesses Answer  Above it was a question of the cause of the vaiśāradyas here it concerns their effect  In the assemblies  including those of the bodhisattvas their preaching is inexhaustible  their teaching indomitable and their mind imperturbable for they have acquired the unhindered fearlessnesses Moreover the sūtra said above that they are fearless in the midst of infinite assemblies but one does not know by virtue of what power they are fearless This is why here it adds that they are fearless because they have acquired an unhindered power  Question If the bodhisattvas like the Buddha have these unhindered fearlessnesses how does the Buddha differ from them Answer We have said that the bodhisattvas who have the power of the fearlessnesses experience no fear in respect to any dharma But that is not the fearlessnesses enjoyed by the Buddha Moreover there are two kinds of unhindered dharmas  universal and nonuniversal  The person for example who experiences no difficulty in a whole series of texts  from one text to a hundred thousand texts or who experiences no fear in front of a whole series of assemblies  from one to a hundred thousand assemblies is nonuniversal In the same way the bodhisattvas do not encounter any obstacle in their own wisdom but rather in that of the Buddha Thus when the Buddha dropped his begging bowl  the five hundred arhats and the bodhisattvas Maitreya etc were unable to catch hold of it do you cling to pleasures Such are the various reproaches made by the bodhisattvas to them and this proves that they know the mind and conduct of beings Question How do they save them by means of their subtle wisdom First what is subtle wisdom and what is coarse wisdom  Answer Coarse wisdom is a purely mundane skill  generosity  discipline  and concentration are called subtle wisdom Furthermore the wisdom of generosity is a coarse wisdom the wisdom of discipline and concentration is subtle wisdom Furthermore the wisdom of dhyāna is coarse wisdom dhyāna without bliss is a subtle wisdom Furthermore it is a coarse wisdom that grasps all the characteristics of dharmas  but it is a subtle wisdom that does not accept or reject any characteristic of dharmas Finally destroying ignorance and the other afflictions and discovering the nature of dharmas is a coarse wisdom but penetrating into the true nature incorruptible and imperishable like gold  indestructible and unchangeable like diamond  untarnishable and ungraspable like space  is a subtle wisdom These are the innumerable subtle wisdoms that the bodhisattvas have acquired and which they teach beings Thus the sūtra says that knowing the course of the mind and the activity of beings the bodhisattvas are skilled in saving them by means of the subtle wisdom Text of the sūtra commented on in this chapter  apratihatacittair adhimātrakṣāntisamanvāgatair yāthātmyāvatāraṇakuśalaiḥ These bodhisattvas had a mind without obstacles they were endowed with utmost patience they excelled in saving appropriately they feel no hostility if someone comes to torment them they feel no joy if they are honored in many ways A stanza says They have no attachment Towards the Buddha or the bodhisattvas They have no hostility Towards heretics or bad people This purity is called apratihatacitta iii Finally their mind is without obstacles in regard to dharmas Question But these bodhisattvas have not attained buddhahood and do not yet possess omniscience  why does their mind not encounter obstacles in regard to the dharmas Answer Having attained immense pure wisdom  their mind is free of obstacles with regard to dharmas But since they have not reached buddhahood they cannot possess immense wisdom  since they retain a residue of fetters  they cannot have pure wisdom Answer The bodhisattvas are not the bodhisattvas with fleshly body  who are bound to actions and limited to the threefold world  All of them have acquired the sovereignty of the dharmakāya and transcended old age  sickness and death  out of compassion for beings they dwell in the universes  move about in and adorn the buddhafields and convert beings Having acquired sovereignty  they wish to become Buddha and to succeed therein Question If the bodhisattvas of the dharmakāya are no different from the Buddha why are they called bodhisattva why do they serve the Buddha and listen to his teaching If they are different from the Buddha how do they possess the immense and pure knowledge  Answer Although they have attained the dharmakāya and transcended old age sickness and death they differ slightly from the Buddha they are like the moon of the fourteenth day which we wonder whether it is full or not Thus the bodhisattvas have not yet become truly Buddha although they act as Buddha and preach the Dharma The Buddha himself is like the moon of the fifteenth day which is undeniably full Furthermore there are two types of immense purity  The first is limited but those who cannot measure it call it immense this is for example of drops of water in the ocean  or of grains of sand in the sands of the Ganges  unable to evaluate it people describe it as immense But for the Buddhas and bodhisattvas there is no limited immensity For gods humans śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas that cannot be measured is called immense wisdom  but the bodhisattvas at the moment they find the path of nonarising  cut through the fetters and acquire pure wisdom  Question If it is at this moment that they cut through the fetters what do they still have to cut through when they become Buddha Answer Purity is of two types i At the moment when they become Buddha they expel the bonds and obtain real purity completely ii At the moment when they cast off the fleshly body and acquire the dharmakāya they break the bonds bandhanāni chinnanti this is the purity It is like a lamp that chases away the shadows and fulfills its rle but there is a more powerful lamp that shines still more brightly For the cutting of the fetters  it is the same for the Buddhas and bodhisattvas that are broken in the bodhisattvas may be described as broken but in comparison with those that are broken in the Buddhas they have not completely disappeared This is what is called the immense and pure wisdom by virtue of which the bodhisattvas have an unhindered mind towards all dharmas We have already discussed the patience of equanimity and the patience with respect to dharmas  why does the sūtra say again that the bodhisattvas are endowed with utmost patience Answer The increase of the two patiences you have just mentioned is called utmost patience  Moreover the patience of equanimity may be held by beings  the patience consonant with the Dharma is the patience relating to profound dharmas  the increase of these two patiences realizes the patience relating to nonarising  During his last fleshly existence  the bodhisattva contemplates the Buddhas of the ten directions and their emanations  It is like in the śrāvaka system where the increase of heat is called summit and the increase of summit is called patience  they are not distinct dharmas but merely different degrees  Furthermore there are two kinds of patience the patience towards beings and the patience towards dharmas  The patience towards beings relates to beings if beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges persecute you in every way you do not feel any anger  if they honor you and pay homage to you in every way you experience no joy  Moreover you know that beings have no beginning  if they have no beginning they have no causes and conditions  if they have no causes and conditions they have no end either Because the beginning and the end are interdependent  If they have neither beginning nor end they have no middle either When things are seen in this way one does not fall into the two extreme views of eternalism and nihilism  it is by means of the way of safety that one considers beings without producing wrong views  The patience relating to dharmas is the unhindered mind relating to profound dharmas  Question What are the profound dharmas Answer See the explanation already given for gambhīradharmakṣānti In the twelvemembered pratītyasamutpāda the result is produced successively the result is not present in the cause  but neither is it absent it is from this intermediate state that it arises This is called gambhīradharma   Siddhi p   Furthermore when the three gates of liberation  namely emptiness  signlessness and wishlessness  are penetrated the eternal bliss of nirvāṇa is found This also is a gambhīradharma Finally it is also a gambhīradharma to consider dharmas as neither empty nor nonempty  neither with marks nor without marks  neither active nor inactive and by considering them thus not to attach ones mind to it Some stanzas say Dharmas resulting from causes and conditions Are called empty of nature  Are described as conventional  Are called the Middle path  If dharmas really existed They would not return into nothingness Not existing after having existed Is what is called annihilation  When there is neither eternalism nor nihilism Neither existence nor nonexistence The basis of the mind and of consciousness disappears And words are exhausted The two vehicles  while possessing the means of salvation do not save as they should  for their adepts not being omniscient  use only rather rudimentary skillful means  It is only bodhisattvas who can save appropriately There is a good and a bad way of saving beings just as there is a good way and a bad way to cross a river or to cure a sickness Thus to take someone across to the other shore the master ferryman is able to use a fishermans straw raft or a big boat  there are notable differences between these two ways of crossing Or again there are different remedies for curing sicknesses  such as medicinal herbs or cauterization with a needle but there is a still more wonderful herb called Sou to chan to which it suffices that the sick person looks at it and all his ills are cured Although these remedies seem similar their quality differs According to the śrāvaka doctrine one finds the Path by considering suffering  according to the bodhisattva doctrine the mind finds purity by considering the dharmas as free of bonds and free of deliverance  Bhagavat once in times gone by innumerable incalculable periods ago there was a Buddha called Che tseu yin wang  The lifetime of the Buddha and of beings was a hundred thousand koṭinayuta years the Buddha saved beings by the three Vehicles  the country was called Tsien kouang ming  In this land the trees were made of the seven jewels and emitted immense and pure sounds of the Dharma  the sounds of emptiness  signlessness  wishlessness  nonarising  noncessation and nothingness  The beings who heard these sounds found their minds opening up and discovered the Path When the Buddha Siṃhanādarāja preached the Dharma to the first assembly  koṭis of human beings attained the state of arhat all these bodhisattvas had acquiescence of the teaching of nonarising  they penetrated all sorts of religious texts  they saw innumerable Buddhas whom they served and honored  they were able to save innumerable and incalculable beings they possessed innumerable dhāraṇīmukhas they used innumerable samādhis of all kinds from the first production of mind  they had crossed through the gate of the Path It would be impossible to cite and list all these bodhisattvas and describe the beauties of this buddhafield  Finally when the Buddha had converted them all he entered into nirvāṇawithoutremainder  his Dharma lasted  more years and then the trees stopped emitting the sounds of the Dharma  There were at that time two bodhisattva bhikṣus named Hi ken and Cheng yi  The Dharma teacher Prasannendriya of frank and simple manner had not renounced the things of the world and did not distinguish good from evil His disciples were intelligent  loved the Dharma and understood admirably the profound meaning  Their teacher did not recommend moderation in desires to them or the observance of the precepts or the practice of the dhūtas He spoke to them only of the true nature of the dharmas which is pure  He said to them The dharmas are characterized by desire  hatred and delusion  but all these characteristics may be reduced to the true nature of the dharmas which is without hindrance  It was by these soteriological means that he instructed his disciples and introduced them into the knowledge of the unique nature  Thus his disciples felt no hostility or affection for people and as their minds were unperturbed they had obtained the patience towards beings  provided with the patience towards beings they acquired the patience relating to the dharmas  In the presence of the true doctrine they remained motionless like a mountain By contrast the Dharma teacher Agramati clinging to the purity of the precepts  practiced the twelve dhūtas had acquired the four dhyānas and the formless absorptions  His disciples were of weak faculties and clung to distinguishing the pure from the impure ones their minds were always disturbed  On various occasions Agramati went to the village among the disciples of Prasannendriya and seated there he praised the precepts  moderation in desires  the practice of solitude and the dhyānas He criticized their teacher Agramati saying This man who preaches the Dharma and teaches people introduces them into wrong views  He says that desire  anger and delusion are not an obstacle  that people of mixed practices are not really pure The disciples of Prasannendriya who had keen faculties and the patience relating to dharmas asked Agramati O Venerable One what are the characteristics of desire This affliction of desire is neither internal nor external If it were internal it would not depend on causes and conditions to take birth if it were external it would not have anything to do with the self and would be unable to torment it People then retorted If desire is neither internal nor external nor in the directions in the east  in the south  in the west or in the north  nor in the four intermediate directions  nor at the zenith nor at the nadir  one might look everywhere for its true nature and one would never find it This dharma does not arise and does not cease and since it lacks the characteristics of birth and cessation  it is empty and nonexistent  How could it torment  Deeply displeased on hearing these words Agramati could not reply He rose from his seat saying Your teacher Prasannendriya deceives many beings and clings to wrong ways  This bodhisattva Agramati did not know the ghoṣapraveśadhāraṇī he was happy when he heard the speech of the Buddha and grieved when he heard a heretical word he was sad when he heard speak of the three evil things and rejoiced when he heard speak of the three good things  he hated speaking about saṃsāra and loved to speak about nirvāṇa Leaving the dwellings of the vaiśya he went back to the forest and returned to his monastery  He said to his bhikṣus You should know that the bodhisattva Prasannendriya is an impostor who leads people to evil This Agramati who is so fierce is covered with faults and will fall into great sins  I am going to teach him the profound Dharma  Even if he cannot grasp it today this teaching will earn him buddhahood later Then gathering the saṃgha together Prasannendriya spoke these stanzas Rāga is the Path Dveṣa and moha are also the Path In these three things are included Innumerable states of buddhahood Whoever makes a distinction Between rāgadveṣamoha and the Path Departs as far from the Buddha As the sky is far from the earth The Path and rāgadveṣamoha Are one and the same thing The person who listens to his fears Wanders far from buddhahood Rāga is not born it does not perish It is incapable of calling forth anxiety But if the person believes in the ātman Rāga will lead him to bad destinies To distinguish existence from nonexistence Is not freeing oneself from them Recognizing their fundamental identity Is to win the victory and realize buddhahood Prasannendriya spoke seventy more stanzas of this kind and at that moment  devaputras found acquiescence in the doctrine of nonproduction   śrāvakas detached from all dharmas found deliverance  Becoming a monk in search of the Path he gave up the precepts and so for  lifetimes he completely neglected the precepts Finally for innumerable lifetimes he was a śrāmaṇa but although he no longer neglected the precepts his faculties remained closed  As for the bodhisattva Prasannendriya he is the Buddha in the eastern region beyond  koṭis of buddhafields  his land is called Pao yen and he himself is named Kouang yu je ming wang  At that time I was the bhikṣu Agramati I knew that I had to endure these immense sufferings Mañjuśrī said again Those who seek the Path of the three vehicles and do not want to undergo such suffering should not reject the nature of dharmas or give themselves up to hatred  The Buddha then asked him When you heard these stanzas  what benefit did you get from them Mañjuśrī replied When I heard these stanzas I came to the end of my suffering From lifetime to lifetime I had sharp faculties and wisdom  I was able to find the profound Dharma and I excelled in preaching the profound meaning  I was foremost among all the bodhisattvas Thus to be skillful in preaching the nature of the dharmas is to excel in saving appropriately   There is a buddhafield adorned with the seven jewels which is always bathed in clear light although it has neither sun nor moon  When I will be Buddha may my field be always bathed thus in pure light There is a buddhafield where all the beings practice the ten wholesome actions and have great wisdom  where garments coverlets and food appear at will When I will be Buddha may beings in my field also find garments coverlets and food at will There is a buddhafield where the pure bodhisattvas have the physical appearance of the Buddha with his thirty major marks and his brilliant light where there is no question of śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas and where women are completely absent all the inhabitants follow the profound marvelous Path of the Buddhas travel in the ten directions and convert all beings When I will be Buddha may the beings in my field be like this This is how the bodhisattvas aspire to and attain all the marvels of innumerable buddhafields and this is why the sūtra says that they have acquired an infinite number of buddhafields by means of their aspirations Question But by virtue of the purity of their conduct and their actions  the bodhisattvas automatically obtain good rewards  Why must they first aspire to them in order to obtain them later A farmer who has grain must he still wish for it In the same way metalcasting requires a master the crude metal being formless  Thus the Buddha said Some people cultivate the limited merit of generosity or morality  but are ignorant of the law of merit learning that there are wealthy happy people they always think about them and endlessly wish for happiness at the end of their life they will be reborn among wealthy happy people This happiness is the result of their wish In the same way it is by aspiring for the pure universes that the bodhisattvas acquire them later Therefore it is thanks to their aspirations that they possess superior fruits  Furthermore the adornment of the buddhafields is important Thus an ox has the strength to draw a cart but a driver is needed to reach the destination It is the same for aspirations related to the pure universes merit is like the ox aspiration is the driver Question Answer One would gain merit but not as when the aspiration is added If one thinks endlessly of the goal the merit increases  Question If merit entails retribution people who commit the ten sins but do not wish for hell as retribution would not have to suffer hell as punishment  Answer Although sin and merit are necessarily retributed  only those who formulate aspirations cultivate merit endowed with the power of the aspirations they obtain a great fruit of merit  As was said above sin has suffering as retribution but all the beings wish to find happiness nobody wishes for suffering or hell  This is why sin has but a limited punishment whereas merit finds unlimited reward  According to some even the greatest sinner who has fallen into the Avīci hell will suffer his punishment for one kalpa whereas the very meritorious person residing in the sphere of neither perceptionnornonperception  will enjoy his reward for  great kalpas In the same way the bodhisattvas who have aspired to the pure universes will travel the Path for countless kalpas and will attain nirvāṇa eternal bliss  when the antarakalpa is ended the guilty one falls into other hells  How can you say that the very great sinner suffers his punishment in hell for just one kalpa In the way of the śrāvaka the Buddha says that the person guilty of the five ānantarya crimes will suffer hell for only one kalpa in the bodhisattva way the Buddha declares that the enemy of the Buddhadharma after having spent an antarakalpa  will go to yet other hells to undergo innumerable sufferings there  According to the theory of the śrāvakas a single great merit will be rewarded during  kalpas according to the theory of the bodhisattvas it will be rewarded during innumerable asaṃkhyeykalpas This is why merit requires aspiration  It is in this sense that the sūtra says that the bodhisattvas are adorned with an infinite number of buddhafields by means of their aspirations They always turn to the concentration commemorating the Buddhas of numberless buddhafields āstra The countless buddhafields are the buddhafields of the ten directions The concentration commemorating the Buddhas is that which by means of the minds eye  perceives all the Buddhas of the ten directions and the three times as if they were present QuestionThen what is the buddhanusmṛtisamādhi Answer It is of two types i According to the śrāvaka system it is to see with the eye of the mind one single Buddha filling the ten directions ii according to the bodhisattva system it is to recollect all the Buddhas of the ten directions and the three times who are present in numberless buddhakṣetras Also the sūtra says that the bodhisattvas always direct themselves towards the concentrations commemorating the Buddhas of countless buddhafields Question The concentrations of the bodhisattvas are of infinite variety why does the sūtra praise only the bodhisattvas who devote themselves always to the buddhānusmṛtisamādhi Answer  i Because by commemorating the Buddhas these bodhisattvas reach buddhahood This is why they devote themselves always to the buddhānusmṛtisamādhi ii Furthermore the buddhānusmṛtisamādhi is able to drive away the afflictions of all sorts and the sins of former lifetimes  Other samādhis can drive away desire but not hatred  others can drive away hatred but not desire still others can drive away delusion but not desire or hatred finally others can drive away the threefold poison but not the sins of earlier lives Only the buddhānusmṛtisamādhi is capable of eliminating all the afflictions and all the sins iii Finally the buddhānusmṛtisamādhi has the great merit of being able to save beings and this is precisely what these bodhisattvas want The buddhānusmṛtisamādhi is able to destroy sins quickly better than all the other samādhis They encountered Mo kie lo  king of the fish  the water of the sea rushed into its gapiing mouth and the ship was about to be engulfed The captain  asked the man in the lookout What do you see He answered I see three suns  ranges of white mountains and a waterfall at the entrance to a the age of seven years to Jetavana and embraced the monastic life cave The captain shouted It is the Makara the king of the fish he is holding his mouth agape the first sun is the real sun the other two suns are his eyes  the white mountains are his teeth  the waterfall is the sea water that is rushing into his mouth v Moreover by always commemorating the Buddhas we acquire all kinds of qualities and benefits  In the same way that a great minister who has received special favors always commemorates his master so the bodhisattvas who owe qualities of all kinds and immense wisdom to he Buddha feel gratitude and ceaselessly commemorate the Buddha You may ask why the bodhisattvas always commemorate the Buddhas instead of practicing the other samādhis as well But to say that they always commemorate the Buddhas does not mean that they neglect the other samādhis what it does mean is that they practice the buddhanusmrtisamādhi more often vi Finally the sūtra has already mentioned the samādhis of emptiness  signlessness and wishlessness  but did not say anything about the buddhānusmṛtisamādhi That is why it is spoken of here They excelled in inviting innumerable buddhas  The invitations are of two types i When a Buddha becomes buddha the bodhisattvas ceremoniously invite him three times during the night and three times during the day throwing their upper garment over one shoulder ekāṃsam uttarāsaṅgaṃ kṛtvā with joined palms  they say to him In the buddhafields of the ten directions  countless Buddhas once they have become buddha do not turn the wheel of Dharma  I soandso invite all the Buddhas to turn the wheel of Dharma for beings to save them all ii When the Buddhas are about to abandon their life of immense duration and prepare to enter nirvāṇa the bodhisattvas three times during the day and three times during the night throw their upper garment over one shoulder and with joined palms say I soandso invite the countless Buddhas of the buddhafields of the ten directions to remain for a long time in this world for countless kalpas for the salvation and welfare of all beings This is how the bodhisattvas invite innumerable Buddhas Question The Buddhas have a pattern according to which they must preach the Dharma and save all beings Whether they are invited or not this pattern remains the same Then why must they be invited Besides although it is possible to invite the Buddhas who are close by how is it possible to invite the Buddhas of the innumerable buddhafields of the ten directions Answer i Although the Buddhas are obliged to preach the Dharma and need no human invitation the person who invites them gains merit by doing so In the same way even though the king finds plenty of delicacies to eat at home many people still invite him in order to gain his favor and obtain his advice In Tibetan this practice is called Phungpo gsumpaḥi mdo ii Moreover if one feels friendship for beings and one wishes them happiness one gains great merit even though these beings do not get any It is the same when one invites the Buddhas to preach the Dharma iii Furthermore there are Buddhas who have not been invited to preach and who have entered directly into nirvāṇa without having preached the Dharma Thus in the Fa houa king  the Bhagavat Yo pao  whom nobody had invited  entered nirvāṇa directly but later his fictive nirmāṇakāya and his stūpa made of the seven jewels appeared simultaneously in order to confirm the prediction of the Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra Similarly also the Buddha Siu chan to fo  as his disciples had not yet ripened the seeds of good and were consequently unable to grasp his teaching he entered directly into nirvāṇa but to save beings he left a fictive Buddha which lasted for a kalpa The present Buddha ākyamuni having become buddha waited  days before preaching the Dharma My Dharma is profound  difficult to penetrate and difficult to understand  Beings attached to worldly things are unable to understand it Nevertheless ākyamuni did not enter into silence in the bliss of nirvāṇa At that time the bodhisattvas and the akradevendra and Brahmādevarāja gods came to bow down before him with joined palms and invited him to turn the wheel of Dharma for beings The Buddha accepted their invitation in silence and then went to Po lo nai in the Lou lin where he turned the wheel of Dharma Under these circumstances how can you say that it is useless to invite the Buddhas iv Finally it is customary for the Buddhas to consider beings not in order to know whether they are noble or lowly light or heavy but to know if they invite them Even if beings did not invite the Buddha facetoface the Buddha who always knows their minds hears their invitation Supposing even that the Buddhas do not see and do not hear those who invite them there would still be the same merit of inviting them how much more so when they are able to see you and hear you Question If it is so advantageous to invite the Buddhas why invite them only on the two occasions indicated above Answer It is not necessary to invite them in other circumstances but in those two it is indispensable to do so People might also say If he knows the nature of dharmas he should not covet a long life By remaining so long in the world he is in no hurry to enter into nirvāṇa This is why prayers for him to stay here are needed If the Buddhas preached without being invited people would say that the Buddha is attached to his own system and wants to make it known to people This is why the Buddhas must await peoples invitation to turn the wheel of Dharma The heretics themselves are attached to their own systems with or without invitation they preach to people The Buddha has no attachment or fondness for his doctrine it is out of compassion for beings that he preaches when he is invited if he were not invited he would not turn the wheel of Dharma The Buddhas say What is true What is false The true and the false Are both nonexistent Thus the truth consists Of not being discursive about the dharmas It is out of compassion for beings That they turn the wheel of Dharma Moreover if the Buddha preached the doctrine without being invited he would have preached his own discoveries  his own beliefs and would certainly have answered the fourteen difficult questions But when the gods invited him to preach where it was a matter only of cutting through old age  sickness and death  he did not engage in controversial questions  this is why he did not answer the fourteen difficult questions and avoided any criticism For this reason he must be invited to turn the wheel of Dharma Furthermore although born among humans the Buddha nevertheless acts as a Mahāpuruṣa despite his great compassion  he does not preach without being invited If he preached without an invitation he would be criticized by the heretics  therefore first he must be invited Again the heretics belong to the sect of the god Brahmā and if Brahmā himself invites the Buddha the heretics give in Finally the bodhisattvas regularly accomplish a threefold practice three times during the day and three times during the night  In the morning throwing the upper garment over one shoulder and with joined palms  they pay homage to the Buddhas of the ten directions saying I soandso in the presence of the Buddhas of the ten directions confess the faults and sins of body speech and mind that I have committed for countless kalpas in my present lifetime and in past lifetimes I vow to wipe them out and not to commit them again During the night they repeat this formula three times  They commemorate the Buddhas of the ten directions and the three times their activities  their qualities and those of their disciples They praise them and exhort them   They supplicate the Buddhas of the ten directions to turn the wheel of Dharma and invite them to remain in the world for countless kalpas to save all beings By accomplishing this threefold practice the bodhisattvas gain immense merit and approach buddhahood This is why they must invite the Buddhas They excelled in destroying various wrong views entanglements and afflictions  These views are brought about by various causes and conditions  are discovered by various sciences  are understood by various teachers  they constitute all kinds of fetters under various characteristics and cause diverse sufferings to beings This is why they are called various views  The meaning of the word dṛṣṭi will be explained fully later There are ten manifestly active defilements  i anger  ii hypocrisy  iii lethargy  iv languor  v regret  vi agitation  vii shamelessness  viii nonembarrassment  ix avarice  x envy  Moreover because they fetter the mind all the afflictions are called manifestly active defilements  The afflictions are called kleśa because they vex and torment the mind The kleśas of inner attachment are the five dṛṣṭis doubt  pride  etc the kleśas of outer attachment are lust  hatred  etc Ignorance is both inner and outer There are two other types of bonds  those that depend on craving and those that depend on wrong views  There are also three types of bandhana those that depend on lust  those that depend on hatred and those that depend on delusion  They are called kleśa Some people list ten paryavasthānas others   There are nine saṃyojanas seven anuśayas and a total of  bandhanas According to the Kia tchan yen tseu a pi tan  these ten paryavasthānas and āstra By the power of dhyāna and mental discipline  by the power of pure wisdom and skillful means  these bodhisattvas produce all kinds of samādhis What is samādhi It is the fixing on one point of a good mind  the immobility of the mind  There are three kinds of samādhis i samādhi with vitarka and vicāra  ii samādhi without vitarka but with vicāra iii samādhi with neither vitarka nor vicāra There are four other kinds of samādhi i samādhi connected with the world of desire  ii samādhi connected with the world of form  iii samādhi connected with the formless world  iv samādhi not connected with anything Here it is a question of the bodhisattva samādhis that have already been mentioned They are not as complete as those of the Buddhas The bodhisattvas produce them by the practice and cultivation of effort  Question Why do the bodhisattvas produce and play with these hundred thousand samādhis Answer Therefore the bodhisattvas use the hundred thousand kinds of samādhis to cut through the disturbances of the passions  Thus those who wish to enrich the poor must first gather all sorts of wealth and provisions to be able then to go and help the poor those who wish to cure sick people must first prepare all kinds of drugs to be able then to cure the sick In the same way the bodhisattvas who wish to save beings use hundreds of thousands of samādhis Question Why are they not content with just producing these samādhis but they also play with them The bodhisattvas who produce these samādhis amuse themselves by entering into and emerging from them this mastery of the samādhis is called play  This play is not attachment to desire  it is a mastery  Thus the lion who appears as a fearless sovereign among gazelles is called mṛgarati  In the same way these bodhisattvas who have mastery of these samādhis go in and out of them at will some enter into them at will but remain there and do not emerge easily others remain there at will but do not enter and emerge freely others enter and remain freely but do not emerge easily finally others remain and emerge at will but do not enter freely Because the bodhisattvas have the threefold power over these samādhis of entering remaining there and emerging at will the sūtra says that they produce a hundred thousand samādhis and play with them These bodhisattvas were endowed with countless qualities of this type evaṃvidhaiś cāpramāṇair guṇaiḥ samanvāgataiḥ āstra As these bodhisattvas surround the Buddha the person who would like to glorify their qualities  were he to do so for countless koṭis of kalpas This is why they are endowed with innumerable qualities These were the bodhisattvas Po to po lo or Chan cheou  Tche pao yin  Tchang kiu cheou Varuṇadatta is an upāsaka bodhisattva Then having himself arranged the lionseat the Bhagavat sat down crosslegged holding his body upright and fixing his attention he entered into the samādhi called King of Samādhis in which all the concentrations are included Atha khalu bhagavān svayam eva siṃhāsanaṃ prajñapya nyaṣīdat paryaṅkaṃ baddhvā ṛjukāyaṃ praṇidhāyābhimukhīṃ smṛtim upasthāpya samādhirājaṃ nāma samādhiṃ samāpadyate sma yatra sarvasamādhayo ntargatāḥ āstra Question The Buddha has a servant and numerous bodhisattvas why does he arrange the lionseat himself Answer This seat was created by the Buddha himself in accordance with the great assembly this is why nanda could not arrange it Besides it is the Buddhas mind that creates this seat this is why it is said that he arranges it himself Question What is this siṃhāsana Did the Buddha create a lion Is a real lion present or did he make a lion out of gold silver wood or stone Besides since the lion is not a nice animal the Buddha does not need it and since there is no need for it the lion should not be there Answer The lion in question is not a real lion but since the Buddha is a lion among men  the seat where he sits down whether it be on a bed or on the ground  is called the lions seat In the same way even today the seat where the king is enthroned is called a lions seat the chief who commands warriors is called a lionman and people call the king of the land puruṣasiṃha Just as a lion among animals is strong fearless and can conquer all  so the Buddha triumphs over all ninetysix heretical systems and is called puruṣasiṃha Question Sitting postures are numerous why does the Buddha take just the crosslegged posture  Answer  Among sitting postures the crosslegged position is the calmest and the least tiring this is the posture of those in dhyāna for by holding the hands and feet in this way the mind does not wander What is the Samādhirājasamādhi This samādhi is foremost among all the samādhis it takes innumerable samādhis at will as object  Just as the king is foremost of all men just as the cakravartin king is foremost among kings just as the Buddha is foremost among all the beings of earth and heaven so this samādhi is foremost of all samādhis Question By virtue of the power of the Buddha all the samādhis are necessarily foremost Why do you call only the Samādhirāja foremost Answer Although all the samādhis practiced by the Buddha are necessarily foremost by virtue of his miraculous power  nevertheless there are differences among them they do not all have the same value Question In what absorption is the Samādhirājasamādhi contained  and what is its nature  a Some claim that the Samādhirājasamādhi has mastery as its nature that it is contained in the five good elements  and that it resides in the fourth dhyāna  It is in the fourth dhyāna that all the Buddhas travelling on the path of seeing the truths  attain the fruit of A na han  and that they attain Buddhahood in eighteen mindmoments dhyāna The kṛtsnāyatanas are abundant in the fourth dhyāna The fourth dhyāna is free of disturbances  it is not an obstacle to the dharmas of absorption  in the desire realm  desire counteracts the mind of absorption  in the first dhyāna investigation and analysis stir up the mind in the second dhyāna it is great joy that moves it in the third dhyāna it is great pleasure that moves it But in the fourth dhyāna there is no disturbance Moreover the first dhyāna is burned up by fire  the second is flooded by water  the third is blown away by wind  but the fourth is free of these three torments  there is no inbreath or outbreath  it is pure in its equanimity and its memory  This is why the Samādhirājasamādhi should be in the fourth dhyāna in the same way that a precious object has its place in a treasury b Others say Who can know the nature of a samādhi of the Buddha All the dharmas of the Buddha have a unique nature  without mark  immense  incalculable  inconceivable  If the other samādhis are immense incalculable and inconceivable what then could be said of the Samādhirājasamādhi The Buddha is the only one who knows it If the basis of his miraculous power and his morality is inconceivable what then could be said of the Samādhirājasamādhi Moreover all the samādhis are collected in the Samādhirājasamādhi this is why it is called king of samādhis In the same way all the rivers and all the streams of Jambudvīpa empty into the great ocean and all the people depend on their king Question The Buddha is omniscient and knows everything Why does he enter into the Samādhirājasamādhi and what will he know subsequently  Answer  He wishes to show that his wisdom is the result of causes and conditions and astound the six heretic teachers who claim Wisdom is always present in us we always know This is why it is said that the Buddha knows because he has entered into the Samādhirājasamādhi and if he did not enter it he would not know Question If that were so the power of the Buddha would be very reduced Answer No because he never has any trouble entering into Samādhirājasamādhi and it takes him but a moment to do so It is not the same for the śrāvakas the pratyekabuddhas and the lesser bodhisattvas who try in every way to enter samādhi miraculous power that are medium iii the one who has entered into samādhi by actual qualities and mental power  is able to emit great rays and manifest great miraculous power that are superior This is why the Buddha enters into the Samādhirājasamādhi Question All the samādhis have their own nature  how can they all be included in this  Answer  When one obtains the Samādhirājasamādhi one obtains all the samādhis  This is why they enter into it  By the power of the Samādhirāja all the samādhis become immense  incalculable and inconceivable  This is why it is said that they are contained in it Question The Buddha possesses the buddhaeye  the wisdomeye and the Dharmaeye  they are better than the divine eye  Why does he use the divine eye to contemplate the universe Answer Because the visual range of the fleshly eye is not great enough The wisdomeye knows the true nature of the dharmas the Dharmaeye sees a given person and discovers by what skillful means and by what teaching that person will fnd the Path the buddhaeye is the direct insight into all dharmas Here it is the divine eye that considers the universe and beings without encountering any obstacles  The wisdomeye the Dharmaeye and the buddhaeye although superior are not meant to see beings If one wishes to see beings there are only two eyes one can use the fleshly eye and the divine eye but since the fleshly eyes range is insufficient and encounters obstacles the Buddha uses the divine eye Question But the divine eye occurs in the Buddhas why is it called divine eye  Answer  Because it often occurs among the gods  The range of the divine eye is not obstructed by mountains  walls or forests  The zealous person  disciplined and concentrated  obtains it by the power of practice  it is not an inborn gift  This is why it is called divyacakaṣus Beings always are afraid of suffering but they always suffer they are like blind people who lose their way and fall into the ditch while seeking the right path After all these considerations the Buddha smiles with his whole body One smiles with ones mouth and sometimes with the eyes  Why does the sūtra say that the Buddha smiles with his whole body  Answer The Buddha who has obtained mastery over the universe can make his whole body like the mouth or the eyes Besides we call smiling the dilatation of all the pores of the skin  when we smile with pleasure all the pores dilate Why does the Buddha who is always so serious smile like this Answer When the great earth trembles  it is not without a reason or for a trivial reason it is the same for the Buddha he does not smile without rhyme or reason He smiles with his whole body for a grave reason What is this grave reason for the Buddha to take these dried grasses that are the  sayings of the Dharma  and to enter with them into the true nature of the dharmas without letting them be burned by the fire of attachment and to pass through this fire safely without stopping That is why the Buddha smiles and it is a result of these difficulties of every kind that the Buddha smiles with his whole body Wheels with a thousand spokes the soles of his feet shoot out six hundred prabhedakoṭi of rays āstra Question Why does he first emit light from his body Answer We have already answered this question by talking about the causes for the smile but we will repeat it here would be frightened and fear to be exposed to them This is why the Buddha emits rays from the soles of his feet Question The six hundred prabhedakoṭi of rays that escape from the soles of his feet up to and including those that come from his cranial protuberance can be counted If they cannot fill the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu how could they then fill the ten directions Answer The rays from the body are a source of light and the secondary currents coming from this source are innumerable and incalculable  Just as the Kie lo kien lo insect  the body of which is minuscule  grows in contact with the wind to the point of being able to devour everything so the Buddhas rays on contact with beings to be converted  grow to be infinite In the same way beams of six hundred prabhedakoṭi of rays are emitted from the ten toes of his feet  from his two ankles  from his two thighs  from his two knees from his two hips  from his spine  from his belly  from his sides from his navel  from the śrīvatsa mark on his chest  from his shoulders   from his arms  from his hands  from his ten fingers  from his neck  from his mouth  from his forty teeth  from his two nostrils  from his two eyes  from his two ears  from his urṇā and from his uṣṇīṣa āstra If the rays that shoot out from the soles of his feet can illuminate the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and the universes of the ten directions why do the other parts of his body also shoot out six hundred prabhedakoṭi of rays Answer I have said above that the rays from the soles of his feet light up the direction of the nadir  but do not fill the other directions this is why the Buddha also emits rays from parts of his body Some say that the feet the support of the entire body are the most important and for this reason the Buddha emits six hundred prabhedakoṭi of rays from the soles of his feet By so doing he shows beings that of his thirtytwo marks  the foremost consists of having his feet wellplanted  but that the other parts of his body have also a miraculous power  On which samādhi on which abhijñā and on which dhyāna does the Buddha depend to emit his rays Answer Among all the samādhis he depends on the Samādhirājasamādhi among the six abhijñās he depends on the abhijñā of miraculous power  among the four dhyānas he depends on the fourth dhyāna The fire of the fourth dhyāna surpasses ordinary fire and all who enter into it emit rays Moreover when he was born when he attained bodhi and when he set in motion the wheel of Dharma  the Buddha emitted immense rays that filled the ten directions Why then would he not emit rays when he preaches the Mahāprajñāpāramitā The jewels of a cakravartin king usually have a brilliance that illuminates the king and his army on all four sides to a distance of one yojanaIt is the same for the Buddha if he did not enter into samādhi he would emit only his usual light  What is that From these rays came a great light that illuminated the trisāhasamahāsāshralokadhātu From the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu it went to illuminate universes in the east as numerous as the sands of the Ganges  And it was the same in the south  in the west and in the north  in the four intermediate directions  at the zenith and at the nadir  And all the beings touched by this light were settled into supreme perfect enlightenment ye ca sattvās tena mahatā raśmyavabhāsena sphutā avabhāsitās te sarve niyatā abhūvan anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau vapor of fire and vapor of water such are the vapor of fire of the sunstone and the vapor of water of the moonstone  Although the nature of fire is to blaze upward the fire in the human body rises descends and penetrates everywhere It is the same for the solar fire and it is in this way that the waters of the earth dry up in the summer months Thus we know that fire does not always rise upward Furthermore by the power of the Buddha these rays penetrate the ten directions like an arrow shot by a bow goes straight to the target Question Why do these rays first light up the east and only after that the south the west and the north Answer Since the sun rises in the east the east is first the Buddha who is in harmony with peoples ideas  lights up the east first Furthermore we will always come up with the same difficulty if he first illuminated the south we would wonder why he did not first illuminate the east the west and the north if he illuminated first the west or the north the difficulty would be the same Question When do the rays disappear Answer The Buddha uses his miraculous power  as long as he maintains it the rays persist when he lets it go the rays disappear The Buddhas rays are like a lamp and his miraculous power is like the oil  as long as the Buddha does not abandon his miraculous power the rays do not disappear The rays shoot out across the region of the east and its universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and the same for the ten directions āstra What is a trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu or trichiliomegachiliocosm Answer The Buddha defined it in the Tsa a han  A thousand suns  a thousand moons  a thousand Jambudvīpas a thousand godanīyas a thousand Uttarakurus a thousand Pūravidehas a thousand Sumerus a thousand Cāturmahārājikas a thousand Trāyastriṃśas a thousand Yāmas a thousand Tuṣitas a thousand Nirmāṇaratis a thousand Paranirmitavaśavartins a thousand Bramalokas a thousand Mahābrahmās all that is called sāhasracūḍikalokadhātu or cūḍika for short A group of a thousand universes of the sāhasracuḍika type is called dvisāhasramadhyamalokadhātu  A group of a thousand universes of the dvisāhasramadhyama type is called trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu  Thus we have the sāhasralokadhātu  then the dvisāhasramadhyama of the seven jewels and caused by their merits padmāni as large as a chariot wheel  Anavatapata king of the nāgas  is a great bodhisattva of the seventh bhūmi At the four corners of the lake there are four from which the water flows out i at the east the Elephants Mouth  ii at the south the Oxs Mouth Nieou teou  vṛiṣabhamukha iii at the west the Horses Mouth  iv at the north the Lions Mouth  a In the east the Elephants Mouth empties into the Heng  Its bed consists of golden sand  b In the south the Oxs Mouth empties into the Sin teou  Its bed also consists of golden sand c In the west the Horses Mouth empties into the Po tcha  Its bed also consists of golden sand d In the north the Lions Mouth empties into the Sseu to  Its bed also consists of golden sand These four rivers all come from the mountain in the north The Gaṅgā comes from the mountain in the north and empties into the eastern ocean  The Sindhu comes from the mountan in the north and empties into the southern ocean  The Vakṣu comes from the mountain in the north and empties into the western ocean  The Ganges is the most important of these four rivers people come there from the four directions of space and consider it to be a sacred river the sins  stains and faults of those who bathe there are completely removed Since all people venerate and know this river the sands of the Ganges are taken as comparison Answer No mathematician is capable of knowing the number it is known only by the Buddhas and dharmakāya bodhisattvas who are able to number the atoms that arise and cease in the whole of Jambudvīpa and therefore they can also know the number of grains of sand in the Ganges Thus the Buddha was seated under a tree in a forest near the Jetavana A brahmin approached him and asked How many leaves are there in this forest The Buddha immediately replied There are suchandsuch a number The brahmin wondered how to prove that He went behind a tree tore off a few leaves and went to hide them He came back and asked the Buddha Exactly how many leaves are there in this forest The Buddha answered by subtracting from the original number the number of leaves he had torn off The brahmin recognized and was filled with respect and faith he asked the Buddha to accept him as a monk and later he became an arhat This proves that the Buddha is able to know the number of grains of sand in the Ganges Question What is the number of those who became destined to supreme complete enlightenment in contact with the Buddhas rays If it is enough to be touched by the Buddhas rays to find the Path why does the Buddha who is so benevolent  not always emit his rays so that everyone will find the Path Why should it be necessary to observe morality  samādhi and wisdom in order to finally find the Path Answer Beings find salvation by all sorts of different means Some are saved by concentration  others by morality and preaching  still others because the Buddhas rays touched their body It is like a city with many gates  the entryways are different but the point of arrival is the same Some people whom the Buddhas rays have touched find salvation others who see the rays and whom the rays have touched do not find salvation Then the Bhagavat smiled once more with all the pores of his skin and emitted rays that lit up the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and extended to universes of the ten directions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges ye ca sattvās tayā prabhayā spṛṣṭās te sarve niyatā abhūvan anuttatāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau āstra Above the Buddha smiled with his whole body  why does he smile here with all the pores of his skin  Answer When he smiled with all his body he was smiling with a coarse part  now when he smiles with all his pores he is smiling with a subtle part  Moreover when he smiled with his whole body the rays could be counted now when he smiles with all his pores his rays are innumerable  Finally those who had not been saved by the rays emitted from his body now obtain salvation by encountering the rays emitted from his pores Thus when a tree is shaken to gather the fruit the ripe fruit fall at once but the tree must be shaken again to get the green fruit the net must be cast in order to take fish and if it is not full it must be cast again until the fish are taken As for the reasons for smiling they are the same as above Then by means of his usual light the Bhagavat illumined the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu this brilliance extended to all the universes of the east as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and it was the same in the ten directions All the beings who were touched by this light were destined to supreme complete enlightenment Atha khalu Bhagavān prakṛtiprabhayā trisāhasramahāsāhasraṃ lokadhātum avabhāsayāmāsa First the Buddha smiled with his entire body then he emitted rays from the pores of his skin  why now does he exhibit his usual light to light up the ten directions Answer Some people who have seen the different rays shooting out from the body and the pores of the Buddha believed that this was not the light of the Buddha seeing the great development of the usual light of the Buddha they are filled with joy and recognizing the true light of the Buddha they finally reach anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi Question What is the usual light of the Buddha Answer It is a light one armspan in width surrounding the body of the Buddha on all sides the Bodhisattva possessed it since his birth and it is one of the thirtytwo marks called vyāmaprabhālakṣaṇa Question Why is the usual light of the Buddha one armspan in width and not larger Answer The usual light of the Buddha is immense and lights up the universes of the ten directions The miraculous bodily light of the Buddha hākyamuni is immense it is the width of one armspan a hundred armspans a thousand prabhedakoṭi of armspans and fills up the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and the ten directions However the Buddhas custom is to manifest in the world of the five corruptions  where beings are of middling qualities and knowledge  a brilliance of only one armspan  If he showed a larger brilliance the people today of little merit and weak faculties  would be unable to tolerate the light When a person sees a god his eyes are blinded because the greater the light the more the eye contracts It is to people of keen faculties and eminent merit that the Buddha shows his immense brilliance  Besides there are people who seeing the usual light of the Buddha rejoice and find salvation The king makes a gift of the leftovers from his usual table to his inferiors and the latter receive them rejoicing greatly The Buddha does the same Some people feel no joy in seeing the other many lights of the Buddha but on contemplating his usual light they are destined to anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi Then the Bhagavat put out his broad tongue and covered the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu with it Having lighted it up he began to smile From his tongue there shot out innumerable millions of prabhedakoṭis of rays on each of these rays appeared lotuses of precious jewels with a thousand petals golden in color on these lotuses sat magical Buddhas crosslegged preaching the six virtues beings who heard them were established in supreme complete enlightenment Atha khalu Bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ velāyāṃ jihvendriyaṃ nirṇāmayāmāsa Answer Three times the Buddha shot out rays of light previously that illumined the beings of the ten directions and brought them to deliverance  Now wishing to preach the Mahāprajñāpāramitā which is profound  difficult to sound out  difficult to understand and difficult to believe  he puts out his broad tongue as a test  for the words pronounced by such a big tongue are necessarily true Once having spent the Rains Retreat in the country of Ch po ti  the Buddha started out to travel followed by nanda and was about to enter a village of brahmins  Whoever gives food to the Buddha or listens to his words will be fined five hundred kārṣāpaṇas Hardly had the edict been issued than the Buddha arrived preceding nanda and holding his begging bowl he entered the village to beg for his food All the inhabitants had closed their doors and did not respond the Buddha returned with his bowl empty  At that time there was an old woman in a house in place of lao ch jen read lao niu jen as in the rest of the story who had in her hands a chipped clay dish full of foul broth which she had come out onto her doorstep to throw away A being as marvellous as this ought to eat the food of the gods wanted to make an offering to the Buddha but not having what she would have liked to give she said quite confused to the Buddha I would very much like to make offerings to you but I do not have the means Here is some spoiled food The Buddha can take what he needs Knowing the purity of her mind  her faith and her veneration  the Buddha stretched out his hand and received in his bowl the food which was given to him Then he began to smile and emitted rays of five colors that lighted up heaven and earth and returned to him through his ūrṇā  Joining his palms together añjaliṃ praṇamya and bending his knee  nanda said to the Buddha Bhagavat I would like to hear the reason why you smile The Buddha said to nanda Do you see this old woman who out of a mind of faith  has given me some food nanda replied that he saw her The Buddha continued This old woman who has given food to the Buddha will receive the reward for her merit for fifteen kalpas among gods and humans and will not fall into the bad destinies  Later she will receive a human male body will leave home and practice the Path She will become a pratyekabuddha and will enter nirvāṇawithoutresidue  There was at that moment near the Buddha a brahmin who spoke the following stanza You are of the solar race from a family of Kṣatriyas You are the crown prince of king uddhodana But you are a great liar about this food How could of such foul food have such a great reward Then the Buddha put out his broad tongue and covering his face with it up to his hairline  he said to the brahmin You have read the texts  the person who has such a tongue would he tell lies  The brahmin replied The person whose tongue can cover his nose tells no lies what can be said about the person whose tongue reaches his hairline I fully believe that the Buddha does not lie but I do not understand how such a small gift can assure such a great reward  Then the Buddha said to the brahmin Once I was travelling with some other brahmins and I saw a nyagrodha tree the shade of which covered five hundred chariots without being completely used up What was the size of the seed of that tree  He answered It was a third as big as a mustard seed  The Buddha said Who would believe you when you say that such a big tree could come from such a small seed kas te śraddhāsyati iyatpramāṇasya bījasyāyaṃ mahāvṛkṣo nirvṛtta iti The brahmin asnwered Nevertheless that is so Bhagavat I saw it with my own eyes it is not a lie The Buddha said It is the same for me I see that this old woman who has given alms to the Buddha with faith and pure mind will attain a great fruit of retribution  just like a big tree comes from a tiny seed Besides the Tathāgata is a field of merit filled with marvels The brahmins heart opened and his mind was liberated foolish of me not to believe the Buddha The Buddha preached the Dharma in many ways to him and the brahmin obtained the first fruit of the Path  Then raising his hand he uttered a great shout and addressed the villagers thus The gates of immortality are open to all beings Why do you not enter therein All the brahmins in the village paid the five hundred kārṣāpaṇas and went with the king to the Buddha and paid homage to him The king of the brahmins and his ministers and subjects took refuge in the Buddha and the Dharma All the villagers attained pure faith  It is thus that the Buddha puts out his broad tongue to the unbelievers When it was a matter of people of little faith the Buddhas tongue to covering his face up to his hairline but here it is a matter of the great interests of the Prajñāpāramitā so his long tongue covers the entire trisāhasramahāsāsralokadhātu If it is already extraordinary that all the inhabitants of one village should be able to see the Buddhas tongue is it not still more extraordinary that when he preaches the Prajñāpāramitā all the great assemblies of this region and others should also be able to see it Besides the range of the human eye does not go beyond a certain number of li and you assume here that it extends to an entire trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu The Buddha uses his miraculous power skillfully so that all beings can see his tongue cover the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu If the Buddha did not communicate his miraculous power to them even of the ten bhūmis would not know the Buddhas mind  but if he does communicate his miraculous power the animals themselves know the mind of the Buddha that in one of the following chapters of the Prajñāpāramitā all the people see the assembly of the Buddha A tchou and contemplate it face to face  And when the Buddha had spoken of the various splendors of the universe of Buddha A mi to and when nanda had said to him I would like to see them the Buddha caused the entire assembly to see the splendors of the universe of Buddha Wou leang cheou  seated on a lotus this is why the Buddha who conforms to current usage  also sits crosslegged on a precious lotus to teach the six pāramitās and those who listen to this sermon necessarily reach anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi Question The Buddha ākyamuni creates innumerable thousands of prabhedakoṭi of Buddhas by emanation How can they all preach the Dharma at the same time It is said in the A pi tan  when the apparitional Buddhas speak the master who creates them must be silent when the creating master speaks the apparitional creations must be silent How do these preach the six pāramitās all at the same time What has been said there holds for the creations of the heretics and śrāvakas but the immense power of concentration inherent in the creations of the Buddha is inconceivable  Thus when the Buddha speaks the innumerable thousands of prabhedhakoṭi of apparitional Buddhas speak at the same time as him Moreover the apparitional creations of the tīrthikas and the śrāvakas are unable in their turn to create apparitional creations whereas those of the Buddha Bhagavat can create them in turn Moreover after their death the tīrthikas and śrāvakas cannot make the fictive beings last  whereas the Buddha after his own parinirvāṇa can make the apparitional being persist as if it were no different from the Buddha himself Finally what the Abhidharma says that there cannot be two minds at the same moment holds true also for the Buddha At the moment when the emanated being speaks he is without thought but when the Buddha thinks about his emanationed creations and wants them to speak then they all begin to speak Question The Buddha now wants to preach the Prajñāpāramitā why does he have the emanated Buddha preach the six pāramitās Answer The six pāramitās and the Prajñāpāramitā are identical and not different Without prajñāpāramitā the five pāramitās would not be called pāramitā Without the prajñāpāramitā the virtue of generosity would be classed among the perishable dharmas of the world or would lead to the parinirvāṇa of the arhats and pratyekabuddhas it is when it is joined with prajñāpāramitā that it is called pāramitā and leads to Buddahood This is why the prajñāpāramitā and the six pāramitās are identical and not different There are two kinds of prajñāpāramitā that which is adorned and that which is not adorned It is like a person who takes coral and adorns their body with it and a person who does not have coral and does not adorn themselves with it Or also when the king comes accompanied by his retinue  we say The king is coming when he does not have a retinue he is said to be solitary This is the way it is in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the east and in the ten directions If the Buddha has miraculous power such that innumerable thousands of prabhedakoṭi of fictve Buddhas go in the ten directions to preach the six pāramitās and save the entire world all beings will find salvation and there would be nobody else  Answer i beings plunged in the three bad destinies cannot understand  ii and iii gods and humans who are too young too old or too sick as well as the nonperceptive gods of the formless realm cannot hear or understand  QuestionWhy cannot all those who hear and understand find the Path Answer They do not all find the path Because of their fetters and the obstacles actions  People whose fetters are heavy have a mind obsessed with fetters this is why they do not all find the Path Question Now that the Buddhas of the ten directions and the apparitional Buddhas whom they have delegated preach the six pāramitās why do we who are free of the three obstacles  not hear them Answer Actually beings are living in a bad age and enter into the three obstacles they are living in an epoch after the Buddha The retribution of evil actions consisting of the errors and sins of the world or the obstacle constituted by heavy fetters has plunged beings into an epoch after the Buddha and many people are chained by heavy fetters sometimes their desire is small but their hatred is considerable sometimes their hatred is small but their desire is considerable sometimes their desire is small but their delusion is considerable sometimes their delusion is small but their hatred is considerable As a result of the obstacle consisting of the fetters  people do not hear or do not understand the apparitional Buddhas who are preaching the Dharma and do not see the rays of the Buddha How then would they find the Path Thus when the sun rises  blind people who do not see it claim that the world has no sun or moon  is that the fault of the sun When thunder and lightning shake the earth deaf people do not hear it is that the fault of the sound  Actually the Buddhas of the ten directions are always preaching the Dharma and always delegating the apparitional Buddhas to preach the six pāramitās in universes of the ten directions but those who are affected by the blindness or deafness of evil actions do not hear the sound of the Dharma Therefore they are not all in a position to hear and to see Although the rya has great lovingkindness  he cannot cause everyone to see and hear Then the Bhagavat on the same lionseat entered into the concentration called Lions Play and by the action of his superknowledge shook the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu which trembled in six different ways Atha khalu Bhagavāṃs tasminn eva siṃhāsane niṣaṇṇaḥ siṃhavikrīḍitaṃ nāma samādhiṃ samāpede  Just as the lion who has taken a gazelle plays with it as a master aiśvaryena krīḍati so the Buddha having entered this samādhi can upset the world in every way and thus make it shake in six different ways their minds are softened  he preaches the Dharma to them This is why he shakes the earth in six ways What are the six ways  The east rises up and the west sinks   the west rises up and the east subsides   the south rises up and the north sinks down   the north rises up and the south subsides   the edges rise up and the center sinks anta unnamati madhye vanamati  the center rises and the edges sink  āstra What are these six tremblings of the earth  Answer The trembling of the earth is lesser  medium and greater  In the lesser trembling of the earth there are two movements the east rises and the west sinks or else the south rises and the north sinks or else the edges  In the medium trembling there are four movements in the east in the west in the south and in the north or again in the east the west the edges and the center or again in the south the north the edges and the center In the greater trembling all six movements appear There are all kinds of causes for a greater trembling of the earth Thus the Buddha said to nanda There are eight causes and eight conditions for a great trembling of the earth aṣṭāv ime nanda ketavo ṣṭau pratyayā mahataḥ pṛthivīcalasya etc Moreover some talk about four kinds of trembling of the earth Then there is no more rain the rivers dry up the year is bad for grain the emperor is cruel and the great ministers are evil If the moon enters one of the following six constellations Lieou  Hydrae  Then there is no more rain the rivers dry up the year is bad for grain the emperor is cruel and the great ministers are unjust Then there is no more rain the rivers dry up the year is bad for grain the emperor is cruel and the great ministers are unjust If the moon enters one of the following nine constellations Scorpionis  Virginis  Then peace is plentiful rain favors the growth of the five grains the emperor is kind  the great ministers are virtuous and everyone is peaceful when an individual of quality is born or dies there is a trembling of the local earth this is the small trembling when the Buddha is born reaches Buddhahood and is about to enter nirvāṇa the entire trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu shakes completely this is the great trembling Here the Buddha who wants to gather together all beings causes the earth to tremble in six ways Moreover in the Prajñmapāramitā the Buddha prophecies to the bodhisattvas that they will be Buddhas The Buddha is the great leader of heaven and earth On learning of the accession of the future Buddhas the goddess of the earth is filled with joy  I have found a leader This is why the earth trembles In the same way when the leader of a country sets up a minister  the people congratulate him everyone shouts Hurray and they sing and dance Finally as a result of the merits of the beings of the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu there are rivers trees and all kinds of things on this earth but beings are ignorant of their transitory nature  This is why the Buddha by the power of his merit and his wisdom shakes this universe so that the beings know the futility of it everything will be destroyed and will return to nothingness  The earth became soft and gentle so that all beings rejoiced pṛthivī mṛduka snigdhā sarvasattvasukhajanany abhūt āstra Answer Mind stands in support behind the body  thus when the body is at ease the mind is joyful And so  in the person who has fasted  has a joyful mind on returning to his normal routine At present in the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu beings with various faults have a coarse mind deprived of wholesome stimuli this is why the Buddha shakes the great earth so that soft and gentle minds can develop  Thus when the gods enter the Houan lo yuan garden of the king of the Trāyastriṃśa gods their minds become soft and gentle they are joyous content and no gross minds arise in them When the asuras come with their armies they feel no aggressive attitudes  But it happens that Che ti po na min  at the head of an army of gods enters the Pāruṣyavana and because this garden where the trees flowers and fruits have an unpleasant smell is coarse  the army of gods aggressive thoughts arising in themselves It is the same for the Buddha Since this great earth is coarse and harsh he transforms it softens it and causes all beings to have joyous dispositions Thus when certain magical herbs are burned under peoples noses violent feelings are aroused in them and they fight On the other hand there is a certain magical herb which inspires joy  happiness  respect and harmony in people If a simple magical herb has such power what can be said who makes the ground of the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu soft and gentle In this trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu in the hell realms  in the preta realm the animal realm and the eight difficult conditions were immeditately liberated and reborn among the gods dwelling at the Cāturmahārājika stage to the Paranirmitavaṣavartin stage Divyāvadāna p Because when one enters it ones thoughts become harsh  When the rising sun lights up a lotus pool  the ripe lotuses open at once while the young buds do not similarly when the Buddha emits his rays  beings with ripe merit and sharp knowledge attain liberation at once whereas those who do not have ripe merit or keen knowledge do not The Buddha has great lovingkindness and compassion  he saves everyone alike  without feeling aversion or affection for anyone When a fruit tree is shaken  the ripe fruits fall first the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu is like the fruit tree it is the Buddha who shakes it the ripe fruits that fall are the beings who are saved the green fruits are the beings who are not saved Question Why are the beings who have had this good mind reborn among the gods of the desire realm and not in the form realm or the formless realm  Answer In order to save beings the Buddha leads them to realize the Path  But in the formless realm where have no bodies  it is not possible to preach the Dharma to them in the form realm where all feelings of displeasure are absent it is difficult to find the Path because where the pleasure of dhyāna is plentiful the mind is dulled  Furthermore when the Buddha makes the ground of the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu soft and pliable by shaking the universe by means of hisabhijñā beings full of faith are joyful and consequently are reborn among the gods of the desire realm  formless realm they cannot be reborn in the form realm or the formless realms  Question The five aggregates are transitory  empty and nonsubstantial  then how can one be reborn among the gods or men Who is reborn You say that the five skandhas are transitory empty and nonsubstantial but according to the Prajñāpāramitā the five skandhas are neither eternal nor transitory neither empty nor nonempty neither substantial nor nonsubstantial Like the heretics  you are looking for a real ātman but that is nonexistent  it is only a designation  It exists as a result of diverse causes and conditions  but only nominally and conventionally  Thus when a magician kills himself the spectators see him dead and when a trick resuscitates him the spectators see him alive but his life and his death have only nominal existence and are not real  According to ordinary systems  saṃsāra really does exist but according to the system of the true nature there is no saṃsāra transmigration Furthermore if there were a transmigrating being  there would be transmigration saṃsāra without a saṃsārin there is no saṃsāra Because the Asaṃsārin has destroyed birth by means of his great wisdom Thus some stanzas say Although the Buddha dharmas are empty They are not however reduced to nothingness  Existent but noneternal Actions are not lost Dharmas are like the trunk of a banana tree  All are the result of mind If one knows the nonreality of the dharmas This mind in its turn is empty The person who thinks about emptiness Is not a practitioner of the Path Dharmas do not arise and they do not perish Being momentary  they lose their nature The person who thinks falls into Māras net The person who does not think finds escape  Mental discursiveness is not the Path Nondiscursiveness is the seal of the Dharma  they know where they have come from  they know where they are born and they know by virtue of what previous merit  But when men are reborn they are unaware of these three things It may be so for the gods but it is impossible for humans indeed how could they walk  In the universes of the ten directions universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges the earth shook similarly in six ways The damned  the pretas the animals and the other inhabitants of the eight difficult conditions were at once liberated and reborn among the gods of the six classes If by his great power the Buddha ākyamuni saves the ten directions as a whole why are other Buddhas still needed  Answer  Because beings are infinite in number and do not all ripen at the same time Similarly in order to designate all the fetters  they are spoken of as a whole as the three poisons  It would suffice to say that the blind obtained their sight why specify those blind from birth Answer Because in their previous existences those born blind were great sinners If great sinners can thus recover their sight what about minor sinners Question What grave sin have they committed in their previous lives in order to be blind from birth today Answer They have gouged out or torn out someones eyes or destroyed someones correct view by saying that sin and merit do not exist After death these people fall into hell  then in the form of humans their sins make them blind from birth Moreover stealing lights or lamps from a stūpa of the Buddha arhat arhat or pratyekabuddha ruining the lamps in other fields of merit are also actions of previous lives that cause the loss of sight  But one may lose ones sight during the present lifetime as a result of sickness or because of being beaten  those are actual causes Only the Buddha is able to restore sight to the  eyesicknesses that king Ch na kia lo could not cure first he gives them back their sight then he makes them find the wisdom eye  It is the same for the deaf who recover their hearing Question If there are those who are blind from birth why does the sūtra not speak of those who are deaf from birth Answer Because those who are blind from birth are more numerous than those who are deaf from birth Question What are the causes of deafness Answer  Deafness has of the previous life as cause To reject or transgress the instructions of ones teacher or ones father and to rebel against them is a sin which will result in deafness To cut off or tear out someones ear to ruin a gong  a bell  a conch or a drum of a stūpa of the Buddha of the saṃgha of good men or of any field of merit are also sins which in turn lead to deafness These various actions of a previous lifetime are the causes of deafness in a future lifetime water This is how one loses ones reason and all these individuals are called insane But when they succeed in seeing the Buddha these madmen recover their reason Question vikṣipticittā ekāgracittā bhavanti sma but the insane are also distracted Answer There are people who without being insane are often distracted Attentiveness is like a monkey  when it is not fixed there is distraction Agitated and speedy mind becomes attached to a crowd of objects then one loses ones mental power and is unable to find the Path Question What are the causes of distraction Answer The attenuation of the functioning of good thoughts  the pursuit of evil  these are of distraction Finally they do not enjoy the inner joy coming from the Buddhadharma they seek the occasions of pleasure outwardly and pursue the causes of pleasure this is why they are distracted But when these distracted people come to see the Buddha their attentiveness is fixed Question There are two kinds of madmen  those who are recognized as such and those who by a sad mistake are naked without people considering them to be insane It is said that in southern India there was a Dharma teacher Kao tso  who preached the five precepts In the crowd there were many heretics who had come to listen and the king of the country made some objections If as you say those who provide liquor or who drink liquor were punished with madness among our contemporaries mad people would be more numerous than rational people Now actually mad men are rare and those of healthy mind are numerous This is a profound objection This Kao tso with the shaven head will not be able to answer it for the kings knowledge is sharp  Then the Dharma teacher pointing his finger at the heretics spoke about something else The king understood but the heretics said to him The kings objection was profound he has not answered Ashamed of his ignorance he just raises his finger and talks about something else The king said to the heretics The Dharma teacher Kao tso has answered with his finger and that is all he said nothing in order to spare you By showing you his finger he meant that you are the madmen and that madmen are not rare You coat your bodies with ashes and you have no shame in going about naked you fill human skulls with excrement and you eat it you tear out your hair  you sleep on thorns  you hang yourselves upsidedown and you asphyxiate yourselves you go into the water in winter you roast yourselves in the fire in summer All these practices are not the Path  but signs of madness According to your rules selling meat or selling salt are transgressions of the brahmin law but in your temples you accept oxen as gifts you resell them and you claim to observe your law But the ox is meat Is it not wrong to deceive people thus You claim that by going into the sacred rivers  all the stains of sins are wiped out but there is no reason why such a bath consitutes a sin or a merit What wrong is there in selling meat or salt You claim that a bath in holy rivers can wipe out sins but if it wipes out sins it would also wipe out merits what is there that is holy in these rivers These practices have no basis attempting to justify them is madness All these signs of madness are yours and it is to spare you that the Dharma teacher has shown you his finger and said nothing That is what is called the madness of nudity Moreover some poor people go about without clothes or their clothes are in tatters read lan liu required to eat and drink Others fulfill the causes and conditions required to eat and drink but do not fulfil the causes and conditions required to see a Buddha It is like the black snake that sleeps while clasping the jewel at the top of its head  There are arhats who beg for their food and get nothing Thus at the time of the Buddha Kāśyapa two brothers left home in order to seek the Path  The first observed the precepts  recited the sūtras and practiced dhyāna the second solicited patrons and cultivated meritorious actions  When Buddha ākyamuni appeared in the world the first was born into a merchants household and the second became a great white elephant whose strength conquered the enemies The merchants son left home to practice the Path He became an arhat endowed with the six abhijñās but as a result of his restricted merits he obtained his food with difficulty when he begged One day he entered into a city bowl in hand to beg his food but he could not obtain anything Coming to the stable of the white elephant he saw that the king furnished the latter with everything in abundance He said to the elephant You and I together have committed sins  The elephant was at once remorseful and spent three days without eating Worried its keepers set out to look for the monk and having found him asked What spell have you placed on the kings white elephant that it is sick and does not eat He answered In a previous lifetime this elephant was my younger brother under the Buddha Kaśyapa we left home together to practice the Path I was satisfied to keep the precepts recite sūtras and practice dhyāna but I did not practice generosity  on the other hand my brother limited himself to soliciting patrons and making gifts he did not observe the precepts and did not educate himself Having thus renounced observing the precepts reciting sūtras and practicing dhyāna today he is this elephant but because he was very generous food and amenities come to him in abundance As for myself I was content to practice the Path but I was not generous in making gifts thus today even though I have attained of arhathood I am unsuccessful in getting any food when I beg This explains why causes and conditions vary and why although being born in age of a Buddha one may still be hungry and thirsty Question How did these beings see their bowls filled  Some say that the Buddha by his miraculous power  created food that satisfied them According to others the Buddhas rays on touching their bodies suppressed their hunger and thirst This is like the wishfulfilling jewel  those who think of it have neither hunger nor thirst What then could be said of those who meet the Buddha the sick are cured  There are two kinds of sickness  The Buddha was in the country of Ch po ti  There are five reasons why the Buddha staying in a vihāra would go for a meal  He wishes to enter into samādhi  He wishes to preach the Dharma to the devas  He wishes to visit the monks cells in the course of his walk  He wishes to care for the sick monks  going to give you half of my kingdom as compensation Gaṇḍaka answered I am satisfied O king you are not guilty either But today I have given my body to the Buddha and the saṃgha I will not return with you This is how the crippled who have lost their wholeness recover it when they receive the Buddhas rays This is why says that the crippled recover their wholeness hīnendriyāḥ paripūrṇendriyā bhavanti They are reestablished as soon as they receive the Buddhas rays All beings obtained the mind of equanimity by thinking of one another for ones mother  ones father  ones older brother  ones younger brother  ones older sister  ones younger sister  ones relatives  or ones spiritual friend  They practiced the ten wholesome ways of acting  Pure remaining celibate they were without faults and were full of bliss like that experienced by a bhikṣu in the third dhyāna sarvasukhasamarpitā idṛśaṃ sukhaṃ pratilabhante sma tadyathāpi nāma tṛtyadhyānasamāpannasya bhikṣuḥ They approved of wisdom  keeping the precepts  mastery of the self and nonviolence towards beings  āstra QuestionThese beings had not renounced desire  were not concentrated and did not possess the four limitless ones  how could they attain an evenness of mind  Answer This evenness is not that of concentration it is absence of hostility and malice towards all beings Thanks to this evenness they consider one another with good feelings Concerning this mind of evenness  it is said in a sūtra It is to consider one another with the feelings one would feel for ones father or mother Question Do they consider all beings indiscriminately as their father mother elder brother younger brother older sister or younger sister Answer They consider old people as their father and mother large people as their elder brother small people as their younger brother similarly for elder or younger sister By the power of samācitta everybody is considered as a relative  Question Why call father and mother somebody who is neither father nor mother etc Why call somebody who is not a relative a relative Is that not a falsehood  Answer In the course of innumerable generations all beings have been ones father mother elder brother younger brother elder sister younger sister and relative Furthermore according to the true nature of dharmas there is no father or mother no elder or younger brother but people who are submerged in the error of self believe in their existence and thus there is the question of father and mother elder and younger brother Therefore it is not a lie when by virtue of a wholesome mind  we consider one another for a father or mother Finally there are people who out of interest treat as a father someone who is not their father and as a mother someone who is not their mother It is the same for elder brother younger brother and children There are people who send away their son when he is badly behaved and other families take him in and treat him as their own son Consider another persons wife as a mother Consider the welfare of another like fire Consider all beings as your relatives This is what is called the vision of evenness all beings practice the ten good paths of action daśakuśaladharmapathasevino bhavanti sma Answer Because they are often resorted to they are rightly called paths of action Although the last three may not be actions they can give rise to actions this is why they are called paths of action as a whole  Pure observing chastity they are without fault śucayo brahmcāriṇo nirāmayāḥ Question We have just said that these beings practiced the ten wholsome paths of action and the argument is satisfactory Why add that they are pure and practice chastity Answer There are beings who practice the ten wholsome paths of action and who have not cut through their sensual desire Here we are also praising those who observe the conduct of king Brahmā  Because they have cut through lust says that they are pure chaste and without fault People who practice impurity have an ugly malodorous body This is why we praise those who have cut through their sensual desire by saying that they are without fault  that they were full of bliss  Question What is bliss  Answer This bliss is of two types internal bliss and the bliss of nirvāṇa  This bliss is not the result of the five coarse objects  This mental bliss is like water from a spring that gushes forth spontaneously from the rocks and does not come from the outside By practicing the mind of evenness  by observing chastity  by practicing the ten wholesome paths of action  one is pure and faultless this is what is called internal bliss Question To what realm does this bliss belong Does it belong to the desire realm  the form realm or the formless realm  Answer This bliss both belongs to and does not belong to the desire realm  it does not belong to the form realm or the formless realm The sūtra says that it is like that experienced by a bhikṣu entered into the third dhyāna  If this bliss belonged to the form realm  the sūtra would not have used this comparison  that is why we know that it does not belong to the form realm It is a matter here of a mind of the desire realm that produces a joy filling the entire body it is like a warm joy that floods the body makes it flexible  soft and happy  Those who are without bonds discover the nature of Prajñāpāramitā they see that all dharmas are unborn and unceasing  they acquire real wisdom and their mind is without attachment  The bliss of the signless is the absence of bonds Question The Buddha has said that nirvāṇa is the supreme bliss  why do you speak here about the bliss of the third dhyāna  Answer There are two types of bliss the bliss that involves feeling and the bliss that involves the abandonment of feeling  In the latter the five aggregates are completely eliminated and there is no further rebirth this is the bliss of nirvāṇawithoutresidue  But the bliss of the mind that suppresses displeasure and the afflictions is called pleasant feeling and the fullness of the pleasant feeling occurs in the third dhyāna This is why the bliss which these people experience is compared to that of the third dhyāna Question The first and second dhyānas involve a pleasant feeling as well why does the sūtra speak only of the third dhyāna The lesser bliss is that of the first dhyāna the medium bliss is that of the second dhyāna the greater bliss is that of the third dyāna In the first dhyāna it is twofold the faculty of pleasure and the faculty of satisfaction  namely the faculty of pleasure associated with the five consciousnesses and the faculty of satisfaction associated with the mental consciousness  In the second dhyāna there is the faculty of satisfaction associated with the mental consciousness  In the third dhyāna there is the pleasure associated with the mental consciousness  In all the threefold world  with the exception of the third dhyāna this faculty of pleasure associated with the mental consciousness is absent The five consciousnesses are unable to conceive things they do not know their names or their symbols or their marks  At the moment it is produced the visual consciousness is like a first indication but it is the mental consciousness arising later  This is why the faculty of pleasure associated with the first five consciousnesses is unable to perfect happiness it is the faculty of pleasure associated with the mental consciousness that perfects bliss Consequently if in the third dhyāna the qualities are few in number bliss abounds This is why the sūtra compares the to that experienced by a bhikṣhu in the third dhyāna They approve of wisdom  keeping the precepts  mastery of the self and nonviolence toward others  Question Having spoken of the bliss  why does the sūtra say that they approve of wisdom Those who have not found bliss can still acquire qualities  but when they have found it attachment to bliss dominates and they no longer acquire qualities This is why immediately after this bliss they set their minds to the approval of wisdom Those who approve wisdom keep the precepts master themselves and do no harm to others Question Keeping the precepts is mastering oneself and not harming others why add this useless comment Answer Purity of body and sppech constitutes keeping the precepts setting ones mind on the wholesome is mastering oneself and also not harming others All these qualities are included in the section on morality  the section on concentration and the section on wisdom  Keeping the precepts constitutes the śīlaskandha mastering oneself constitutes the samādhiskandha not harming others lovingkindness in the course of dhyāna and other qualities constitutes the prajñāskanda Question Nobody boasts about hating the precepts Why does the sūtra say that the beings whom it praises here approve the observing of the precepts Answer There are some brahmins attached to worldly things who say Leaving home observing the precepts those are the deeds of a casteless person Dedicating ones life to acquiring wealth and accumulating qualities  that is what is good How can a mendicant who begs for his food and makes no personal effort acquire qualities This is how they criticize those who keep the precepts People should govern the world by law Rewarding good and punishing evil is an inviolable principle There is great profit in never forgetting to pay respect to ones parents establishing laws and helping ones neighbor Why should one be limited to improving oneself mastering oneself without doing anything about putting the disordered world into order or helping those in need This is how they criticize the partisans of selfmastery Finally there are people who criticize the partisans of nonviolence towards beings prāṇibhūteṣv avihiṃsā by saying They do not punish the wicked they do not arrest thieves or chastise rogues they show no severity towards the guilty they are unable to repel an offense or put aside difficulties What is the use of preserving profitless silence This is how they criticize the partisans of nonviolence toward beings They also say Why does a man without energy Come into the world He does not avoid his own difficulties He is like a wooden statue fixed in the ground With evil words like these they criticize nonviolence toward beings But the gods and men all approve of wisdom observation of the precepts mastery of oneself and nonviolence toward beings Practicing these good dharmas peace of body and mind and the fearlessnesses  they are without worry and without anger they have a good reputation they are beloved by people they are going towards entry into nirvāṇa When their life reaches its end and they think about their merits they feel neither sorrow nor remorse If they do not attain nirvāṇa they are reborn in the Buddha universes or in the heavens  This is why the sūtra say that they approve wisdom keeping the precepts selfmastery and nonviolence toward beings Then the Bhagavat seated on the lionseat mastered the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu by his brilliance his color his beauty and his splendor and extended as far as universes of the ten directions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the same way that Sumeru king of the mountains surpasses all the mountains by its brilliance its color its beauty and its splendor Atha khalu Bhagavāṃs tasminn eva siṃhāsane niṣaṇṇaḥ imaṃ trisāhasramahāsāhasraṃ lokadhātum abhibhūya tiṣṭhati  QuestionBy means of what power does he thus dominate all beings with his brilliance beauty and splendor The cakravrtin kings the devas and the āryas also have power brilliance and beauty why speak only of the Buddhas superiority here Answer Although these āryas have brilliance and beauty theirs are limited like the stars that are dimmed and disappear at sunrise  For numberless asaṃkhyeyakalpas the Buddha has accumulated great qualities and all the accumulations  and because his merits are great his retribution also is great This is not the case for other men Moreover from age to age the Buddha has practiced the austerities beyond measure or limit unceasingly he has sacrificed his head his eyes his marrow and a fortiori his kingdom his wealth his wife and his children Having from age to age cultivated all types of morality  patience  energy  dhyāna and acquired incomparable  pure  unchangeable and inexhaustible wisdom  his accumulations were complete By the power of retribution he has obtained an incalculable powerful superiority This is why we have said that when the merits are large the reward also is large Question If the miraculous power of the Buddha is immense if his beauty and grandeur are ineffable  why would he have to undergo the retribution of the nine sins   in Chinese in Tseng yi a han T  k ac Lieou tou tsi king T   k ba tr  Fa kiu pi yu king T  k Buddha therefore underwent the small sufferings of this world If the Buddha has immense miraculous power  if he dominates the trisāshramahāsāhasralokadhātu and universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the ten directions  the east south west and north in the four intermediate directions and in the zenith and the nadir thus by his brilliance  his color  his beauty and his splendor  why does he submit to the retribution for his sins  Answer  Dwelling among men born from human parents the Buddha has so much strength that one of his fingers surpasses the strength of a hundred thousand prabedakoṭi of white elephants  the power of his superknowledges is immense  incalculable and inconceivable  The son of king uddhodana was revulsed by old age  sickness and death  left home and attained Buddhahood Can we say that such a man will undergo the retribution of sins and be tormented by cold  heat  etc If the miraculous power of the Buddha is immense if he possesses such miraculous qualities  how could he suffer from cold heat etc to beg his food got nothing and returned with an empty bowl  he also was sick at the massacre of the ākyas he suffered a headache All the more reason that we lesser people with little merit   Hearing this answer the lay people will not have any further bad feelings and will grant the bhikṣus the fourfold offering caturvidhā pūjā the bhikṣus will then enjoy peace and seated in dhyāna will find the Path It is therefore by skillful means and not in actuality that for wrongdoings Thus it is said in the Pi mo lo ki king  that the Buddha dwelling in the land of Vaiśalī said to nanda  My body feels a little feverish I would like to have some cows milk Take my bowl and go to beg for some milk nanda took the bowl and went to the door of a vaiśya Why are you standing there since morning with a bowl nanda answered The Buddha is a little sick he needs some cows milk That is why I have come here Wait a moment cried Vimalakīrti Dont slander the Tathāgata The Buddha as Bhagavat has gone beyond all bad dharmas  What sickness might he have Take care that the heretics do not hear such rude words they would scorn the Buddha and say This Buddha who is unable to cure hs own illness cannot save beings nanda replied That is not my intention Personally I have received a request from the Buddha and I must get him some milk Vimalakīrti answered In future generations when sick bhikṣus will go to ask the lay people for broths and medicines and the lay people will say to them If our great teacher himself was subject to sickness then why should we not be sick we whose bodies are like the black mustard plant  And so the lay people will offer the bhikṣus broths and medicines and the bhikṣus will enjoy peace and tranquility will practice the Path If heretic ṛṣis can cure the illnesses of other people by medicinal herbs and spells  then why would the Tathāgata who is omniscient be unable to cure his own sickness Then take this milk in your bowl in silence and be careful lest the unbelievers should learn about it This is why we know that the sicknesses of the Buddha are pretenses coming from skillful means and are not real sicknesses it is the same for the sins that are their cause This is why the sūtra says that the Buddha dominates everything by his brilliance his color his berauty and his splendor Then the Bhagavat made his ordinary body appear to all the beings of the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu At that moment the uddhāvāsakāyika Brahmakāyika Paranirmitavaśavartin Nirmāṇarati Tuṣita YāmaTrāyastriṃśa Caturmahārājika gods as well as the manuṣya and the amanuṣya of the trisāhasramāhasāhasralokadhātu bearing heavenly flowers divya puṣpa celestial garlands  heavenly unguents  celestial powders divya cūrṇa celestial lotuses blue  red  white  purple  and leaves of heavenly trees  gathered around the Buddha Atha khalu bhagavān punar eva yādṛk trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātau sattvānām ātmabhāvaṃ prākṛtam upadarśayāmāsa Just as at the end of a kalpa at the time of the great fire the mountains such as Sumeru parvatarāja catch on fire and are successively consumed by the fire so the Buddhas rays fill the entire trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and reach to the universes of the ten directions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges which all were illumined by them The beings who saw these rays attained anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi in the end Therefore to preach the Prajñāpāramitā the Buddha first manfests his miraculous power  If they cultivate the lesser dhyāna they are reborn as Brahmākāyikas if they cultivate the medium dhyāna they are reborn as Brahmapurohitas if they cultivate the higher dhyāna they are reborn as Mahābrahmās It is the same for the development of lovingkindness  Thus the teacher Miao yen said I have preached the Dharma to people and they have all been reborn among the Brahmakāyikas I should not be reborn in the same place as my disciples I am going to develop a higher lovingkindness  because he had developed higher lovingkindness he was reborn among the Mahābrahmās Moreover it is by virtue of a mind of supreme purity that one is reborn among the Mahābrahmās Answer  We speak of the first dhyāna because renunciation  the gate to it is difficult to practice we speak of the fourth because its subtle beauty is difficult to obtain  Nothing is said of the intermediate dhyānas because they are easy to enter The first class starting from the bottom is that of the Caturmahārājikas or the Four Great Kings Mount Sumeru has a height of  yojanas at its summit is the city of the Trāyastriṃṣas Beside Mount Meru is a mountain called Yugandhara  yojanas high it has four peaks on each of which is a city inhabited by a group of Caturmahārājikas The lands of the other gods Yāmas etc made of seven jewels  are situated in space where they are supported by wind and so on up to the Pure Abodes  Seeing the Buddhas body  its purity and its great rays  these gods offer him aquatic and terrestrial flowers  Of all the terrestrial flowers jasmine is the most beautiful of all the aquatic flowers blue lotus is the most beautiful Whether they grow on trees or on reeds these are flowers having different colors and different perfumes Each holding a celestial flower  they gather around the Buddha These flowers have a beautiful color a rich perfume they are soft and flexible this is why they are used as offerings Question What is a celestial flower Answer The celestial flower is one the perfume of which goes against the wind  Celestial garlands remain suspended above the Buddha celestial unguents are spread out on the ground before the Buddha celestial powders are scattered above the Buddha Celestial lotuses are blue  red pink or white  Why are they not yellow  Answer Because yellow is an attribute of fire and fire is foreign to aquatic flowers These precious celestial lotuses have a stem of jade  a corolla of diamond  leaves of golden sand from the Jambū river  They are tender and perfumed Taking also leaves from the celestial tree  they gather around the Buddha Question The gods can get celestial flowers as offerings but how can men and amanuṣhya get them Thanks to the bases of his miraculous power  the Buddha emits great rays and the earth trembles in six ways the gods rain down all sorts of marvellous flowers that fill the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu as offerings to the Buddha Moreover it is customary in India to call celestial anything that is beautiful Even though the flowers of the manuṣya and amanuṣya do not come from the heavens they can nevertheless be described as celestial because of their beauty Thus it is not wrong to say that the manuṣya and the amanuṣya offer celestial flowers They scatter  from celestial flowers to leaves of the celestial tree  over the Buddha Question Why do they scatter these flowers on the Buddha Answer As a sign of respect and as offering  Moreover when the Buddhas rays shine forth and they see the Buddha from afar they feel great joy and want to pay homage to him this is why they scatter flowers on him Answer These flowers that have been scattered were not numerous but nevertheless they form a great belvedere This teaches beings that a small cause has great effects  QuestionHow does this belvedere rest in the air without falling Answer By his miraculous power  the Buddha wishes to show beings that the Buddha is a field of merit  that the reward that he has received is imperishable and that even after having become Buddha his merits are indestructible From this belvedere hang garlands and bouquets of flowers of different colors mixture of the five colors these bouquets and garlands fill the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu tataś Question If the Buddha himself has miraculous power  why is it necessary that the flowers scattered are transformed into a belvedere The noble cakravartin king is the chief of four universes  Brahmādevarāja is the chief of a chiliocosm  the Buddha is the chief of a trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu That is not correct for the creations of the Buddha extend to universes of the ten directions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges The miraulous power of the Buddha is twofold  seated in the same place he preaches the Dharma in such a way that all beings see him from far away and hear from from far away  staying in the same place he preaches the Dharma in such a way that each being in particular sees a Buddha faceing himself preaching the Dharma In the same way at daybreak  the shadows seem to be a mass of water Moreover all beings are not the same some find pure faith by seeing the Buddhas body fill the trisāhasramahāsāsralokadhātu others find pure faith bliss and joy in seeing a particular Buddha preaching the Dharma facetoface this is why the Buddha preaches the Dharma facing each one of them Then seated on the lionseat the Bhagavat smiled with joy and the light of this smile illumined the whole trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu Thanks to this light the beings of the trisāhasramahāsāsralokadhātu saw the Buddhas and the saṃghas in universes of the east as numerous as the sands of the Ganges  the beings of the universes of the east universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges saw the Buddha ākyamuni and his great assembly which were in the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu And it was the same for the south the west and the north the four intermediate directions and the directions of the zenith and the nadir atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasminn eva siṃhāsane niṣaṇṇaḥ punar evasmitam akarot Above when he emitted rays he had a particular reason each time as we have noted But up to now the great assemblies were invisible to one another now by the miraculous power of his rays  the Buddha allows all the great assemblies of these different universes to see one another Question The great arhat the āyusmat A ni lou teou  who was the first of the Buddhas disciples to possess the divine eye  ordinarily saw a chiliomicrocosm and exceptionally a dichiliomesocosm  A great pratyekabuddha normally sees a dichiliomesocosm and exceptionally a trichiliomegacosm How can all beings here see the Buddhauniverses of the east universes as numerous as the sand of the Ganges Answer It is the miraculous power of the Buddha which allows them to see so far it is not due to the power of the beings themselves It is accepted that arhats pratyekabuddhas etc also have an unlimited field of vision by the power of the Buddha Thus when a noble cakravartin king comes flying his entire army with its retinue of elephants and horses follow him in the air Here by the Buddhas miraculous power beings distant as they may be see one another Moreover by the power of the concentration of wisdom  even those who do not have the divine eye see the ten directions The Buddhas eye and ear are free of obstacles  In the same way that all beings attain samādhi the divine eye and the divine ear by themselves at the end of a kalpa at the time of the great conflagration so the Buddha by his miraculous power  causes all beings to have the ability to see at a distance Then the Bhagavat seated on the lionseat smiled with joy We have spoken previously of this smile here we are content to explain what has not yet been explained Question The fact that beings of this place see yonder direction over there is due to the Buddha ākyamunis miraculous power but whose is the power by virtue of which beings of yonder place see this direction here Again it is the Buddha ākyamunis power that allows those beings to see our trisāhasramahāsāshasralokadhātu and to contemplate the Buddha ākyamuni with all his assemblies  It is the same also for the south the west and the north the four intermediate directions and the directions of the zenith and the nadir Then in the east beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and at the limit of these universes there is a universe called To pao where there is a Buddha called Pao tse who is now teaching the Prajñāpāramitā to the bodhisattvamahāsattvas Atha khalu pūrvasyāṃ diśi gaṅgānadīvālukopamān lokadhātūn atikramya tebhyo yaḥ sarvāvasāniko lokadhātū Ratnāvatī nāma tatra Ratnākaro nāma tathāgatas tiṣṭhati sa imām eva prajñāpāramitāṃ bodhisattvānāṃ mahāsattvānāṃ dharmam deśayati āstra Question It has been said by the Buddha that the universes are innumerable and infinite  how can you speak of a universe situated at the limits of the universe sarvāvasāniko lokadhātuḥ To talk in this way is to fall into the of a finite world  If the universes were limited be exhausted Actually each one of the innumerable Buddhas saves an immense and incalculable number of beings and introduces them into nirvāṇa without residue  if there were not always new beings their number would finally be exhausted Answer The Buddhist sūtras do indeed say that the universes are infinite in number but this is a statement of a practical order and not a true doctrine In the same way although the saint chen here translates tathāgata does not exist  in practice we say that the saint exists  To say that the world is finite or to say that the world is infinite are both wrong views  If the universes were infinite  the Buddha would not possess omniscience  for omniscience is a universal wisdom from which nothing can escape if the universes were infinite some things would escape him On the other hand if the universes were finite in number you would run up against the difficulty you raised above  Because by being based on the infinite one destroys the finite The Ratnāvatī universe is not the limit of all the universes but the Buddha ākyamuni abides in the extreme limit so that beings may be saved Similarly when one abides at the boundary of a country one does not claim to be abiding at the boundary of Jambudvīpa If the universes were infinite the Buddha would not be omniscient his wisdom being immense he must know everything for if the letter is big the envelope also must be big Question This universe is called Ratnāvatī Rich in Jewels There are two kinds of jewels the substantial jewel and the dharma jewel  Furthermore the many bodhisattvas are also jewels who illumine the nature of things  Note by Kumārajīva These jewels namely the great bodhisattvas serve as a diadem  in the center of this diadem we see the Buddha and we penetrate the nature of all dharmas As these jewels are numerous the universe in question is called Rich in Jewels  There is a Buddha there called Ratnākara Jewel Mine He is so called because he includes the pure faculties  the powers  the Path of bodhi and the other jewels of the Dharma  Question If that is so all the Buddhas should be called Ratnākara Why reserve the name Ratnākara for this Buddha alone Answer All the Buddhas have these jewels but this Buddha is the only one to take his name from them In the same way Mi l is called Lovingkindness although all the Buddhas have the same lovingkindness  but Maitreya is the only one to have this as his name Furthermore the Buddha Ratnapuṣpa was named Ratnapuṣpakumāra Prince of Precious Flowers because at his birth all the extremities of his body were adorned with various flowers of brilliant colors The Buddha Dīpaṃkara was called Dīpaṃkarakumāra Prince Lighter of Lamps because when he was born all the extremities of his body were like lamps When he became Buddha he was still called Dīpaṃkara It is the same for the Buddha Ratnākara he was called Jewel Mine because when he was born many precious substances appeared whether produced from the earth or whether the gods rained down a whole collection of them Objector Only the Buddha ākyamuni exists the Buddhas of the ten directions do not exist Argument number  The Buddha ākyamuni with his immense power and his immense superknowledges is capable of saving all beings  there is no need of other Buddhas It is said that nanda absorbed with onepointed mind  said to himself The Buddhas of the past Ratnapuṣpa Dīpaṃkara etc were all born in marvelous times their life was very long and they saved all beings Then how could the present Buddha born at a bad time and of short life save all beings These were the questions he asked himself At dawn  the Buddha who knew nandas thoughts entered into the Daybreak samādhi  then he emitted rays from all the pores of his skin  Like the sun he emitted rays the brilliance of which spread successively over Jambudvīpa the four continents  the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and finally over all the innumerable universes of the ten directions  Then the Bhagavat sent forth from his navel a precious lotus described by the following stanzas The stem is of green jade  The petals  a thousand in number are of yellow gold The corolla is of diamond The trimming is of coral  The stem is flexible without the usual curves Its height is ten armspans  Having the color of green jade various glows Its leaves are broad and long White in color striped with marvelous colors Infinitely precious ornament The thousand petalled lotus This marvelous lotus of such beautiful colors Emerges from the Buddhas navel On the four petals of its corolla Precious seats shine with divine light On each of these seats sits a Buddha One would call them four golden mountain summits From the navels of these four Buddhas Comes a magnificent precious lotus On each lotus there is a seat On each seat there is a Buddha From the navels of all these Buddhas Come in turn precious lotuses On each lotus there is a seat On each seat there is a Buddha These successive creations Rise up to the uddhāvāsa heaven Whoever would like to know how far Will have to resort to the following comparison An enormous rock Having the size of a high mountain Thrown from the height of the uddhāvāsa And falling straight down without meeting any obstacle Would take eighteen thousand three hundred And eightythree years To land on the earth That is the number of years it would take In the intermediate space Emanated Buddhas placed in the center Spread out a brilliant light That surpasses the fires of the sun and moon Some Buddhas have bodies streaming with water Others have bodies emitting fire Sometimes they appear to walk Sometimes they are seated in silence Some Buddhas go to beg their food To make a gift of it to beings Sometimes they go to visit the three bad destinies And the hells of water the shadows and fire Their warm breath warms up the cold water Their rays illumine the shadows In the fiery places they breathe out a cooling breeze Skillfully they calm the torments  By all of these skillful means  all at the same time wanted to save the innumerable beings of the ten directions When they had saved them they returned to their starting point and reentered the navel of the Buddha Then the Bhagavat coming out of the Sūryodhayasamādhi asked nanda Did you see the power of my abhjñā during this samādhi nanda relied Yes I saw it and added If it is sufficient for the Buddha to appear for just one day in order that the disciples converted by him fill space  what would not the number of those converted amount to if he remained in the world for eighty years This is why we say that one single Buddha whose qualities and miraculous power are immense suffices to convert the ten directions without the need for other Buddhas Furthermore the Buddha said A woman cannot be a cakravartin king akradevendra or Māradevarāja or Brahmādevarāja Two cakravartin kings cannot reign together at the same place Similarly with regard to the Bhagavat with ten powers there cannot be two Buddhas existing in the same world Argument number  Finally the Buddha said and his words are not frivolous that two Buddhas do not exist at the same time One thing that is difficult to find is a Buddha Bhagavat In  kalpas there have been only three Buddhas Before the good kalpa  during the st kalpa there was a Buddha called Vipaśyin Views of All Kinds during the st kalpa there were two Buddhas the first was called ikhin Fire and the second Viśvabhū Victorious Over All During the good kalpa there were four Buddhas Krakucchanda Kanakamuni Golden Sage Kaśyapa and ākyamuni Except for these kalpas all the others were empty  lacking Buddhas and miserable If the Buddhas of the ten directions existed how could say that the other kalpas lacked buddhas and were miserable Although the Buddha ākyamuni endowed with immense miraculous power  is able to create the apparitional Buddhas established in the ten directions preaching the Dharma emitting rays and saving beings he is however not able to save beings without exception Since the number of beings is inexhaustible  there must be other Buddhas than ākyamuni to work for their salvation Refutation of argument number  The Buddha has said that a female cannot be five things that two cakravartin kings cannot appear in the world simultaneously and likewise that two Buddhas cannot exist in the same world at the same time You do not understand the meaning of this text The Buddhist sūtras have two meanings Some have a meaning that is easy to undestand  others have a profound meaning remote and difficult to grasp  Thus at the moment of entering Nirvāṇa the Buddha said to the bhikṣus Henceforth you must rely on the truth in itself and not on any authority whatever it may be  you must rely on the meaning and not on the letter arthapratisaraṇena bhavitavyaṃ na vyañjanaprtisataṇena you must rely on gnosis and not on discursive knowledge jñānapratisaraṇena bhavitavyaṃ na vijñānaprtisaraṇena you must rely on the sūtras of explicit meaning and not on the sūtras of indeterminate meaning  a Relying on the truth in itself is keeping to the twelve categories of texts  and not keeping to the authority of a person b Relying on the meaning  since goodwill or malice defect or merit falsity or truth cannot be attributed to meaning Suppose a man points his finger at the moon to people who doubt the moons presence if these doubters fixate on the finger but do not look at the moon this man tells them I am pointing to the moon with my finger so that you may notice the moon Why do you fixate on my finger instead of looking at the moon It is the same here the letter is the finger pointing to the meaning  but the letter is not the meaning This is why one should not rely on the letter c Relying on gnosis  Gnosis allows one to appreciate and distinguish between good and evil discursive knowledge is always seeking pleasure and does not penetrate the essence This is why one should not rely on discursive knowledge d Relying on sūtras of explicit meaning  Of all the omniscient ones  the Buddha is foremost among all the texts the Buddhist texts are foremost among all beings  the bhikṣus are foremost Through generosity one acquires great merit  Discipline allows one to be reborn among the gods etc It is evident and easy to understand that generosity involves great merit  that preaching the Dharma  which is not a material gift  is meritorious as this sūtra would have it Nevertheless it is meritorious for the preacher by praising generosity in every way destroys the greed of others and combats his own greed this is why his preaching is meritorious Many sūtras out of skillful means  say things that  Thus a sūtra has said that two Buddhas cannot appear together in the same world but by the same world the sūtra does not mean to designate all the universes of the ten directions The sūtra also says that two cakravartin kings are not found in the world together it does not mean to say that two cakravartin kings cannot coexist in the same trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu it says only that two cakravartin kings cannot coexist in the same cāturdvīpaka  If there were two kings  that would mean that their merit was not pure In the ten directions these trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātus are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and each of them consitutes the universe of a Buddha  only one Buddha is found there never two In one of these Buddha universes the single buddha ākyamuni incessantly creates emanated Buddhas who resort to preaching  to apparitional bodies  to causes and skillful means of all kinds in order to save beings It is in this sense that it is said in many sūtras that two Buddhas cannot exist simultaneously in the same world That does not mean that there are not Buddhas in the ten directions at the same time The corresponding Sanskrit phrase is in the Divyāvadāna p  and Avadānaśataka I p The Buddha has said that it is hard to find a Buddha Bhagavat and you said that in  kalpas only three kalpas had a Buddha and that the other kalpas were empty lacking a Buddha and were miserable The Buddha has in mind those guilty men who have not planted the roots of good needed to see a Buddha when he said The appearance of a Buddha is a rare thing as rare as the appearance of a flower on the udumbara tree  Indeed these sinners cycle through the three bad destinies  sometimes even being reborn among humans or among the gods but when a Buddha appears in the world they are unable to see him It is said that among the  householders in the city of rāvastī  saw the Buddha  heard him speak but did not see him  did not even hear him speak Now the Buddha lived at rāvastī for  years and if some citizens did not see him and some did not hear him speak what can be said of people living far away One day accompanied by nanda the Buddha went to rāvastī on his almsround A poor old woman was standing at the roadside nanda said to the Buddha This woman is worthy of compassion the Buddha should save her The Buddha replied When she sees the Buddha with his major marks and minor marks and his rays  she will experience a joyful mind and will thus fulfill the required conditions Then the Buddha came near the woman but she turned away and showed her back to him The Buddha tried to approach her from four different sides each time she turned her back to him in the same way She looked up in the air but when the Buddha came down to her she lowered her head at once The Buddha rose up from the earth  but she lowered her face with her hands and did not want to look at the Buddha Then the Buddha said to nanda What more can I do Everything is useless there are people who do not fulfill the conditions necessary for being saved and who do not succeed in seeing the Buddha That is why the Buddha has said that it is as difficult to meet a Buddha as a flower on the udumbara tree With the Buddha it is like rainwater  easy to receive in folded hands but which the pretas ever thirsty never get You say that in  kalpas only three times has there been a Buddha This holds for one Buddha universe taken alone but does not hold for all the Buddha universes taken together Similarly the other affirmation which says that the other kalpas were empty without Buddhas and miserable applies only to one Buddha universe alone and not to all the others taken together This is why we affirm the existence of the Buddhas of the ten directions Furthermore the Buddhas of the ten directions do appear in the śrāvaka texts but you do not understand these texts What you know with the wisdomeye The gods cannot understand Whether they be past future or present I bow before all the Buddhas Taking refuge today in the Buddha I also pay homage equally to the Buddhas of the three times In these stanzas it is a question of the Buddhas of the ten directions the asura king bows before the Buddhas of the three times then in particular he takes refuge in the Buddha ākyamuni If the actual Buddhas of the ten directions did not exist he would take refuge only in the Buddha ākyamuni and he would not say anything about the other past  future or present Buddhas This is why we affirm the existence of the Buddhas of the ten directions On the contrary if he mentally denies their existence since these Buddhas actually exist his sin is very grave If then the person should believe in the existence from their own lights why should he not then believe in them when the Buddha in person has proclaimed the existence of these Buddhas in the Mahāyāna Question In the ten directions if there is an immense number of Buddhas and bodhisattvas why do they not come of the beings who at the present time are falling into the three bad destinies  Answer  Because the sins of these beings are too serious Even if the Buddhas and bodhisattvas come  these beings would not see them the Yue tche there he subdued the nāgaking A po lo  then going to the west of the Yue tche kingdom he subdued the rākṣasī stayed in her cave and even until today the Buddhas shadow has remained there those who go inside the cave see nothing but when they come outside they see the rays at a distance Finally the Buddha flew to Ki pin on the mountain of the ṛṣi Li po to  remaining in space he subdued this ṛṣi who said to him I would like to stay here would the Buddha please leave me one of his hairs and one of his fingernails  The ṛṣi then built a stūpa to venerate them which still  Sarvāstivādin Vinaya T  k exists today at the foot of this mountain is the monastery of Li yue to be pronounced Li po to  the nāgas lake ab Divyāvadāna p Therefore it is not because the Buddhas of the ten directions are unseen that one can say that they do not exist By means of the rays by the bases of miraculous power  By all kinds of means the Buddhas save beings He has hard words for the violent who are difficult to convert He has soft words for the gentle who are easy to save Despite his lovingkindness his compassion and his equanimity He knows the favorable time and in his wisdom he uses skillful means This is why although the Buddhas of the ten directions do not come here it cannot be said that they do not exist mounted on a white elephant who with joined palms  paid homage to the bhikṣu I then asked the venerable one why the man with the rays had disappeared at my arrival The bhikṣu answered That is the bodhisattva Pien ki  this bodhisattva has made the following vow Each time someone recites the Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra I will come on a white elephant to teach him  As I was reciting the Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra the bodhisattva Samantabhadra came in person Note by Kumārajīva Pien ki in the Fa houa king is called Pou hien Samantabhadra Finally in a certain country there was a bhikṣu who recited the A mi to fo king and the Mo ho pan jo po lo mi  When he was about to die he said to his students Here comes the Buddha Amitābha with his great saṃgha his body shook he took refuge and died at once After his death his students built a funeralpyre and burned him The next day among the ashes they discovered the bhikṣus tongue which had not burned up Because he had recited the Amitābhabuddhasūtra this bhikṣu had seen the buddha Amitābha come to him because he had recited the Prajñāpāramitā his tongue could not be burned These are facts of the present day and the sūtras tell of many cases of Buddhas and bodhisattvas appearing Thus in many places there are people whose sins  stains and bonds are light they wholeheartedly invoke the Buddha their faith is pure and free of doubt they will necessarily succeed in seeing the Buddha and their efforts will not be in vain For all these reasons we know that the Buddhas of the ten directions really exist At that time in that universe there was a bodhisattva called Pou ming Atha tatra lokadhātau Samantaraśmir nāma bodhisattvaḥ For the meaning of the word bodhisattva see Chapter VIII Because his rays illumine all the universes ceaselessly Seeing this great brilliance this great trembling of the earth and the body of the Buddha he went to the Buddha Ratnākara and said Bhagavat what are the causes and conditions for this great brilliance that lights up the universe for this great trembling of the earth and the appearance of the body of the Buddha mahāntum avabhāsaṃ dṛṣṭvā taṃ ca mahāntaṃ pṛthivīcālaṃ taṃ ca mahāntaṃ pṛthivīcālaṃ taṃ ca bhagavataḥ prākṛtam ātmabhāvaṃ dṛṣṭvā yena bhagavān Ratnākaras tenopasaṃkrāmad upasaṃkramya taṃ tathāgatam etad avocat āstra For the trembling of the earth the body of the Buddha and his brilliance see Act V above Question The bodhisattva Samantaraśmi the most venerable and the foremost of the bodhisattvas should himself know all that Why does he question the Buddha on this subject Answer  Great as he is the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi is incapable of knowing the wisdom and the miraculous power of the Buddha it is like the moon whose light great though it is disappears at daybreak  This is why he asks the Buddha O son of good family in the west beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges is the universe called So po  The Buddha named ākyamuni is there who at this time is preaching the Prajñāpāramitā to the bodhisattvamahāsattvas These by his miraculous power Evam ukte Ratnākaras tathāgataḥ Samantaraśmiṃ bodhisattvam etad avocat Question The Buddha is like Mount Sumeru which cannot be moved by the waves of the great sea why does he reply here to Samantaraśmi That is a mark of agitation  for when the mind is concentrated one does not talk a certain agitation of the mind is necessary to talk Preaching the Dharma comes from an arousal which in itself is a coarse thing  But the Buddha cannot have anything coarse Answer  Deep in samādhi the Buddha is not disturbed by things of the world nevertheless as a result of hs great loving kindness and great compassion  he has compassion for beings and preaches the Dharma for them to destroy their doubts Like Sumeru king of the mountains unshaken by gentle winds but which trembles strongly when the Soueilan winds blow the Buddha at the breath of the wind of his great lovingkindness and great compassion is moved by compassion and constantly enters into the five destinies in order to convert beings to this effect he assumes  from the god realm to the animal realm Like a heavenly musical instrument that emits sounds automatically  like a precious stone that automatically gives people everything they desire in the way of clothing  food or music  the Buddha speaks automatically through all the pores of his body and preaches the Dharma according to the wishes without any action thought or conception on his part Thus it is said in the Mi tsi kin kang king  There are three secrets in the Buddha the body secret  the speech secret and the mind secret  Neither gods nor men can grasp them or understand them The members of a given assembly see the body of the Buddha  his color is yellowgold silverwhite or a mixture of precious colors his size is one armspan and six feet one li ten li a hundred li a thousand li ten thousand li or one hundred thousand li sometimes even it is infinite  immense like space  Secret of the voice They hear the voice of the Buddha at a distance of one li ten a hundred a thousand ten thousand a hundred thousand li or even at an incalculable immense distance like space In a given assembly some hear the Buddha preach on generosity  others on morality  others on exertion  dhyāna or wisdom  And so the twelve classes of sūtra and the  dharmaskandhas are heard according to the wishes of everyone Such is the secret of speech I would like to know the range of the Buddhas voice Then by virtue of his base of miraculous powers  he passed through innumerable thousands of millions of buddhauniverses and then he stopped he still heard the voice of the Buddha as if he were quite close In the universe where he had stopped a Buddha was in the process of dining with his great assembly Thus leaving the pure abodes  the vaiṣya Cheou  came to see the Buddha he had a subtle body he was flexible like a straw he could not stand upright Make a coarse body appropriate to this realm for yourself The vaiśya followed the Buddhas advice and made for himself a body of a size appropriate for the earth Having bowed down to the Buddhas feet he stood to one side The Buddha asked Of how many things have you never wearied in order to have been able to be reborn in the heaven of the pure abodes  He replied I took rebirth in the heaven of the uddāvāsa for never having tired of three things i I never tired of seeing the Buddhas or of paying homage to them ii I never wearied of hearing the Dharma  iii I never tired of serving the community  When the Buddha dwells in Jambudvīpa the four assemblies always follow him listen to his Dharma and question him on the subject In the same way the uddhāvāsa gods always follow me listen to my sermons and question me about them If the śrāvakas do not tire of hearing the Dharma what then could be said of the dharmakāya bodhisattvas  That is why the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi comes to see the Buddha ākyamuni and the bodhisattvamahāsattvas who will accede to the state of Buddhahood bhūyastvena kumārabhūta and who have obtained the dhāraṇis and the samādhis In the chapter devoted to the praise of the bodhisattvas we have said what should be understood by those who have acquired mastery of all the samādhis Question The Buddha is the only one to have obtained mastery of all the samādhis Why do you say here that the bodhisattvas also have obtained mastery of all the samādhis Answer There are two kinds of samādhi those of the Buddha and those of the bodhisattva The bodhisattvas in question have acquired mastery of the bodhisattvas samādhis and not those of the Buddha death I took rebirth among the Avṛha gods Wen chou che li wanted to see the assembly of the Buddhas but did not succeed because the Buddhas were each returning to their starting point Mañjuśrī went to the place where the Buddhas were gathered a woman was seated beside the Buddha deep in samādhi durāsadā ca te bodhisattvā ye tatra Sahāyāṃ lokadhātāv utpannāḥ Question Why does the Buddha say Go now know that the right moment has come Answer It is in order to conform to the usage of the world  Just as the bhikṣus in order to honor the Jewel of the Dharma  do not honor the Dharma which they embody in themselves but honor others Guardians of the Dharma  Knowers of the Dharma and interpreters of the Dharma  so the Buddhas although they have the Dharma in themselves only honor the Dharma of other Buddhas But the Buddha no longer seeks to merit  why does he honor the Dharma Answer The Buddha who has cultivated the qualities for innumerable incalculable periods  continues to practice the good always It is not in view of any reward  but out of respect for the qualities that he venerates the Buddhas Thus in the time of the Buddha there was a blind bhikṣu whose eyes no longer could see One day he was mending his robes and he could not thread his needle  He said I am a man who wants to gain merit I am here to thread your needle Recognizing the voice of the Buddha the bhikṣu got up immediately put away his robes and prostrated at the Buddhas feet saying The Buddha fulfills all the qualities  why does he say that he wants to gain merit The Buddha answered Even though my merits are complete I recognize the deep cause  fruit and power of these qualities If I have obtained the foremost place among all beings it is as a result of these qualities That is why I love them Having praised the qualities the Buddha then preached the Dharma according to his wishes The bhikṣu obtained the purity of the Dharmaeye and his fleshly eyes recovered their sight If I have realized these qualities why should you not be able to acquire them There was an old man of about a hundred years of age dancing in a variety theater He was asked why he continued to dance at his age I have no need myself to dance if I do it it is only to teach dancing to my pupils In the same way in the Buddha the qualities are perfected it is in order to teach his disciples that he continues to practice these qualities and thus to venerate them Question If that is so why does the Buddha not go in person to offer his lotuses on the Buddha ākyamuni but rather he sends someone in his place to venerate him Answer So that the bodhisattvas of the universe may receive Samantaraśmi Moreover the messengers sent by the Buddhas have no fear of water fire soldiers poison or the hundred thousand other dangers Question Why not use precious jewels  profound sūtras  or Buddha or bodhisattva jewels as letter  Note by Kumārajīva These jewels invisible to the gods produce all kinds of precious objects thus the cūḍāmaṇi is called Buddha Jewel He has no need of Buddha jewels or divine jewels or still less human jewels Since he has no need of them does not send them Since the Buddha ākyamuni already has them they are not sent to him And it is the same for the profound sūtras   Furthermore these sūtras would have nothing profound for the Buddha  The epithet profound concerns only ordinary people  That which makes ordinary people hesitant is no obstacle for the Buddha that which is difficult for ordinary people is easy for the Buddha These objects of worship are flowers  perfumes and banners  Question Why not present them instead of throwing them Answer Offering with the hand is a bodily action  speaking in a gentle voice is a vocal action  The action that gives rise to gesture and voice is called mental action  These three actions produce the solid qualities that give rise to Buddahood Question Why does say Be careful the bodhisattvas in the Sahā universe are difficult to reach and difficult to vanquish Answer  The Buddhas pratyekabuddhas arhats and all the āryas are all very mindful  for Māra Māras army  the inner fetters and the multiform retribution of the sins of previous lifetimes are like many brigands of whom one must be careful when they are approached Thus when one goes among the brigands and one is not careful one is captured by them This is why advises Samantaraśi to be very careful while going about in this universe was young One day Upagupta went to her cell to ask her about the behavior of the Buddha when he was visiting He had previously sent a pupil to the bhikṣuṇī and this pupil had announced to the bhikṣuṇī My great teacher Upagupta is coming to see you to ask about the behavior of the Buddha when he was visiting Then the bhikṣuṇī filled a begging bowl with oil and set it under the fan at her door she wanted to test the behavior of Upagupta and his mindfulness When Upagupta entered he pushed the fan at the door and a little bit of oil spilled Tell me what was his manner when he was visiting The bhikṣuṇī replied When I was young I saw the Buddha entering a village one day the crowd shouted There is the Buddha I followed the crowd outside and saw the Buddhas rays  As I bowed before him a gold pin that I had on my head fell to the ground into a thick bush Immediately the Buddha illumined it with his rays and as all the dark corners were visible I found my pin As a result of that I became a nun Upagupta questioned her further And at the time of the Buddha what were the manners and courtesy of the bhikṣus She replied At the time of the Buddha there was a group of six impudent shameless wicked monks  But in regard to their manners they were better than you I have noticed that today Depraved though they were they knew the rules of monastic courtesy Walking standing sitting or lying down they missed nothing Although you are an arhat endowed with the six abhijñās you do not measure up to them on this point Hearing these words Upagupta was very ashamed Be careful Mindfulness is the mark of an honest man The bodhisattvas universe are difficult to vanquish to attain to destroy and to meet Like the great king of the lions  they are difficult to vanquish and destroy like the king of the elephants or the king of the nāgas or like a great fire they are difficult to approach These bodhisattvas actually have the great power of merit and wisdom Those who wish to conquer them and destroy them will not succeed and will risk perishing themselves This is why they are difficult to approach Question Given their great qualities their wisdom and their sharp faculties  all the great bodhisattvas are difficult to approach Answer This is why people of Yu yan lo wei are so happy that among them there are no monks or followers of the precepts  It is the same among the gods In the Sahā universe the causes for happiness are rare there are the three unfortunate destinies  old age sickness death  and the exploitation of the soil is arduous This is why easily feel disgust for this universe at the sight of old age sickness and death their minds are filled with distaste at the sight of poor people  they know that their poverty is a result due to previous existences and their minds feel great distaste Their wisdom and thier keen faculties come from this  By contrast the universe is made out of seven jewels and full of all kinds of precious trees  the bodhisattvas have whatever food they desire at will Under these conditions it is hard for them to feel disgust  this is why their wisdom is not very sharp  If a sharp knife is left in good food the knife becomes rusty because although these foods are good they are not suitable for the knife but if the knife is rubbed with a stone and scoured with grease and ashes the rust disappears It is the same for the bodhisattvas Those born in a mixed universe have sharp knowledge and are hard to approach  on the other hand for those who spare their efforts  suffering has too much power and too much effect To feed a horse and not to ride it is to make it useless is large Or is it the power of the Buddha Ratnākara or that of the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi or that of the Buddha ākyamuni Those whose power is too weak travel by means of the power of the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi Thus when a cakravartin king wants to fly his army  his officers and his stables accompany him in the sky because his qualities are great the cakravartin king can make his whole suite fly along with him It is the same here those whose power is too weak travel by way of the power of the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi They also use the power of the Buddha Ratnākara Finally the rays of the Buddha ākyamuni illumine them If they had no other power the rays of the Buddha ākyamuni would be enough for them to be able to travel What more can be said if they use the other three sources Question Why does the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi not come alone instead of at the head of a numerous troupe Answer Because he needs a suite like a king who is traveling Besides the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi and the Buddha ākyamuni choose among people How is that In the great assembly there are two groups those who fulfill the causes and conditions  go those who do not fulfill the causes and conditions stay Why is this bodhisattva accompanied by householder and monastic bodhisattvas youths and maidens  Answer The Buddhas disciples are of seven categories bhikṣu bhikṣhuṇī śaikṣa śramaṇera śramaṇerī upāsaka and upāsikā The upāsakas and upāsikās are the lay people  the five other categories are monastics  Among the monastics and the lay people there are two kinds the old and the young The young are the youths and maidens  the others are the old Question the old ones should go Why do the young ones go also Answer The person who lacks qualities and practices evil is small despite their great age the person who has the qualities and practices the good is great despite their youth Furthermore these young ones come from far away and those who see them admire the fact that despite their youth they are able to come from so far away to hear the Dharma This also proves that both young and old are capable of acquiring the Buddhadharma which is different from the heretical sects where the brahmins alone are able to follow the rules and those who are not brahmins cannot In the Buddhadharma there is no old or young no insiders and no outsiders  everybody can practice the Dharma In the same way when medicine is given it is the cure to be attained that rules everything whether the sick person is noble or commoner old or young is of no importance  they express their homage  their respects  their esteem and their veneration to the Buddhas of the east Answer These bodhisattvas do not pay homage in the manner of gods or men they carry out the rituals current among bodhisattvas They enter into samādhi and they draw forth innumerable bodies from their own upright body  they create all kinds of objects of worship and fill the Buddha universes with them They are like the nāga king who at the moment of acting raises his body from the water and causes rain to fall over an entire continent  Question These bodhisattvas wish to go to the Buddha ākyamuni Why do they pay homage to all the Buddhas on their way Answer The Buddhas are a supreme field of merit  those who pay homage to them receive a great reward  It is like the man who cultivates his field well and reaps a big harvest of grain The bodhisattvas see the Buddhas and the worship which they pay to these Buddhas brings them the reward of the Buddhas This is why they pay homage to them Furthermore the bodhisattvas always feel a respect towards the Buddhas comparable to that of a son for his parents they have received instructions from them and they have received samādhis dhāraṇīs and miraculous powers of all kinds from them Out of gratitude they pay homage to them Thus in the Fa houa king  the bodhisattva Yo wang who had acquired the samādhi called Faculty of making all forms appear had this thought How am I going to worship the Buddha and the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka At once he entered into samādhi rose up into the sky and by the power of samādhi caused a rain of lotuses made of seven jewels  perfumes  banners and bouquets to pay homage to the Buddha When he came out of samādhi he felt that it was not enough so for twelve hundred years he fed on perfumes and drank perfumed oil  then he clothed himself in divine white garments and burned his own body  He made the following vow  May the rays of my body illumine Buddha universes as numerous as the sands of eighty Ganges  In these Buddha universes as numerous as the sands of eighty Ganges all the Buddhas congratulated him  Good good O son of noble family the offering of the body is the foremost offering Abandoning royalty  abandoning a wife and children  does not equal a thousandth part of it For twelve hundred years the body burned without however becoming consumed tasyātmabhāvasya dīpyato dvādaśavarṣaśatāny atikrāntāny abhūvan na ca praśamaṃ gacchati sma Finally the worship of the Buddhas assures glory  merit and immense benefits  all the bad dharmas disappear and all the roots of good show progress  in the present lifetime as in future lifetimes one is always rewarded for this worship long afterwards one comes to be able to do the Buddhas work Thus the worship of the Buddha assures all kinds of immense benefits This is why the bodhisattvas pay homage to the Buddhas With flowers  incense  garlands  powders  perfumes aromatics and unguents  with robes  flags and banners  he went to the Buddha and having approached him bowed his head to the Buddhas feet and stood to one side  āstra Question It should be said that he saluted the Buddha why is it said that he bowed his head to the Buddhas feet Answer  The head is the noblest part of the human body for it is the seat of the five feelings and is on top  the feet are the lowest part for they tread an impure soil and are below  This is why by saluting the lowest part to the noblest part the homage is doubled  Moreover there are three salutes lower  medium and higher  The lower salute consists of joining the hands  the medium salute of kneeling  and the higher salute of prostrating  homage there is This is why in the Vinaya the newer bhikṣus take the feet of their superior in their two hands and bow their head to them  Question There are four bodily positions  sitting  standing  walking and lying down  Why does the bodhisattva stand to one side  Answer Since he has arrived his repect and his homage  he cannot lie down before him That is very clear have you finished questioning me The sitting position is not very respectful whereas the fact of standing up is a mark of respect and homage  Moreover in the Buddhadharma mendicant heretics and all lay people sit when they come to the Buddha The heretics belonging to a foreign sect sit out of suspicion of the Buddha the lay people sit in their quality of hosts  But the five assemblies attached to the Buddha by body and spirit remain standing near him The arhats in possession of the Path  such as āriputra Maudgalyāyana Subhūti etc have done what needed to be done  this is why they are permitted to sit down  The others although they have obtained the threefold Path are not permitted to sit down because their great work has not yet been completed and their fetters have not yet been cut are like the kings ministers who because of their great qualities have the right to a seat Even though there may be lay people amongst these bodhisattvas they remain standing before the Buddha because they have come from far away to pay homage to him The tathāgata Ratnākara asks you if you have but little anguish and but little suffering  if you are healthy and alert  if you are strong and if you are enjoying your ease  he offers to the bhagavat these golden thousandpetalled lotuses Samanatarśmir bodhisattvo bhagavantaṃ ākyamunim etad avocat āstra The Buddha Ratnākara is omniscient  why does he ask if the Buddha ākyamuni has but little anguish and but little suffering if he is healthy and alert strong and in a joyful state Answer  It is customary for the Buddhas to ask about what they already know It is told in the Vinaya that the bhikṣu Ta eul kia had built a hut of red brick  The Buddha who had seen it and knew about it nevertheless asked nanda It is the son of the potter  the monk called Dhanika He had made a hut of leaves which was destroyed over and over again by the cowherders  he built it three times three times it was destroyed That is why he made this brick house The Buddha said to nanda Destroy this brick house When the Buddha the great teacher lived here the Dharma came from a dirty place Similarly in many other places the Buddha asks about what he already knows Question Why does he not ask him if he has no torment and suffering instead of asking if he has but little torment and little suffering Answer The wise know very well that the body is a source of suffering and that it is never without sickness Why Because the body is an assemblage of the four great elements and the earth  water  fire and wind that compose it are naturally in disharmony and struggle with one another Thus an ulcer is never without pain but it can be improved not cured by a medicinal unguent It is the same for the human body always sick it requires constant care with care it can live deprived of care it dies This is why is a victim of these eternal outer torments which are wind  rain  cold  heat  Moreover there are the four bodily positions  sitting  lying down  walking and standing  which ākyamuni is obliged to take up like everyone else To stay sitting for a long time is a great torment prolonging the other three positions is also painful This is why Ratnākara asks him if he has but little torment and suffering Question It would be enough to ask if he has but little torment and suffering why does he also ask if he is healthy and alert  Answer Although he is convalescing the sick person has not yet recovered his health this is why he asks if he is healthy and alert Question Why ask him if he is strong and enjoying his ease  Answer There are convalescents who can walk sit and rise but whose strength is not sufficient to allow them to fulfill their occupations to work to carry light objects and to lift heavy things this is why he asks if he is strong There are people who although convalescent and able to lift heavy things and carry light things do not however enjoy their ease  this is why he asks if he is enjoying his ease Question If one is well and strong why would one not enjoy ones ease There are poor people  frightened people and sad people who do not enjoy their ease this is why he asks if he is enjoying his ease Moreover there are two ways of asking asking about the physical and asking about the mind  Asking someone if they have but little suffering or torment if they are healthy alert and strong is asking about the physical asking if they are enjoying their ease is asking about the mind All the inner and outer sicknesses are called bodily sicknesses  desire  hatred  envy  avarice  grief  fear  etc In order to ask someone about each of these sufferings we ask them if they have but little torment and little suffering if they are healthy and alert if they are strong and if they are enjoying their ease Question We can ask a man these questions but not a god  and still less a Buddha Answer The body of the Buddha is of two types  the body of emanation  created by the superknowledges   the body born from father and mother  Since the body born from father and mother takes on the conditions of human life it is not like the gods and we can question it according to human customs Question All noble individuals have a detached mind  they do not cherish their body and do not hope for a long life do not fear death and do not hope to be reborn under these conditions what use is it to ask about their health Answer It is in order to conform to worldly customs that borrows the rules of human etiquette to question does also conforms to human etiquette Having taken these golden thousandpetalled lotuses the Buddha ākyamuni then threw them to the Buddhas of universes of the east as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Atha khalu bhagavāñ ākyamunis tathāgatas tāni sahasrapattrāṇi suvarṇanirbhāsāni padmāni gṛhītvā yena te pūrvasyāṃ diśi gaṅagānadīvālukopameṣu lokadhātuṣu buddhā bhagavantas tena prākṣipat āstra Question The Buddha is unsurpassable why does he throw flowers as offering to the Buddhas of the east When the Buddha had found the Path he said to himself Men are not worthy of reverence their capacities are imperfect  Indeed who has the right to veneration in heaven and on earth in the ten directions I who would like a teacher  will follow him Then Brahmā devarāja and the other gods said to the Buddha The Buddha has no superior  noone surpasses the Buddha The Buddha himself also saw with his divine eye that in the three times  in the ten directions  whether in heaven or on earth that noone surpassed the Buddha and he said to himself I shall practice the Mahāprajñāpāramitā now that I have become Buddha that is what I will venerate that is what will be my teacher I must respect honor and serve its Dharma There was a tree called Hao kien  this tree was at the center of the earth and had hundreds of branches and leaves in one day it grew a hundred cubits  When this tree was fully grown it sought out big tree to take shelter under it There was at that time in the forest a deity who said to the Hao kien tree There is no tree in the world bigger than you all the trees should take shelter in your shadow It is the same for the Buddha for innumerable incalculable periods  he dwelled in the bodhisattva levels  one day when he was seated under the tree of enlightenment on the diamond throne  he discovered the true nature of all dharmas and attained the state of Buddha Then he said Who is the venerable individual who can serve me as teacher I wish to honor him respect him and serve him Then Brahmā devarāja and the other devas said to the Buddha The Buddha has no superior  nothing surpasses the Buddha Question  why does he want to worship the Buddhas of the east Answer  The Buddha is without superior  in the three times  the ten directions  in heaven and on earth noone surpasses him nevertheless the Buddha can pay worship  Pūja is higher  medium and lower  Lower pūjā consists of honoring someone who is beneath oneself higher pūjā consists of honoring someone who is above oneself medium pūjā consists of honoring someone who is ones equal When the bhikṣuṇī Ta ngai tao and her five hundred arhatībhikṣuṇīs entered nirvāṇa all at the same time the upasakas in possession of the threefold Paths set up five hundred beds for the bhikṣuṇīs and the Cāturmahārājikas set up a bed for Mahāprajāpatī Buddhas stepmother and nurse  The Buddha himself placed before her body an incenseburner to burn perfumes in her honor Help me to pay homage to the body of my nurse Immediately these arhatbhikṣus each by virtue of his bases of miraculous power  went to Mount Mo li to gather cowshead sandalwood and other aromatics and helped the Buddha build the funeral pyre this was a lower pūjā in this way without looking for any reward the Buddha practices the pūjās When hākyamuni was a bodhisattva of the seventh bhūmi  he saw that all dharmas are empty  nonexistent without birth and cessation  seeing this his mind became detached from all the universes  he wanted to abandon the practice of the six virtues and enter into nirvāṇa He was like a man who in a dream  builds a raft to cross over a big river and who feels sick because his arms are tired in the middle of the stream he wakes up out of his dream and says to himself Why do I imagine there is a river and that I must cross it and at once his worries have disappeared In the same way the Bodhisattva having reached the seventh bhūmi acquired acceptance of the teaching of nonarising  the course of his mind stopped and he wanted to enter into nirvāṇa  the Buddhas of the ten directions emitted rays that illumined the Bodhisattvas body and with their hands caressing his head they said to him O son of good family  do not make that decision remember your previous vow which was to save beings Without any doubt you know emptiness  but beings are not liberated nevertheless You must again gather the qualities necessary ro convert them Do not enter into nirvāṇa You have not yet acquired the goldencolored body or the thirtytwo major marks or the eighty minor marks or the immense rays or the thirtytwo acts producing the marks You have just attained the Dharma relating to nonproduction  Do not rejoice too much Then hearing the encouragement of the Buddhas the Bodhisattva returned to his first decision practiced the six virtues and set himself to save beings Such was the help that he received from the Buddhas when he reached Buddhahood Moreover when the Buddha had attained enlightenment he had this thought This Dharma is very profound  beings are stupid and of little merit Within this single Dharma I will make three parts  and these parts will be the three Vehicles by means of which I will save beings When he had thought thus the Buddhas of the ten directions caused rays to appear and they congratulated him saying Good good When we were in the world of the five poisons we too divided the single Dharma into three parts to save beings Then hearing the voices of the Buddhas of the ten directions the Buddha felt great joy and cried Homage to the Buddhas  This is how the Buddhas of the ten directions rendered him great services by encouraging him and helping him several times and  out of gratitude for all these benefits offers flowers to the Buddhas of the ten directions The highest qualities do not exceed those of these lotuses Because these precious lotus bouquets are the result of the same Buddha qualities these are not ordinary lotuses born on the water Samantaraśmi a dharmakāya bodhisattva dwelling on the tenth bhūmi had brought these lotuses and scattered them on the Buddha ākyamuni The latter knowing that the Buddhas of the ten directions are a supreme field of merit  in turn offers whose value is thus doubled Because it is a Buddha who is offering them to the Buddhas Actually in the Buddhadharma there are four types of gifts   The donor is pure and the recipient impure  The donor is impure and the recipient is pure  Both the donor and the recipient are pure  Both the donor and the recipient are impure Here the gift is made to the Buddhas of the east it is doubly pure both  its merit is very great This is why ākyamuni offers flowers to the Buddhas of the ten directions Question But the noble individuals will receive no reward because they will not be reborn why do you say that the merit of this gift is very great Answer Although there is noone to enjoy this merit it is great in itself if anyone enjoyed it the reward would be infinite  But the noble individuals who renounce entering into nirvāṇa because they know that conditioned dharmas are transitory and empty  also renounce this merit It is like a glowing bubble of molten gold the beauty of which the eye perceives but which cannot be touched because it would burn the hand Those who have an ulcer need an unguent  those who do not have an ulcer do not need a remedy Similarly corporeal beings  ever tormented like an ulcer by hunger  thirst  cold and heat  use clothing coverlets food and a temperate climate which are like the unguent spread on an ulcer If out of love for the remedy they do not use it to get rid of their ulcer they would be stupid  for when one does not have an ulcer the remedy is useless The Buddhas think of the body as an ulcer and because they have rejected this bodyulcer they do not rejoice over the reward  This is why although they have great merits they do not receive the reward  These lotuses thrown filled the Buddha universes of the east as numerous as the sands of the Ganges taiś ca padmair ye pūrvasyāṃ diśi gaṅgḥanadīvālukopamā buddhalokadhātavas te paripūrṇā abhūvan Answer  This is due to the Buddhas abhijñās by virtue of the first eight he can transform the dharmas at will make small that which is big make big that which is small make heavy that which is light make light that which is heavy freely move at will without hindrance shake the great earth realize wishes The great arhats possess all these eight masteries  this is why the Buddha is able to fill the universes of the east that are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges with just a few flowers āstra Here are the stanzas which they spoke True nature and point of arrival Are the same for the Buddha and not otherwise The āryas speak the truth The Buddha also speaks the truth With patience as breastplate his mind is firm With exertion as bow his strength is bent With the sharp arrow of his wisdom He slays his enemies  pride etc He has the right to the complete worship Of gods and men The is why we give to the Buddha The epithet of Arhat Having the Right He knows full well the true nature of suffering He also knows the origin of suffering He knows the true nature of the cessation of suffering He knows also the Path of cessation of suffering Completely understanding the four truths He dwells in equanimity and is immovable This is why in the ten directions He is call Samyak sambuddha He has obtained the three subtle sciences  He is also endowed with pure practices  This is why we call this Bhavgavat Vidyā caraṇa saṃpanna Endowed with the Sciences and Practices Knowing all the dharmas He has followed the marvellous Path At the desired time he preaches skillfully Because he has compassion for all He has destroyed old age sickness and death To arrive at the place of safety  This is why we give to the Buddha The epithet of Sugata WellGone He knows the origin of the world And also knows its cessation This is why we give the Buddha The epithet of Lokavid In regard to samādhi śīla prajñā and saṃpaśyanā He has no equal and still less no superior This is why we give to the Buddha The epithet of Anuttara Without Superior He saves beings with his great compassion He guides them with his good Dharma This is why we give to the Buddha The epithet of Puruṣasamyasārathi With wisdom free from the passions  He preaches supreme deliverance  This is why we give to the Buddha The epithet of āstā devamanuṣyāṇām That which is mobile or immobile in the threefold world Perishable or imperishable He learned under the bodhi tree This is why we call him Buddha In the south  beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and at the extreme limit of these universes tebhyo yaḥ sarvāvasānikaḥ there is the universe called Li yi tsie yeou  its Buddha is named Wou yeou t and its bodhisattva Li yeou  In the west  beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and at the extreme limit of these universes there is a universe called Mie ngo  its Buddha is called Pao chan and its bodhisattva Yi pi  In the north  beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and at the extreme limits of these universes there is the universe called Cheng wang and its bodhisattva T cheng  In the region of the nadir  beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and at the extreme limit of these universes there is the universe called Houa  its Buddha is called Houa t  and its bodhisattva Houa chang  In the region of the zenith  beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and at the extreme limit of these universes there is the universe called Hi  its Buddha is called Hi t and its bodhisattva T hi  In these universes everything occurred just as it did in the east āstra Question Because they are not included in the list of the five aggregates  the twelve bases of consciousness and the eighteen elements  Then why speak here about the Buddhas of the ten directions and the bodhisattvas of the ten directions Answer It is in order to be in harmony with the traditions of conventional language that we speak of directions but regardless of the search their reality cannot be demonstrated Question If the directions are not in your four baskets of the Dharma  they are mentioned in my six baskets of the Dharma Answer If in one single land the sun enters into conjunction with the east that is limited  if it is limited it is not eternal  if it is not eternal it is not univerasl  Then this trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu was transformed into jewels it was strewn with flowers decorated with fabrics banners and bouquets adorned with perfumetrees and flowering arbors Atha khalo ayaṃ trisāhasramahāsāhasro lokadhātū ratnamayaḥ saṃsthito bhūt puṣpābhikīrṇaḥ Answer This transformation is brought about by the immense miraculous power of the Buddha People versed in spells and magic  the asuras the nāgarājas the devas etc are able to transform small objects but noone other  including Brahmā devarāja has the power to transform the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu into precious jewels When the Buddha is in the fourth dhyāna the four minds of metamorphosis adorn the trisāhasaramahāsāhasralokadhātu with its flowers perfumes and trees in all its superiority All beings in perfect agreement turn their minds to the good In order to preach the Prajñāpāramitā and also to honor the bodhisattvas of the ten directions who have come to visit him accompanied by gods and men When the master of a household invites a noble individual he adorns his home if it is the leader of a country he adorns his kingdom if it is a cakravartin king he adorns the four continents  if it is Brahmā devarāja he adorns the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu The Buddha himself adorns his universe for the chiefs of the universes of the ten directions universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges ie for the foreign bodhisattvas and for the gods and men who have come to visit him He also wants people on seeing the fairyland of the metamorphoses that he has produced to produce the great thought of enlightenment  feel pure joy  be inspired by the thought of enlightenment to accomplish the great acts  obtain a great reward from these great acts profit from this great reward by producing the great thought once more and thus successively they succeed in attaining supreme perfect enlightenment  This is why the Buddha adorns this universe and transforms it into jewels What is meant by jewels  Answer There are four types of jewels  Kin  gold  Yin  silver  Pi lieou li  lapislazuli  Po li  crystal when the Dharma will have disappeared all the Buddhas relics will change into cintāmani Similarly at the end of a thousand years water will change into crystal pearls All these jewels are the usual jewels found among mankind but the universes adorned by the Buddha have far more value and cannot be obtained even by the gods Because they come from the great qualities of the Buddha The perfumed trees are  the A kie leou  Agalloche tree with the perfume of honey  the To kie leou  Tabernaemonatana coronaria   the Tchan tan  sandalwood and other species of perfumed trees The flowering trees are  the Tchan pou  Eugenia jambolana tree with white flowers  the A chou kia Jonesia asoka   the Po ho kia lo tree with red flowers and others Because the universe after it has been transformed resembles it In making comparisons  we customarily compare the smallest with the biggest in this way we compare the beauty of a mans face with the full moon  But in the ten directions there are other pure universes such as the Ngan lo of the Buddha A mi to  etc Why take only the Padmāvatī universe as comparison Answer The universe of the Buddha Amitābha is not like the Padmāvatī universe Although the Buddha guided the bikṣu Fa tsi in the ten directions to contemplate the pure universes the qualities and the power of this bhikṣu were weak and he was unable to see the supremely pure universes This is why the universes are not alike Furthermore when the Buddha universe he gives it a resemblance to the Padmāvatī universe This is why it is compared here to the Padmāvatī universe Question There are other great bodhisattvas such as Pi mo lo ki  Kouan che yin  Pien ki  etc Why mention only the bodhisattvas who reside in the universe and be limited to citing the bodhisattvas Wen chou che li and Chan tchou yi  Answer From all the pores of his skin  the bodhisattva Samantabhadra ceaselessly emits buddhauniverses with Buddhas and bodhisattvas who fill the ten directions as he transforms beings he has no fixed residence Dividing and transforming his body the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī penetrates into the five destinies and sometimes acts as a śrāvaka sometimes as a pratyekabuddha and sometimes as a Buddha It is said in the Cheou leng yen san mei king  The bodhisattva Mañjuśrī in the past was the Buddha Long tchong tsouen  for  koṭi of lifetimes he was a pratyekabuddha his previous abodes  But for the bodhisattva Samanatabhadra it is impossible to count describe and know his abodes because if he abides anywhere it is in all the universes  Then the Buddha knew that all the universes with the world of the gods  the world of Brahmā  the śramaṇas and the brāhmaṇas the gods  the gandharvas the asuras etc and the bodhisattvamahāsattvas who are to accede to the state of Buddhahood were all gathered together  Answer Because the Buddha universes are infinite and limitless  If all  they would be limited Besides the ten directions each have their Buddhas who also preach the Prajñāpāramitā Thus in the rd chapter of the Prajñāpāramitā a thousand Buddhas appear in each of the ten directions and they each preach the Prajñāpāramitā Question  why does it mention the world of gods  the world of Māra and the world of Brahmā  It should simply say the world of gods and men Among the ten epithets of the Buddha there is one that calls him Master of Gods and Men  this is why gods and men should be mentioned here Answer The gods who have the divine eye the divine ear  keen faculties and wisdom have flocked together voluntarily This is why the sūtra mentions the world of gods here Question The world of gods already includes the Māras and the Brahmās Why does the sūtra mention the Māras and the Brahmās separately Answer There are three great leaders among the gods is synonymous with the purity of renunciation  by speaking of Brahmaloka here we include all the gods of the form realm as a whole  Furthermore the other gods have no entourage At the beginning of the kalpa when he was born Brahmā devarāja was dwelling alone in the palace of Brahmā without any companion Feeling bored he thought Why should I not give birth to some companions At this moment some bhāsvara gods whose life had come to an end were reborn surrounding him as he had wished King Brahmā then thought These gods previously did not exist they are born according to my wish I am able to engender these gods At the same moment the bhāsvara gods also on their part had this thought We are born from king Brahmā king Brahmā is our father This is why the sūtra limits itself to mentioning the Brahmaloka here Finally the gods of the second third and fourth dhyānas ie the gods higher than the Brahmaloka who are identified with the first dhyāna see the Buddha hear the Dharma or assist the bodhisattvas in the desire realm  whereas visual consciousness  auditory consciousness and tactile exist in the Brahmaloka themselves up to worldly pleasures  this is why the sūtra does not speak of them The brāhmaṇas use wisdom and look for merit those who have left home all seek the Path  this is why the sūtra limits itself to talking about the śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas We call those of pure family up to seven generations and who have taken the precepts at the age of six years brāhmaṇas The qualities of the Path and wisdom are found among the śramaṇas and the brāhmaṇas this is why they are spoken of here Question Why does the sūtra which sometimes speaks of the realm of the gods  again speak of the gods here The realm of the gods designated the heaven of the Cāturmahārājika and akra gods Māra designated the Paranirmitavaśavartin and Brahma gods the form realm  Here the words gods means the gods of the desire realm  namely the Yāmas Tuṣitas Nirmāṇaratis the Ngai chen  etc The Ngai chen reside at the top of the six classes of gods as their shape and color are very fine they are called Ngai chen Admirable Form Question The gandharvas are divine artists who accompany the gods their predispositions are gentle but their merits their qualities and their power are minimal they are lower than the devas and the asuras They are classed in the asura destiny  wheras the nāgarājas dragonkings are classed in the animal destiny  and kiṃnaras habitually reside in two places their usual residence is on the TenJewel Mountain  but sometimes in the heavens they play music for the gods  the people who inhabit the four continents have four different lifespans those who have a very long life can live an incalculable number of years those who have a very short life live only ten yearsThe asuras are malevolent by nature and quarrelsome but they do not break the precepts and cultivate merit They are born in dwellings at the edge of the ocean and also have cities and palaces The asura kings are named Pi mo tche to po li  and Lo heou lo  It is said that once Rāhu asurinda wanted to swallow Yue  At that time an asura named Po tche  seeing the asura Rāhu release the moon quickly and return said the following stanza to him Asura Rāhu Why do you release the moon This Rāhu is tormenting me I would like to ask the Buddha to grant me his protection out of his compassion The Buddha spoke to Rāhu with this stanza The moon is resplendent in illumining the shadows In space it is a great lamp Its color is pure white it has a thousand rays Do not swallow the moon let it go immediately Then Rāhu sweating with fear let go of the moon at once Vemacitra asurinda seeing Rāhu frightened and releasing the moon spoke this stanza O Rāhu why then Do you release the moon in your fear You are sweating drops of sweat like a sick man What is this fear and this anxiety Then Rāhu replied with this stanza The Bhagavat has given me this commnd with a verse If I do not release the moon my head would split into seven pieces As long as I live I would have no rest This is why I release the moon Since has spoken this pure stanza Rāhu has released the moon Tsa a han above L Feer has made a French translation in Extraits p  Question Why does the sūtra not mention the damned  the animals and the pretas The damned  whose minds are distracted by their great suffering are not able to receive the Dharma the animals  who are stupid and of closed mind  are not able to undergo conversion as for the pretas who are burned by the fire of hunger and thirst  they do not succeed in receiving the Dharma Moreover among the animals and the pretas a few come to hear the Dharma they conceive meritorious sentiments but are unable to embrace the Path  This is why the sūtra does not mention them QuestionIf that is so then the sūtra should not speak of the gandharvas or the asuras either The Buddha did not say that why do you claim that they are included in this destiny That is an statement by Kia tchan yen tseu  etc The asuras have a power equal to that of the gods sometimes in their battles they even win over the gods  The gandharvas are the divine artists who enjoy happiness equal to that of the gods they have wisdom and can distinguish the beautiful from the ugly Why could they not receive the Dharma of the Path See for example in the Tsa a han  in the chapter about the gods  the story of the mother of the asura Fou na po seou  In the course of his travels the Buddha spent the night in her home when the Bhagavat was preaching the ambrosia of the holy Dharma her two children daughter and son began to cry You too should find it like me This is why we know that even among the asuras there are some who obtain the Path Furthermore in the Mahāyāna the hero Mi tsi kin kang  prevails over all the bodhisattvas and all the more over all men When Touen louen mo  king of the kiṃnaras and gandharvas came to the Buddha to play the lute and praise the Buddha three thousand universes were shaken even Mahākāśyapa was uncomfortable on his seat How could such individuals be unable to obtain thePath When the asurarājas and the nāgarājas come to the Buddha to question him about the profound Dharma  the Buddha is flexible to their questions and answers their queries on the profound meaning  How can you say that they are unable to obtain the Path Question Of the five destinies  the Buddha teacher of gods and men śāstā devamanuṣyāṇāṃ does not include the three bad destinies  As they have no merit and do not participate in the Path the nāgas all fall into the bad destinies Answer The Buddha never spoke explicitly about the five destinies The five destinies are an invention of the school of the Chou yi tsie yeou but the school of the Po tso fou tou lou accepts the existence of six destinies Moreover there must be six destinies Because the three bad destinies are exclusively places of punishment  But if the merits are many and the sins are rare as is the case for the asuras gandharvas etc the place of birth should be different This is why six destinies must be posited Finally even in the three bad destinies there are beings who obtain the Path but as their merits are rare we say that they do not possess the Path As for the expression bodhisattva before acceding to the state of Buddhahood see what has previously been said  The Prajñāpāramitā is the system of the bodhisattvamahāsattvas Why does the Buddha address himself here to āriputra and not to the bodhisattvas Of all the disciples of the Buddha āriputra is by far the foremost in wisdom prajñā  A stanza of the Buddha says Except for the Buddha Bhagavat the knowledge of all beings would not equal a sixteenth part compared with the wisdom and learning of āriputra Furthermore by his wisdom and his learning  āriputra possessed great qualities  In his youth at the age of eight he recited the eighteen kinds of sacred books and understood the meaning of all the treatises At that time there were two nāgakings at Mo kie to  the first was called Ki li and the second A kie lo  They brought the rain at the proper time and the country did not experience the years of famine The people were grateful to them and regularly in the month of spring  they went in a crowd to the nāgas to hold a great festival  they played music and palavered the whole day regards āriputra as a child prodigy but according to other sources āriputra was much older when he was present at the Giryagrasamāja moreover he was accompanied by his friend Maudgalyāyana  The king mounted on an elephant rang a bell and proclaimed everywhere and in the six great cities of the sixteen great countries  there was nobody who did not congratulate him According to this explanation Giryagrasamāja would mean Festival in honor of the Nāgas Giri and Agra again a false etymology has given rise to a myth In reality Giryagrasamāja giriyagrasamāja in Mahāvastu III p ye dharmā hetuprabhāvāḥ converted to this new faith āriputra went immediately to find his Kolita is also the name of the village where he was born  it was located a halfyojana from Rājagṛha tchou kia che T  k When āriputra heard this stanza he attained the first fruit of the Path  He went back to Maudgalyāyana who noticing the color of his complexion and his cheerfulness asked him Have you found the taste of the Immortal  Share it with me āriputra communicated to him the stanza he had just heard Repeat it again and when he had heard it again he also attained the first fruit of the Path Seven days after he was born the baby boy was wrapped in white cotton to be shown to his father who thought I am called Tiṣya will drive out my name therefore I will call him Yeou po ti ch  he who casts out Tiṣya Such was the name given to this child by his parents But other people considering that it was āri who had given him birth with one accord agreed to call him Ch li fou  the son of āri Later thanks to the previous vows he had made in many successive lifetimes āriputra became foremost of ākyamunis disciples in his wisdom his name was āriputra this name thus came to him from the causes and conditions that consist of his previous vows That is why he is called āriputra Question Why not say Upatiṣya and why limit oneself to saying āriputra Answer  People then highly honored his mother who was the most intelligent of all women and that is why they called this man āriputra The bodhisattva who wants to cognize all dharmas in all aspects must exert himself in practicing the Prajñāpāramitā Sarvākāraṃ āriputra sarvadharmān abhisaṃboddhukāmena bodhisattvattvena mahāsattvena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ yogaḥ karaṇīyaḥ āstra See what has been said above on the bodhisattvamahāsattva in the chapter dedicated to the praise of the bodhisattva  Furthermore the groups of two dharmas include all dharmas These are the dharmas having form and the dharmas without form  the visible dharmas and the invisible dharmas the resistant dharmas and the nonresistant dharmas  the impure dharmas and the pure dharmas the conditioned dharmas and the unconditioned dharmas the dharmas associated with the mind and the dharmas not associated with the mind  the dharmas associated with action and dissociated from action  near dharmas And just as a hero  seeing his enemy is inevitably drawn to destroy him so the wise man who in his prudence has understood his duty well no matter how violent his enemy greed is he is capable of subduing it and will inevitably bend it to his wishes ie the time when it is proper to give when one encounters it and does not give one misses the opportunity and he understands what has to be done and with the right mind  he practices great generosity Finally the man who practices sublime generosity is venerated by people like the newly arisen moon that everyone admires his good renown and fame spread throughout the world he is trusted by everyone The person who practices sublime generosity is esteemed by the noble ones and respected by the lowly when the end of his life approaches his heart has no fear These are the fruits of reward obtained in the present existence  like the flowers and fruits of the trees they innumerable  Likewise in the future existence  the According to others when there is a person endowed with faith  a field of merit and a material object  and when these three things are brought together the mind produces a thought of renunciation capable of destroying avarice  which is called dāna Just as by means of the dharma of lovingkindness  the mind conceives lovingkindness by considering the happiness of others  so by means of the mental event called generosity when the three things come together the mind produces a dharma of renunciation that is able to destroy greed  constitutes the gift properly speaking The merit produced by means of abandoning results from this willingness to give a merit which results from the sole fact of abandoning the merit produced by rejoicing  the merit that results from the enjoyment by the person who receives of the object given  But it is not indispensable and often will be absent eg in the gift given to a caitya where no one is favored by the gift Even if I had to undergo immense sufferings In the three bad destinies or among men I would resolutely seek buddhahood And never depart from this resolve  note and in the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha ed  says Parivrāṭkāmukaśunām ekasyāṃ pramadātanau  kuṇapaḥ kāminī bhakṣya iti tisro vikalpanāḥ  The ascetic the lover and the dog have three different conceptions of the same female body People see delicious pure and clear water they use it to wash to quench their thirst and to bathe in it As for the gods in the sphere of the infinity of space they see only space there for they have no physical sensations Now it is impossible to have so many opposing consciousnesses on one and the same thing if this thing were real The same example is given in Madh  l  the Nyāyavārtitika p Furthermore arising from causes and conditions  the five aggregates are empty and are not ātman made of the seven jewels on each floor was a bed made of the seven jewels cushions of different colors were placed at the two ends of the bed they had banners and flags hung and incense was spread on the ground We would like you to accept this Dharmapalace with its precious trees and its pools The great king accepted by remaining silent then he thought I must not be the first to live in this new palace and devote myself to pleasure I am going to look for holy people  śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas to be the first to enter the ceremonies  only afterwards will I myself live there Then he joined the holy men who were the first to enter into the precious palace filled with offerings of all kinds and splendid accessories  When these men had gone the king entered the precious palace ascended to the floor of gold  sat down on the silver bed and meditating on generosity eliminated the five hindrances  concentrated his six organs  swept away the six sense objects  experienced joy and happiness and entered into the first dhyāna   Then he ascended to the floor of silver  sat down on the golden bed and entered the second dhyāna   Then he ascended to the floor of beryl  sat down on the crystal bed and entered into the third dhyāna  Finally he ascended to the crystal floor  sat down on the beryl bed and entered into the fourth dhyāna  he spent three months in solitary meditation The queen Yu niu pao  and her eightyfour thousand followers who had all adorned their bodies with the White Pearl jewel came to the great king and said For a long time you have been averse to visits from your family and we have come to ask why The king answered Sisters  you should change your feelings and be friends not enemies to me In It is the same for the moral man he has at his disposal marvelous pleasures and there is no wish that he does not realize but if he violates the precepts his pride puffs up he becomes licentious and is like the man who broke his vase and lost all his treasures Moreover the perfume of glory of the moral man here and in the hereafter  extends everywhere in the heavens and among men Moreover the moral man is pleased with generosity and is unsparing of his riches  even though he does not follow after ordinary interests  he lacks nothing he is reborn among the gods in the presence of the Buddhas of the ten directions  he enters the path of the Threefold Vehicle and attains liberation  Many wrong views disappear after taking the precepts Furthermore without going forth from the world  the person who observes the rules of discipline will also be reborn among the gods he will necessarily realize this wish  Even though the moral man has no weapons  wicked people do not attack him Morality is a treasure that cannot be lost it is a parent who does not abandon you even after death it is an adornment that surpasses the seven jewels  This is why morality must be guarded as if one were defending the life of the body or as if one were watching over a precious object The immoral man endures ten thousand sufferings he is like the poor man who broke his vase and lost his wealth This is why pure discipline must be observed Moreover seeing the punishments suffered by the immoral man the moral man must try to observe discipline carefully  What are the punishments of the immoral person An upāsaka who commits murder a bhikṣu who lacks chastity ceases to be an upāsaka or bhikṣu because these faults are directly opposed to their discipline Clearly discipline as it has been described here can be possessed only by people living in the realm of desire For them sins or renunciation of sins induce a subtle change and it is precisely of this transformation that the quality of sinner or of monastic consists   In the Abhidharma it is said that every moral discipline is good  why is it said here that it is neutral  Answer  It is in the Kātyāyanīputra Abhidharma that it is said that it is always good but in the other Abhidharmas it is said that abstention from murder is sometimes good sometimes neutral If abstention from murder is always good the person who abstains from killing would be like a practitioner of the Buddhist path and would never fall into the bad destinies  This is why there can be the case where abstaining from murder is neutral being neutral it does not involve any fruit of retribution and therefore does not lead to rebirth among the gods or men  Question  One does not fall into the hells because the morality of abstention is neutral but rather because there had been in addition the production of an evil mind  Answer  Abstention from murder produces an undefined merit because whether there is action or abstention  a merit always results If one commits a slight error  will be quite limited and quite definite  This is why we know that abstention from murder is sometimes neutral Taking what is not given  knowing that an object belongs to another  forming the intention to steal it  taking the object and leaving the original place saying This object belongs to me that is theft  Not doing that is abstaining from theft The rest viz stratagems  plots  up to the fact of laying hands on some land that is not abandoned are auxiliary to theft  There are two kinds of wealth  that which belongs to another and that which does not belong to another  The fact of taking an object belonging to another constitutes the sin of theft  This is how Kiu kie li  the disciple of Ti po t to  looked for the faults of Ch li fou and Mou kien lien    One day when the summer retreat was over these two men were traveling through the land and were caught in a great rainstorm Having come to the house of a potter  they spent the night there In this house His great tongue has been stretched out and nailed with a hundred spikes five hundred plows are plowing it There are five ways of taking these five precepts which makes five kinds of upāsakas Question  How does one take this discipline of one day Answer  Here is the rule for taking the discipline of one day They also chose one or another of the upavāsa days for the recitation of the Pratimokṣa ba b Kośa IV p The Buddha said to the bhikṣus akradevendra should not have spoken this stanza akradevendra has not expelled the five obstacles nor the three poisons How could he claim that by The śikṣamāṇā pledges to observe the six rules for two years Question  The śrāmaṇera possessor of the ten precepts  is able to directly take the full discipline of the bhikṣu  Why must the śrāmaṇerikā in the career of the bhikṣuṇī go through a stage of śikṣamāṇā in order to take the full discipline  Answer  When the Buddha was in this world the wife of an eminent man  unknowingly pregnant  left the world and took on the full discipline  Subsequently when her pregnancy became noticeable all the nobles blamed this bhikṣuṇī Because of that it was established that for two years women should practice the discipline by taking the six precepts and only after that could they take the full discipline of the bhikṣuṇī He gave all of these to prince Ajātaśatru as a gift But those who understand the passions go forth fearless of whatever may be they have reached the other shore of this world and have attained the destruction of the impurities The ṛṣi Tchan ti was practicing patience and lovingkindness in a great forest One day king Kia ki with his courtesans went into the forest to walk about and amuse themselves His meal being finished the king stopped to sleep The courtesans who were wandering in the flowering forest noticed the ṛṣi and went to pay their respects to him Then the ṛṣi praised lovingkindness and patience to them his words were so fine that the women could not get enough of them and stayed with him for a long time King Kali woke up and not seeing his courtesans seized his sword and follow their footprints When he saw them standing by the ṛṣi his jealousy broke out with furious eyes and brandishing his sword he asked the ṛṣi What are you doing here The ṛṣi replied I am here to cultivate patience and practice lovingkindness The king said I will put you to the proof at once With my sword I will cut off your ears  nose  hands and feet  If you do not The bhikṣus of the kingdom of Kiu chan mi for futile reasons the feelings of anger increased and they were split into two groups An end was attempted but after three months there was no success The Buddha went to their community and raising his right hand marked with the sign of the wheel he stop them saying You others O bhikṣus Do not provoke quarrels  By continuing in bad feelings One exposes oneself to very heavy punishment You are seeking nirvāṇa You have renounced material profit and innocent man in the earth O venerable one I do not approve the violence the king has done to you I beg you to show your indulgence The ṛṣi said to him Moreover the disciples of the Buddha say that cessation not due to knowledge is eternal they also say that uncaused dharmas are eternal whereas dharmas resulting from causes and conditions are transitory In the Mahāyāna permanence  the nature of things  the true nature  the summit of existence and other of this type are called eternal dharmas space and nirvāṇa as was said before in the chapter dedicated to the praise of the Bodhisattva  In regard to the soul time direction and the subtle atom  see also what has been said above above p This is why we cannot speak of the existence of dharmas i permanently nonexistent ii nonexistent following a cessation  If having previously existed they no longer exist now or if presently existing they will not exist later there is cessation If that is so then there is no longer cause or condition  If there is no longer any cause or condition then anything can come from anything or also nothing comes from anything But if causes and conditions for sins and merits being suppressed and if there is no longer any difference between the poor and the rich  Moreover the bodhisattva sees that the beings of the threefold world and the five destinies are each of them deprived of happiness God realm  The gods of the formless realm  who enjoy the absorptions and are attached to them do not understand that when their life is over they will fall back into the desire realm and will take on the form of a bird or animal In the same way the gods of the form realm  having fallen from the pure abodes  will again conceive sensual desire and will abide in the impure spheres Finally the six classes of gods of the desire realm  attached to the five desirable objects will fall into the hells and be subjected to all the sufferings Human realm  In the human destiny  the bodhisattva sees beings who by practicing the ten meritorious actions have obtained a human body The human life involves many sufferings and but little joy when their life is over people often fall into the unfortunate destinies  Animal realm  The bodhisattva sees the animals undergoing all the torments they are made to gallop by blows of the whip or stick they are made to make long journeys carrying burdens their harness is damaged they are branded with hot iron People who in their former lives have trussed them up whipped them or been guilty of crimes of this kind assume the animal form of an elephant  a horse  a cow  a sheep or a deer   If sensual desires  passion and When the bodhisattva is in his first resolution  his qualities are not complete he is then planting the causes and conditions of the threefold merit  When his generosity  morality and good intention have finally been rewarded he uses the latter to give gifts to beings But as beings are not satisfied he cultivates merit on a grander scale and makes a resolution for great compassion  He says Beings have insufficient wealth and many are bad I am incapable of satisfying their desires with my small wealth If their desires are not satisfied they will not willingly accept my teaching if they do not accept my teaching they will not be liberated from birth  old age  sickness and death  Therefore I will use great skillful means to load them with riches until they are satisfied Then the bodhisattva goes to the great sea to look for various treasures he climbs mountains and faces dangers in the search for marvelous medicines he penetrates into deep caves in search of various objects stalactites or precious gems and he gives them to beings Or else he becomes the leader of a caravan and he daringly crosses mountain trails facing robbers lions tigers wolves and madmen In order to make gifts to beings he carefully seeks the most precious materials and he considers nothing too difficult With medicinal herbs and magical spells  he can transform copper into gold by means of these many transformations  he produces all kinds of precious substances and when he is successful things that are not native in the four directions he gives them to beings That is bodily exertion But when he has acquired the five superknowledges  he can transform himself and create exquisite tastes or else he goes to the heavens to gather the food there spontaneously That is mental exertion However the bodhisattva does not take into account either his parents sadness or the punishment reserved for the tigress he wants only to accomplish a gift and gain merit  One breaks the mountain of the fetters  One obtains the power of the six superknowledges  One is able to save innumerable beings A heavy rain can penetrate Question Answer  By eliminating five objects  by avoiding five things namely the five obstacles and by using five practices First Method Eliminating the sensual desires How to eliminate the five objects The five objects of desire should be condemned by saying Beings are always tortured by the five objects of desire and yet they seek them sendlessly Once obtained the five objects of desire develop and progress like fever or magic The five objects of desire are useless like the bone gnawed by a dog they foment quarreling like the meat over which birds are contending they burn a man like the torch carried in the wind they harm a man like treading on a poisonous snake they are futile like profit made in a dream they are as short as a shortterm loan Here the ascetic enters into the pure and the stainless  it is the same for the second third and fourth dhyānas According to the Buddhas definition Having avoided desires and the bad dharmas the bhikṣu enters into the first furnished with examination furnished with judgment coming from detachment which is joy and happiness Dhyānasūtra lc Desires are the five sense objects  colors  etc to which one becomes attached The wicked bad dharmas are the five obstructions  greed  etc By becoming detached from these two categories of which the one is external and the other internal  the first dhyāna is acquired by acquiring the good dharmas and the qualities not previously acquired in the first dhyāna the mind experiences great fear When who has ceaselessly been burned by the fires of desire attains the first dhyāna it is as if he were entering a pool of cold water Or else he is like a poor man who suddenly finds a treasure the ascetic who has meditated and analyzed the disadvantages of kāmadhātu and who sees the importance of the benefits and qualities of the first dhyāna feels great joy  this is why it is called savitarka and savicāra Question Answer  They are two different things the five superknowledges are concerned with kāmaand rūpadhātu The other concentrations are each adapted to its own object the saṃjñāvedayitanirodhasamapatti has no object Immaculate like space Free of speech and designation To see Prajñā in this way Is also to see the Buddha Seeing the Buddha the Prajñā and nirvāṇa According to the rules These three things are identical There is no difference among these realities The Buddha is the father of beings Prajñā is the mother of the Buddha Thus the Prajñā is the grandmother Of all beings The Prajñā is a unique dharma To which the Buddha applies all kinds of names According to the capacities of beings He applies different sounds Ungraspable from any direction Without holding or not holding Escaping from any grasp It is called ungraspable The taking of it when it is ungraspable Is what the grasping of it consists of Parivāra VIII   Tibetan Udānavarga XXVI  ed Beckh p  Chinese Dharmapada  Mahāvastu II p  III p c tr de La Valle Poussin Documents dAbhidharma BEFEO XXX  p Vivādabala you should know That for me and my disciples There is no mistake and no truth What are you searching for here Answer  That is not correct The four great elements present in fire should all be hot for there is no fire without heat If the three great elements earth water and wind that are found in fire were not hot they would not be called fire if they were hot they would lose their own nature and would all be called fire If you say that this heat is not perceived because of its subtlety  we would say that it would be no different from nonexistence It is necessary that a coarse element be perceived in order that one could thereby deduce a subtle element but without coarse element there is no subtle element For these various reasons the specific nature of earth is nonexistent and if the nature of earth does not exist neither does that of the other dharmas Therefore all dharmas have this absence of nature as their identical nature  which depends on it  all speak of the true nature of dharmas in the śrāvaka Piṭaka also it is a matter of the true nature of dharmas Why is it not called Prajñāpāramitā and only in the present sūtra is the true nature of dharmas called Prajñāpāramitā Answer  The worldly books which aim at the pacification of kingdoms the perfecting of families and the pleasures of life are not true Religious heretics  who fall into wrong views and whose minds are perverted are not truthful either As for the śrāvakas although they do have the four truths they believe that the true nature of dharmas consists of impermanence  suffering  emptiness and nonself  Since their wisdom is imperfect and dull  they are unable to help beings or to acquire the qualities of the Buddhas The have a true wisdom but it is not the virtue of wisdom It is said that the Buddha enters into and comes out of concentrations of which āriputra and the other disciples are ignorant even of their names still less of their nature At the time of their first resolution  the arhats and pratyekabuddhas do not have the great vows  do not have great lovingkindness or great compassion  do not seek all the qualities  do not honor all the Buddhas of the three times and the ten directions they do not sincerely seek to understand the true nature of dharmas for they seek only to escape from the suffering of old age  sickness and death  On the other hand from their first resolution the bodhisattvas pronounce the great vow  they have great lovingkindness and great compassion they seek all the qualities and honor all the Buddhas of the three times and the ten directions they have very keen knowledge and seek the true nature of dharmas they expel all kinds of opinions namely opinions regarding pure and impure  emptiness and reality  the self and the nonself  Rejecting these wrong views and theoretical opinions they only see in external things that the true nature is neither pure nor impure neither eternal nor transitory neither happy nor unhappy neither empty nor real neither with nor without self The bodhisattva is not attached to any of these opinions for these are worldly theses  they are not absolute  are neither completely pure Having fond this True nature  the bodhisattvamahāsattva is not disgusted with saṃsāra and not pleased with nirvāṇa The thirtyseven auxiliaries are the ground of true knowledge  The dharmas where mindfulness is focused on the objects of knowledge are called foundations of mindfulness Those that destroy bad dharmas and move in the right path are called right effort  When the concentrated mind stops worrying about things  there is foundations of magical power  When a mind of dull knowledge is acquired there is faculties   When a mind of sharp knowledge is acquired there is powers   By the practice of the path of meditation  there is  of enlightenment  By the practice of the path of seeing  there is  of the path  Question The true nature of such a magical thing is ungraspable  If production duration and destruction have a secondary characteristic there is infinite regression if they do not have a secondary conditioned characteristic they are not conditioned But when the yogin examines the outer body the ātman is not found there either When I examined inwardly  I did not find the ātman and on the outside I did not find it either I wonder if the ātman is not a delusion  Now I must examine internally and externally simultaneously  Examining internal and external are two distinct operations  examining at the same time and simultaneously are conjunct operations But although he examines conjointly or separately the ātman is not found anywhere  the examination is therefore ended  Question  In regard to mindfulness of the body  it might be a matter of the inner  Because the seat of present movement does not exist without a motor activity  If the seat of the present movement could exist without a motor activity then it ought to involve movement but that is not the case Without a present seat of movement there is no motor activity and without motor activity there is no seat of present movment Since this is a case of coexistent conditions  we If each of these six elements were male there would have to be six men for it is impossible that one equals six or that six equals one But in the earth element entering into the composition of the body there is neither male nor female characteristic and it is the same for the other elements water fire wind space and consciousness  If these characteristics do not exist in each of the six elements taken separately neither do they exist in the grouping of these six elements Similarly if six dogs  taken separately cannot give birth to a lion  neither can they do so taken together for that is not their nature Question  Why would there not be male and female Although the individuals are not different the parts of the body themselves differ and there are sexual distinctions Considering the emptiness of dharmas is called śūnyatā When there is no place to grasp characteristics in this emptiness this śūnyatā changes its name and is called ānimitta When there is no place in the presence of this signlessness to experience desire for or rebirth in the threefold world this ānimitta changes its name and is called apraṇihita It is like a city with three gates A single person cannot simultaneously enter by the three gates If he enters it is by going through one single gate Here the true nature of dharmas is the City of nirvāṇa  This City has three gates ūnyatā nimitta and Apraṇihita These four dhyānas are also dominating conditions and constitute dominating conditions All this is fully explained in the Abhidharmavibhāga This bodhisattva knows well that dharmas are empty and without characteristics  but as beings themselves do not know it he resorts to the signs of dhyāna in order to convert them If the emptiness of dharmas truly existed in itself we would not call it emptiness and it would not be necessary to abandon the five objects of enjoyment to obtain dhyāna since existing substantially this emptiness would involve neither abandoning nor acquiring  But the empty nature of dharmas also being nonexistent you cannot raise the objection that you have just brought up by saying How can the bodhisattva produce trance on empty dharmas Question Why speak of them separately here Question So lovingkindness brings the five benefits in question but why did the Buddha say nothing about the benefits brought by compassion joy and equanimity Answer Refer to the above comparison  by speaking of one single thing the Buddha intends the other three This applies here also What the Buddha said about lovingkindness is equally true for compassion joy and equanimity Furthermore lovingkindness is the immeasurable par excellence Lovingkindness is like the king  the other three immeasurables that accompany it are like the people  First the yogin by the mind of lovingkindness  wants beings to find happiness  Seeing that there are some In many places in the Mahāyānasūtras he spoke about the benefits it presents Thus in the Wangming pousa king  he said The bodhisattva practices the thirtytwo kinds of compassion among beings The former increase gradually and change into great compassion  Great compassion is the root of the qualities of all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas it is the mother of Prajñāpāramitā and the grandmother of the Buddhas By means of great compassion the bodhisattva attains Prajñāpāramitā and having acquired Prajñāpāramitā he becomes Buddha He praises great compassion in every way Question  What do these four absorptions consist of in the Mahāyāna Answer  In the Mahāyāna these four formless absorptions are modes of wisdom connected with the true nature of dharmas Question  What is the true nature of dharmas Answer  It is the fact that dharmas are empty of intrinsic nature  Question  We accept that material dharmas composed of and coming from various causes and conditions are empty but why would nonmaterial dharmas be empty Answer  If the coarse substances  seen by the eye and heard by the ear can be accepted as empty then why would nonmaterial invisible nonresistant  experiencing neither suffering nor happiness not be empty Vikṣiptakasaṃjñā The pieces lying on the ground are more or less complete This body when it was not yet torn to pieces  was an object of attachment for people now that it is torn to pieces and scattered  it no longer has its original characteristics and only the pieces are seen a and is represented on the basreliefsat agndhāra Foucher Agb  pl b p  pl However a canonical passage should be noted where the Teacher forbade everyone except himself to measure a pudgala Mā puggalesu pamāṇikā ahuvatthu  yo vā panassa madiso Do not be one of those who measure men for the person who takes the measure of men wounds himself It is I who am able to take the measure of men or someone like me Anguttara III p   V p Like all the lakṣaṇas and anuvyañjanas the anavalokitamūrdhatā is the fruit of immense merit accumulated over innumerable kalpas When he was Bodhisattva the Buddha venerated the teachers the ancient ones the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for innumerable lifetimes he prostrated with the top of his head destroying all pride in himself b k a  p  Endowed with these thirtytwo marks this man will before long leave home  will attain omniscience and will become Buddha This is how the physical qualities of the Buddha should be recollected Moreover the qualities and the physical strength of the body of the Buddha surpasses ten myriads of white gandhahastins this is physical power inherited from his parents His supernatural powers  his qualities and his strength are immense and limitless The body of the Buddha is adorned with the thirtytwo marks and the eighty minor marks  inwardly he has the innumerable attributes and qualities of the Buddhas this is why one does not tire of seeing him Those who see the Buddhas body forget about the five worldly objects of enjoyment and never think of them again Ones happiness is complete on seeing the Buddhas body one never tires of seeing it These are the qualities of the Buddhas body under which one should recollect him  Furthermore in the Buddha maintenance of morality is perfect and complete  From the first production of the mind of Bodhi  he practices morality and accumulates it without measure Endowed with the mind of compassion  he does not seek the fruit of retribution  He does not lean toward the Bodhi of the śrāvakas or of the pratyekabuddhas He maintains discipline from birth to birth only for the purification of his own mind and so as not to harm beings Thus when he obtains the Bodhi of the Buddhas his morality is perfected Recollection of the dharma  The yogin should recollect the Dharma skillfully presented obtaining its retribution in the present lifetime without fear of burning Seeing them coming the dānapati rejoiced went to meet them greeted them and made them sit down When they were seated they resumed their youthful foms These distinguished old men Have recovered their youth There are no skillful words There are no supplications that can free one Thee is no fortified place Where one can hide from it Neither by observing pure morality Nor by exertion can one elude it Death is a pitiless thief When the fruits are ripe it is to be feared that they may fall in the morning in the same way when mortals are born they risk death perpetually When the Buddha entered nirvāṇa nanda and the disciples not yet detached from passion  who had not yet cultivated the eightfold noble Path  wept and lamented the anāgāmins detached from desire were all frightened the arhats whose impurities were destroyed remained impassive and only said Dharmas must have a characteristic so that we may know that they exist Thus if we see smoke and we feel heat  we know there is a fire  Because there are differences between the five sense objects  we know they exist Because beings of various sorts conceive and compute things in different ways we know that there are minds and mental events  But since the ātman has no characteristic we know it does not exist If there were no ātman then who would have this breathing this looking straight ahead or sideways this life this mind this suffering or this happiness this affection or this aversion this will etc Thus we know that there is an ātman moving internally and that the life and mind are properties of the ātman If there were no ātman one would be like an ox without an oxherd  But since there is an ātman it can govern the mind penetrate things without any loss of attentiveness  Duḥkhajñāna and samudayajñāna have as object saṃvṛtijñāna and the impure paracittajñāna ii Saṃvṛtijñāna is associated with ten faculties excluding the faculty of wisdom  i Dharmajñāna anvayajñāna and duḥkhajñāna are associated with the samadhi of emptiness  ii Dharmajñāna anvayajñāna  nirodhajñāna kṣayajñāna and anutpādajñāna are associated with the samādhi of signlessness  iii Dharmajñāna anvayajñāna paracittajñāna duḥkkhajñāna samudayajñāna mārgajñāna kṣayajñāna and anutpādajñāna are associated wih the samadhi of wishlessness  ii Saṃvṛtijñāna is associated with the four intermediate concepts of the same group namely the concept of the repugnant nature of food  the concept of displeasure in respect to the whole world  the concept of death and the concept of impurity  iii Dharmajñāna anutpādajñāna nirodhajñāna kṣayajñāna and anutpādajñāna are associated with the three final concepts of the same group namely the concept of abandonment  the concept of detachment and the concept of cessation  Some say that saṃvṛtijñāna is sometimes associated with the concept of detachment  Dharmajñāna has as object nine knowledges excluding anvayajñāna Saṃvṛtijñāna paracittajñāna kṣayajñāna and anutpādajñāna have as object the ten knowledges Acquisition of the ten knowledges in the darśanaand aśaikṣamārga A Dharmajñāna and anvayajñāna have the sixteen aspects  Paracittajñāna has four aspects Duḥkha samudaya nirodhaand mārgajñāna have each of the four aspects  All of these distinctions are fully explained in the Apitanmen  The Eleven Knowledges According to the Mahāyāna ānataryapathe ṣaṇṇām aikṣasyendriyottāpanāyāṃ vimuktimārge sarāgasya ṣaṇṇāṃ bhāvanā  sarvānantaryamārgapratiṣiddhatvāt apratipakṣatvāt Transl For the śaikṣa in the path of deliverance of perfecting the faculties there is the development of six or seven knowledges in the uninterrupted path development of six knowledges In the path of deliverance during the devopment of the faculties the śaikṣa who still has the defilements develops six knowledges In the bhāvanāmārga C In the Aśaikṣamārga Finally the bodhisattva cuts through all the habitual propensities and obtains supreme perfect enlightenment  Because he has understood and completely fulfilled everything to be known  this is called ājñātāvīndriya faculty of that which has been understood  l  l It marks the beginning of the nonreversible career which will be followed in the last three bhumis Mahāvastu I p   l Although the Buddha says that everyone fears the stick and the rod for beings of the formless realm who have no body Neither does it hold true for the realm of subtle form where there are bodies but no whip or rod In the desire realm  it is not valid for the Buddhas the noble cakravartin kings the Yāma gods and other higher deities who have nothing to fear from a beating It is in reference to those who do have reasons to fear the rod that the Buddha said Everyone fears being beaten by the rod It is the same here when we speak of fulfilling completely  fulfilling them completely is not to seek to realize them or to be attached to them Furthermore as has been said above the bodhisattva does not abandon beings and although he fulfills completely the śrāvaka qualities it is by joining them with the knowledge bearing upon the emptiness of nonexistence  This is why he does not fall into the class of the śrāvakas Answer  When we say that he fulfills completely  we mean that he sees them and knows them completely but without taking on their realization  By seeing and knowing them clearly he fulfills them completely He has obtained the four fearlessnesses  this is why he is called Puruṣasiṃha manlion He has obtained immense profound knowledge  this is why he is called Mahāguṇasāgara great ocean of qualities He skillfully preaches the path of supramundane salvation  this is why he is called Anuttarapuruṣadamyasārathi supreme leader of beings to be converted It is impossible that the Buddhas have defects and errors that the saints seek out heretical teachers that the saints fall into the bad destinies  that the fetters  once destroyed by It is impossible that a bad action retribution aṭṭhānam etaṃ anavakāso yaṃ kāyavacīmanoduccaritassa iṭṭho kanto manāpo vipāko nibbatteyya netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati And if a bad action cannot bring worldly happiness  how then could it bring supramundane happiness  As a result of an action to be experienced in the present lifetime  one undergoes a retribution in the present lifetime as a result of an action to be experienced after having been reborn  one undergoes a retribution after having been reborn ie in the very next lifetime to come as a result of an action to be undergone later  one undergoes a retribution in a later existence  As a result of an impure action one undergoes a retribution of torment as a result of a pure action one undergoes a retribution free of torment As a result of a mixed action one undergoes a mixed retribution If the bad action done by the evil man during the present lifetime has not yet ripened and if a good action done by him during a previous When the fruit of action is in progress it cannot be stopped like the fire at the end of the kalpa  Action distributes beings among the various places where they are to be reborn like the great king of a country distributes administrative posts according to the services rendered When a man dies action covers up his mind like a great mountain extending its shadow over things If a person acts well action procures a fine reward for him if the person acts badly action procures a bad punishment for him like the man who serves a king and is rewarded according to his services The power of knowledge of the various aspirations of beings  The Buddha knows the world with its many various acquired dispositions indeed each being has many dispositions infinite and incalculable dispositions There are two kinds of world  the world as universe and the world of beings  The Buddha knows that beings have such and such acquired dispositions  such and such aspirations and that they come from such and such a place  He knows the beings endowed with good roots or bad roots  those who are able to be converted or incapable of being converted  determinate or indeterminate  destined or not Dictionary which also has karu and skyegbu for wedge Tashi pronounces kiu and Pasang khiu  The pratyekabuddha sees a hundred thousand universes  the Buddhas see innumerable and infinite universes Furthermore in Anilouteou  the foremost of those who possess the divine eye the material derived from the four great elements of the form realm  the matter constituting his divine eye  was only semipure  On the other hand in the Buddha the divine eye material derived from the four great elements is completely pure this is the difference Furthermore it is in the concentrations in which he is dwelling that the śrāvaka obtains the divine eye and it is in the concentrations in which he is dwelling that he can see and this is a matter of concentration with investigation and analysis  of concentration without investigation but with analysis  or of concentration with neither investigation or analysis  On the contrary as soon as he enters into concentration the Buddha if he so wishes is able to see everything Abiding in concentration without investigation or analysis he obtains the divine eye entering into concentration with investigation and analysis or into concentration without investigation but with analysis he can see equally Furthermore when the śrāvaka sees by means of the divine eye and if his mind in concentration enters into another concentration his divine eye disappears This is not the case in the Buddha even if his mind enters into another concentration his divine eye does not disappear By means of this knowledge the Buddha knows the places of birth and death of all beings and since this knowledge is intact and invincible  it is called the ninth power The power of the knowledge of the destruction of the impurities  When the śrāvaka enters the noble path for the first time the moment of entry is distinct from the moment of understanding  In the Buddha it is in a single moment of mind that the entry and the understanding occur He obtains omniscience  destroys all the obstacles and obtains all the attributes of Buddha in a single moment of mind The śrāvakas have two kinds of liberation  i liberation from the passions and ii liberation from the obstacles to the Dharma  The Buddha possesses liberation from all the conflicting emotions and also liberation from all the obstacles to the Dharma Above  the Trait has mentioned the triad of obstacles consisting of the passions  action and retribution   Vibhaṅga p b T  k  propose another triad Wishing to destroy such slander the Buddha himself proclaimed his own true qualities and his four fearlessnesses  saying I alone am omniscient and nobody can truthfully say that I am not cognizant I do not fear that I alone have destroyed all the impurities and their traces and nobody can truthfully say that the Buddha has not destroyed the impurities I do not fear that I have proclaimed the dharmas that create obstacles to the Path to nirvāṇa and nobody can truthfully say that these dharmas do not create obstruction to nirvāṇa The Buddha does not fear that  In the first third and fourth fearlessness it is a matter of knowledge in the second it is a matter of destruction  He guided the minds of the great asuras such as Pimotchetili  Che ti ponamin akra devānām indra Fantienwang  etc and all became his disciples Had he been afraid in the middle of the great assemblies he could not have preached the Dharma Because he had no fear he was able to preach the Dharma in these great assemblies of devas and yakṣas This is why he is said to have no fear  This is why he has no fear  For example Ngantolo  Chopoli  Chkielo  These are the various distinctions to be made between the Wheel of Brahmā and the Wheel of the Dharma Nature and Order of the Fearlessnesses Question  What is the nature of the fearlessnesses  Answer  When the Buddha attained enlightenment he obtained all the attributes of Buddha the powers  the absence of fear  etc Subsequently he obtained the dharmas associated with knowledge free of fear  dharmas called fearlessnesses If one rejected emptiness There would be nothing more to do Eliminate the views of existence and nonexistence And the mind will be exhausted inwardly by itself Answer Question  This is how the śrāvaka system speaks of the ten powers and the four fearlessnesses  How does the Mahāyāna distinguish them in its turn In this example the solid nature of the earth is the artha the thing designated the name earth is the dharma designation to say earth using the voice is the nirukti expression the ease of speaking  the mastery over these three kinds of knowledge is the pratibhāna elocution Penetrating these four things without difficulty constitutes the pratisaṃvid unhindered knowledge The solidity characterizing earth  the moistness characterizing water  the heat characterizing fire  the movement characterizing wind  the intelligent nature of the mind  the impermanent painful and empty nature of the five aggregates of attachment  the nonself nature of all dharmas those are general characteristics and specific characteristics  Distinguishing them in this way is called arthapratisaṃvid unhindered knowledge of the thing The fourth pratisaṃvid is nine knowledges by excluding the knowledge of cessation of suffering   Levels knowledges and types of pratisaṃvid Furthermore the Buddha has no fondness for the practitioners of his doctrine such as āriputra the bodhisattva Maitreya etc he has no aversion either for people of wrong view such as Devadatta or the six heretic masters Pūraṇa etc As the Buddha has formed his mind for innumerable incalculable periods  he is the Jewel among beings and like pure gold he does not undergo variations Furthermore three times during the night and three times during the day the Buddha considers beings with his Buddha eye trī rātres trir divasasya ṣaṭkṛtvo rātriṃdivasena buddhacakṣuṣā lokaṃ vyavalokayati and never allows the time of asking himself who can be converted to pass by Considering beings impartially he has no notion of variety Furthermore the Buddha has praised the good dharmas in many ways and criticized the bad dharmas in many ways However faced with good or with bad his mind shows no increase or decrease  it is only in order to save beings that he makes distinctions Thus he has no notion of variety When the Buddha attained Bodhi it was in the forest of Ngeouleoupin lo alone at the foot of a tree that he became Buddha When he turned the wheel of the Dharma for the first time it was also at Sienjen tchoutchou in the forest of Loulin  Furthermore when the Buddha finished preaching the Dharma he always advised the bhikṣus to practice solitary meditation in the manner of having no regret and as he himself applied the advice that he gave  he entered into concentration Furthermore he disliked homage but when he knew there were beings to be converted  he entered into concentration and created fictive beings to come to save them Furthermore there are beings whose concentrations are rare and whose wisdoms are numerous By giving them the example of his own practice of the dhyānas the Buddha converts them Furthermore there are people who get tired of always seeing the Buddha and the Buddha withdraws a little so that they might aspire to see him again When he entered nirvāṇa it was in the forest of Solo trees under two trees this is why he entered into concentration Furthermore the Buddha always has the mind of solitude  that is why he entered into concentration Furthermore the Buddha avoided crowds and places of unnecessary speech and by contemplating his own treasury of Buddha qualities  he experienced happiness of supreme purity  that is why he entered into concentration   Pṛṣṭhī ma

thus the top of his head is invisible   thus his actions are always generous Furthermore in worldly people  śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas the lovingkindness and compassion are described as lesser whereas in the Buddhas they attain the epithet of great Furthermore great lovingkindness arises in the mind of great men  appears suddenly within the great dharmas which are the ten powers  the four fearlessnesses the four unobstructed knowledges and the eighteen special attributes  it is able to destroy the great sufferings of the three bad destinies  and can bring the three kinds of great happiness i happiness of the gods  ii human happiness  iii the happiness of nirvāṇa  In addition this great lovingkindness is extended to all the beings of the ten directions and three times including insects  Lovingkindness penetrates the marrow of the bones and the mind never renounces it Suppose that the beings of the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu had fallen into the three bad destinies and in their place a single man underwent the sufferings of each of them suppose that after having repaid these sufferings this man took the happiness of the five objects of enjoyment  the happiness of the trances and absorptions  the supreme happiness of this world and distributed them liberally to beings to make up for it Saṃyuktābhidharmasāra T  k c Kośa VI p  VII p A much vaster understanding is required of the bodhisattvas who want to assure the benefit and happiness of all beings  The bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes to obtain the knowledge of the paths must exert himself in the perfection of wisdom the bodhisattvamahāsattva who by means of the knowledge of the paths wishes to fulfill completely the knowledge of the aspect of the paths must exert himself in the perfection of wisdom

scattered etc dharmas All the dharmas are included in these innumerable and incalculable groupings Knowing the said dharmas in an exhaustive and complete way with unhindered wisdom is called omniscience and knowledge of all aspects  Question  All beings seek wisdom  Why is the Buddha the only one to attain sarvajñatā Answer  Since the Buddha is foremost of all beings he is the only one to obtain sarvajñatā Of all beings without legs with two legs with four legs with many legs with a body or without a body conscious unconscious neither conscious nor unconscious etc the Buddha is the foremost of all Just as Mount Sumeru is foremost among the mountains just as fire  of all the four great elements has the power to illuminate and to burn so of all beings the Buddha is foremost Question  Why is the Buddha alone the foremost of beings Answer  As I have just said because he possesses sarvajñatā Out of traces of hatred  after the Buddhas nirvāna when the Dharma was being compiled Mohokiach ordered nanda to confess six duṣkṛta misdeeds then taking him by the Pilingkiapotso was always insulting the deity of the Ganges treating her like a slave  Out of traces of monkey antics Moteoupohotcha sometimes leapt from coatrack to beam from beam to shed and from shed to the tower Out of bovine traces  Kiaofanpoti was always spitting up his food and then swallowing it back again While having destroyed their impurities  saints such as these still have the traces of passion Thus when fire has burned the fuel there remain the ashes and charcoal for the strength of the fire is so weak that it cannot consume them At the end of the kalpa the fire consumes the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu of which nothing remains for the strength of this fire is very great The fire of the Buddhas omniscience is also very great it consumes the passions without leaving any trace   Thus when a brāhman addressed five hundred harmful words to the Buddha in the full assembly the Buddha neither changed color nor feeling And when the same brāhman his mind having been tamed retracted and praised the Buddha with five hundred eulogies the Buddha manifested neither pleasure nor satisfaction   In blame as in praise  his feelings and his color remain unchanged At the death of Souentoli  when evil rumors were spread in regard to the Buddha his mind knew no despondency In the land of Alopi  a cold wind was blowing and there were many thorny broom plants but the Buddha satand lay down there without feeling any discomfort During the summer retreat when he was staying in the heaven in the Houanhiyuan  he was seated on the Kienpoche  soft and pure like the gods silk ribbons but he felt no pleasant sensation   And when the great devarājas on their knees offered him celestial foods  he did not consider them to be exquisite From all these stories  it is evident that when someone wanted to harm him the Buddha remained impassive Just as the gold of the Jāmbhū river does not change when it is beaten melted or broken so the Buddha undergoes criticism derision denigration slander and debates without moving or changing Answer  Previously I said that the power of their knowledge is weak and only like ordinary fire whereas the power of the Buddhas is great and like the fire at the end of the kalpa  The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have accumulated the qualities and the knowledges for a short time one two or three lifetimes The Buddha on the other hand has cultivated the knowledges and practiced the qualities during innumerable incalculable periods  long ago he vaporized the perfume of the good dharmas  this is why he no longer has even a trace of kleśavāsanā Ramachandran Nāgārjunakoṇḍa MASI no Foucher AgbG II p  fig Foucher tude sur liconographie bouddhique de lInde I  pl X The bodhisattva who has entered niyāma does not fall into the evil destinies is not reborn into lowly families does not regress to the level of śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha and does not fall backfrom the summits either Question  What is falling back from the summits  Answer If it was a matter of a bodhisattva attribute the latter would lead to salvation  But in the śrāvaka system they speak only of niyāma and not of niyāma of the śrāvaka This is why by saying samyaktvaniyāma position of salvation Furthermore the śrāvakas do not possess the mind of great lovingkindness and great compassion  Their wisdom not being sharp  they have no feeling of disgust  they especially seek out dharmas and multiply wrong views  doubts and regrets  The bodhisattvamahāsattva however full of lovingkindness and compassion for all seeks especially to free beings from the sufferings of old age  sickness and death  he does not try to imagine or increase futile proliferation  Like the wealthy man who dearly loves his only son when this son gets sick his father looks for only the best remedies capable of curing the sickness he does not seek to distinguish the names of the remedies and as soon as he has found them he mixes them and administers them  The bodhisattva detached from the five objects of enjoyment  possessing the trances  endowed with lovingkindness and compassion  takes the abhijñā in the interest of beings and manifests wondrous and marvelous things so To take an example if the bhikṣu is greedy  he does not receive offerings  but if he has no ulterior motive he lacks for nothing It is the same for the mind  If it imagines and grasps at characteristics  it does not find the truth and not finding the truth it cannot penetrate or know the minds and mental events of all beings On the other hand if it does not grasp at characteristics and does not imagine anything it finds the truth and finding the truth it penetrates and knows the minds and mental events of all beings without encountering any obstacles The bones that a single man leaves during a single kalpa surpasses in height the great mountain Pifeoulo   A note in the Kitan says This is an Indian mountain and as the natives see it constantly it is easy to believe it Thus the man undergoes the sufferings of saṃsāra during innumerable kalpas But the analytical knowledge spoken of here in the Trait does not quite give the dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇa of the Pāli which W  he explains Das Wissen von der Kausalitt wird hier bestimmt als eine Vorstufe des Wissens vom Nirvāṇa There are also three other samādhis i with examination and analysis  ii without examination and with analysis only  iii with neither examination nor analysis  There is also the fivemembered samādhi Here is an example of sympathetic joy Someone is practicing the qualities in question viz generosity morality etc a spectator rejoices in it and congratulates him saying That is good in this impermanent world enveloped in the shadows of ignorance  you are strengthening the great mind and you are planting this merit  QuestionThe qualities and attributes of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are very numerous Answer  All the attributes of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are contained within those six To speak of generosity already presupposes the qualities faith  erudition  etc Because it is necessary to have heard in order to believe and it is necessary to have believed in order to give This generosity is of two types material generosity and generosity of the Dharma  Morality contains three kinds of morality morality of discipline  morality of meditation and pure morality  Concentration contains the concentrations of meditation  absorption and liberation  Wisdom contains the wisdom resulting from hearing  the wisdom resulting from reflecting and the wisdom resulting from meditation  Deliverance contains two kinds of deliverance impure and pure  The knowledge and the vision of deliverance contains the knowledge of the destruction of the impurities  When one knows that the impurities are destroyed one attains deliverance with respect to the threefold world and one knows and sees this clearly I have already spoken about the auxiliaries of enlightenment and the dharmas of the noble Path  Finally as for the qualities of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas not turned toward nirvāṇa the sūtra does not say here that surpasses them because these qualities are too slim  Question  Surpassing means to take away by force But here the bodhisattva is not struggling against the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas Why is it said that he surpasses them  He surpasses them only in the sense that by means of his wisdom  his skillful means and the strength of his mind  he obtains an increase of merit on a given point Thus in respect to a given flower  a person grasps only the color and the fragrance whereas the bee grasps the juice and makes honey out of it In the same way also in order to draw water  if the vessel is big one gets a lot if it is small one gets only a little By means of these comparisons  we can know that by means of a mind of sympathetic joy associated with profound and keen wisdom  the bodhisattva  Giving from pride  thinking Giving from jealousy  thinking My rival has acquired a reputation and has surpassed me by giving Now I should give more generously still in order to surpass him Giving from love for reward  thinking By giving a little bit my reward will be ten million times better therefore I give Now that I like to give I am esteemed by people and loved by the crowd Giving in order to win over people  thinking The person to whom I am giving now will certainly take refuge in me Practicing generosity with many fetters of this type is impure generosity Pure generosity Pure generosity does not have these mean tricks These are the innumerable reasons why he is born into the family of the bodhisattvas Question  From his first production of the mind of bodhi  the bodhisattva has already been born into the family of the bodhisattvas The why does the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra here speak about the bodhisattva who wishing to be born into the family of the bodhisattvas must practice the perfection of wisdom Answer  The family of the bodhisattvas is of two kinds i the family with regression and the family without regression  ii the nominal family and the real family iii the pure family and the mixed family iv the family strong in faith and the family without strength It is the family without regressions and so on up to the family strong in faith that the bodhisattva wishes to obtain This is the sense in which the Prajñāpāramitā here says that the bodhisattva who wishes to be born into the family of the bodhisattvas must practice the prajñāpāramitā Kumārakabhūmi The bodhisattva wishes to obtain the level of Kumāraka  Some bodhisattvas from their first production of the mind of bodhi  have destroyed lust and up to their acceding to supreme complete enlightenment In samādhi the bodhisattva meets the buddhas converses with them and enjoys their presence by means of prajñā he penetrates the emptiness of beings and things by virtue of which nobody meets anybody and nothing is said about things that are neither existent nor nonexistent Supported by the two wings of samādhi and prajñā the bodhisattva takes flight like a garuḍa king of the birds which soars supremely in empty space The bodhisattva wishes to have at his disposal as he likes  If he has need of a flower to offer it comes to him as he wishes  whether he looks for it or he gets it without looking for it Actually there are things that arise spontaneously  apparitional beings on up to musical instruments  and it is the same for all the things to be offered  The Buddha tapped the earth with his toe and at once his field was adorned with the seven jewels This is why the bodhisattva teaches them to practice meritorious actions  each before collecting himself what he has done himself The bodhisattva knows well that of causes and conditions cannot be violated and that beings must first receive his teachings in order that they collect the fruits This is why according to the order adopted here he teaches beings to become established in the six perfections Their number Question  The bodhisattva wants all the beings of the ten directions to become established in the six perfections Why then does the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra here speak only of the beings populating universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Answer  For the auditors of the Dharma the expression as numerous as the sands of the Ganges is familiar Moreover for a bodhisattva who has just produced the mind of bodhi  to speak of beings infinite and innumerable would be too much and would throw him into confusion on the contrary for a great bodhisattva the expression numerous as the sands of the Ganges is not used by way of computation Moreover the expression numerous as the sands of the Ganges also means an infinite immense number as will be said in a later chapter Finally the expression numerous as the sands of the Ganges has already been used to designate the universes of the ten directions and as here we are not speaking of one single Ganges there is no objection to be raised As a result to speak of universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges is not wrong On the meaning of the expression universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges see what has been said above  i the thirtyseven auxiliaries of enlightenment that lead to nirvāṇa ii the dharmas producing happiness in the course of rebirths  Here we are speaking only of the good dharmas occurring in the reincarnations  we are not talking about the good dharmas leading to nirvāṇa The good of the mundane order is of three categories i the superior category gives as fruit of retribution a deva destiny ii the middling category gives as fruit of retribution a human destiny iii the inferior category gives as fruit of retribution an asura destiny Question  But you yourself just said that the asuras are equal in power to the devas and that their bliss does not differ from that of the devas Why do you now say that the good of the lower category gives as fruit of retribution an asura destiny Answer  Among humans  it is possible to go forth from home take up the precepts and thus arrive at bodhi in the destiny of the asuras the fetters cover the mind and it is very difficult to arrive at bodhi Although they are inclined towards the fetters the devas have right mind and In the places where the original speaks of destiny in general the translator in this case Kumārajīva speaks of six destinies Moreover although they arise and perish from moment to moment the conditioned dharmas are inexhaustible insofar as their series is not cut and the fruit of retribution is not lost It is like the lamp which although its successive flames arise and are extinguished  is not said to be extinguished it is necessary that the tallow be melted and the wick be consumed for the lamp to be extinguished It is the same for merit resolutely planted in an excellent field it remains nonextinguished until the disappearance of things  Finally the Bodhisattva knows that the true nature of dharmas is inexhaustible  like nirvāṇa But the merit is part of to the true nature of the dharmas therefore it too is inexhaustible If that is so nirvāṇa being inexhaustible merit too should be always inexhaustible Why does the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra say that it remains inexhaustible during the interval of time required for the bodhisattva to become Buddha Answer  By the power of the wisdom  this merit becomes a quality comparable to nirvāṇa absolutely empty  unborn and unceasing  This is why it is compared to nirvāṇa but it is not nirvāṇa If it were confused with nirvāṇa one would be unable to establish a comparison  If it were really nirvāṇa then what would this fruit of retribution that remains indestructible consist of when one becomes Buddha This can be compared to the three gates of deliverance  namely emptiness  signlessness and wishlessness   Finally there are bodhisattvas who are endowed with bodhisattva attributes namely the ten bhumis the six perfections  the ten powers  the four fearlessnesses  the four unhindered knowledges  the eighteen special attributes and innumerable pure Buddha attributes However for beings they remain in saṃsāra for a long time and without taking Thus the Buddhas and the great bodhisattvas are strong enough that they can save all beings but since beings do not possess wisdom and do not fulfill the required cause and conditions they cannot be saved Let us take for example the water in the great ocean  if all beings drew water from it it would never run dry but all beings do not use it Thus beings in the preta category because of their own sins  are unable to see the water and even when they do see it it dries up or changes into molten copper The formations are like the trunk of a banana tree  leaf by leaf it is examined but no pith is found  Concept is like a mirage seen from afar without there being any water there one gets the notion that there is water one has the concept of water but it is nothing but an illusion Such are the considerations on inner outer and both onner and outer dharmas When the four great elements of the present existence are brought together they produce a form but as soon as thesse causes and conditions disappear the form disappears along with them The practitioner who follows the path of impermanence penetrates gradually into the door of emptiness  How is that The dharmas that perish as soon as they are born have not even a moment of duration and not having a moment of duration are not grasped Furthermore by virtue of the characteristics of conditioned  at the moment of production there is disappearance and at the moment of disappearance there is production If dharmas are already produced production is useless if they are not produced production produces nothing Imagine a man bound in chains who once he is freed engages in vain chatter saying Here are the chains here are the feet what then is deliverance This man is foolish to look for a dharma deliverance outside the feet and chains Beings do the same thing when they seek a dharma deliverance elsewhere than the chains of the five aggregates  Finally dharmas are not separate from the absolute and the absolute is not separate from the true nature of dharmas The result is that the emptiness of the true nature of dharmas is the emptiness of the absolute These are the various names used to designate the emptiness of the absolute   Yo kecid dharmā saṃskṛtā vāsaṃskṛtā vā virāgas teṣām agra ākhyāyate These sūtras pursue a salvific goal saṃsarataṃ mātuthaññaṃ pītaṃ It is precisely against this irreducibility and this stability of the skandhas that the Prajñāpāramitā and the Trait rise up Whether they are material like rūpa or immaterial like vedanā saṃjñā the saṃskāras or vijñāna the skandhas are decomposable and ruled by the process of causes and conditions This is what is called the emptiness of dispersal  Moreover canonical passages which deny them any reality are not lacking Answer  The adharma is not a dharma only because it is counter to existence is it called adharma If it were really an adharma it would be existent This is why it is said that all dharmas have a characteristic of existence Unconditioned dharmas also are dominant in respect to conditioned dharmas Therefore it is said that all dharmas have a characteristic of dominance Although they have attained these qualities  the saints who enter into nirvāṇa without residue of conditioning do not regard them as acquired  it is ordinary people who regard them as great acquisitions  if all his wishes were realized some least expected consequences would result To want to establish all beings in Buddhahood all at once would result in the interruption of the lineage of the Buddhas  something noone would want The Prajñāpāramitā alone penetrates it and penetrates it by not cognizing it for it is free of any opinion he refrains from any futile proliferation about causes and conditions but determines that they produce nothing Thus they are neither to be taken up nor rejected Brought to expressing a position its author does not hide his preferences for the divyackṣus p Thus far from being useless the intervention of the bodhisattva is eminently beneficial Loka according to them is derived from the root loki to shine and the skandhas are loka insofar as they do not break and do not disaggregate  consequently their true nature is nonproduction and noncessation  quite the contrary of pratītyasamutpāda This samādhi can only concentrate the distracted mind in such a way that prajñā is produced but it cannot see the true nature of things   COWELL

text of the corrected Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā and the two earliest Chinese translations of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā that of Dharmarakṣa made in AD and that of Mokṣala made in AD say  nothing about the four pratyayas in the place where they should have spoken of them ie after the statement of the eighteen śūnyatās c c The bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes to understand the sixteen śūṇyatās and the ālambanaśūṇyatā the adhipatiśūnyatā the samanantaraśūnyatā  etc should practice the perfection of wisdom They simply say that the bodhisattva wishing to understand the four pratyayas should practice the perfection of wisdom c b āstra THE FOUR CONDITIONS AND THE SIX CAUSES All conditioned dharmas are the result of four conditions   the causal condition   the immediately preceding condition   the object condition   the dominant condition  An exception is made for the last mind and the last mental events of the arhat at the moment of his nirvāṇa these cannot constitute an immediately preceding condition because no mind and no mental events arise after them  Mahāvibhāṣā T  k a Kośa II p Objector  According to the perfection of wisdom  the four conditions do not exist  If the fruit that arises from the complex of the cause and conditions already occurs in this complex why would it need to arise from the complex If the fruit that arises from the complex of cause and conditions does not occur in this complex how could it arise from this complex If the fruit occurred in the complex of cause and conditions it should certainly be taken hold of in this complex If the fruit did not occur in the complex of cause and conditions causes and fruits would be equivalent to noncauses to nonconditions Compare Madh But if this dharma is fundamentally without object how could it ever be comprised of one Kārikā I v  is expressed differently Bhāvānāṃ niḥsvabhāvānāṃ na sattā vidyate yataḥ  satidam asmin bhavatīty etan naivopapadyate  Paraphrase absolutely pure and free of futile proliferation According to the word of the Buddha there are four conditions But people with little knowledge  being attached to these four conditions  have composed bad treatises on their subject In order to destroy these wrong opinions  teaches the emptiness and indestructibility of dharmas Therefore arising from a complex of causes and conditions  namely the internal and external bases of consciousness  this minddharma is like a magic show  deceptive and without definite nature  And it is the same for the mentaleventsdharmas  good dharmas  it is the same for bad dharmas and indeterminate dharmas Thus all dharmas each have their homogeneous cause  When the mindsandmentalevents follow one another in order without intermediary  there is the immediately preceding condition   When the mindsandmentalevents arise and take things as object  there is the object condition Dominant condition   At the moment of their arising the dharmas do not obstruct one another mutually that is an absence of obstacle  The conditioned dharmas  being weak by nature  none of them arise from a single condition Not being indeterminate  they exclude the ripening cause  not being afflicted  they exclude the universal cause  grasped or capable consequently of being rejected  But as beings are attached to the emptiness of causes and conditions they say that they can be rejected  Thus seeing the moon reflected in the water  the little child is greedy for it and is attracted to it but when he wants to grab it and does not succeed he feels sad and annoyed This moon can be seen with the eyes but it cannot be seized with the hand The wise man denies only that it can be seized he does not claim that it cannot be seen In the same way the bodhisattva sees and knows that all dharmas arise from the four conditions but he does not grasp any determinate nature in these conditions Dharmas arising from the complex of the four conditions are like the moon reflected in water  Although this moon is false and nonexistent  it necessarily arises from causes and conditions  namely water and the moon  and does not come from other conditions It is the same for dharmas each one arises from its own causes and conditions and has no fixed reality This is why says here that the bodhisattva who wants to understand the causal condition the immediately preceding condition the object condition and the dominant condition in accordance with the truth must practice the perfection of wisdom Question  If one wants to understand completely the meaning of the four conditions  one must study the Abhidharma Why then does say here that in order to understand the four conditions it is necessary to study the Prajñāpāramitā Answer  In the explanation dedicated by the Abhidharma to the four conditions the beginner believes that it touches realities but if he examines them and goes into depth he falls into wrong views like those that you have formulated above in rejecting the four conditions  Furthermore if dharmas as causes depend on the four conditions how are these four conditions caused in turn If they themselves have causes there is an infinite regression  wherever there is an infinite regression there is no beginning point  if there is no beginning there is no cause and hence all dharmas would be without cause  If there was a beginning this beginning would be uncaused and existing without being caused it would not depend on causes and conditions That being so all dharmas themselves would exist without depending on causes and conditions Furthermore dharmas arising from causes and conditions are of two kinds If they preexist in the causes and conditions they arise independently of causes and conditions and there is neither cause nor condition for them If they do not preexist in the causes and conditions they are each without their respective causes and conditions By futile chatter about the four conditions one comes up against such errors  But the emptiness consisting of nonperception of which it was a matter above in the Prajñāpāramitā does not present such faults Thus birth old age sickness and death perceived by the eyes and the ears of ordinary people are considered by them to be existent but if their characteristics are examined subtly they are nonexistent  This is why in the Prajñāpāramitā only the wrong views are eliminated but the four conditions are not rejected This is why it is said here that in order to understand the nature of the four conditions the perfection of wisdom should be studied Dharmatā Second Section UNDERSTANDING DHARMAT AND ITS The problem of causality was the object of the preceding section   all that is called unconditioned dharmas The dharmatā of dharmas is emptiness the nonexistence of all dharmas Daśabhūmika p Because of this emptiness of this nonexistence all dharmas are equal The pratītyasamutpāda which the Early ones held to be real and termed  dharmatā the Mādhyamikas call emptiness nirvāṇa  goes to the great ocean to empty out the water but who uses a vessel so small that he cannot collect the immense waters Question  Tathatā dharmadhātu and bhūtakoṭi these three things are identical or different  If they are the same why use three words If they are three different things it would be fitting to distinguish them now Answer  The three words are synonyms serving to designate the dharmatā Why is that Ignorant worldly people have wrong views of all the dharmas and speak of permanent  happy  pure  real and personal dharmas The disciples of the Buddha consider things according to their principal characteristics  But while not seeing permanent dharmas seeing impermanence is a wrong view  And it is the same for the views of suffering emptiness nonself and impurity That is what is called tathatā  The tathatā is fundamentally indestructible  this is why in the Chandasūtra of the Saṃyuktāgama the Buddha enunciated the three rules constituting the three Seals of the Dharma  namely i All conditioned dharmas are impermanent  ii All dharmas are nonself  iii Nirvāṇa is peace  Question  But these three Seals of the Dharma are completely broken by the Prajñāpāramitā where the Buddha says to Subhūti The bodhisattvamahāsattva who considers form to be permanent is not practicing the perfection of wisdom the bodhisattvamahāsattva who considers form to be impermanent is not practicing the perfection of wisdom And it is the same if he considers it as happy or unhappy  self or nonself  peaceful or nonpeaceful  That being so why speak of the Seals of the Dharma Answer  The two sūtras are both the Word of the Buddha  but it is in the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra that the Buddha spoke most clearly about the true nature of dharmas   There are people who being attached to the error of permanence  reject this eternalist view but are not however attached to impermanence  this is the true Seal of the Dharma  The fact of rejecting eternalism and adopting impermanence should not be considered as a Seal of the Dharma In the Prajñāpāramitā condemns attachment to the wrong views of impermanence etc  but does not condemn the fact of accepting nothing  of adopting nothing  Having acquired this tathatā of dharmas one penetrates into the dharmadhātu one eliminates all opinions and does not conceive any further beliefs for such is its essence  Thus when a small child sees the moon reflected in the water  he goes into the water to grab the moon but unable to grab it he is very sad Question  In the system of the śrāvakas why do they not speak of the tathatā dharmadhātu and bhūtakoṭi whereas they are often spoken of in many places in the Mahāyāna system Answer  There are some places in the system of the śrāvakas where they are also spoken of but these places are rather rare This not being that is not  by the cessation of this that ceases asya nirodhād idaṃ nirudhyate That is to say the cessation of ignorance results in the cessation of the formations  by the  cessation of the formations consciousness ceases  and so on up to the cessation of oldageanddeath  by means of which grief  lamentation  suffering  sadness and torment cease This law of production and cessation  whether there is a Buddha or there is not a Buddha is eternal  and the Jātakas IV p Three times the Buddha questions āriputra as to how they differ and three times āriputra is silent We are reduced to three hypotheses for the reasons for this silence see those of Buddhaghosa in his Commentary on the Saṃyutta II p  l āriputra repeats them and continues Then āriputra rejoined the bhikṣus and said to them As long as the Buddha did not give me his approval  I  did not reply But now for seven days and seven nights without stopping I myself would be able to furnish him with explanations on that subject Then a certain bhikṣu said to the Buddha After the Buddha had returned to the vihāra to meditate āriputra uttered the lions roar and boasted The Buddha said to the bhikṣu What āriputra said is true and not false Because ariputra has penetrated well the dharmadhātu tathā hi śāriputrasya bhikṣor dharmadhātuḥ suptratividdhaḥ  This is what āriputra has just explained here and the Buddha congratulates him for his answer In the śrāvaka system the nature of production and cessation of all dharmas is considered to be tathatā whereas in reality it is necessary to eliminate all views in order to discover the true nature of dharmas  Question Answer As there were reasons to mention these two things  these two sūtras cited here spoke of them As is said in the Prajñāpāramitā in the Jou pin chapter  The past tathatā the future tathatā the present tathatā and the tathatā of the Tathāgata are one and the same tathatā and are no different Moreover previously  in the present Louenyi  same with dharmas when one analyzes and explores them wisely one reaches the very center of the tathatā and on leaving this tathatā one enters into the intrinsic nature  The tathatā without birth from the very beginning true nature It is called dharmadhātu viśuddhi bhūtakoṭi That is the entry into the dharmadhātu The dharmadhātu is immense  limitless  extremely subtle and admirable  There is no dharma that surpasses the dharmadhātu or that diverges from it  mind is fulfilled and without looking for anything else it actualizes it  The traveller who day after day has gone on without ever stopping no longer has the idea of starting again Take for example an arhat or pratyekabuddha who is established in bhūtakoṭi even if Buddhas as many as the sands of the Ganges were to preach the Dharma to him he would not progress any further because he has attained his goal Moreover  he is no longer reborn in the threefold world  As for the bodhisattva entered into the dharmadhātu it is uncertain whether he knows the bhūtakoṭi Although he has not yet fully perfected the six perfections  he converts beings sattvān paripācayati If he realized attaining the bodhi of the Buddhas From then on by the power of his great compassion and his exertion  the bodhisattva returns to exercising the practices Moreover the bodhisattva knows that in the true nature of dharmas there is no eternal dharma or happy dharma or personal dharma or real dharma He also abandons these considerations of the dharmas  The cessation of all considerations of this kind is precisely the true tathatā of dharmas nirvāṇa nonproduction  noncessation  primordial nonarising  Thus water is cold but if it brought close to fire it gets hot when the fire is extinguished the heat disappears and the water gets cold again as before Applying considerations of dharmas is like bringing the water close to the fire suppressing all considerations about dharmas is like extinguishing the fire so that the water becomes cold again Why is that Because the dharmadhātu is like that Just as there is an empty aspect in every material dharma  so there is a nature of nirvāṇa  called dharmadātu in dharmas The nature of nirvāṇa is also in the many skillful means used to attain nirvāṇa At the time when nirvāṇa is realized tathatā and dharmadhātu are bhūtakoṭi Finally the immense  limitless dharmadhātu unable to be measured by the mind and mental events  is called dharmadhātu  Furthermore āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes to calculate the number of subtle atoms contained in the great earth and mountains of the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu must practice the perfection of wisdom punar aparaṃ āriputra trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātau ye

hundred pieces he wishes by means of only one of these pieces to scatter into the air the waters contained in the great oceans the rivers the pools and the springs of the

trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and all the Mount Sumerus as if they were all just rotting grass If the bodhisattvamahāsattva wishes to stop the force of these winds  with his fingertip so that they do not arise he must practice the perfection of wisdom trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātau ye vātā imaṃ trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātuṃ sameruparvataṃ vidhvaṃsayeyus tad yathāpi nāma bisamuṣṭitām tān sarvān ekenāṅguliparvāgreṇa saṃcchādayitukāmena bodhisattvena mahāsattvena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam āstra  Question Why does the Buddha not praise the qualities of the bodhisattva such as the six perfections  but rather he praises this great power consisting of mastering the four elements Answer  Beings are of two types i those who love the good dharmas  ii those who love the fruits of ripening resulting from the good dharmas For those who love the good dharmas the Buddha praises the qualities  for those who love the fruits of ripening resulting from the good dharmas he praises great magical power  People build cities and palaces  but the materials they use are insignificant  The earth itself is very extensive  it supports the ten thousand things and is very solid  This is why the Buddha says here that in order to know fully the number of subtle atoms contained in the earth and the Mount Sumerus of the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and in order to know the respective part beings hold in regard to their actions it is necessary to practice the perfection of wisdom  The subtle atoms contained in a single stone are already difficult to count what can be said of the subtle atomes contained in the earth and mountains of the trisāhasramahāsmahasralokadhātu It is unbelievable  Answer  The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are unable to know them and still less the worldly people  but this number is known by the Buddhas and the great bodhisattvas  It is as if a man reduced to dust the earth and mountains of the present trisāhasramahāsāhasralokdhātu then  he crossed over a thousand universes of the eastern direction and there set down this dust next taking a second pinch of dust he crossed over a thousand universes and there set down the second pinch of dust finally in the same way he used up all the dust of the present trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu Then the Buddha asked the bhikṣus Is it possible to know by calculation the number of pinches of dust and the universes The bhikṣus answered As for the number of kalpas that have elapsed since the buddha Tatonghouei appeared in the world it is like the fine dust contained in universes as numerous as the sands of innumerable Ganges  And the Buddhas and the great bodhisattvas however know it all all the more reason when it is only a matter of universes as numerous as the sands of one single Ganges Furthermore speaking of immense things is to conform to the human point of view Thus it is said that the waters of the great ocean are immense when they have the depth of eighty thousand yojanas and Lo heou  king of the Asuras has no problem in measuring it Question  How does one obtain such a science by practicing the Prajñāpāramitā Answer  There are men who by practicing the Prajñāpāramitā  destroy the conflicting emotions  wrong views  futile chatter  and penetrate into the very profound dhyānas and absorptions of the bodhisattvas By the purity and extent of their memory and their knowledge  they are able to distinguish the subtle atoms of all the substances and know their number Moreover the Buddhas and the great bodhisattvas who have obtained the unhindered liberations do not consider calculations higher than that to be difficult and still less that calculation Moreover there are people for whom the solidity of the earth and the absence of shape of the mind are wrong This is why the Buddha has said that the power of the mind is great By cultivating the Prajñāpāramitā this great earth is reduced to its subtle atoms  Because the earth element possesses color  odor  taste and touch  it is heavy and does not have activity on its own  Because the water element has no taste  it is superior to earth by means of its movement  Because the fire element has neither odor nor taste  it is superior to water in its power   Because the wind element is neither visible nor has it any taste or touch  it is superior to fire by means of its movement   The mind which has none of these four things color taste smell and touch has a still greater power  But when the mind abounds in afflictive emotions  in fetters and bonds  its power is very small  Impure but good minds have no afflictive emotions however since they still grasp characteristics  their power is small also In adepts of the two Vehicles  pure minds no longer grasp characteristics and nevertheless since the wisdom of these adepts is limited as soon as they leave the pure Path  their six organs to imagine and to grasp the characteristics of dharmas  and this is why they do not exhaust all the power of mind  By contrast in the Buddhas and great bodhisattvas wisdom is immense  unlimited  always deep in the dhyānas and the meditative absorptions  There is no difference between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa The True nature of dharmas is true and undifferentiated  In one moment they can count the subtle atoms contained in the great earth and the mountains of trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātus as numerous in each of the ten directions as the sands of all the Ganges  and all the more so those contained in each of the ten directions in universes as many as the sands of a single Ganges Finally although outside of the Prajñāpāramitā one is able to conquer the superknowledge of magic  the latter will never equal the knowledge of which I have just spoken This is why the Prajñāpāramitā says that in order to obtain this great power of magic  it is necessary to practice the perfection of wisdom  Some say that water is the greatest of all substances Because at the zenith  at the nadir and at the four cardinal points of the great earth  there is no place where there is no water If the Lokapāla gods did not moderate the rain of the heavenly nāgas and if there A great element is the more subtle and the more powerful the smaller the number of derived substances it supports Furthermore it is as a result of the waters that the classes of animate and inanimate beings in the world take birth and grow  That is why we can know that water is very great This is why the Buddha says here that the bodhisattva who wishes to know the number of drops of water and to disperse them drop by drop so that they have no more power must practice the perfection of wisdom Some say that the fire element is the greatest Because it has no odor or taste and because if water greatly overflows its banks fire can destroy it The power of fire is so great that it can burn the ten thousand things and illuminate all the shadows  From that we know that fire is very great This is why the Buddha says here that the bodhisattva who wishes to extinguish the great fire by his breath should practice the perfection of wisdom Question  But it is thanks to the wind that fire is finally kindled  how then do wind and fire mutually destroy each other Answer  Although they are mutual causes they destroy each other in time Question  So be it But fire is immense  whereas  the bodhisattvas breath is very small  how can it destroy fire  Thanks to his dhyānas and absorptions  the bodhisattva who is cultivating the Prajñāpāramitā attains a magical superknowledge thanks to which he can change pariṇamFinally establishing a trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu is very difficult but by his merits and his wisdom  the bodhisattva is able to govern it Some say that of the four great elements  the power of the wind is the greatest Having neither form nor odor nor taste  its mobility is very great Just as space is infinite so wind too is infinite The success or failure of giving birth depends on wind Answer  Brahmā Devarāja who rules the trisāharalokadhātu had some wrong ideas and considered himself to be great But when he saw the Bodhisattva sitting crosslegged and filling space his proud thoughts Moreover by his skillful means coming from this magical superknowledge eko pi bhūtvā bahudhā bhavati being many he becomes one  being small he becomes large being large he becomes small and if he wants to manifest extraordinary things  he is able to sit and fill all of space  Finally it is in order to prevent the asuras and the nāgarājas from tormenting beings that the Bodhisattva sits and fills space thus assuring the safety of beings    Thus when the nāgarājas Nanto and Ponanto  the older and the younger wanted to destroy the city of rāvastī they rained down weapons and poisonous snakes  but Moulien  at that time properly seated filled space and changed the offensive weapons into perfumed flowers and necklaces  This is why the Prajñāpāramitā says here that the bodhisattvamahāsattva should practice the perfection of wisdom if by means of a single paryaṅka he wants to fill all the space in the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu  Furthermore the bodhisattvamahāsattva should practice the perfection of wisdom if he wants by means of a single hair having raised up all the Sumerus king of the mountains in the trisāhasramahāsāsralokadhātu to cast them beyond innumerable and incalculable universes without harming the beings in them Punar aparaṃ trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātau ye sumeruparvatarājās tān sarvān ekena vālenābhyutkṣipyāprameyān asaṃkhyeyān lokadhātūn samtikramya prakṣipeyaṃ na tu sattvān viheṭhayeyam iti bodhisattvena mahāsattvena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  Question  How can the bodhisattva raise the Mount Sumerus and the mountains and cast them far away beyond the innumerable universes of the other directions Answer  He has no need of a lever and this emphasizes the power of the bodhisattva who is able to lift up the mountains Moreover when the Buddha is going to preach the Dharma the bodhisattvas first adorn the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and remove the mountains so that the ground is leveled out  Each Mount Sumeru has a height of  yojanas To raise up one single Sumeru is already extraordinary  to say nothing about the hundred koṭis of Sumerus in the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu to say nothing about raising with a single hair ekena vālāgreṇa the hundred koṭis of Sumerus in the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu and casting them out beyond innumerable and incalculable universes The beings who see this extraordinary exploit of the bodhisattva all produce the mind of supreme complete enlightenment and have the following thought If this bodhisattva who has not yet attained the bodhi of the Buddhas possesses such magical power  what will it be when he becomes Buddha That is why the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra spoke thus Sixth Section HONORING ALL THE BUDDHAS BY MEANS OF A Sūtra   The bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes by means of one and the same morsel of food to satisfy all the Buddhas and their disciples present in each of the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges  Question  To offer one and the same morsel of food to a single Buddha and his monks is already difficult  to say nothing of the bodhisattva offering this morsel to Buddhas and their saṃghas in each of the ten directions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Answer  The merit of the offering resides in the intention and not in the thing offered It is with a great intention that the bodhisattva offers this single morsel to all the Buddhas and all their saṃghas of the ten directions Whether they are far or near is unimportant This is why all the Buddhas see this offering and accept it  Question  All these Buddhas have omniscience and consequently see the offering and accept it but the monks themselves do not have omniscience how could they see it and accept it Answer  The monks neither see it nor know it and yet the donor of the offering gains merit  Thus when a man sends a messenger to carry an offering to another even if this other person does not receive it the man gains the offering of the gift Also in the concentration of lovingkindness  even though nothing is given to the beings  spring the output of which does not dry up sakṛdāgāmiphale anāgāmiphale arhattve yāvad anupadhiśeṣanirvāṇadhātau pratiṣṭhāpayitukāmena bodhisattvena mahāsattvena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam When they are in the subsequent knowledge concerning of the path  the ascetic who has sought by means of faith and the ascetic who has sought the truth by means of scripture have acquired the realization of the fruit of entry into the stream  The Chinese characters Siuto mean stream ie the noble eightfold Path  To enter into the noble eightfold Path is to enter into the stream of nirvāṇa that is the first vision of the true nature of dharmas dharmāṇāṃ bhūtalakṣaṇam or dharmatā By successfully entering into this part of the immense dharmadhātu one is classed among the āryas realm or in the formless realm  there his impurities are destroyed and he is no longer reborn  Question  But the anāgāmin who acquires parinirvāṇa in the present lifetime and the anāgāmin who acquires parinirvāṇa in the intermediary existence by going to the rūpadhātu are not reborn either in the form realm or in the formless realm  then why call them nonreturners   Answer  Among the anāgāmins there are many who are reborn in the form realm or the formless realm whereas those who are parinirvāṇized as soon as this present life are rare as the latter are in the minority which is the name of the majority Those who obtain parinirvāṇa in the intermediate existence  being also on the point of being reborn in the form realm but seeing the torments they would have to undergo in the course of this last existence  take nirvāṇa all the time this is why they too take the name of anāgāmin because it is the name of the majority dānaṃ dattvā prathamaṃ dhyānaṃ dvitīyaṃ dhyānaṃ tṛtīyaṃ dhyānaṃ caturthaṃ dhyānaṃ ākāśānantyāyatanasamāpattiṃ vijñānantyāyatanasamāpattiṃ ākiṃcanyāyatanasamāpattiṃ naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatanasamāpattiṃ pratilabhate  The bodhisattvamahāsattva knows the true nature of dharmas free of grasping  free of rejecting and indestructible  He practices an ungraspable perfection of wisdom  but by means of a feeling of great compassion  he returns to cultivate meritorious practices  By the sharpness of his wisdom  the bodhisattva who practices the perfection of wisdom is able to make distinctions between the merits of the gift   Answer  A good field also contributes to the importance of merit but not as much as the intention of the donor Because the mind is the internal master whereas the field is just an outer thing Sometimes however the merit of generosity resides in the field of merit    Thus the arhat Yieul who once had offered a single flower to a stūpa of the Buddha enjoyed happiness among gods and men for ninetyone kalpas and by virtue of the remainder of his merit  he became an arhat   Thus king Achoukia  who as a small child had given some earth to the Buddha reigned over Jambudvīpa built eighty thousand stūpas and still later found bodhi The thing he had offered was very common and the intention of the child quite weak  It was only because of the excellence of the field of merit that he acquired a great fruit of retribution  So we know then that great merit results from the good field with a feeling of great compassion  to save save all beings also obtains a great retribution  In addition to the great fruits of rpening  as is said  it is to be reborn in the families of the kṣatriya and so on up to becoming Buddha Question  How does one get to be reborn in the families of the kṣatriyas and so on up to becoming Buddha  Answer  The generous and moral man obtains riches and honor among men and gods The seven rebirths in kāmadhātu gentle  their wisdom becomes sharp and they are immediately reborn into the noble eightfold Path  By elimination of the three fetters trayāṇāṃ saṃyojanānāṃ prahāṇāt they obtain the fruit of srotaāpanna and so on up to their arrival at the bodhi of the Buddhas As a result of these gifts they hear preach the Dharma and then they produce the mind of supreme complete enlightenment  The generosity of a man not detached from desire results in rebirth among men in wealth and honor or among the six kinds of gods of the desire realm   The generosity of a man detached from desire results in rebirth among the gods of the Brahmā realm  up to the Bṛhatphalas The generosity of a man freed from the notion of material results in a rebirth among the formless gods  By not committing either wrong deeds or good actions the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of morality By not disturbing his mind the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of patience By not relaxing his physical and mental energy the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of exertion By having neither distraction nor the act of attention the bodhisattva fulfills completely the perfection of meditation  The meaning of this paripūri the act of completetly fulfilling has been fully explained above Now we will speak about upāyakauśala  skillful means In regard to the perfection of generosity this skillful means is not to grasp three things Suppressing the three things as here is to fall necessarily into the view of nihilism  Answer  There are two kinds of nongraspng  i not grasping that which exists  ii not grasping that which does not exist  Not grasping that which does not exist is to put skillful means to work and not falling into the view of nihilism Without skillful means the donor  clings to these three characteristics   But if he has recourse in the emptiness of these three things he grasps the absence of characteristics  He who possesses skillful means from the very beginning does not see the three characteristics of generosity This is why using skillful means is not to fall of existence and nonexistence  Moreover eliminating the afflictive emotions on the occasion of a gift is called skillful means Moreover giving while producing a mind of great compassion toward all beings is called skillful means The fact of applying the meritorious gifts practiced during numberless past and future lifetimes to supreme and perfect enlightenment is also called skillful means Finally the fact of commemorating the merits acquired by the Buddhas and their disciples in the ten directions and the three times  the fact of being pleased with their gifts and applying them to supreme and complete enlightenment is also called skillful means These are the many potentialities constituting skillful means   Furthermore āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes to attain the qualities of the blessed Buddhas past future and present must practice the perfection of wisdom Punar aparaṃ āriputra bodhisattvena mahāsattvenātītānāgatapratyutpannānāṃ buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ guṇām anuprāptukāmena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  The qualities of the past Buddhas have already disappeared the qualities of the future Buddhas do not yet exist and the qualities of the present Buddhas are not perceptible  therefore the qualities of the Buddhas of the three times do not exist Then why does the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra speak here of the bodhisattva who wishing to acquire the qualities of the Buddhas of the three times should practice the perfection of wisdom Answer  The sūtra does not speak of the bodhisattva wanting to acquire the qualities of all the Buddhas of the three times but of the bodhisattva wanting to acquire for himself qualities that are not fewer than those of one Buddha of the three times How is that In all the Buddhas the qualities are equal neither more nor less numerous Question  If that is true how can one say in regard to the buddha Amita that his lifespan is limitless  that his brilliance covers thousands of myriads of koṭis of yojanas and that he has saved beings of innumerable kalpas Answer  The buddhafields are diverse  At that time the Buddha had gone to spend the rainy season among the Trāyastriṃśa gods  and when the time of dismissal had come  the four assemblies remaining on earth and not having seen the Buddha for a long time were distressed and sad They sent Moulien to the Buddha and Maudgalyāyana said to the Buddha Lord why do you neglect all these people and stay with the gods Then the Buddha said to Maudgalyāyana Look at this universe with its three thousand continents  By the power of the Buddha Maudgalyāyana looked at the universe in question and he saw there some Buddhas who were preaching the Dharma to the great assembly other Buddhas seated in meditation yet others begging their food in these many ways they were accomplishing their Buddhawork  Then Maudgalyāyana prostrated with a fivefold bow  Sumeru king of the mountains shook with great trembling and all the gods were seized by great fear Maudgalayāyana burst into tears and bowing his head said to the Buddha In their great compassion the Buddhas do not abandon anyone by working with these many transformations  they save beings  The Buddha said to Maudgalyāyana What you see is nothing at all Beyond what you see in the east there is a universe the ground of which is made only of gold  the disciples of the Buddha who lives there are all arhats and their six superknowledges are without obstacle  Beyond that region of the east there is a universe the ground of which is made only of silver  the disciples of the Buddha there all practice the bodhi of the pratyekabuddhas  Beyond this region of the east there is a universe the ground of which is made only of the seven jewels  on that ground there is always an immense brilliance  the disciples created there by the Buddha are all bodhisattvas who have all attained the gates of dhāraṇī and samādhi and abide in the nonregressing stage  You should know O Maudgalyāyana that all those Buddhas are myself Thus among all these numberless universes in the eastern direction equal in number to the sands of the Ganges  there are some that are beautiful and some that are ugly  in all of them it is I myself who carry out the work of Buddha And it is the same in the universe of the south  of the west  and the north  in the four intermediate directions  in the direction of the zenith and in the direction of the nadir  This is why it should be known that the Buddha ākyamuni has pure universes also like of Amita and that the buddha Amita as well as his pure universes has also impure universes  like of Buddha ākyamuni The great compassion of the Buddhas penetrates as far as the marrow of their bones  Indifferent to the beauty or the ugliness of the universes they conform of the beings to be saved and train them  like a tender loving mother trains her son should he fall into a pit of excrement she rushes to pull him out without any regard for the annoyance  Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes to arrive at the other shore of conditioned and unconditioned dharmas must practice the perfection of wisdom Punar aparaṃ āriputra bodhisattvena mahāsattvena saṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtḥanāṃ dharmāṇāṃ pāraṃ gantukāmena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  Arriving at the other shore is coming precisely to the other shore of conditioned dharmas and unconditioned dharmas By means of great wisdom how does one get to know entirely to exhaust entirely  this other shore  By analyzing the general characteristics and the specific characteristics of conditioned dharmas in many ways and in regard to the unconditioned dharmas by understanding completely the four fruits of the religious life from srotaāpanna up to Buddhahood For the characteristics of conditioned and unconditioned dharmas see what has been said above   The bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection  of wisdom if he wishes to understand all dharmas past present and future their dharmanature and their intrinsic nonarising Bodhisattvena mahāsattvena sarvadharmāṇāṃ atītānagatapratyutpannānāṃ tathatāṃ dharmāṇām anutpādakoṭim anuboddhukāmena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  Question  Above  tathatā the manner of existence has already been spoken of why talk about it again here Answer  Above we talked simply of the tathatā of all dharmas here we are speaking about the tathatā of the three times   Above we spoke briefly  here we will speak at length   Above we spoke of just  here we are speaking of three things tathatā dharmatā and anutpādakoṭi The tathatā of past dharmas is the dharmatā of past dharmas and it is the same for future and present dharmas Furthermore the tathatā of past dharmas is the tathatā of future and present dharmas the tathatā of present dharmas is the tathatā of past and present dharmas Because the nature of tathatā is beyond identity and diversity  Furthermore as I have said above  there are two kinds of tathatā the worldly tathatā and the supraworldly tathatā In terms of the worldly tathatā the three times are each different in terms of the supraworldly tathatā the three times are the same As for the dharmatā there are actiondharmas and resultdharmas  causesconditions and fruits of retribution  in the same way that fire has heat as its nature and water has moistness as its nature The causesconditions and the fruits of retribution of these dharmas are distinguished Each has its specific nature  as has been said in regard to the power concerning the possible and the impossible  that is the worldly dharmatā  But if one examines and considers the nature of things one enters into the system of nonarising and one does not depart from it this is called anutpādakoṭi intrinsic nonarising Objection   But in this dharmatā it is possible to discern the existence of the three times The anutpādakoṭi is future dharmas How is there still the past and the present  Dharmas havingarising are the past and the present dharmas withoutarising are the future and unconditioned dharmas That being so why would you want the past and the present to be withoutarising Answer  In many ways previously I have refuted the existence of dharmahavingbirth all dharmas are unborn  Why would the future be the only one to be withoutbirth F in interpreting the phrase at one time I refuted the existence of the three times  The three times have only one characteristic namely the absence of nature  that is their nature of nonarising  Moreover the anutpāda is called nirvāṇa because nirvāṇa does not arise and does not cease From beginning to end nirvāṇa is absolutely without rebirth and all dharmas are nirvāṇa This is why the Buddha speaks here of their anutpādakoṭi their intrinsic nonarising  Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wants to acquire precedence over all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas become the assistant of all the blessed Buddhas participate in the close circle of all the blessed Buddhas have a large following acquire a following of bodhisattvas and purify great offerings Punar aparaṃ āriputra bodhisattvena mahāsattvena sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhānāṃ pūrvaṃgamena bhavitukāmena buddhānāṃ bhagavatām upasthāyakena bhavitukāmena buddhānāṃ bhagavatām abhyantaraparivāreṇa bhavitukāmena  mahāparivāreṇa bhavitukāmena bodhisattvaparivāraṃ pratilabdhukāmena dakṣiṇāṃ pariśodhayatukāmena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  Question  How can the bodhisattva who has not yet acquired the cessation of the impurities take precedence over the holy individuals whose impurities are destroyed  Answer  From his first production of the mind of bodhi  the bodhisattva already takes precedence over all beings what more can be said when he has practiced for many kalpas The merits and knowledge of this bodhisattva are great from lifetime to lifetime he has always been of great benefit to the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas Out of recognition of the benefits of the bodhisattva beings venerate him esteem him and respect him even in his animal existences   Thus at one time the Bodhisattva was a deer  his body golden in color  his antlers made of the seven jewels  and five hundred deer followed him as his servants When the Bodhisattva lived among men he was during the fortunate periods a noble cakravārtin king but in  periods of corruption  he was a great king protecting the Buddhadharma and benefiting beings When the Bodhisattva left home  if the Dharma of a Buddha existed at that time he was a great saviorteacher for the world but if  the Dharma of a Buddha did not exist he was a great heretic teacher practicing the four immeasurables  Although they are without impurities  the arhats and pratyekabuddhas render only mediocre service they are like a bushel of melted butter which although shiny is only the foam of the great ocean The bodhisattva himself despite his impure wisdom and his maturations renders immense service   sv Chikush Finally in regard to the four kinds of purifications that are the auxiliaries to enlightenment  the arhats and pratyekabuddhas have received a great deal from the bodhisattva   Thus it is said in the  Cheoulengking  Mañjuśrī was a pratyekabuddjha  times and by converting people to the pratyekabuddha Vehicle he helped them realize bodhi This is why the bodhisattva has precedence over the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas The bodhisattva wants to be the assistant of the Buddhas Holy individuals such as Cholifou   Moukienlien  Mohokiach  Siupouti  Kiatchanyen  Fouleouna  Anilouteou  etc and also the nonregressing bodhisattvas  separated from buddhahood by only one lifetime  such as Milo  Wenchoucheli  Potopolo  are called the great entourage of ākyamuni Furthermore the Buddha has two kinds of bodies i a body born of the fundamental element  ii a body in accord with the world  The worldly body had the alreadymentioned entourage As for the body born of the fundamental element it had as assistants innumerable and incalculable bodhisattvas separated from buddhahood by only one single existence   It is said in the Poukosseuyikiaito king  that when he was born the Buddha was the head of  bodhisattvas separated from buddhahood by only one existence and that these bodhisattvas were born in his entourage like dark clouds encircling the moon   It is said in the Fahoua king  that the bodhisattvas who arose from the earth each had a close entourage  a great entourage   The bodhisattva wishes to acquire a bodhisattva entourage  There are Buddhas who are surrounded only by bodhisattvas there are Buddhas who are surrounded only by śrāvakas there are Buddhas who are surrounded by both bodhisattvas and śrāvakas This is why the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra says here that in order to acquire an entourage composed exclusively of bodhisattvas the bodhisattva must practice the Prajñāpāramitā There are three kinds of entourage  superior middling and inferior The inferior one is made up of śrāvakas alone the middling one is a mixture  the superior one consists only of bodhisattvas The bodhisattva wishes to purify great offerings  Some say The bodhisattva collects much merit but does not eliminate his afflictive emotions   by accepting the pious offerings of people he does not purify them na pariśodhayati  But the Buddha has said that for the bodhisattva  who is practicing the perfection of wisdom all dharmas are empty and nonexistent and all the more so the fetters  Once having entered into the fundamental element  the bodhisattva does not realize the limit of the truth  this is why he is able to purify the gifts made to him Furthermore the bodhisattva has very great merits from the first production of the mind of bodhi he wants to take the place of each being in particular to undergo all the sufferings in that beings place He wants to give all his merits to all beings and only after that to find the bodhi of the Buddhas for himself But not being able to realize such a task alone he will end up becoming Buddha and saving all beings Furthermore the altruistic wishes of the bodhisattva are beyond calculation  As the world of beings  the tathatā the dharmadhātu the bhūtakoṭi the ākāśa etc last for a long time  so the intention of the bodhisattva to remain in the world for the benefit of beings sattvānāṃ hitāya is of long duration as well and knows no limits  If such a man cannot purify the merits of the offerings  who then can A father and a mother however heavy their fetters  dedicate their entire lives so that their son may be very fortunate how then could the bodhisattva who has no fetters and who for an infinite number of lifetimes dedicates himself to the welfare of beings be unable to purify the offerings Finally if a bodhisattva endowed only with compassion but without wisdom is already so beneficial what can be said of the bodhisattva cultivating the perfection of wisdom Question  But how can the bodhisattva who has no more fetters still take on rebirths in the world Answer  I have already answered that above  The bodhisattva who has obtained the acquiescence that dharmas do not arise  who has obtained a body born of the fundamental element  who manifests by metamorphosis in different places  is able to save beings and adorn the universes  As a result of these merits  even before becoming Buddha he can purify the offerings   Moreover āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes to not produce thoughts of avarice immorality malice laziness distraction or false wisdom should practice the perfection of wisdom Punar aparaṃ āriputra bodhisattvena mahāsattvena mātsaryacittaṃ dauḥśīlyacittaṃ vyāpādacittaṃ kausidyacittaṃ vikṣepacittaṃ dauṣprajñācittaṃ anutpādayitukāmeṇa prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  These six kinds of minds that are evil close the door to the six perfections  Thus when the bodhisattva is practicing generosity and a mind of avarice arises in him it makes the gift impure  sometimes he will not give pure things or if he gives external things he does not give a lot of them or if he gives inwardly he does not give fully all of this because of the thought of avarice But if the bodhisattva cultivates the perfection of wisdom he knows that all dharmas are without me  without mine  empty  like a dream  like a magic show  then he gives his body  his head  his eyes  his bones  his marrow as if they were bits of grass or pieces of wood  Although this bodhisattva has not yet attained saṃbodhi he always avoids producing a thought of avarice and to this end he will practice the perfection of wisdom  Other people having attained bodhi by renunciation of desire  do not produce the thought of immorality  The bodhisattva because he is practicing the perfection of wisdom envisages nothing as immoral Morality is the abode of all good qualities  just as the earth is the support and the basis for all things  An immoral man cannot obtain any bodhi how then would he be able to obtain the supreme and perfect saṃbodhi Moreover he has the following thought It is a rule for bodhisattvas to create happiness for beings the immoral man however disturbs the entire world This is why the bodhisattva does not produce any mind of immorality nor a fortiori any immoral  It is already forbidden to a Hīnayānist or a lay person to produce a thought of malice  all the more reason it is forbidden to a bodhisattva who has produced the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment The body is a vessel of suffering  it suffers vexations Thus the murderer himself goes to his punishment of what he himself has committed he himself suffers the consequences he cannot give it to another Only by protecting his own mind is he able not to experience malice It is like when one is suffering from wind  rain  cold or heat  there is no use in becoming irritated Furthermore the bodhisattva has the following thought If the bodhisattva seeks to become Buddha it is as a result of his great compassion  When he gives himself up to anger  he is violating his vows The wicked man does not obtain the happiness of this world  how then would he obtain the bliss of bodhi The wicked man does not find happiness for himself how could he give it to others  The lazy man cannot realize worldly deeds how then would he realize supreme complete enlightenment When pieces of wood are rubbed together to make fire and if one is interrupted many times one never gets a fire made The distracted mind is like a lamp in the wind which has light but does not illuminate objects It is the same for the wisdom in a distracted mind Wisdom is the root of all good dharmas  In order to realize this wisdom it is first necessary to concentrate the mind it is only afterwards that one will realize it A drunk man makes no distinction between his own interest and the interest of others  between beautiful things and ugly things  It is the same for the man with a distracted mind unable to recognize well beautiful worldly things how would he discern the supramundane dharmas The mind of a silly person cannot attain success or setbacks or a fortiori subtle and profound notions A man deprived of sight falls into the ditch or takes wrong paths it is the same for the man deprived of knowledge without the eye of wisdom  he adopts wrong doctrines and does not welcome the right view  Such a man has no success in the worldly things near him  how could he have it in supreme perfect enlightenment By practicing the perfection of wisdom the bodhisattva can counteract the six opposing  and purify  the six perfections  This is why the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra says here that the bodhisattva who does not want to produce the six opposing should practice the perfection of wisdom Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom of he wants to establish all beings in the place of practice of the meritorious action consisting of generosity in the place of practice consisting of morality in the place of practice consisting of meditation in the place of practice consisting of incentive if he wants to establish beings in meritorious material works and in meritorious works of the Dharma Punar aparaṃ āriputra bodhisattvena mahāsattvena sarvasattvān dānamayapuṇyakriyāvastuni śīlamayapuṇyakriyāvastuni bhāvanāmayapuṇyakriyāvastuni samādhāpanamayapuṇyakriyāvastuni pratisthāpayitukāmena  sarvasattvān aupadhikapuṇyakriyāvastuni dharmapuṇyakriyāvastuni pratisthāpayitukāmena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  Question  What is the place of practice of meritorious action called  The Abhidharma says that merit is an action of body speech or mind that is goodimpure  Some say that it is unobscuredindeterminate  Because as a result of a goodimpure action one obtains as fruit of retribution a merit which is also unobscuredindeterminate and that this fruit of retribution it too is called merit In the same way worldly people call a meritorious man but the one who having actualized great things has multiplied his successes In brief  this merit is of three kinds it consists of generosity  morality and meditation  When one gives a man garments  beds and seats  food and drink  flowers  perfumes  necklaces  etc that is a gift  But  these things food drink etc are already gifts Why is it still necessary to give them Answer  No these things food drink etc are not gifts It is at the moment when these things food drink etc  are given that there arises in the mind a dharma of renunciation opposed to the thought of avarice and called merit consisting of generosity  It is always a good mental event associated with the mind  accompanying the mind arising with the mind  It is without form and without shape  It is object producing  It is associated with action  accompanying action and arisen with action  It is not fruit of retribution of an earlier action  It is developed by acquisition and developed by practice  It is to be realized by wisdom and to be actualized physically  It is acquired by worldly persons and also by the saints  Others say that meritorious action consisting of generosity is the volition associated with the gesture of renunciation  Because it is action that produces the fruit of retribution and volition is action This gift is of two kinds i pure  ii impure  The act of giving does not perish even after hundreds of myriads of lifetimes it is like a debt   Increase of merit Question  How does the merit of generosity increase Answer  When one gives at the desired time  one obtains an increase of merit    As is said in the sūtra When one gives in time of famine  one obtains an increase of merit When one gives to someone who has come from afar on desert trails or dangerous paths when one gives constantly and uninterruptedly when one thinks constantly of giving at the right time then the merit of generosity increases See what has been said above on the six recollections in respect to the recollection of renunciation  One gains much merit if one gives generously if one gives to good people if one gives to the Buddha if the donor and the recipient are pure if one gives with a firm intention  if one gives an object that one has tried hard to acquire if one gives absolutely all that one has if one gives in exchange for other things if one gives ones servants  ones lands etc Only the bodhisattva is the one who practices such gifts with resolve  Models of generosity a Bodhisattva jātakas   Thus the bodhisattva Weilomo  having made gifts for twelve years still offered  richly adorned dairy cows vases made of the seven jewels courtesans  the three groups each containing  items  and also other things made of wood and food in incalculable amounts   Thus the bodhisattva Siutinienna  descending from his white elephant Chancheng  gave it to an enemy family then withdrawing to a distant mountain he gave his two dear children to a brahmaṇa with twelve uglinesses finally he gave his wife and his eyes to a fictive brahmaṇa At that very moment the earth shook  there was thunder and lightning and a rain of flowers fell from the sky   Thus king Sapotato chained up his own body and gave it to a brahmaṇa a piece of flesh from his own body to exchange it for the pigeon   Thus when the Bodhisattva was a hare  he roasted his own flesh to give to a hermit All this is told in the Pousapencheng king   b There are also gifts of the śrāvakas   Thus Siumito pikieouni along with two codisciples built a vihāra for the buddha Kianakiemeouni and for numberless incalculable thousands of myriads of lifetimes enjoyed bliss among the noble cakravartin kings and the devarājas   Thus Chepolo  enjoyed happiness from lifetime to lifetime and became an arhat for having offered a bottle of cream to the saṃgha he is foremost among those who have found happiness    Thus Molifoujen  for an offering  to Siupouti  obtained a fruit of retribution  she was the main wife of king Posseuni  in the present lifetime  Bhagavati Koṇāgamaṇe saṃghārāmamhi navanivesamhi  sakhiyo tīṇi janiyo vihāradānaṃ adāsimhā    Thus Chepo  for an offering to Kiatchanyen  obtained in the present existence a fruit of retribution she is the main wife of king Tchantotccheouto    Thus Yukieto kiuche  for offering to five hundred arhats Chlifou  etc on the same day obtained a fruit of retribution five hundred merchants who recieved the remains of his food each gave him a necklace and he became rich immediately As a result he was called suddenly rich Ugrata Such gifts find their fruit of retribution in this very lifetime and we should know that the Upadeśa declares them to be inexhaustible   The place of practice of meritorious action consisting of morality is in the words of the Buddha meritorious action consisting of the five precepts   Question  What are the characteristics of the wrongdoing of killing  Answer  Depriving someone of life knowing full well that he is a living being prāṇasaṃjñī jivitād vyavaropayati is to commit the wrongdoing of killing  To kill for no reason calmly absentmindedly is not committing the wrongdoing of killing to deprive of life inattentively or out of mental disturbance is not committing a wrongdoing of killing to inflict a wound even though mortal is not committing a wrongdoing of killing a physical act not involving death is not a wrongdoing of killing a simple act of body or speech is not a wrongdoing of killing  by itself bad intention is not enough because the implementation is absent The stopping abstaining of this wrongdoing constitutes the good characteristic of the first precept According to some this abstention is unobscuredindeterminate  It belongs to the desire realm or to no realm  It is neither mind nor mental event  neither associated with the mind nor accompanying the mind  sometimes it arises with the mind and sometimes not It is not associated with an action nor does it accompany the action  sometimes it arises with an action and sometimes not It is not the fruit of an earlier action  It is developed by acquisition and developed by practice  It is to be realized physically and to be realized by wisdom  Sometimes the thought is suppressed  sometimes not when one abandons the desires of the desire realm  it is suppressed Abstention  from killing occurs among worldly people as well as among saints  each according to its type participates in morality They have been praised and commented on above in regard to the perfection of morality  Although the sūtra says that the meditation of lovingkindness is the meritorious action consisting of meditation  it also says that any impure meditation able to produce a fruit of retribution usually is called meritorious action consisting of meditation Since the desire realm abounds in hatred and distraction  first of all we speak of the mind of lovingkindness as the sphere of meritorious action consisting of meditation  Metaphorically  lovingkindness is a wish for the happiness of beings  then it sees them really enjoying this happiness It is a dharma associated with the mind that is called lovingkindness  this then is the true maitrī the metaphorical maitrī itself belongs to the desire realm   Maitrī always accompanies the mind and arises following the mind  It is without shape and without resistance  It is not an action but associated with action  it accompanies action and arises with it  It is not the fruit of retribution of an earlier action  It is developed by acquisition and developed by practice  Sometimes in it thinking is cut sometimes not when one has transcended the desires of the realm of form  it is cut  In regard to the meritorious action consisting of meditation  why does the Buddha mention only the mind of lovingkindness and nothing about the other immeasurables ie compassion joy and equanimity Answer  The mind of lovingkindness produces greater merit than all the other immeasurables Material meritorious action consists of robes  food and drink  beds and seats  medicines  gold  silver vehicles  horses  fields  houses  etc  Question Here we want to distinguish the gift of the Dharma from the material gift  It was a gift of the Dharma when the Buddha out of his great lovingkindness  turned the Wheel of the Dharma for the first time and innumerable beings found bodhi It was a gift of the Dharma when āriputra following the Buddha turned the Wheel of the Dharma Other saints  without having turned the Wheel of the Dharma nevertheless preached the Dharma to beings and found bodhi this also is called gift of the Dharma  Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes to obtain the five eyes must practice the perfection of wisdom Punar aparaṃ āriputra bodhisattvena mahāsattvena pañca cakṣūṃṣi niṣpādayitukāmena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  What are these five  The fleshly eye   the divine eye   the wisdom eye   the Dharma eye   the Buddha eye  The fleshly eye sees what is close up  does not see what is far off  sees what is in front  does not see what is behind  sees what is external  does not see what is internal  sees during the daytime  does not see at nighttime  sees what is on top  does not see what is underneath   Because of these screens the bodhisattva seeks the divine eye  Having obtained the divine eye he sees what is distant and what is near what is in front and what which is behind what is internal and what is external he sees during the day and during the night he sees what is above and what is below for there are no further screens This divine eye sees the provisional entities resulting from causes and conditions coming together  but he does not see the true nature  namely emptiness  signlessness  wishlessness  nonarising  noncessation  Having obtained the wisdom eye he no longer sees beings  he eliminates completely the signs of identity and difference  he rejects all clinging and accepts no dharma  However the wisdom eye cannot save beings Because it does not distinguish them this is why the bodhisattva produces the Dharma eye  it is with their human eyes that the Indians of Jambudvīpa during the lifetime of the Omniscient One contemplated him who opened the gates to the deathless for them It prefers the discernment of the Dharma to a vision of the Buddhas  Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to see by means of the divine eye the Buddhas in each of the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges if he wishes to hear by means of the divine ear all the teachings given by these Buddhas of the ten directions if he wishes to penetrate the mind of these Buddhas Punar aparaṃ āriputra ye daśasu dikṣu gaṅgānadīvālukopameṣu lokadhātuṣu buddhā bhagavatas tān satvān divyena cakṣuṣā draṣṭukāmena yāṃś What is seen by the divine eye does not go beyond  one trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu acquired the divyacakṣus is able to see all the Buddhas of the present in the ten directions On the other hand here  by means of the divyacakṣus the bodhisattva sees all the Buddhas of the tendirections Answer   The divyacakṣus is nondefiledindeterminate  It is the same for the divine ear   If even a man of weak faculties belonging to a higher stage does not know the mind of a man with strong faculties belonging to a lower stage  if even a bodhisattva is unable to know the mind of a single Buddha punarvādaḥ could the bodhisattva penetrate the mind of all the Buddhas of the ten directions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Answer  The magical power of the Buddha helps the bodhisattva to know the mind of all the Buddhas As the sūtra says Of all beings there is not one that knows the mind of the Buddha but if the Buddha by means of his power helps one to know it even insects can know it This is why  the Buddha helps the bodhisattvas to know the mind of the Buddhas with his magical power The coarse and the subtle  the profound and the superficial the fool and the sage  all are undifferentiated  The suchness of the mind of the Buddhas and the suchness of the mind of the bodhisattva are one and the same suchness they are not different By following this suchness the bodhisattva is able to penetrate the mind of all the Buddhas Finally as for these marvelous extraordinary things  it is by not knowing them that one knows them Bodhisattvena mahāsattvena yāṃs te buddhā bhagavato daśasu dikṣu dharmān bhāṣante tāñ śrutvā sarvān saṃdhārayitukāmena yāvad anuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhi abhisaṃbuddha iti prañāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  The teachings of a single Buddha are already hard to retain  how then would the bodhisattva retain and not forget the teachings of innumerable Buddhas Answer  By the power of the rutadharadhāraṇi the dhāraṇi retaining what has been heard the bodhisattva gets a strong memory and by the power of the dhāraṇi he does not forget Moreover as is said here it is by the power of the Prajñāpāramitā that the bodhisattva retains the teachings of all the Buddhas  Perfectly pure and free of any clinging  this pāramitā is like the great sea which receives all the rivers Similarly by means of this great receiver  the Prajñāpāramitā the bodhisattva retains and does not forget the innumerable teachings of the Buddhas of the ten directions Finally the Prajñāpāramitā is incomparable like space  After the final conflagration  a great rain fills everything and except for space there is no place that can receive it similarly when the rain of teachings of the Buddhas of the ten directions comes out of the Buddhas mouths there is nobody to retain it except for the bodhisattva practicing the prajñāpāramitā This is why the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra says here that in order to hear the teachings of the Buddhas of the ten directions the bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom First Section SEEING THE FIELDS OF THE BUDDHAS OF THE Sūtra   Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to see the Buddhafields of the past and future Buddhas and if he wishes to see the Buddhafields of the Buddhas existing at the present everywhere in the ten directions Punar aparaṃ āriputra bodhisattvena mahāsattvena atītanāṃ cānāgatānāṃ ca buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ buddhakṣetrāṇi draṣṭukāmena pratyutpannānām api samantād daśadikṣu buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ buddhakṣetrāṇi draṣṭukāmena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  But in seeing the Buddhas of the ten directions the bodhisattva has already seen their Buddhafields why speak again here of the bodhisattva who wishes to see the Buddhafields Answer   the bodhisattva had not yet penetrated deeply into the dhyānas and the absorptions and had he seen the Buddhafields of the ten directions with their mountains rivers plants and trees his mind would have been distracted  this is why he was limited to seeing the Buddhas Everything happened as in the recollection of the Buddha where it is said that the yogin sees only the Buddhas but does not see the lands the mountain the rivers or the trees Furthermore the very pure Buddhafields are difficult to see this is why the Prajñāpāramitā says here that if he wishes to see the Buddhafields the bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom Finally each Buddha possesses hundreds of thousands  of kinds of buddhakṣetras It is like the devaputra in his audience hall he can be seen by the people from the outside but in his private apartments he is not seen by anyone  We accept that the buddhakṣetras presently existing in the ten directions can be seen but how could one see the buddhakṣetras of the past and future Buddhas Answer  The bodhisattva possesses the concentration called vision of the past and future  in this concentration he sees things past and future it is like the visions in a dream  Furthermore the bodhisattva possesses the concentration of unceasing term  In this concentration he does not see that the Buddhas have cessation Question  But these two concentrations are not of the eyes  then how could he see Answer  These two concentrations are wisdoms metaphorically called eye Similarly in the turning of the Wheel of Dharma  on each of the twelve aspects of the four noble truths  the ascetic obtains the eye  the knowledge  the clear intuition  the awareness   Furthermore the bodhisattva who sees the buddhakṣetras presently existing in the ten directions knows perfectly well that the past and future buddhakṣetras are the same as them Because the qualities of the Buddhas are the same amongst all of them In this regard see p Finally in of the prajñāpāramitā the present  the past and the future are the same and without differences for it is a matter of one and the same suchness  one and the same fundamental element    In the canonical sources whether they are nine or twelve in number the aṅgas are set out without any explanation   The Navāṅga are mentioned in some rare canonical sūtras translated into Chinese  p c k  p a The predictions relating to the nine paths of beings ie the paths of the three Vehicles and the paths of the six destinies are called vyākaraṇa   He predicts that the beings belonging to one of the six other destinies naraka tiryañc preta manuṣya deva asura in the future lifetime equally will obtain their retribution  If the Buddha predicts a birth among humans  the rays reenter by his navel nābhyām antardhīyante If the Buddha predicts a birth among the gods  the rays reenter by his chest urasy antardhīyante If the Buddha announces of the śrāvakas the rays reenter by his mouth  If the Buddha announces between his eyebrows  If the Buddha announces of the Buddhas the rays reenter by his cranial protuberance  The Buddha answered the bhikṣu The worldly person who has not obtained the bodhi without impurities and whose mind is covered with doubts  feels great fear in regard to nonself and nonmine  But if the Buddha or a disciiple of the Buddha teaches him the holy Dharma  then he rejoices and obeys because no longer having fear there is no problem This sūtra is told in full in the Saṃyuktāgama The avadānas stories are amusing little tales such as there are among people in the world the Ta apotona  In the Vinaya the Yieul apoto na  and the Eulcheyi apotona  In the two hundred and fifty rules  the Yu apotona in one book and the Pousa apotona in one book  When king Tsingfan and become disciples of the Buddha the latter chose five hundred of them capable of fulfilling this function and of attaining bodhi and led them to rāvastī These young men had not yet renounced desire and if they had remained near their relatives and their village it was to be feared that they would violate the precepts  This is why the Buddha took them to rāvastī and told āriputra and Maudgalyāyana to discipline them During the first and last watches of the night these people endeavored not to sleep and thanks to their diligence and exertion  they attained bodhi When they had attained bodhi the Buddha took them back to their native country It is a rule among all the Buddhas to return to their native land The stanza which the itivṛttaka gives here as an example is taken from the Udānavarga corresponding to the Dhammapada  The Buddha said to the bhikṣus Before you went forth from the world  your mind was lazy and you slept a lot this is why you did not perceive the length of the night Now that you are vigorously seeking bodhi during the first and third watches of the night you are reducing your sleep this is why you find the night very long  Previously it was in a chariot that you rode in the forests of Kapilavastu and you did not notice the distances Now that you are in monks robes with beggingbowl in hand your fatigue is extreme and you take into account the length of the path  Finally this lion here at the time of the buddha Vipaśyin was a brāhaṃaṇa teacher Having heard that the Buddha was preaching the Dharma he went to the Buddha but at that moment the great assembly who were listening to the Dharma were silent At once the brāhmaṇa had a wicked thought and uttered this harmful speech  They are nothing but idiots Once the Bodhisattva was a lion living in the forest He was joined in friendship with a monkey  The monkey  entrusted his two little ones to the lion Then there came along a famished vulture in search of food Finding the lion asleep he stole the two little monkeys and went to perch at the top of a tree When the lion awoke he searched for the babies and did not find them Seeing the vulture at the top of the tree he said The monkey had entrusted his two babies to me but while I was watching them I was not careful this is how you took them away and now you have My only wish is that he magnanimously grant my prayer May he very kindly release these little ones I am king of the animals and you are king of the birds  our dignities being equal an exchange can be made  The vulture answered You do not appreciate the circumstances today I am hungry and weary why discuss our similarities and our differences   Judging that it was impossible for him to gain satisfaction with his own claws the lion tore off the flesh of his sides and traded it for the baby monkeys  Once in time gone by  the entire population was stricken with a disease that turned them yellow and  pallid  The Bodhisattva then changed into the red fish  gave his own flesh to the sick people and saved them from this disease tyakta mayāśraya satvahitāya bhakṣita prāṇisahasraśatebhiḥ  Once the Bodhisattva was a bird living in the forest He saw a man sunk in the deep water a place not frequented by people The man had been caught in the net of the deity of the waters  Now whoever is taken by this net does not escape The bird knew the means to liberate him He went to the Perfumed Mountain  took a medicinal plant and spread it over the net the mesh of the net broke and the man was able to escape There are innumerable stories of this kind where people are saved These are the Mahāyānasūtras for example  Innumerable and incalculable are the sūtras of this kind preached for the obtaining of supreme perfect enlightenment  Weitsengyeou Adbhutadharma When the Buddha manifests his many miraculous powers  beings are astonished at these miracles  Thus at his birth the Buddha emitted great rays that illuminated the trisāhasramhasāhasralokadhātu and the dark intermediate places  he also illuminated the trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātus of innumerable buddhas in the ten directions Then in front of the Buddhas mother there appeared a beautiful clear pool to bathe the Bodhisattva Brahmādevarāja held a parasol  akradevendra washed his body and two Nāgas emitted a stream of water  And he said I will save all beings from birth  old age  sickness and death  There was a great trembling of the earth  the gods rained down flowers the trees emitted sounds and heavenly music began to play The innumerable marvels of this kind are called adbhutadharma arise  his perfection of wisdom is not joined to the perfection of wisdom and is said to be incomplete  up to and including the perfection of dhyāna there are similar upadeśas As for the perfection of wisdom  it is complete if it possesses the power of skillful means  it is incomplete if it does not possess it The passage of the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra commented on here spoke of the bodhisattva wishing to hear the twelvemembered speech of the Buddhawhether or not this speech has been heard by the śrāvakas yac ca śrāvakaiḥ śrutaṃ vā na śrutaṃ vā Actually there is the speech of the Buddha not heard by the śrāvakas  Speech not heard by the śrāvakas  spheres of totality can cause all the waters to change into fire  but other people cannot see this wishing to receiveretain entirely the  To receive is to be present respectfully to retain is to remain for a long time without losing Tryadhvabuddhapravacana Third Section HEARING THE TEACHINGS OF THE BUDDHAS OF Sūtra   Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to understand retain practice and make known to others everything that the Blessed Buddhas in the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges have said are saying or will say Punar aparaṃ āriputra yat kiṃcid daśasu dikṣu gaṅgānadīvālukopameṣu lokadhātuṣu buddhair bhagavadbhir bhāṣitaṃ bhāṣyate ca śrutvā tat sarvam udgrahītukāmena dhārayitukāmena pratipattukāmena parebhyaś  Above  the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra spoke of the bodhisattva who in order to retain and not forget the words of the Buddhas of the ten directions must practice the perfection of wisdom why does it speak again here about understanding and retaining the teachings of the Buddhas of the three times  Above the sūtra spoke of the bodhisattva wishing to retain the teachings of the Buddhas of the ten directions and since one does not know what the teachings were it specified that it was a matter of the twelvemembered scripture which the śrāvakas heard or did not hear Above the sūtra mentioned only the Buddhas in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges here it speaks of the teachings of the Buddhas of the three times as numerous as the sands of the Ganges  Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to understand what the Buddhas of the past have said and what the Buddhas of the future will say and having understood it to assure his own good and that of others   Question  It is possible to understand and retain the teachings currently given in the ten directions by the Buddhas of the present but the teachings of the past have disappeared and those of the future do not yet exist then how can one understand them Answer  I have already answered that question above but I must repeat myself here The bodhisattva possesses a concentration called concentration of seeing the Buddhas of the three times  the bodhisattva who has entered into this concentration sees all the Buddhas of the three times completely and hears their teaching  Similarly also some heretics and eminent hermits see and hear by the power of their wisdom  the things of the past that however have neither form nor language  Furthermore the power of the bodhisattvas is inconceivable and although the past has neither form nor language they are able to see it and hear it  either by using the power of the dhāraṇīs or by inference  by deducing the things of the past and the future from the present This is why it is said here that in order to obtain these results it is necessary to practice the perfection of wisdom Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes to illumine with his brilliance all the darkness of the intermediary worlds  there where neither the sun nor the moon shines  in each of the ten directions in the universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Punar aparaṃ āriputra yā daśasu dikṣu gaṅganadīvālukopameṣu lokadhātuṣv andhakāratamisrā yatra sūryacandrakasau na bhāsatas tāḥ sarvā avabhāsayitukāmena bodhisattvena mahāsattvena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  When the Bodhisattva came down from the Tuṣita heaven into his mothers womb yasmin samaya bodhisattvas tuṣitād devanikāyāc cyutvā mātuḥ kukṣāv avakrāmati his body emitted a radiance that illuminated all the universes and also the intermediary worlds the places of darkness  In the same way also at the moment of his birth his radiance shone everywhere In the same way also he emitted a great radiance when he attained supreme perfect enlightenment  when he turned the Wheel of Dharma and when he entered into parinirvāṇa yasmin samaya nupadiśeṣe nirvāṇadhātau parinirvāsyate In other circumstances as well he manifests his great magical superknowledge and emits a great radiance Thus when he wants to preach the Prajñāpāramitā he manifests his great ṛddhyabhijñā by means of a great brilliance that illumines everywhere the intermediary worlds places  of darkness  Thus is his miraculous radiance spoken of in many places in the sūtras Question  But that is the power of the Buddha why are you speaking about the bodhisattva here Answer  Here it is matter of the bodhisattva wishing to obtain this power and to practice the perfection of wisdom for this purpose There are great bodhisattvas who have this power Thus the bodhisattva Pienki  the bodhisattvas Kouancheyin  Ttache Mahāsthāmaprāpta Mingkang  Wouleangkouang  etc have that power and their bodies emit an immense brilliance illuminating in the ten directions universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges  Thus in the universe of the Buddha Amito  the bodhisattvas emit a perpetual radiance illuminating a hundred thousand leagues  Question  Because of what action does the bodhisattva acquire such a physical radiance Answer  He has acquired this splendor thanks to the purity of his physical actions    As is said in a sūtra there was a preta whose head was like that of a pig and foulsmelling insects came out of his mouth however his body was golden in color  In a previous lifetime  this preta had been a bhikṣu but he insulted a stranger monk with harmful words  Since he had observed the pure precepts  his body had radiance but having uttered harmful words stinking insects came out of his mouth A sūtra says that according to the purity of mind  the radiance is superior  middling or inferior  The Parīttābhas Apramāṇābhas bhāsvaras and the gods of the desire realm possess a radiance  because out of the purity of their mind they make gifts and observe morality Moreover some people out of compassion for beings have set lamps in dark places they have honored the holy images and shrines  they have offered shining things like pearls  windows mirrors  etc this is why their bodies have radiance Moreover by constantly practicing the mind of lovingkindness and listening to all beings the mind becomes pure  Moreover by always practicing the concentration of the recollection of the Buddhas and thinking about the high qualities of the Buddhas one acquires a great bodily radiance Finally the yogin who constantly practices the sphere of totality of fire converts fools and people of wrong view by means of the brilliance of his wisdom As a result of such actions one acquires mentally the lucidity of wisdom and brilliance physically As a result of such actions one finds the purity of physical brilliance  Sixth Section MAKING KNOWN THE NAMES OF THE THREE Sūtra   Furthermore O āriputra in each of the ten directions there are universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges where beings hear neither the name of Buddha nor the name of the Dharma nor the name of the Saṃgha The bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes to establish all these beings in right view and cause them to hear the names of the Three Jewels must practice the perfection of wisdom Punar aparaṃ āriputra yāvanto daśasu dikṣu gaṅgānadīvālukopamālokadhātavo yatra na buddhaśabdaṃ na dharmaśabdaṃ na saṃghaśabdaṃ sattvāḥ śṛṇvanti tatra lokadhātuṣu tān sarvasattvān samyadṛṣṭau pratiṣṭhāpayitukāmena triratnaśabdān śrāvayitukāmena bodhisattvena mahāsattvena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  In a region where there had previously been no Buddha no Dharma no stūpa the bodhisattva builds a stūpa and as a result of this action he obtains in the course of a rebirth  the perfection of power  in regions where there is no Buddha no Dharma no Saṃgha he praises the Three Jewels and helps beings enter into right view  In a region where there is no buddha stūpa a man built a stūpa and thus gained a brahmic merit  ie an immense merit As a result of that he quickly attains the dhyānas and by means of these dhyānas he acquires an immense superknowledge of magical power  By its power he goes in the ten directions and praises the Three Jewels and right view Those who previously did not know anything about the qualities of the Three Jewels acquire faith in them thanks to this bodhisattva By means of this faith in the Three Jewels they are certain that sin and merit have action as their cause and condition Thus believing in the efficacy of actions they understand that saṃsāra is bondage and nirvāṇa is liberation  For a eulogy on the Three Jewels see what has been said in regard to the eight recollections   Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if in regard to beings in the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges By my power may the blind see the deaf hear madmen recover their minds may naked people receive clothing and may those who are hungry and thirsty be satisfied Punar aparaṃ āriputra ye daśasu dikṣu gaṅganadīvālukpameṣu lokadhātuṣv andhāḥ sattvās te mamānubhāvena cakṣuṣā rūpāṇi drakṣyanti badhirāḥ śrotreṇa śabdān śroṣyanty unmattāḥ smṛtiṃ pratilapsyante nagnaś  The bodhisattvas who practice the unhindered prajñāpāramitā become Buddha if they attain unhindered deliverance  But if they become bodhisattvas with a body born from the fundamental element  like Mañjuśrī etc dwelling on the tenth bhūmi  they are endowed with many perfections of qualities  Everyone who sees them obtains what they wish for  Just as with the cintāmaṇi wishes are all fulfilled so it is with the bodhisattvas of dharmadhātujakāya everyone who sees them obtains what they desire Moreover from his first production of the mind of bodhi and during innumerable kalpas the Bodhisattva has healed the  eye diseases for innumerable lifetimes he has given his eyes to beings by the brilliance of his wisdom  he has destroyed the darkness of wrong views  out of his great compassion  he wants the wishes of all beings to be fulfilled As a result of such actions how would beings not recover their sight on seeing the body of the Bodhisattva The bodhisattvamahāsattva who wishes that by his power all those beings may attain a human existence must practice the perfection of wisdom Punar aparaṃ āriputra ye daśasu dikṣu gaṅgānadīvālukopameṣu lokadhātuṣu durgatyupapannāḥ sattvās te sarve mamānubhāvena manuṣyatmabhāvaṃ pratilapsyanta iti bodhisattvena mahāsattvena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  Question  It is as a result of a good action accomplished by oneself that one attains a human existence  Why then does the bodhisattva here wish that by his power  beings in the three bad destinies may find a human existence Answer  It does not say that it is because of an action of the bodhisattva that beings obtain a human existence it states only that it is as a result of the beneficent power of the bodhisattva that they obtain it By the power of his superknowledges  his transformations and his preaching  the bodhisattva makes beings practice the good and thus acquire a human existence See what a sūtra says    There are two conditions required for the production of right view  i externally  the hearing of the Holy Dharma  ii internally  right reflecting  As in the case of a plant  internally there is a seed  externally there is moist earth and only subsequently the plant is born  Without the bodhisattva notwithstanding their  This is how we know how great is the good work carried out by the buddhas and bodhisattvas  But how does the bodhisattva make all the beings of the three bad destinies obtain deliverance  The Buddha himself would be unable to do so how then could the bodhisattva Answer  There is nothing wrong in that the bodhisattva wishes to do that mentally Moreover as many beings obtain deliverance it is said here that all obtain it The body of the buddhas and great bodhisattvas emits immense rays everywhere apramāṇān raśmin niścārayati from these rays there appear innumerable emanation bodies  which penetrate the three bad destinies in the ten directions everywhere ie among the damned  the animals and the pretas Then the fire is extinguished and the boiling water cools down in the hells  the beings who are there and whose minds are purified are reborn among the gods or among humans  The pretas whose hunger and thirst have been satisfied develop a good mind and they too are reborn among the gods and humans  The animals  finding food wherever they wish  drive away their fears  develop a good mind and they too are reborn among gods and men Thus all beings of the three bad destinies obtain deliverance  Question  But other sūtras say that these beings are reborn among the gods or humans  why does the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra say here only that they obtain a human existence  Answer  Among humans it is possible to cultivate great qualities and also find happiness  On the other hand the gods are strongly attached to bliss and consequently cannot cultivate the Path  Finally the bodhisattva does not wish that beings find happiness only he also wants them to obtain deliverance and the eternal happiness of nirvāṇa  This is why he does not mention rebirth among the gods here Ninth Section ESTABLISHING BEINGS IN THE FIVE PURE Sūtra   The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes by the his own power to establish beings in each of the ten directions in universes as many as the sands of the Ganges in morality  concentration  wisdom  deliverance  knowledge  and the vision of deliverance  and attain the fruit of srotaāpanna and the others up to supreme complete enlightenment  Question  Above  the five pure elements and the fruits of the Path were already discussed why speak of them again  Above it was a matter of the attributes only of the śrāvaka the fruit of srotaāpanna and the others up to nirvāna without conditioned residue  here we are speaking of the three Vehicles all together śrāvaka pratyekabuddha all attaining supreme complete enlightenment  Furthermore O āriputra the bodhsattvamahāsattva who wishes to imitate the bearing of the Buddha must practice the perfection of wisdom Punar aparaṃ āriputra bodhisattvena mahāsattvena tathātagateryāpathaṃ śikṣitukāmena prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  Question  What is the bearing of the Buddha Answer  The bearing is the four physical movements or postures Walking Like the king of the elephants  the Buddha turns his body in order to look When he walks his feet are four inches above the ground and although he does not set foot on the ground the traces of the wheel on his soles are visible   He walks neither too slowly nor too quickly He does not bend his body He always raises his right hand to reassure beings Sitting posture He sits crosslegged with his body upright Lying down posture He always lies down on his right side and places his knees one on top of the other The mat of grass that he spreads out is well arranged and not disordered Manner of eating When he eats he is not attached to the taste for him good and bad food are the same In one single stride  they traverse in the east universes as many as the sands of the Ganges and the sermons of their brahmic voice has the same range For the characteristics of the dharmakāya Buddhas see what has been said above   and  l  l  Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattvamahāsattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he wishes this May I look with the gaze of the king of the elephants May I walk four inches above the ground without my feet touching the earth and Surrounded and honored by many thousands of myriads of koṭi of devas from the Cāturmahārājikāikas to the Akaniṣṭhas may I go to the foot of the bodhi tree Bodhisattvena mahāsattvenaivam upaparīkṣamānena kim ity ahaṃ nāgarājāvalokitam avalokayeyam  iti prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam When one swivels ones body and in order to look turns ones whole body this is the gaze like that of the elephant  This is a mark of the Great Man  The body and the mind are especially united this is why when one has something to look at body and mind turn together Thus when a lion has seized its prey it is not because the latter is small that the lion is going to cool its ardor It is the same for the Buddha When he has something to look at or something to say his body and his mind function together and never are separate Because for incalculable periods  he has cultivated the faculty of attentiveness and as a result of this action the bone of his skull is but one with the body there is no separation between them Moreover from lifetime to lifetime the Buddha has eliminated pride  this is why he does not scorn beings and when he looks at them he turns completely towards them  Nītha was a street refusesweeper in the land of rāvastī and yet the Buddha patted his head with his hand and  invited him to go forth from the world  he was the only one who did not scorn him If the Buddha were always flying beings would suspect him of not being of the human race and would not take refuge in him On the other hand if the Buddhas feet touched the ground beings would find that he was no different from an ordinary being and would have no respect for him This is why while gliding four inches above the ground the Buddha does not trample the ground but yet the traces of the wheel appear on the ground Question  But the Buddha always emits a radiance one armspan in width  and his feet do not tread on the ground why then would beings not honor him Answer  For innumerable kalpas beings have accumulated serious faults and so they have doubts about the Buddha If his feet do not tread on the ground it is because that is his nature  what is so wonderful about a bird flying There are beings who as a result of the gravity of their faults do not see the physical marks of the Buddha and simply say The Buddha is a very powerful śrāmaṇa Those who speak in this way are like very sick people who on the point of dying consider the remedies and good food as stinking and consequently do not pay any attention to them The Buddha goes to the foot of the bodhi tree surrounded and honored by many thousands of myriads of koṭi of devas from  the Cāturmahārājakāyikas to the Akaniṣṭhas this is a constant rule among the Buddhas The Buddha Bhagavat goes to the foot of the bodhi tree in order to destroy two kinds of Māras the fetter Māra and the lordgod Māra  and also to realize omniscience  Why would the crowd of devas not honor him not accompany him Besides from existence to existence the devas have always helped and protected the Bodhisattva already when he was leaving home the devas made the palace people and the palace women sleep stupidly and they held their hands over the hoofs of the horse when he leaped over the ramparts now the devas make sure that they accompany the Bodhisattva to the foot of the bodhi tree Question  Why does the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra not say that innumerable people  kṣatriyas brāhamaṇas etc accompany the Buddha but speak only of the devas Answer  The Buddha was alone in the deep forest when he began to look for the bodhi tree But the forest is not a place frequented by people This is why the sūtra does not speak of people Moreover men do not have the divine eye or the knowledge of anothers mind and consequently did not know that the Buddha was about to attain saṃbodhi This is why the sūtra does not speak of men Moreover the devas are higher than men This is why the sūtra speaks only of devas Moreover the Buddhas always love solitary places  and as the devas hide themselves and do not show themselves they do not disturb his solitude This is why the sūtra speaks only of the presence of the devas At the time when I sit down at the foot of the bodhi tree may the gods  from the Cāturmahārājikas to the Akaniṣṭhas  lay down a bed of celestial robes there Bodhisattvena mahāsattvenaivam upaparikṣamāṇena kim iti me bodhidrumamūle niṣīdataś  Question  But according to the sūtras the Buddha spead out grass at the foot of the tree and sitting on that he attained saṃbodhi Answer  It is in the sūtras of the śrāvakas that it is a matter of a bunch of grass the Mahāyānasūtras on the other hand refer to  what beings saw some saw him spread the grass at the foot of the tree others saw him spread celestial mats the visions vary according to the lesser or greater merits of the beings Moreover the Buddhas of birth body collect grass at the foot of the tree whereas the Buddhas of body born from the fundamental element use heavenly robes as seat or things higher than these robes Finally the Buddha realizes saṃbodhi in a deep forest at the foot of a tree if there are people in the forest who see him they offer him grass if these are noble men who see him they offer him garments of high quality as seat But in the forest there are no nobles therefore it is a nāga and the gods who each present to him a beautiful robe as a seat The robe of the Cāturmahārājakāyikas weighs two pala that of the Trāyastriṃśa one pala that of the Yāmas eighteen dharaṇa that of the Tuṣitas twelve dharaṇa that of the Nirmāṇaratis six dharaṇa that of the Paranirmitavaśavartins three dharaṇa The robe of the gods of the form realm has no weight The robe of the gods of the desire realm  being made of treetips has neither warp nor woof it is like a thin skin of ice clear with all sorts of colors pure and of ineffable brilliance The Bodhisattva sits down on these precious robes spread out as as a seat and realizes supreme complete enlightenment  Question  Why does the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra speak only of the devas spreading out robes and say nothing about the great bodhisattvas of the ten directions who themselves set out thrones for the Buddha  The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he envisages thus When I shall have attained supreme complete enligtenment may every place where I walk stand sit or lie down change into diamond Bodhisattvena mahāsattvenaivaṃ upaparikṣamānena kim iti me nuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhim abhisaṃbuddhasya gacchatas tiṣṭhato niṣaṇṇasya śayānasya pṛthivīpradeśo varjramayaḥ saṃtiṣṭheta iti prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  Question  Why is the earth changed into vajra diamond where the Buddha takes up the four postures   Answer In unfortunate ages  among beings of wrong views  in order to eliminate the wrong views of beings some bodhisattvas devoted themselves zealously to very austere practices  Thus in the Uruvilvā forest the Buddha ākyamuni ate only one grain of sesame  one grain of rice  The heretics said Even though he practiced austerities our former teacher could not follow them for more than six years and other men said The Buddha is undergoing today the painful retribution of bad actions of his former lives There are some bodhisattvas who believe that the Buddha really suffered those pains that is why they say to themselves When I go forth may I realize abhisaṃbodhi on that same day Moerover there are some bodhisattvas who go forth during fortunate times Thus Tatonghouei  in search of abhisaṃbodhi sat crosslegged for ten lesser kalpas until  he attained abhisaṃbodhi Learning this some bodhisattvas say to themselves May I attain abhisaṃbodhi on the same day that I go forth There are some bodhisattvas who after having realized abhisaṃbodhi do not immediately turn the Wheel of Dharma  Thus for twelve years after he had attained abhisaṃbodhi the Buddha Janteng only emitted light rays and as there was no one to understand him did not preach the Dharma Also the Buddha Siuchanto who was about to become buddha but had noone to receive his teachings created a fictive buddha who for a whole kalpa preached the Dharma and saved beings whereas Suśānta himself had already entered parinirvāṇa c Also the Buddha ākyamuni having become buddha waited  days before preaching the Dharma Learning this some bodhisattvas say to themselves May  I turn the Wheel of Dharma immediately when I become buddha There are Buddhas who save beings but in limited numbers Thus when the Buddha ākyamuni turned the Wheel of Dharma  Kiaotchenjou was the only person to obtain the first of the Path and  devas also obtained the purity of the dustfree and stainless eye of Dharma  Learning that some bodhisattvas make the following wish  When I turn the wheel of the Dharma may innumerable incalculable beings obtain the purity of the dustfree stainless Dharma eye When the Buddha ākyamuni first turned the Wheel of Dharma a single bhikṣu and some devas obtained the first  but nobody obtained arhathood or the bodhi of the bodhisattvas This is why some bodhisattvas  make the following wish When I become Buddha may the minds of innumerable incalculable beings by detachment in regard to things have their minds liberated from the impurities and may innumerable incalculable beings become irreversible in their course to supreme complete enlightenment Question  But in all the Buddhas the magical power  qualities and salvific activity are the same impure  The bodhisattvas see or hear it said that some buddhas by austerity  have attained abhisaṃbodhi with difficulty and have not immediately turned the Wheel of Dharma Thus for example  the Buddha ākyamuni realized abhisaṃbodhi only after six years od austerity and when he first turned the Wheel of Dharma nobody obtained the bodhi of the arhats still less the bodhi of the bodhisattvas This is why these bodhisattvas not knowing that the buddhas are equal in power make the wishes  Nevertheless the magical power and the qualities are identical and without difference in all the buddhas Ekadharmadeśana Fifteenth Section BRINGING INNUMERABLE BEINGS TO Sūtra   The bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom if he envisages thus When I attain supreme complete enlightenment may there be an immense incalculable sagha of śrāvakas and may a single preaching of the Dharma be enough that in one single session become arhats Bodhisattvena mahāsattvenaivam upaparīkṣamānena kim iti me nuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhhim abhisaṃbuddhasyāprameya saṃkheyaḥ śrāvakasaṃgha bhaved ekadharmadeśanayā cāprameyā asaṃkhyeyāḥ śrāvakā ekāsanikā arhanto bhavyur iti prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam  The Buddha Maitreya will have a first assembly of  koṭi a second assembly of  koṭi and a third assembly of  koṭi of listeners These buddhasaṃghas each having their limit and their determined number are dissimilar This is why some bodhisattvas wish to have innumerable incalculable śrāvakas as saṃgha When Mahākāśyapa saw the Buddha he obtained the first of the Path then eight days later he became arhat  minor ordination  the major ordination and the status of bhikṣu Vin  Catuṣpariṣad p  Mūlasarv Vin T  k May the Lord sit here this will make me happy for a long time nanda first obtaind the fruit of srotaāpanna then after having served the Buddha for twentyfive years and after the Buddhas parinirvāṇa he became arhat Thus these arhats did not obtain the four of the Path simultaneously This is why the bodhisattva wishes that innumerable śrāvakas beome arhats in a single session in the course of a single sermon of the Dharma  May I have an immense incalculable saṃgha of bodhisattvamahāsattvas and in the course of a single sermon of the Dharma may innumerable incalculable bodhisattvas become nonregressing Kim iti me prameyo saṃkhyeyo bodhisattvānaṃ mahāsattvānaṃ saṃgho bhaved ekadharmadeśanayā cāprameyā asaṃkhyeyā bodhisattvā avaivartikā bhaveyur iti This is what the bodhisattva wishes here Mil   years The ordinary radiance of Buddha ākyamuni is one armspan  that of Maitreya ten lis The lifespan and radiance of the buddhas are each of two kinds The real lifespan of the buddhas cannot be short  Because the buddhas are endowed with causes and conditions that lead to a long life    Thus for having once saved the life of some villagers Pokiefan obtained an immense incalculable lifespan In the world of the Brahmā gods  the lifespan does not surpass a half kalpa and this brahmadeva is alone in having an immense longevity I alone am eternally subsistent  The Buddha went to him and to destroy this wrong view told him a jātaka that Bakabrahmā is enjoying such a long life for having formerly saved a village All the more reason that the life of the Buddha should be long the Buddha who from lifetime to lifetime has saved innumerable incalculable beings either by helping them with material goods or by exchanging his life for theirs Then why should not his lifespan surpass one hundred years Furthermore the discipline of abstaining from taking life is the karmic cause and condition leading to a long life  In his great lovingkindness  the Buddha has an affection for beings which penetrates to the marrow of the bones  He is constantly dying for beings why then would he destroy life Answer  Jambudvīpa being bad the life of the Buddha there must be short In other places that are good the life of the Buddha would be long Question  If that is so the Bodhisattva who is born in the palace  of king uddhodana in this Jambudvīpa who leaves home and who realizes enlightenment is the Once there were thieves who looted and damaged a village  oppressed and tied up the inhabitants and escaped with great spoils Answer  That is not correct In the Jambudvīpas of the other universes if they know that the Buddha is fictive they would not accept his teachings or his rules with faith Let us take a strange universe where the human lifespan is a kalpa for these people a buddha of one hundred years would not even have lived for a single one of their days the people would merely scorn him and would not accept his teaching The Buddha transforms the kalpa which these beings hold as real as he pleases The Buddha said to Mañjuśrī That buddha is myself and the Buddha in turn said The Buddha ākyamuni is myself From that we know that the lifespan of the buddhas is truly limitless  In order to save beings the Buddhas manifest a long life or a short life according to the circumstances As you said above  the Buddha ākyamuni who saves beings by his magical power does not have an lifespan different from that of people there is no need for him to live for a hundred years in one single day he could perform his buddha activity    Thus one day nanda had the following thought The bhagavat Janteng  the buddha Yitsiecheng and the buddha Pipoche appeared during favorable ages their lifespans were very long and they were able to fullfil their buddha activity  My Buddha ākyamuni has appeared in a bad age and his lifespan will be very short Soon there will be no more Bhagavat and he will not be able to complete fully his buddha activity At that very moment the Bhagavat entered into the concentration of the rising sun and created innumerable buddhas as many as the rays of the sun spreading in the ten directions by emanation from his body Each of these fictive buddhas was in the universes and each one there fulfilled his buddha activity some preached the Dharma others manifested the superknowledges  others were in samādhi others took their meals in these many ways they did the work of the Buddha and saved beings On emerging from this concentration the Buddha asked nanda Did you see and hear all these things nanda answerd Yes I saw them The Buddha asked nanda Does the Buddha fulfill his buddha activity by such magical power  nanda replied Supposing that the Buddha lived only a single day even the plants of the great earth would all be saved and beings also all the more reason when he lives for a hundred years From that we know that the lifespan of the buddhas is limitless but that in order to save beings they manifest either a long life or a short life Thus when the rising sun is reflected in a body of water it is regulated by the size of the body of water if it is large the reflection lasts for a long time if it is small the reflection quickly disappears When the sun lights up a mountainof lapislazuli  crystal or pearl  its reflection lasts for a long time When fire burns plants if the latter are not numerous it is quickly extinguished but if they are numerous it lasts for a long time On the pretext that there is no more fire in the place where it is extinguished we cannot say that there were places where it burns for a long time When I have attained supreme complete enlightenment may there be no desire no hatred no delusion in my buddhafield and may even the name of the triple poison be absent and From then on may all beings be endowed with wisdom so that they recognize  If the universe is free of the three poisons as well as the name of these poisons why is the Buddha born there Answer  Desire  hatred and delusion are called the three roots of evil  these are the dharmas that have the realm of desire as their domain When the Buddha speaks of desire hatred and delusion it is a question of belonging to the desire realm but when  he speaks of afflicted ignorance  the latter penetrates all three realms for these beings the bodhisattva wishes that at the time when he becomes Buddha in his universe there will be neither the three poisons nor even the name of the three poisons  But there are also pure buddhafields that contain only nonregressing bodhisattvas with body born from the fundamental element  they no longer have any passions but retain only the traces  for them the bodhisattva wishes that even the name of the triple poison will be absent in his universe Some say When the bodhisattva formulates the vow to save all beings beings are really not all saved Similarly here when he wishes that in his universe there would not be the name of the three poisons it is clear that the three poisons will still be found there and will not be exhausted Indeed if there were no more triple poison of what use would the Buddhas still be If on earth there were no more great shadows we would not need the light of the sun As it is said in a sūtra   If three dharmas did not exist the Buddha  would not be born into the world and if these three dharmas are not destroyed it would be impossible to escape old age sickness and death These three dharmas are the three poisons Finally there are universes where beings analyzing dharmas say This is good  that is not good  this is bondage  that is deliverance  etc and they indulge in futile chatter about nirvāṇa of unique nature  This is why the bodhisattva hopes that in his universe beings do not produce the three poisons knowing full well that the true nature of the three poisons is nirvāṇa  Question  all beings are endowed with such a wisdom that What is this wisdom  Answer  This wisdom is the correct worldly view  There is generosity  there is of good or bad actions asti sukṛtaduṣkṛtānāṃ karmāṇāṃ vipākaphalam there is a world here below and a world beyond asty ayaṃ loko sti paro lokaḥ there are arhats Believing in the existence of good and bad actions  they approve of generosity  believing in the existence of arhats they approve of morality  they approve of concentration  they approve of continence  Having obtained the power of right view  they approve of nonviolence toward beings avihiṃsā sarvaprāṇibhūteṣu This mundane correct view is the root of wisdom free of impurities  bad desire and simple desire hatred is of two kinds bad hatred and simple hatred delusion is of two kinds Beings who are the victims of the three kinds of bad poisons are difficult to convert and save those who are victims of the three kinds of simple poisons are easy to save When the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra speaks here of eliminating the name of the three poisons it is a matter of eliminating the name of the three bad poisons  Question  If even the Buddha who is the king of the Dharma must disappear why should his Dharma not disappear Answer  As I have already said above this was a wish of the bodhisattva but is not itself realizable This is a bodhisattva who has made the resolution to attain abhisaṃbodhi some day and by virtue of that to become fully and completely enlightened The sūtra gives neither the name of this bodhisattva nor the name he will take once he becomes buddha The bodhisattva formulates the following wish When I shall have attained abhisaṃbodhi may beings living in each of the ten directions in universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges also be settled into abhisaṃbodhi as soon as they hear my name Only the hearing of the name is required there is no question of meditation or of recollection of the name or of vocal invocation In order to realize this wish the bodhisattva must practice the perfection of wisdom prajñāpāramitāyāṃ śikṣitavyam ie conceive it and practice it in the spirit of the prajñāpāramitā From the point of view of relative truth this wish is unrealizable On the other hand from the point of view of absolute truth the wish formulated here by the bodhisattva is completely realizable furthermore it has already been realized How does the bodhisattva practice it What is there to say The bodhisattva engaged in the perfection of wisdom does not consider all these names and not considering them does not become attached to them Furthermore O āriputra the bodhisattva engaged in the perfection of wisdom determines this bodhisattva is only a name bodhi is only a name buddha is only a name prajñāpāramitā is only a name and the practice of prajñāpāramitā is only a name That being so the bodhisattva who wishes to lead all beings to abhisaṃbodhi and buddhahood by the simple hearing of his name is the victim of an illusion since beings the buddha abhisaṃbodhi and the bodhisattva himself are purely imaginary The prajñāpāramitā itself only a name is the absence of all illusion or in other words the destruction of wrong views Empty of content though it may be and precisely because it is empty of content the Truth is liberating It is omnipotent and there is no wish that it cannot realize for the good reason that there is no wish to be realized The buddhas and the great bodhisattvas of the tenth bhūmi who have the Prajñāpāramitā as mother and the Dharmadhātu as body are mingled with the Truth and like it are allpowerful   p   l  G  Incessantly repeated according to Hnen  piously pronounced only once according to Shinran  accompanied by dance according to Ippen  the nembutsu became solely by the power of Amita and in the absence of any merit the main if not the only means of salvation The bodhisattva whom the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra presents here formulates a wish both more simple and more ambitious more simple in method for it is a matter of only the hearing of the name  and also more ambitious in method for the goal is not to be reborn collectively in the Pure Land but to establish all beings in the abhisaṃbodhi of the buddhas This goal is attained only in the perspective of the perfection of wisdom the view of emptiness People said In view of ten advantages I promulgate the following rule for bhikṣus daśānuśaṃsān pratītya bhikṣūṇāṃ śikṣāpadaṃ prajñāpayiṣyāmi and from now on this rule must be worded thus  those who see it escape from all their misfortunes  It is like akradevendra   They said That is bondage as well which liberates from the mass of suffering its memorization which protects from fire and its invocation by loud cries which saves from water Rather it notes that recourse to Avalokiteśvara profitable though it may be is less efficacious than calling upon these depersonalized buddhas that are the dharmadhātujakāya  and Mahāvastu III p feet withy it Then he made the following statement The hearing of the name alone is insufficient to produce abhisaṃbodhi Moreover the hearing of the name  by itself is not enough to obtain abhisaṃbodhi   Thus the eminent Siuta first heard the name of the Buddha rejoiced in his heart went to the Buddha heard the Dharma and thus obtained bodhi  arhats but the fruit of srotaāpanna when on the next day the Buddha gave him the graded instructions meant for lay people bb T  no ba the Pāli Vin II p ba the Sarv cb the Mūlasarv Yes O householder I did say the Buddha buddho ti tvaṃ gahapati vadesiti  buddo t āhaṃ gahapati vadāmīti Sudatta fell down at his feet After exchanging salutations the Teacher explained the graded teachings to him  It was only then that the dustfree stainless eye of the Dharma arose in Sudatta  Therefore according to the canonical sūtras it is not sufficient to hear the word buddha in order to be settled by that very fact in supreme complete enlightenment Did you say the Buddha asked Sela Yes I did say the Buddha answered Keṇiya The word buddha is indeed rare in the world Again this time the fact of having heard three times the word buddha had no more effect on Sela than it had had on Sudatta They knew that anyone bearing the thirtytwo marks is destined to become a cakravartin king or a fully and completely enlightened Buddha Fully convinced Sela and his disciples asked to be received into the order and on the spot they were given ordination Shortly afterward Sela and his companions realized in this very life the supreme goal of the religious life and recognized that they had destroyed rebirth Khiṇā jāti Sudatta as we have seen in the preceding note had to be content with the fruit of srotaāpanna Question Answer  Here the expression at the same time does not mean in one and the same mindmoment  it only means that there is no intermediary them thus does not see them this wisdom is a nonwisdom It itself is without inherent nature and character it is the absence of wrong views In this capacity it holds the force of truth There is nothing that it does not penetrate nothing that it does not realize since there is nothing to penetrate nothing to realize The nonseeing of beings and phenomena logically involves the destruction of all speech and all practice and even better the nonfunctioning  the pacification of the mind which is none other than nirvāṇa But with the example of the Buddha the bodhisattva is not only a great sage he is also a great compassionate one  When the bodhisattva cultivates the Prajñāpāramitā he sees that all dharmas are empty and that this emptiness itself is empty from then on he abolishes all seeing and acquires the Prajñāpāramitā free of obstacles The bodhisattva combines the two The methods put into use by the bodhisattva must suit the dispositions and capacities of the beings to be converted and are like the latter innumerable A canonical stock phrase emphasizes their importance And the destruction of the impurities is nirvaṇa Answer  The five skandhas as long as they are not broken or disintegrated are designated here by the Prajñāpāramitā by the name of Loka What does that say Indeed O Subhūti since the five skandhas do not exist in inherent nature they have emptiness as nature and this very emptiness does not break up does not disintegrate Thus the Prajñāpāramitā of the Tathāgatas is the revealer of the Loka  And the signlessness the wishlessness the inactivity the nonarising the nonexisting the fundamental element they also do not break up do not disintegrate Therefore O Subhūti the Prajñāpāramitā of the Tathāgatas is the revealer of the Loka  Loving sons watch over their mother who has given birth to them and brought them up into the Loka in the same way the Buddhas consider their mother to be the Prajñāpāramitā from whom they derive and who reveals to them the Loka  Thus in some Buddhist texts Loka meaning breakage has become synonymous with skandha the five psychophysical aggregates of existence They are Loka insofar as they break up  distracted mind in such a way that prajñā is produced but it cannot see the true nature of things  Also although the yogin who cultivates the six perfections and a group of many qualities is able to realize all his wishes the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra says only that he must practice the prajñāpāramitā are called perfections and bring about abhisaṃbodhi so that the succession of the Buddhas will be uninterrupted  SETTING OUT ON THE In Kumārajīvas Chinese translation  Chapter XX of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā is entitled Fatsiu pin It corresponds to pages  l  to  l This chapter deals with the stages in the career of the bodhisattva a complicated subject which has been the object of many studies for a long time the article Bodhisattva in Hastings Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics II  p  La carrire de Bodhisattva appearing in his translation of the Vijñaptiātratāsiddhi II  p  Also very useful are the studies dedicated to the Abhisamayālaṃkāra and the Prajñā literature   p  E  The career of the bodhisattva occupies a place of choice in the enormous Japanese production centered on the Mahāyāna in particular   p In the pages that follow I will borrow many references to the works of R Yamada Daij Bukky Seiritsuron Josetsu An Introduction to the Development of Mahāyāna Buddhism  A Hirakawa Shoki Daij Bukky no Kenkyū   a work condensed by its author in an article entitled The Rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism Memoirs of the Research Department of the Ty Bunko No   p  Over time the stages of the career of the bodhisattva have been the object of numerous classifications the four stages or the four practices belonging to the bodhisattvas  the ten grounds or the ten abodes reserved for the bodhisattvas  There is thus a parallelism between the career of the śrāvaka and that of the bodhisattva with the essential difference that the former pursues his own benefit above all whereas the latter assures both his own benefit and that of others  Many are the Mahāyāna texts that arrange the bodhisattva career into ten grounds daśabhūmi sa bcu

śrāvakas the pratyekabuddhas the bodhisattvas and the Buddhas respectively The list was elaborated in the Prajñā school and presents some similarities with that of the ten bodhisattvavyavasthānas mentioned above It is described in chapter XX of the Pañcaviṃśati entitled Saṃprasthānaparivarta and commented on in the present chapter of the Trait b Subhūti asked the Buddha Bhagavat what are the ten grounds which the bodhisattva completely fulfills in order to obtain anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi  The Buddha replied The bodhisattva who completely fulfills the uṣkavidarśanābhūmi the Gotrabhūmi the Aṣṭamakabhūmi the Darśanabhūmi the Tanūbhūmi the Vitarāgabhūmi the Kṛtāvibhūmi the Pratyekabuddhabhūmis the Bodhisattvabhūmis the Buddhabhūmi this bodhisattva I say who completely fulfills these bhumis obtains anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi In this passage the Buddha again explains the causes and conditions leading to anuttarā bodhi From his first production of the mind of bodhi  the bodhisattva practices the perfection of wisdom and completely fulfills the grounds from the first to the tenth These ten grounds help in realizing anuttarā bodhi These ten grounds are the uklavidarśanābhūmi etc dharmatā no longer produces any wrong views and obtains the water of the dhyānasamāpattis Some critics are surprised that the Trait places the Avaivartika in the fourth stage of the bodhisatvas career But a distinction is made here as we will see the Avaivartika is in the fourth stage of the shared levels but at the eighth stage of the grounds proper only The present passage has nothing revolutionary about it to the contrary it follows the purest abhidharmic tradition  Atha khalu bhagavān āyuṣmantaṃ subhūtim etad avocat  yad api subhūtir evam āha  kathaṃ bodhisattvo mahāsattvo mahāyānasaṃprasthito bhavati  iha subhūte bodhisattvo mahāsattvaḥ ṣaṭsu  pāramitāsu caran bhūmer bhūmiṃ saṃkrāmati  ayaṃ bodhisattvo mahāsattvo mahāyānasaṃprasthita ity ucyate  athāyuṣmān subhūtir

gacchati vā saṃkrāmati vā upasaṃkrāmati vā  api tu bodhisattva yā sarvadharmāṇaṃ bhumis tāṃ na manyate na cintayati bhūmiparikarma ca karoti na ca bhūmiṃ samanupaśyati  Then the Blessed One said to venerable Subhūti You also asked me O Subhūti how the bodhisattvamahāsattva sets out on the Mahāyāna Well then Subhūti the bodhisattvamahāsattva who going along with the six perfections passes from ground to ground is said to have set out on the Mahāyāna Then the venerable Subhūti said to the Blessed One How O Blessed One does the bodhisattvamahāsattva pass from ground to ground  The Blessed One answered The bodhisattvamahāsattva knows the nonpassing of all the dharmas indeed there is no dharma that comes or that goes that passes by or that approaches However the bodhisattvamahāsattva does not think does not reflect about the level of the dharmas and yet he practices the preparations for the grounds but does not see the grounds āstra   Above  Subhūti had questioned the Buddha about the Mahāyāna and the Buddha had answered by explaining the many characteristics of the Mahāyāna to him The bodhisattvamahāsattva going in this Vehicle knows that from the beginning all dharmas are without coming   without going  unmoving and without setting forth  because the fundamental element is eternally stable  Furthermore by minds of great compassion  by the perfection of exertion and by the power of skillful means  the bodhisattva returns to practice the good dharmas and still seeking the higher grounds  he does not grasp the characteristics of these grounds and does not see these grounds Answer  The Greater Vehicle is the grounds thus to speak about the grounds is to speak about the Greater Vehicle The grounds are ten in number to go from the first to the tenth is to start out  Thus a man riding on a horse who wants to ride on an elephant  abandons the horse and gets up on the elephant and to ride on a dragon  he abandons the elephant and mounts the dragon Question  What are the ten grounds Answer  There are two kinds of grounds i the grounds belonging to the bodhisattva alone ii the shared grounds  The shared grounds go from the ground of dry seeing to the ground of the Buddhas  produces the mind of bodhi  he forms the high aspiration which takes pleasure in abhisaṃbodhi and from lifetime to lifetime the concerns about worldly things decrease In all the virtues that he practices generosity  morality  concentration  etc the bodhisattva does not seek either the happiness of this world or that of the other world  or longevity or safety  he seeks only omniscience  Just as a miser refuses for any reason to give even a single coin  saves them and piles them up with the sole desire of becoming rich so the bodhisattva whether his merits are many or not seeks nothing other than to save them and pile them up with the view of omniscience Question  But if the bodhisattva does not yet have omniscience and has not yet tasted its flavor  how can he form the high aspiration  Answer  I said above that it is a question of someone of keen faculties  of slight passions of pure qualities who is not fond of the world Without even having heard the Mahāyāna praised he hates the world what then if he has heard it praised Thus Mohokiach had taken as wife a woman golden in color  but as he did not love her he abandoned her and entered into the religious life Also seeing in the middle of the night that his courtesans were like corpses Yech tchangtchtseu left his precious sandals worth a hundred thousand on the bank of the river crossed over the river and went straight to the Buddha śatasahasraṃ maṇipādukayugaṃ nadyāvārakāyās tīre ujjhitvā nadīṃ vārakāṃ pratyuttīryayena bhagavāṃs tenopasaṃkrāntāḥ The noblemen and kings who out of disgust thus renounced the five objects of enjoyment are innumerable Why then does the bodhisattva who has heard speak of the many qualities of the bodhi of the Buddhas not at once make the resolution  to penetrate it deeply Thus in the chapter Satopolouen which will follow the daughter of a nobleman  having heard the praises of the Buddha immediately left her home and went to Tanwoukie  Moreover as his five spiritual faculties  faith  etc are complete and ripe  the bodhisattva is able to acquire the high aspiration  A small child whose five organs  eye  etc are not complete does not discern the five objects and does not distinguish what is beautiful and what is ugly it is the same when the five spiritual faculties faith etc are not complete one does not distinguish between the good and the bad one does not know the difference between what is bondage and what is deliverance  one loves the five objects of enjoyment and one falls into wrong views  But the person whose five spiritual faculties faith etc are complete is able to distinguish good from bad If already he takes pleasure in the śrāvaka system advocating the ten good paths of action  why would he not think more deeply yet of supreme bodhi As soon as he first produces the mind of supreme bodhi he has already gone beyond the world he goes even further when he has perfected  Furthermore when the bodhisattva begins to taste the flavor of the Prajñāpāramitā he is able to produce the high aspiration  A man closed up in a dark prison who sees the light through a narrow slit leaps for joy he thinks and tells others that he alone has seen such a light and in his joy and happiness he produces a high aspiration thinking of this light he seeks to escape by any means It is the same for the bodhisattva closed up in the dark prison of the twelve bases of consciousness and of ignorance by his earlier actions  everything that he knew and saw was false but when he has heard the Prajñāpāramitā and tasted its flavor a little bit he thinks deeply about omniscience and wonders how to get out of the prison of the six sense organs  like the Buddhas and the āryas  Finally when the bodhisattva has produced the mind of supreme complete enlightenment he acts in conformity with his wish  this is why he produces the high aspiration that consists of loving all dharmas but none as much as omniscience  of loving all beings but none as much as the Buddhas of penetrating deeply into the feelings of compassion to work for the benefit of all beings  In the first ground the bodhisattva must always practice these resolutions   Sarvasattvasamacittatāparikarma sattvānupalabdhitām upādāya  yad bodhisattvaḥ sarvajñatāpratisaṃyuktaiś cittotpādaiś caturpramāṇany abhinirharati maitrīkaruṇāmuditopekṣam  The equality of mind towards all beings by not apprehending any being  When the bodhisattva has obtained this high aspiration  he equalizes his mind in regard to all beings Beings always love their friends and hate their enemies but for the bodhisattva who has obtained the high aspiration enemy and friend are equal he regards them as the same Here the Buddha himself defines the equality of mind as being the four immeasurable feelings  When the bodhisattva sees beings experiencing happiness  he produces minds of lovingkindness and joy and formulates the vow to lead all beings to find the happiness of a Buddha  When he sees beings undergoing suffering  he produces a mind of compassion and out of pity for them he formulates the vow to eradicate the sufferings of all beings When he sees beings who are neither unhappy nor happy he produces a mind of equanimity and formulates the vow of bringing them to renounce any feeling of fondness or aversion  For other explanations of these four immeasurable feelings see what has been said above  āstra  Generosity is of two kinds i Making a gift by giving up a material object  ii obtaining bodhi by giving up the fetters  The former is abandoning insofar as it rejects avarice  by contrast the latter the abandoning of the fetters plays the role of cause and condition  It is necessary to reach the seventh ground in order to abandon the fetters Question  There are several kinds of abandoning internal or external gift small or large gift material gift or gift of the Dharma worldly gift or supraworldly gift  etc Why then does the Buddha speak only of supraworldly gift free of discrimination and free of conceptualization  Answer  Although generosity is of any type the Buddha speaks only of great generosity the generosity that does not grasp the characteristics  Furthermore the Buddha subscribes to no dharma and therefore teaches the bodhisattva a generosity without adherence  in conformity with the teachings of the Buddhas Here it would be necessary to speak at length about the generosity free of discrimination  as for the other kinds of generosity they have been the object of many explanations already in several places āstra   āstra  To seek the Dharma is to write it to recite it to study it and to meditate on it These texts heal the mental illnesses of beings Thus while still a bodhisattva the Buddha ā was called Lofa  At that time there was no buddha and this bodhisattva had not yet heard a good word  but he was searching everywhere for the Dharma and did not relax his exertion  however he had not yet found it One day Māra transformed himself into a brāhamaṇa and said to him I have a stanza spoken by a buddha I will give it to you if you agree to write it using your skin as parchment your bone as pen and your blood as ink Dharmarata thought During my previous lifetimes I have lost my life an incalculable number of times without ever deriving any benefit from it Immediately he flayed his skin put it out to dry and wrote the stanza on it  Māra went to take his life when at that moment the Buddha aware of the extreme resolve of the bodhisattva arose from the direction of the nadir and came to teach him the profound Dharma Immediately Dharmarata obtained the conviction that dharmas do not arise  Satopolouen also sought the Dharma by ascetic practices  The bodhisattva ākyamuni drove five hundred nails into his body in order to find the Dharma The king Kinkien perforated his body in five hundred places and threw himself into the flames in order to light them All these heroes were seeking the Dharma by means of these ascetic practices and deeds in order to teach beings Finally the Buddha himself says here that by seeking the Dharma with omniscience the bodhisattva does not fall to the rank of śrāvaka or of prateykabuddha  āstra   The bodhisattva knows that the householder life is the cause and condition of many wrongs  If I remain at home he says to himself I myself will be unable to carry out the pure practices  how then could I lead others to practice them If I follow the rules of the householder life I would have a whip and a stick etc and I would be tormenting beings If I act in conformity with the Holy Dharma I will violate the rules of the householder life I have two things to think about if I do not leave home today I will of course be forced to leave it at the time of death if I abandon it by myself today my merit will be great Again the bodhisattva has the following thought As for myself I am abandoning home for beings in order to keep the pure morality  seek the abhisaṃbodhi of the Buddhas and fulfill the causes and conditions for the perfection of morality  Here the Buddha himself says that from lifetime to lifetime and with an unmixed intention the bodhisattva goes forth from home With an unmixed intention  for the bodhisattva does not leave home to embrace the ninetysix kinds of doctrines but only to enter into the Tathāgatas order   The Buddha hears the qualities of the Buddha praised in many ways the ten powers   the four fearlessnesses  great loving kindness  great compassion and omniscience  Moreover he sees the Buddhas body adorned with the thirtytwo major marks and the eighty minor marks  emitting a great brilliance and unceasingly honored by gods and men and he says to himself In a future lifetime I too will be like that Even if he does not fulfill the causes and conditions required to meet a Buddha already he is delighted in him and if he does fulfill them he is even more pleased Possessing the high disposition  he takes delight in the Buddha and this is why he always succeeds in meeting a Buddha from lifetime to lifetime  Having sought the Dharma as has been said above the bodhisattva preaches it to beings  The lay bodhisattva practices material generosity particularly the monastic bodhisattva in his love and respect for the Buddha always practices the generosity of the Dharma  Whether a Buddha is present in the world or not the bodhisattva  is well established in morality without seeking fame or profit  Equalizing his mind toward all beings he preaches the Dharma to them  This Dharma is good at the beginning because it praises generosity it is good in the middle because it praises morality in detail it is good at the end paryavasāne kalyāna for in reward for these two things  the bodhisattva is going to be reborn in a buddhafield or become a deity Or again the Dharma is good at the beginning because in seeing the five aggregates of attachment of the triple world abounding in suffering one feels disgust towards them It is good in the middle because one abandons lay life and separates oneself from the world It is good at the end because the mind is liberated from the disturbing emotions  Or finally the Dharma is good at the beginning because it first explains the Vehicle of the śrāvakas It is good in the middle because it explains the Vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas It is good at the end because it proclaims the Greater Vehicle The Dharma is good in meaning and good in letter  In the threefold speech the elocution may be good while the reasoning is mediocre and superficial or the reasoning may be profound and good while the elocution in imperfect this is why the sūtra says here that the meaning is good and the letter is good The Dharma is completely pure because having eliminated the stains of the triple poison it enunciates only the True Dharma  without mixing in false dharma  The Dharma is completely clear because the noble eightfold Path and the six perfections are complete in it On the twelvemembered  sūtra etc see what has been said above   The bodhisattva goes forth from home  observes morality śīlaṃ rakṣati preaches the Dharma and cuts the doubts of beings sattvānāṃ saṃśayāṃś chinatti and sometimes he becomes puffed up and experiences pride and vanity  In that case he should make the following reflection I have shaved my head I have put on the yellow robe and with bowl in hand I beg for my food This is of the nature of destroying pride and vanity in me How could I feel pride and vanity in that Moreover pride and vanity dwell in the human mind These faults stifle the qualities they are detested by men and are the source of a bad reputation In later lifetimes the prideful are always reborn among wild animals or if they are reborn among humans they are base and lowly in condition Knowing that pride and vanity have these immense defects the bodhisattva destroys this pride and this vanity in order to seek supreme complete enlightenment If the person who begs for material things should be humble and modest then what should be said about the person who is seeking the peerless bodhi Because he has destroyed pride and vanity the bodhisattva is always reborn among the nobility and never in lowly families  Truthful speech is the root of all good  the cause and condition of rebirth among the gods it is believed and accepted by all people He who puts it into practice does not pretend generosity  morality or wisdom merely by cultivating truthful speech he wins immense merit  Truthful speech is acting as one says Question  There are four vocal actions  abstaining from lying  from malicious gossip  from harmful speech and from idle speech  why does the sūtra not mention truthful speech here Answer  In the Buddhadharma truth is specially honored this is why the sūtra here speaks of the truth that encompasses the four vocal actions One obtains nirvāṇa by means of the truth Furthermore the bodhisattva who relates to beings will endure harmful words  idle words and malicious gossip  sometimes he will even commit the grave wrongdoing of false speech himself On the first ground the bodhisattva is not yet able to practice the four vocal actions fully this is why the sūtra mentions only truthful speech  in the second ground he will be able to practice it fully Question  Why is it a matter of only the ten preparations in the first ground Answer  The Buddha is the king of Dharma having mastery over all dharmas He knows that these ten preparations can produce the first ground He is like a good physician who knows the number of medicines necessary to cure the sickness sometimes five sometimes ten Therefore there is no objection that can be raised against the number  Bhūmi II   Kṛtajñatā kṛtaveditā  yad bodhisattvo mahāsattvo bodhisattvacaryāṃ carann alpam api kṛtam āsaṃsārān na nāśayati prāg eva bahu  Acknowledgement and gratitude  The bodhisattvamahāsattva traveling on the bodhisattva career does not until the end of saṃsāra forget any favor even if it is small or all the more so if it is big āstra   Some people say It is because of merits won in my previous existences that I have obtained such a benefit And so the Buddha says here that the bodhisattva must acknowledge kindnesses  Although beings in their previous existences may have acquired the rights to happiness  they would be unable to enjoy this happiness if in their present existence certain circumstances did not occur Thus the seeds of the grain are in the earth but without rain  they cannot sprout It cannot be said that the rain is of no use on the pretext that the earth produces the grain Although the benefits we gather at present have been planted during earlier lifetimes why would the fondness and kind feelings of our benefactors not play a part in these benefits Moreover acknowledgement is the source of great compassion and opens the first door to good actions  The grateful person is loved and esteemed by people his renown extends afar after his death he is reborn among the gods and finally he will attain abhisaṃbodhi In this regard the Buddha has told the story of the following Jātaka   A man went to the mountains in order to cut  wood He lost his way in a violent rainstorm and at sunset he was hungry and cold Poisonous insects and animals came to attack him and so he entered a cave in the rock In this cave there was a big bear  seeing it the man wanted to run out in fear The bear said to him Dont be afraid this cave is warm you can spend the night here The rain lotuses sat down among the elders and told them the full story  and  fig  lasted for seven days The bear constantly offered the man sweet fruits excellent water and provided him with fresh supplies After seven days the rain stopped The bear guided the man showed him the path and said to him I have been a sinner and have many enemies If anybody asks you dont tell them that you have seen me The man agreed But following on his path this man saw some hunters  One of the hunters asked him Where do you come from have you seen any game The man answered I saw a big bear but  this bear has done me favors I cannot show him to you The hunter said You have lost your way once when will you get back home If you show me the bear I will give you the biggest share  The man changed his mind guided the hunter and showed him where the bear lived The hunter killed the bear and offered him the biggest portion But just when the man stretched out his hands to receive the meat  his two arms fell to the earth The hunter asked him What wrongdoing have you committed The man answered This bear treated me like a father treats his son it is for not being grateful for his kind deeds that I suffer this punishment Frightened the hunter did not dare to eat the flesh of the bear and went to offer it to the sagha The abbot  an arhat possessing the six superknowledges said to the monks This bear was a bodhisattva in his future existence he will obtain abhisaṃbodhi Do not eat this meat Then the monks built a stūpa and paid homage to the bear Hearing about this business the king proclaimed an edict in his kingdom forbidding ungrateful people from living there any longer There are many reasons to praise grateful people They are esteemed in all Jambudvīpa and people place their trust in them Moreover the bodhisattva has the following thought Even if a man does me harm I should save him all the more reason I should save those who have done me a favor  āstra   See our lengthy explanation on the perfection of patience p Question  Patience appears in many aspects  why is the sūtra limited here to presenting it as nonmalice and nonharming  Answer  Because first produces a thought of malice and then harms someone by voice  or body pūrvaṃ vyāpādacittam utpādayati pascāt kāyena cā vācā vā parān vihiṃsati Here since it is a matter of a bodhisattva at the beginning of his career  the sūtra speaks only of patience towards beings but does not speak of patience towards things  Prāmodyaprītyanubhavanatā  yad bodhisattvasya sarvasattvaparipācanatāyāṃ pramodanatā Feeling joy and contentment  The bodhisattva feels joy in ripening all beings āstra   The bodhisattva sees that his body and voice have been purified by the observance of morality and that his mind has been purified by his feelings of gratitude and patience  Since the three kinds of action physical vocal and mental  are pure in him he experiences joy and contentment  A man bathed in perfumed water clothed in new garments and adorned with necklaces when he looks in the mirror  feels joy and contentment In the same way also the bodhisattva is very pleased at having obtained this good dharma of morality He says to himself Morality is the root of concentration and wisdom  Immense and infinite qualities will be easy to obtain by me who has just acquired this pure morality This is why he rejoices The bodhisattva established in this morality and this patience ripens beings so that they are able to be reborn in the presence of the Buddhas of other regions or enjoy happiness among gods and men Sometimes he even makes them obtain the Vehicles of the śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and the Buddhas He considers the attachment of beings as happiness and just as an adult seeing little children amusing themselves together plays with them first then gives them other playthings to make them renounce their previous toys so the bodhisattva disciplines beings by first making them obtain human and divine happiness then leads them gradually to discover the three Vehicles This is why the sūtra says here that he experiences joy and contentment  The bodhisattva who has cultivated well the mind of great compassion has sworn to save beings and his resolve is strong So as not to suffer the scorn of the Buddhas and āryas so as not to forget his obligations to beings he does not abandon them The man who has promised something to someone and who then does not give it is guilty of deception āstra  As the Buddha says here from the beginning the bodhisattva makes the following resolve concerning beings For such and such a person in particular for innumerable periods I will suffer in his place the torments of hell and I will pursue my effort until I have led him to accumulate the qualities  to become Buddha or to enter into nirvāṇa without residue of conditioning  Question Answer   but this bodhisattva has such strong resolve and loves beings so deeply that if he had the means of substituting himself for the guilty ones he would do so without hesitation Moreover the bodhisattva sees that among people there are sacrifices to the gods where human flesh is used human blood  and the five human internal organs are offered to the rakṣasas but where substitutions of people are authorized Then the bodhisattva says In the hells there must be substitutions of this kind and I am determined to take the place of others there Learning that the bodhisattvas great resolve is like that beings honor him and respect him  Because the bodhisattvas concern for beings is so profound that it surpasses even that of a loving mother  Guruśraddhāgauravaśuśruṣā  yad bodhisattvasya gurūnām antike śāstṛsaṃjñā  Faith respect and submissiveness to the teachers  The bodhisattva produces the notion of teacher ie he considers his teachers as being the Buddha in person towards teachers āstra   Because of his teachers the bodhisattva obtains supreme complete enlightenment why then would he not believe them respect them honor them High as his own knowledge and qualities may be the bodhisattva would not derive great benefit from them if he lacked respect and veneration for his teachers The excellent water at the bottom of a well cannot be reached without a rope  in the same way destroying his pride and vanity  the bodhisattva must be respectful and obedient so that the great benefits resulting from his virtues may come to him The rain that falls does not stay at the top of the mountain  but necessarily flows downward in the same way if the bodhisattva is prideful and haughty  the water of the Dharma does not enter into him But if he respects good teachers the qualities due to him fall on him Finally the Buddha has said that it is necessary to depend on good teachers so that morality  concentration  wisdom and deliverance can increase  in the same way that the trees that grow on the Himālayas their roots trunk branches leaves flowers and fruits are in full bloom This is why the Buddha said that we must honor our teachers as if they were the Buddha in person Question  But if it is a matter of bad teachers how could one serve them and trust them It is impossible to regard good teachers as the Buddha and all the more difficult to regard bad teachers as the Buddha  Then why does the Buddha here want us to produce the idea of the Bhagavat toward teachers  Answer The bodhisattva should not conform to worldly judgments  Those who conform to them are attached to the good and turn away from the bad The bodhisattva does not act in that way If some teachers are able to explain to him the profound meaning and cut the knot of his doubts  he sees his benefit there he honors them wholeheartedly and does not think about their defects If a bad purse is full of jewels  one does not refuse to take the jewels under the pretext that the purse is bad if you are traveling at night on a steep path and some thieves offer you a torch  you would not refuse this light under the pretext that the thieves are bad In the same way the bodhisattva who finds the light of wisdom in his teachers does not care about their faults Furthermore the disciple should say to himself My teacher uses the innumerable artifices of the Prajñāpāramitā I do not know why he affects this fault Thus Satopolouen heard the voice of the Buddhas of the ten directions say to him from heaven That the Dharma teacher likes what is bad is not my business what I desire is only to hear the Dharma and derive benefit from it A clay or wooden statue without any real qualities makes one gain immense merit only by evoking the idea of buddha  what then should be said about this man capable of preaching the Dharma to people with the skillful means of wisdom  Consequently although the Dharma teacher may have faults that is not very important Towards teachers the bodhisattva produces the idea of bhagavat  As I have said above the bodhisattva is different from worldly people Worldly people make distinctions between beauty and ugliness they like honest people but do not see them  as buddhas they distrust bad people and do not take them into account The bodhisattva himself is not like that he contemplates the absolute emptiness of dharmas which from the very beginning are like nirvāṇa without residue of conditioning  he looks at all beings and sees them as equal to the Buddha All the more reason that he sees as equal to the Buddha the Dharma teachers who possess the advantages of wisdom and who do the work of Buddha   Pāramitāsūdyogaparyeṣṭiḥ  yad bodhisattvasyaikacittena pāramitānāṃ paryeṣaṇatānanyakarmatayā ime subhūte bodhisattvena mahāsattvena dvitīyāyāṃ bhūmau vartamānenāṣṭau dharmāḥ paripūrayitavayāḥ  The energetic search for the perfections  The bodhisattva has the following thought The six perfections are cause and condition for supreme complete enlightenment  I will cultivate this cause and condition attentively  Merchants who diligently search for the goods asked for by the lands through which they travel farmers who diligently look for the seeds needed for the soil which they are cultivating cannot fail to succeed in their business The person who in the present lifetime practices generosity  later obtains great wealth the person who keeps the discipline later obtains noble  the person who practices concentration and wisdom obtains bodhi It is the same for the bodhisattva if he practices the six perfections  he succeeds in beoming buddha It is a matter here of energetic search  ie of constant attentive and energetic search for the six perfections Because if slackness creeps in one is stifled by the passions and overcome by Māra This is why the Buddha says here in the second ground not to relax energetic search  ca paripācayati buddhakṣetraṃ ca pariśodhayati bodhisattva na khedam āpadyate yāvan na sarvajñatāṃ paripūrayati  āstra  The bodhisattva has acquired roots of good so pure that the sadness  jealousies  malicious thoughts of the present existence are eliminated for him  When he assumes a new existence  he gathers the fruits of retribution of his roots of good he himself enjoys happiness works in many ways for the benefit of beings and purifies his own buddhafield as he wishes  The splendor of the universes surpasses that of the divine palaces  one never tires of contemplating them They soothe the minds of the great bodhisattvas and even more so those of worldly people  There are several types of shame  here it is a matter of repulsion for the state of mind of the śrāvaka and prateykabuddha The bodhisattva has made the resolution to save all beings in general If he accepted only a little suffering or like the pratyekabuddhas he wanted to go alone to nirvāṇa this would be shameful on his part If after having prepared a feast and invited a crowd of people a man was seized by an attack of miserliness and started to eat alone that would be shameful  The bodhisattva who always accumulates the qualities without ever getting tired is satisfied when he has attained supreme enlightenment  for there is no dharma superior to it As for satisfaction in regard to food clothing beds seats  etc it is a cause and condition of good dharmas but as it does not consider it to be important the sūtra does not speak of it here Dhūtaguṇānutsarjanatā  yā gambhīreṣu dharmeṣu nidhyānakṣāntiḥ   Not neglecting the ascetic rules During the course of the preparatory convictions  the bodhisattva contemplates the anutpattikadharmakṣānti The twelve dhūtas produce purity of morality  purity of morality produces concentration  and concentration produces wisdom  But true wisdom is anutpattikadharmakṣānti ikṣāyā aparityāgitā  yaḥ sarvaśikṣānām apracāraḥ  The nonabandoning of the moral dictates  The bodhisattva who understands the true nature of dharmas sees neither morality nor immorality  Although for many reasons he does not violate morality what is important for him is to cross through the gateofdeliverance called emptiness    See above Here the Buddha would say When one knows that the nature of the mind is deceptive and unreal one no longer produces even the idea of desire and all the more so one no longer experiences the objects of desire   See what has been said above about the notion of displeasure in regard to the world  Here the Buddha wants to talk about the fruit of maturation resulting from disgust for the wotld  namely the gateofdeliverance called wishlessness    Sarvāstiparityāgitā  yādyātmikabāhyānāṃ dharmāṇām agrahaṇatā  The rejection of everything exists See above  āstra   We have already spoken about this above several times The bodhisattva is informed about the nature of this nonslackening and this absence of fear and does not remain on twofold levels of cosciousness  On these twofold planes of consciousness in the sense that he does not produce  visual consciousness in regard to the eye and visibles  and so on up to The bodhisattva remains in the nonduality  Determining that the objects of the six consciousnesses are false and deceptive he makes the great vow to lead beings to remain in nonduality and to become separated from the six consciousnesses Sarvavastvanapekṣatā  yā sarvavastūnām amanasikāratā  ime subhūte daśadharmā bodhisattvena mahāsattvena caturthyāṃ bhūmau vartamānena na parityaktavyaḥ  Disdain for everything  There are many reasons for this disdain for everything but here the main one is that the bodhisattva knowing the absolute emptiness leaves home shaves his head and puts on the yellow robe  Because he always takes pleasure in the monastic condition and abhors meeting with lay people  Bhikṣuṇīsaṃstavaḥ parivarjayitavyaḥ  yad bhikṣuṇyā sārdham acchaṭāsaṃghātamātram api na tiṣṭhati na ca tannidānaṃ paritarṣaṇācittam utpādayati  Avoiding the company of nuns  See the first chapter Question  The bodhisattva considers all beings with equanimity  why does he not stay near a nun Answer  This bodhisattva is not yet nonregressing and has not yet destroyed all the impurities  but he has already accumulated qualities and is loved by men Besides he wants to avoid being slandered for whoever slanders him would fall into hell  The bodhisattva makes the following reflection I have left my own family without greed or regret why would I have greed and envy towards the families of others It is a rule for the bodhisattvas to lead all beings to find happiness why feel greed and envy for them Because of merits from their previous lives these beings are enjoying some comfort in the present lifetime and thus are making offerings to me why would I be jealous of them and envy them  āstra   These useless conversations are idle speech intended to dissipate sadness in ones own mind and in that of others They tell stories about palaces or thieves they speak about the sea or the mountains trees plants jewels foreign kingdoms or other similar things These conversations are of no use to merits  of no use to bodhi The bodhisattva has pity for beings who have fallen into the fire of impermanence  I want to save them he says How would I sit calmly chatting idly about useless things In the case of a fire people rush about how would I remain inwardly calm holding forth on something else Here the Buddha is saying that talking about things concerning the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is already a uselss conversation what then could be said of talking about something   In the mind there first arises a feeling of maliciousness which is as yet vague  The maliciousness increases becomes specific and then one strikes with a stick or an axe   Insult and gossip are feelings of quarrelsomeness  Killing torture the stick and fetters come from a feeling of hostility  In his great lovingkindness and great compassion for beings the bodhisattva does not experience these feelings he always curbs these bad thoughts and prevents them from having access   Not taking extreme dharmas into consideration āstra  The bodhisattva sees neither inner nor outer dharmas namely the five aggregates assumed to be me and the five aggregates not assumed to be me āstra   In these ten bad paths of action the bodhisattva sees multiple causes and conditions of wrongdoings  as has been said above In the present passage the Buddha makes it known that the ten bad paths of actions already destroy the Lesser Vehicle and all the more so the Greater Vehicle     The bodhisattva who cultivates the eighteen emptinesses does not see a definite mark of big or small in any dharma  Stambhaḥ parivarjayitavyaḥ  tathā hi bodhisattvas tad vastu na samanupaśyati yatrāsya stambha utpadyeta  Avoiding arrogance  Actually the bodhisattva does not see anything on which arrogance could arise  For the bodhisattva has eradicated the roots of the sevenfold pride Bhūmi VI Sūtra  Punr aparaṃ subhūte bodhisattvena mahāsattvena saptamyāṃ bhūmau vartamānena viṃśatidharmā na kartavyāḥ  beings and cannot be accepted All the others from the view of extinction and of eternity up to the view about the disciplines cannot be accepted because of the emptiness of phenomena  Question Answer  All conditiond dharmas are cause and fruit in turn But the mind being attached to these dharmas and grasping at their characteristics  gives rise to the wrong view here called view of causes  thus for example one speaks of fruit without cause or one claims that cause and fruit are identical different etc   The bodhisattva who practices the eighteen emptinesses completely completely fulfills emptiness  Moreover practicing the two kinds of emptiness the emptiness of beings and the emptiness of phenomena  is to completely fulfill emptiness Finally the bodhisattva who practices the absolute emptiness Answer  Because the three kinds of emptiness of which we have just spoken are the emptiness of specific characteristics When he was in the sixth ground thanks to his merits  the bodhisattva had keen faculties and by means of these keen faculties he still distinguished dharmas and grasped their characteristics that is why now that he is in the seventh ground the emptiness of specific characteristics constitutes for him the fullness of emptiness  Sometimes the bodhisattva sets out the emptiness of the conditioned and the emptiness of the unconditioned as being the fullness of emptiness sometimes he propounds the emptiness consisting of nonperception as being the fullness of enmptiness  Signlessness is nirvāṇa It can be vouched for  but it cannot be meditated on  Since it cannot be meditated on one cannot pretend to know it since it is immense  infinite and unimaginable one cannot claim to fulfill it completely  The three things  although they are penetrations are knowledges  but here the sūtra brings up a modification for the first two and in place of calling them knowledges  calls them  Above I spoke about the three gates of deliverance  I will not repeat it here  Trimaṇḍalapariśuddhiḥ  yaduta daśakuśalakarmapathapariśuddhiḥ  Purifying the three groups completely  That is to say purifying entirely the ten good paths of action āstra  In some people the physical acts are pure and the vocal acts impure in others the vocal acts are pure and the physical acts are impure in others still the physical and vocal acts are pure and the mental acts impure in yet others the three kinds of acts are pure but they have not rejected the prejudices about them Here in the bodhisattva  the three kinds of action are pure and he has rejected prejudices about them This is why it is said that he has purified the three groups  Sarvasattveṣu kṛpākāruṇyaparipaūriḥ  yaduta mahākaruṇāpratilanhaḥ  Completely fulfilling pity and compassion towards beings  And he does this by taking possession of great compassion  There are three kinds of compassion  i that which has beings as object  ii that which has  things as object  iii that which has no object  Here it is a matter of great compassion without an object which is the fulfillment of compassion Since dharmas are empty of inherent nature and the true nature of things itself is empty the compassion is called great compassion without object  The bodhisattva has deeply penetrated the true nature and then has compassion for beings He is like a man father of a single son who having found a precious object wants to give it as a gift to his son out of his profound affection  By leading beings to establish themselves in the ten good paths of action  the bodhisattva had already purified his buddhafield but such an adornment was not yet an obstaclefree adornment Now  the bodhisattva ripens beings but does not grasp the characteristic of being  His roots of good and his merits are pure and because of this purity he adorns his buddhafield without obstacle  Sarvadharmasamatādarśanaṃ tatra cānabhiniveśaḥ  yadutānukṣepo prakṣepaḥ sarvadharmāṇām  Seeing the equality of all dharmas without being attached to it  This is not adding anything to and not taking away anything from dharmas āstra   See what has been said above about dharmasamatākṣānti Here the Buddha himself says that it is not adding anything to and not subtracting anything from dharmas  This has already been fully developed above in many ways  Anutpādakṣāntiḥ  yā sarvadharmāṇām anutpādāya aniroddhāya anabhisaṃskārāya kṣāntiḥ  Adherence to nonproduction  This is adherence to nonproduction nondestruction nonformation of all dharmas āstra   It is believing and understanding without hindrance or regression  the true nature of dharmas having neither production nor destruction āstra  The sūtra first mentions adherence  next it speaks of knowledge here Adherence is coarse whereas knowledge is subtle  Here the Buddha himself says that is is a question of knowledge about the nonproduction of name and form    The bodhisattva knows that the twelve bases of consciousness  both internal and external  are the net of Māra  deceivers and unrealities  the six kinds of consciousness arising from these twelve bases are themselves the net of Māra as well and deceivers Then what  is real Only nonduality  The absence of the eye and visibles etc up to and including the absence of the mind and phenomena  that is reality  In order to lead beings away from the twelve bases of consciousness the bodhisattva constantly speaks to them of this nonduality in many ways  The bodhisattva established in this nonduality destroys the differentiations falsely attributed to objects  the qualities of male or female  long or short  big or small  etc  Saṃjñāvivartaḥ  yāpramāṇānāṃ saṃkalpānāṃ vivartanatā  The reversal of notions  This is the reversal of the innumerable false notions āstra   Destroying the false conceptualizations of the inner mind differentiating dharmas  Dṛṣṭivivartaḥ  yā śrāvakabhūmeḥ pratyekabuddhabhūmeś ca dṛṣṭivivartanatā  The reversal of views  This bodhisattva has first reversed the wrong views  such as the view of the self  the view of the extremes  etc next he has entered into the Path  Now  he reverses the view of phenomena and the view of nirvāṇa  because dharmas have no fixed nature  he reverses nirvāṇadṛṣṭi because in reversing the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha views he goes directly to the bodhi of the Buddhas   Kleśavivartaḥ  yaḥ sarvakleśayaḥ  Reversing the passions  By the power of his merit and his morality  the bodhisattva has first broken up his coarse passions and easily followed the Path  only the subtle passions  affection  views  pride  etc  remain in him Now in the seventh ground he also eliminates the subtle passions Furthermore the bodhisattva who uses the true wisdom sees these passions as being the same as the true nature  He is like a man endowed with the superknowledges who can change impure thngs into pure things    When the bodhisattva was in the first three grounds introspection was predominant over quietude because he was not yet able to concentrate his mind  in the following three grounds quietude was predominant over introspection this is why he had not had the assurance of attaining bodhisattvahood  Now in the seventh ground his quietude and introspection in regard to the emptiness of beings and the emptiness of phenomena are perfectly balanced  this is why he can easily travel on his career of bodhisattva Starting  the level called nonregressing  he will gradually attain the knowledge of all the aspects     Previously the bodhisattva thought about old age  sickness and death  the three bad destinies  and it is out of lovingkindness and pity for beings that he tamed his mind Now that  he knows the true nature of phenomena he is no longer attached to the threefold world and out of this detachment he tames his mind  āntacittatā  yā saṇṇām indriyāṇāṃ pratisaṃharaṇatā  Pacifying the mind  This is withdrawing the six organs āstra   Previously the bodhisattva in view of nirvāna had only tamed the first five organs   namely the eye ear nose tongue and body by withdrawing them from the five objects of enjoyment  since at that time the sixth organ the organ of mind  was too hard to tame Now in the seventh ground he also pacifies the organ of mind   Apratihatajñānam  yaduta buddhacakṣuḥpratilambhaḥ  Unobstructed knowledge  The bodhisattva attains the prajñāpāramitā and is unobstructed about everything true or false He acquires the wisdom of the Path and guides beings to make them enter into the truths He obtains unhindered deliverance and possesses the eye of the buddhas  He has no obstacles over anything Question  How can the sūtra say that the bodhisattva obtains the eye of the buddhas in this seventh ground Answer  Here one should refer to the buddhaeye  the bodhisattva has no obstacle to any dharma and this is equivalent the eye of the buddhas āstra   Although in the seventh ground he has obtained the power of wisdom  this bodhisattva still keeps his fleshly body out of consideration of his former existences  Having entered into concentration  he is detached  but when he comes out he has flashes of attachment and conforming to the visions of his fleshly eye  when he sees a beautiful person he loves him tenderly Sometimes also he is attached to wisdom  to the reality of the seventh ground This is why the Buddha tells him here to practice indifference in regard to the six sense objects  Bhūmi VIII   Buddhakṣetradarśanatā  yad ekasminn eva buddhakṣetre sthitvāparimāṇāni buddhakṣetrāni paśyati  na cāsya buddhakṣetrasaṃjñā bhavati  Seeing the buddhafields āstra   There are bodhisattvas who by the power of their superknowledges  fly in the ten directions looking at the pure universes and grasping their marks in order to adorn their own field There are bodhisattvas whom a Buddha conducts through the ten directions in order to show them the pure universes they grasp the marks of these pure fields and make the vow to reproduce them Thus the Buddha Chetseutsaiwang guided the bhikṣu Fatseu across the ten directions and showed him the pure universes Sometimes there are bodhisattvas who reminaing in their own original field use the divine eye and see the pure universes in the ten directions at first they grasp their pure marks then conceiving a mind of detachment  they return to indifferernce   As has previously been said  the eighth ground is called the level of the cakravartin Just as the precious wheel of the cakravartin king goes everywhere without  encountering any obstacle or hindrance or enemy  so the bodhisattva in this ground can cause the Jewel of the Dharma to rain down and fulfill the wishes of beings without anything obstructing him He is also able to grasp the marks of the pure fields that he has seen and build his own field on their model This body is not part of the five skandhas  the twelve bases of consciousness  the eighteen elements  his dimensions his various colors  they are adjusted to the visions which beings have as a result of actions of their previous lives  In the present passage the Buddha himself says thatseeing the Buddha is seeing the dharmakāya  he knows those who are of weak faculties  those who are of keen faculties  those in whom generosity predominates and those in whom wisdom predominates āstra   There are two ways of purifying i the bodhisattva purifies himself ii he purifies the minds of beings to make them follow the pure Path   The magician to some extent fills the universe with magical fictive objects armies consisting of the four elements  palaces and cities food and drink singing and dancing killings and calamities etc In the same way also the bodhsattva established in this concentration fills the universes of the ten directions with his metamorphoses first he makes gifts and satisfies beings then he preaches the Dharma  makes conversions and destroys the three bad destinies  finally he establishes beings in the Three Vehicles  in all these beneficent acitivities not a single one fails The mind of the bodhisattva remains motionless and he no longer grasps objects of the mind     Abhīkṣṇaḥ samādhiḥ  yo bodhisattvasya vipakajaḥ samādhiḥ  Perpetual concentration  In the bodhisattva it is the concentration resulting from retribution  Having obtained the concentration like a magic show  the bodhisattva accomplishes all his activities and with its help Now it is a matter of the existence  In the same way that a person sees visibles without having recourse to the power of the mind so the bodhisattva who is established in this concentration saves beings It easily surpasses the concentration like a magic show for it spontaneously accomplishes its role without any help Thus among those who seek for wealth some obtain it thanks to some help but others obtain it spontaneously  The bodhisattva has thus acquired the two kinds of concentration and the two kinds of superknowledge  those that are acquired by practice and those that are acquired by retribution  He knows that henceforth he will assume a form of existence with such a body such a voice such nidāna by such a path and by such means  He will even go so far as to assume an animal form of existence in order to convert and save beings āstra   In the innumerable incalculable universes of the ten directions there are beings in the six destinies  the bodhisattva ripens those who are capable of being saved and saves them There are three kinds of universes  the pure  the impure and the mixed ones Of the beings living in these three types of universe some have the privilege of being able to be saved it is those that the bodhisattva takes hold of One lights a lamp for those who have eyes and not for blind people  in the same way the bodhisattva those who already fulfill the causes and conditions or who are beginning to fulfill them Oceans of buddhalokadhātus of the same type present in the ten directions in number equal to that of the sands of the Ganges form a seed of buddhalokadhātus Seeds of the same type innumerable in the ten directions form a buddhakṣetra  Praṇidhānaparigrahaḥ  ṣaṇṇāṃ pāramitānāṃ paripūrṇatvāt  All obtain according their wishes Merits and wisdom are complete in this bodhisattva this is why there is no aspiration that he does not realize Learning that in immense and infinite universes there are masses of beings to be saved one is afraid of not succeeding in doing so This is why the sūtra here is speaking of the success in aspirations  The bodhisattva is assured of success since as the Buddha says here the bodhisattva fulfills the six perfections completely ṣaṇṇāṃ pāramitānāṃ paripūrṇatvāt The first five perfections represent the fulfillment of merits  wisdom respresents the fulfillment of wisdom   Devanāgakṣagandharvarutajñānam  yaduta niruktipratisaṃvidā  The knowledge of the languages spoken by the devas nāgas yakṣas and gandharvas  I have spoken above of the fulfillment of merits  the fulfillment of wisdom and success in aspirations  Knowing foreign languages is precisely one of the bodhisattvas wishes Furthermore the bodhisattva whose knowledge of former abodes Finally the bodhisattva has himself obtained the four unhindered knowledges or he practices the four unhindered knowledges of the Buddha This is why he knows the languages and the sounds of beings  Garbhāvakrāntisampat bodhisattvas and also the devas nāgas asuras ṛṣis āryas and noble ladies join their palms and wholeheartedly wish to see the birth of the Bodhisattva Next the Bodhisattva comes out of the right side of his mother like the full moon emerging from the clouds He emits a great brilliance that lights up immense universes At the same moment a great voice is heard in the universes of the ten directions that proclaims In that place the Bodhisattva is in his last lifetime  Sometimes there are bodhisattvas who arise apparitionally on the lotuses In regard to the four wombs  the Bodhisattva is born from the chorion or he is of apparitional birth  In regard to the four castes of men  the Bodhisattva is born either into the kṣatriya caste or in that of the brāhmaṇa for these two castes are honored by men  Kulasampat  yad bodhisattvaḥ kṣatriyakuleṣu brāhmaṇakuleṣu vā pratyājāyate  The excellence of the family  The Bodhisattva takes birth into a kṣatriya family or a brāhmaṇa family āstra  both families are useful in the world this is why the Bodhisattva is born among them  Gotrasampat  yad bodhisattvo yasmād gotrāt pūrvakā bodhisattvā abhūvaṃs tatra gotre pratyajāyate  The excellence of the clan  The Bodhisattva is born into the clan coming from the Bodhisattvas of the past āstra   When the Bodhisattva is still in the Tuṣita heaven he examines the world asking himself which clan is the most noble in order to welcome a being this is the clan in which he takes birth Furthermore the Bodhisattva who begins with the strength of high aspiration   Abhiniṣkaramaṇasampat  yad bodisattvaḥ pravrajyāsaṃaye nekaiḥ

hundreds of thousands of millions of beings and these beings are predestined to the Three Vehicles āstra   Thus one night in his palace the Bodhisattva ākyamuni saw that his courtesans were like corpses The devas and the asuras of the ten directions bearing banners and flowers came to offer them to him and bearing themselves respectfully on meeting him escorted him outside Then Tchni  despite the orders he had previously received from king Tsingfan  acceded to the wishes of the Bodhisattva and brought him his horse  The four kings messengers of the gods  held the horses hoofs in their hands while it leaped over the ramparts and left he city Episodes of this kind illustrate the excellence of the departure   Bodhivṛkṣavyūhasampat  yad bodhivṛkṣasya mūlaṃ sauvarnaṃ bhavati

qualities  In the Bodhisattva this is the ripening of beings and the complete purification of the Buddhafield These O Subhūti are the twelve dharmas which the Bodhisattvamahāsattva in the ninth ground must fulfill completely āstra   In the seventh ground the bodhisattva destroys all the passions Furthermore O Subhūti the Bodhisattva on the tenth ground should simply be called Tathāgata  Why should the Bodhisattva on the tenth ground be called simply Tathāgata When he completely fulfills the six perfections when he completely fulfills the four foundations of mindfulness up to and including the eighteen special attributes of the Buddhas when he completely fulfills the knowledge of all the aspects and when he destroys all the passions and their traces the Bodhisattvamahāsattva in the tenth ground should be called simply Tathāgata Now O Subhūti the Bodhisattvamahāsattva on the tenth ground who by his skillful means is practicing the six perfections as well as the four foundations of mindfulness up to including the eighteen special attributes of the Buddha this Bodhisattva I say exceeds  the ground of the dry view  the ground of the spiritual lineage  the ground of the eighth saint  the ground of seeing  the ground of the diminution of the passions  the ground of the saint freed from desire  the ground of the saint who has done what had to be done  the grounds of the pratykebuddha  the grounds of the bodhisattva Having exceeded these nine levels the Bodhisattva is established in the ground of the Buddhas This is the tenth ground of the Bodhisattva Therefore O Subhūti the Bodhisattvamahāsattva has set off well for the Great Vehicle āstra   The Bodhisattva seated under the tree of enlightenment penetrates into the tenth ground called ground of the Cloud of Dharma  Like a great cloud uninterruptedly pouring out torrential rain the Bodhisattvas mind produces by itself  from moment to moment and infinite in number  immense  infinite and very pure Buddha attributes Māra irritated and vexed gathers his troops and comes to attack the Bodhisattva After the Bodhisattva has vanquished Māra the Buddhas of the ten directions congratulate him for his deeds they emit rays from their ūrṇās which penetrate into the Bodhisatva through the top of his head At this moment the merits acquired by the Bodhisattva in the ten grounds are changed into Buddha attributes The Bodhisattva destroys all the traces of the passions  obtains the unfailing deliverances and acquires the ten powers  the four fearlessnesses  the four unhindered knowledges  the eighteen special attributes  great lovingkindness  great compassion and the other Buddha attributes immense and infinite At this moment the Bodhisattva emits a great brilliance that illumines the innumerable universes everywhere in the ten directions The Buddhas bodhisattvas devas and manuṣyas of the ten directions proclaim in a loud voice that in that place in that land and in that year the Bodhisattva seated on the seat of enlightenment has realized buddhahood and that this light is his Thus in the tenth ground the Bodhisattva should be recognized as Buddha Moreover in the present passage the Buddha has specified the characteristics of the tenth ground by saying By practicing the six perfections and by his skillful means  the Bodhisattva has exceeded from the level of dry vision up to and including the bodhisattva grounds and is now in the ground of the Buddhas This ground of the Buddhas is the tenth ground The Bodhisattva who thus travels through the ten grounds is said to be well set out on the Great Vehicle  The Scripture says Thus have I heard At one time the Bhagavat The phrase Thus have I heard in general refers to the enunciation of what has already been heard The second is exhortatory The third is responsive The fourth is authenticating Analogical discourse is exemplified by the sentence Monks are like treasures Exhortatory discourse is exemplified by the sentence This is the manner in which you should recite and understand the scriptures and treatises Responsive discourse is exemplified by the sentence What I am preaching is precisely what I have heard Authenticating discourse is exemplified by the sentence For you I must think this do this and say this Such discourse is thus authenticated  When assembled all the bodhisattvas ask Please speak just as you have heard The bodhisattva who transmitted this doctrine then spoke assuring them and saying I must indeed speak just as I have heard for it is in this manner that faith may be examined and confirmed This means that in all instances his discourse was in conformity with and in no way different from that doctrine he had previously heard  When questions arise must have responded with exactly what he had heard Therefore he said Thus have I heard The third opinion holds that all four kinds of discourse are involved is analogical in that the phrase Thus have I heard implies identity to what is now being enunciated  it is exhortatory in that when it was spoken the assembly must have been enjoined to listen to the content of what was heard by the transmitter The word I refers to the conventionally erroneous view of the aggregates The word hear refers to the auditory perception of the consciousness that evolves from the ear organ Although these words and images did depend directly on the power of own good roots yet since he received strong conditioning  it is called buddha discourse Thus when the Scripture says I hear it means that the mind of the hearer was itself transformed through the power of his ear organ The second opinion holds that by the power of the enabling cause of good roots and the power of the primal vow images of words and meanings were produced in the consciousness of the Tathāgata These images arose from the good roots whereby the Buddha benefits others and are thus called buddha discourse Although the mind of the hearer did not apprehend them yet because similar images became present he said I have heard Understand that the phrase Thus have I heard implies the avoidance of any increase or decrease  It means that declared in accord with the doctrine heard from the Buddha and not according to any explanation concocted by another Such a hearer had the profound ability to avoid the errors of either adding to or subtracting from that which he had heard He was not like the fool who lacks such ability and is thus incapable of avoiding these errors The transmitter of the Buddhas doctrine when he gathered up that doctrine based himself on the Tathāgatas doctrine and began by saying these words in order to lead sentient beings to revere respect believe and accept  He said a Chapter I that his words and meanings are established with neither increase nor decrease just as he had heard them from the Buddha And we having correctly heard must truthfully reflect on and assiduously cultivate them The phrase at one time refers to the time of hearing and refers to a continuous series of moments without interruption The period of speaking and hearing is generally said to be one time If this were not so then syllables words and phrases would be different when they are spoken and when they are heard How then could words be the same  Alternately he who enunciated has attained mystic formulae and in one word in one instant he was able to convey all doctrines Or when he who heard had attained the pure ear in one instant when he heard but one word everything became unobstructed to him Because of such experiences is said to have occurred at one time Or again perhaps because the time is not differentiated from the period when that assembly perceived it the text says at one time This means that the phrase at one time refers to the coming together of the common characteristics of speaking and hearing Or it is a state of mind in which images are all conventionally established in dependence upon material forms Thus it is included among those karmic formations unassociated with the mind why then do we not explain by dividing it into the sequential moments as below  If we speak only of one time then the divisions of day and night could not be established or identified in speaking opinion is that the time when this Scripture was spoken is not determined Thus we cannot ascertain whether it was spoken just in one moment or in a continuity of moments Therefore in general terms its images are said at one time The term Bhagavat comes from six interrelated meanings Since all tathāgatas are endowed with these qualities and do not lack any of them they are called Bhagavats This is to be interpreted as meaning that since all tathāgatas are never bound by any passion they are masterful Since they are consumed by the fire of flaming wisdom they are brilliant Since they are adorned with the thirtytwo major marks they are majestic Since they are recognized as being replete with all eminent qualities they are renowned Since they are approached revered and praised everywhere in the world they are blessed Since their merits are always active and bring benefit and peaceful joy to sentient beings through skillful means without ceasing they are noble Furthermore since they are able to destroy the four inimical forces they are called Bhagavats These four inimical forces are the passions the aggregates death and the demon Thus Buddha is designated by these ten qualities of the six meanings of the term Bhagavat and the four abilities to destroy inimical forces The reason why the transmitter of the Tathāgatas teaching placed this name Bhagavat at the beginning of all the scriptures is that it is honored over all the world Even heterodox teachers all refer to their founders as Bhagavat This one name encompasses a multitude of good qualities and being unlike other names it is always placed at the beginning of scriptures Later we will discuss all these good qualities of the Buddha It was the cloud gathering of the assembly of all great bodhisattvas It constantly had as servants an immeasurable number of gods dragons humans and all manner of supernatural beings It was sustained by enjoyment and delight in the taste of the great Dharma It brings about meaning and benefit for all sentient beings Its paths are great memory great understanding and great practice Its vehicles are great quiescence and wondrous insight Its entrance gates are the deliverances of emptiness imagelessness and wishlessness It rests on a kingly collection of great jeweled lotus flowers ornamented with innumerable collections of good qualities The Commentary explains This passage explains the perfections of the Tathāgatas abode for it describes the Pure Land of the buddhas Since the Pure Land is characterized by eighteen kinds of perfection it is termed completely perfected These eighteen fullnesses are color configuration extent domain cause result lords confreres servants sustenance action beneficence fearlessness abode paths vehicles entrance gates and foundation These eighteen phrases manifest the eighteen perfections This means that that august palace of such perfections is called the Buddhas Pure Land This Scripture reports the manner in which the Buddha abides in that great palace c But is this the enjoyment land or the transformation land of the Buddha The first opinion holds that that land was a magically transformed land and that the Buddha who preached this Scripture was the transformation body  because a great number of wordhearers dwelled in that land were present before the Tathāgata and listened to him preach this Scripture They were elated received it in faith and put it into practice Because of this manifestation of the Buddhas mind his pure worldtranscendent conscious construction became phenomenally perceptible in the enunciation of this eminent Dharma He magically created this land in the presence of all kinds of sentient beings and caused them to become elated and to embark upon practice If this were not so the numerous wordhearers would not have gained insight The second opinion holds that that land was the enjoyment land and the Buddha who preached this Scripture was the enjoyment body  because this land was unlimited in measure and its paths vehicles and entrance gates were all actually merits If he magically created this Pure Land by means of his wondrous body in order to benefit the multitudes and lead them to gain insight this would have been clearly stated as it is in other scriptures But it is not so stated here Thus this land is an enjoyment land of the enjoyment body The multitude of wordhearers and so forth were magical creations of the Buddha or perhaps they were the bodhisattvas who appeared in these bodies because they are the assembly to whom this doctrine is addressed in that adorned buddha land Chapter II But if this be true then this land would have been both seen and heard only by bodhisattvas above the earth Why then was this Scripture codified and preached to the bodhisattva who transmitted this doctrine in this land of the transformation buddha in order to show that universal wisdom and its abode do transcend all worldly states for thus it shows desires to cause those who are to be converted to engender gladness This was done in order to lead them to elicit the vow to be born into that Pure Land of Buddha to see Buddha to hear that doctrine and to cultivate its causal force It was done in order to engender eminent joy for sentient beings of broad victorious understanding and for all bodhisattvas It was done because he desires to strengthen such a victorious understanding of superior aspirations Moreover that doctrine was preeminent for those who heard its proclamation In such a case the transformation body which in its phenomenal defilement is not preeminent could not have proclaimed such words Thus this buddha is the enjoyment body dwelling in an enjoyment land and he preached this Scripture for all bodhisattvas from the first stage up to the last and caused them to codify and preach it But if this be the case then why did he not state that this doctrine was specifically addressed to them Even if he did not identify its location who could claim that he did not know it The correct opinion is that when ākyamuni preached this Scripture a great multitude on this earth saw his transformation body dwelling on this lower earth to preach this teaching while a great multitude above this earth saw his enjoyment body preaching this Scripture in the Buddhas Pure Land Although what they heard was identical what they saw was different Although all were elated received it in faith and put it into practice yet some understood in a shallow manner and others understood deeply The transmitter of this doctrine witnessed to the Buddhas good qualities in the presence in order to lead sentient beings to hear about his eminent wonderful vow to cultivate its causal force and to be born into a the Pure Land Thus the assembly of those who saw the Victor said that the Bhagavat dwells in utmost victory and they discoursed on the Tathāgatas merits The First Perfection Color The phrase ornamented with the seven luminous gems according to the original Sanskrit grammatical form means either that that palace employed seven jeweled adornments which were luminous or that because that great palace was adorned with the seven gems it was luminous These are what is referred to as the seven gems In truth the Pure Land is beautifully arranged and adorned with limitless wonderful gems beyond the awareness of people on this earth The phrase it emitted a great light that completely illuminated immeasurable worldrealms means that that great palace emitted a great light and illuminated all the numberless realms or perhaps because that great palace in its essence encompassed these limitless realms it emitted a great light and illuminated everything These first two phrasestreat the perfection of color in Buddhas Pure Land The phrase its immeasurable configuration was well apportioned in its distribution of dwellings means that the wondrous configuration of that great palace was well apportioned in limitless dwellings or that the limitless configuration of that palace was well apportioned in those dwellings for the word limitless can modify either the word configuration or the word dwellings The phrase that configuration was well apportioned means that that apportionment was laid out by placing priority on understanding But how can it be that the pure mind of the Buddha became phenomenally characterized this was not done by Chapter II some worldly craftsman working from the outside The meaning of the sentence that its configuration was well apportioned by placing priority on understanding is that the Buddha Bhagavat previously when he was a bodhisattva developed the wisdom of skillful means and by his earnest practice vowed to adorn this buddha land From the power of that vow of his previous practices when he had attained the result  the Buddhas pure conscious construction became manifested in this manner even though he dwelled in the wisdom of no fabrication It was this that caused the conscious construction of the bodhisattvas to be similarly transformed Thus there is no contradiction All the other passages should be understood according to this principle Extent The phrase its unlimited horizon was unfathomable in the original Sanskrit grammar means either that because the extent which that palace encompasses is unlimited it is unfathomable or that because the extent of that palace is itself unlimited and what it encompasses is unfathomable There are three opinions on the nature of the Pure Land of the enjoyment body The first opinion holds that the land of the Tathāgatas enjoyment body when proclaimed and manifested to those to be converted cannot be determined as to its extent Even though it may appear to be very extensive yet it does have limits But in order to perfect the wisdom of those bodhisattvas who are present in this land it is said to be unlimited and its extent is unfathomable The second opinion holds that the land of the Buddhas enjoyment body is the universal Dharma realm  cultivated for three incalculable eons and influenced by unlimited good roots Worldtranscendent bodhisattvas and even all the tathāgatas are unable to fathom its unlimited extent Therefore they consider it to be unlimited from time without beginning The second is the enjoyment body for others whereby all tathāgatas lead the multitudes of worldtranscendent bodhisattvas to enjoy the great Dharma This body for others advances and cultivates victorious conduct and is manifested as appropriate Whether superior or inferior large or small it is subject to change and undetermined just like the transformation body It is thus that the Pure Land is considered to have limits The phrase its domain surpasses anything in the triple world means that the location of that great palace transcends anything that might be found in the triple world It is dissimilar to this world where covetousness and craving for the objects of the two obstacles of passion and to knowledge hold sway and ever increase These and those mature and become the dominant results of life in this world But one cannot grasp that Pure Land by the covetousness of this world because it is liberated from the two obstacles and does not produce such dominant results  It is like unto cessation which transcends the realm of all the results of maturation in the triple world if this is so then the Pure Land is not included in the triple world Then it must be uncontaminated And if it is included in the category of uncontaminated but conditioned things then it must be identical with the truth of the path and goodness itself How then can that Pure Land employ material form voice smell and so forth as its own characteristics It has been taught elsewhere that of the eighteen realms which support perception and are thus necessary for such material forms voices smells c Chapter II and so on fifteen are contaminated while eight may be morally neutral Thus if the Pure Land is uncontaminated it cannot be characterized by such contaminated or at best neutral material forms and so on The first opinion holds that the eighteen realms  whether contaminated or uncontaminated are all entirely good When it is said that of the eighteen realms fifteen are contaminated or eight morally neutral this refers to the gross characteristics of the objects the lower vehicles But if this be so then the five sense consciousnesses of the bodhisattvas would not have that blissful land as the object of their perception although they do rely on their own powers  and their own consciousnesses do mature yet because of the in the grossness and subtlety of the images in their minds those minds do not resemble the  the phenomenal activities of a buddha in taking sense objects as their objects do resemble  but he is said to have these five sense consciousnesses only by conventional designation while in reality he does not have them at all since he constantly dwells in concentration Other texts teach that by their nature the five sense consciousnesses are the essence of distraction because they lack concentration Thus if a buddha is in concentration he does not really have the nonconcentrated sense consciousnesses if this be so then the consciousness of a buddha would not arise from the sense organs at all the five sense organs and their objects are conventionally designated as the five sense organs because they are described as being the same as those objects of sensation but his objects of material form and so on are transformations of his concentrated mind In truth they are material forms produced from the mastery of the Dharma realm if this be so then the four wisdoms would not be simultaneous because since a buddha would have only the container and thinking consciousnesses the four wisdoms would then not be simultaneous because many consciousnesses of the same kind do not arise simultaneously  there is no error in admitting that It is neither existent nor nonexistent neither contaminated nor uncontaminated neither good evil nor neutral It is not included within the teachings on the aggregates and the realms but is enunciated differently as appropriate When other texts teach that among the eighteen realms of perception fifteen are contaminated or eight neutral this refers to the gross discrimination of sense objects by those in the two vehicles ie of individually enlightened ones and wordhearers or by common worldlings and does not touch upon the profound sphere of all buddhas and great bodhisattvas for it is elsewhere taught that the tathāgatas are not really included within the aggregates supports and realms  but manifest only what is good if that be the case the Pure Land is identical with or different from the triple world Again there are three opinions The first opinion holds that it is different for some texts teach that it is located above the pure heaven of the gods while others teach that it is to be found somewhere off in the west Chapter II The second opinion holds that it is identical because the Pure Land extends in its limits to the universal Dharma realm The third correct opinion holds that the land of enjoyment does extend to the universal Dharma realm and has no place in which it is not present But it cannot be described either as apart from the triple world or as identical with the triple world When it is that which is appropriately manifested to bodhisattvas then the question of whether it is a purification of the world of material form is located in the heavens or is off in the west cannot be determined Cause since the Pure Land has such a perfection of domain then it transcends the realm of the results of maturation in this triple world and like cessation cannot have any cause For if it had a cause then it would necessarily be included within this triple world But since it is taught that the Pure Land transcends this triple world it must also transcend all the causes of this triple world Its characteristic must then be said to be the absence of cause How then are we to understand the phrase that it arises from good roots beyond those that transcend the world this meansthat that great palace has asits cause the good roots of both transcendent nondiscriminative and subsequently attained wisdoms It is thus that it arises for it does not lack a cause but that cause is not the great god śvara nor anything within the world of material form how can the Pure Land transcend this triple world and yet employ the transcendent nondiscriminative and subsequently attained wisdoms Are not all pure states in this world such as subsequently attained wisdom caused by the process of maturation We do not teach that the Pure Land is caused by the process of maturation as are those other  It arises from a cause other than that a cause similar to the highest worldly state of wisdompatience that understands suffering It employs both the basic nondiscriminative wisdom and the subsequently attained uncontaminated seeds of good states and by cultivating them for three incalculable eons causes them to increase This is the cause for the magical creation that is the Pure Land a Nondiscriminative wisdom is termed worldtranscendent But its cause is the subsequently attained wisdom that goes beyond that and is termed the preeminent employment of those transcendent uncontaminated good roots In other words the holy path of the wordhearers and the individually enlightened ones is termed worldtranscendent while the good roots of tathāgatas surpass even these and are termed preeminent Therefore the Pure Land of the Buddha takes as its cause these uncontaminated good roots in the consciousness of the Tathāgata and thus arises The second opinion holds that the Pure Land arises by direct causality because are able immediately to produce it If this were not so then it would have no direct cause at all because the images of external things in the consciousness of sentient beings cannot be its direct cause All such external things have as their cause the permeation of internal states if external things have the internal permeation of seeds in the container consciousness as their cause then since have a common existence how can individual sentient beings have their own individual seeds Since the direct cause would be common to all of them then it would have to produce one common result  The above statement assumes that real atoms actually exist and that they account for the similarity of objects in consciousness But how could it be that external things are actually compounds unified from these many causes which are the atoms It is just like the light from many lamps or things seen in a dream for such images are similar because the same kinds of causes produce the same kinds of results That which is not differentiated Chapter II in its support in the similarity of the container consciousnesses of individual sentient beings actually becomes individualized and differentiated only by conventional designation The Buddhas Pure Land is like this for the magical creations of the individual conscious constructions encompass the universal Dharma realm These are said to be common to many buddhas because of the similarity of their grounding within that Dharma realm Such is the perfection of cause in the Pure Land The Sixth Perfection Result What are the characteristics of its result The phrase it was characterized by perfectly pure and masterful conscious construction means that that great palace was characterized by the Buddhas uncontaminated mind of utmost mastery This is so because only conscious construction exists and apart from such conscious construction there are no separately existing gems or anything else  This means that the pure mind of the Buddha in its transformations appears as these multitudinous gems and so forth As has already been explained these objects are similar to those of a person who has entered the concentration of totality focused on blue and so on These objects which are manifested by conscious construction are the pure conscious constructions associated with the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom because they are directly caused by the uncontaminated seeds of the Pure Land which he has previously cultivated for his own benefit At all times and in all places these objects do not wait upon any activity of thinking but manifest themselves spontaneously This enjoyment land adorned with its gems has as its support the enjoyment body for oneself But as directly caused by the pure uncontaminated seeds that benefit others as manifesting Pure Lands whether large or small whether superior or inferior as appropriate for the bodhisattvas this Pure Land is also supported on the enjoyment body for others This means that as appropriate for bodhisattvas in the first stage a buddha manifests small and inferior  and as they develop through the other stagesthese become large and superior for this is how they function from the beginning until the final  Such is the perfection of result in the Pure Land b The Seventh Perfection Lords What of its lords Every palace must depend on a lord The phrase it is the support for tathāgatas means that in that palace all Buddha Bhagavats are lords since only they are so preeminent Only those associated with Bhagavats support and maintain it for no others are capable of so doing Although the enjoyment body for oneself and its land encompass the Dharma realm yet there is no contradiction here with the successive magical creations of its individual lords And although the enjoyment body for others and its lands are the magical creations of all buddhas there is no contradiction here with its being supported by lords either as a unified body and land of many buddhas or as an individual body  Confreres There must be confreres for every lord gathers confreres around himself The phrase it is the cloud gathering of the assembly of all great bodhisattvas means that that great palace constantly had a cloud assembly of innumerable great bodhisattvas All those who stand before are his assembly and they constitute a community of innumerable great bodhisattvas Because they have become his confreres there is no evil capable of injuring them All the wordhearers are not like this at all This means that all the bodhisattvas from the first stage although unable to assemble in the pure enjoyment land for oneself of any buddha yet are able to gather in a pure enjoyment land of the enjoyment body for others Since in their own minds buddhas are compassionate they reveal lands either gross or subtle to these bodhisattvas as appropriate The bodhisattvas because of their own good roots and the power of their own vows elicit images in their own minds similar to the Pure Lands produced by the buddhas Although their minds are each separately transformed yet in their configuration they all resemble that one place This is what is meant by their gathering together in that one Land that Pure Land of those bodhisattvas above the world is contaminated or uncontaminated By means of a magical creation within their own minds they give rise to a Pure Land and therein enjoy the great Dharma The entire assembly of these bodhisattvas from the first stage on up  realizes the truth of suchness attains the true uncontaminated support and the true outflow from that reality dwells in that Pure Land and always sees all the buddhas Therefore that magically transformed land consists exclusively in the reality of the uncontaminated path The second opinion holds that it is contaminated because in their own minds these bodhisattvas at the stage of intensified effort are equipped with the seeds and the vow power of a contaminated Pure Land This is so because even though these bodhisattvas realize suchness and attain a true uncontaminated state still in the first seven stages passion does yet arise Even until the tenth stage there are still present the seeds of passion which have to be eliminated by the practice of meditation The obstacle to knowledge is still present because the container consciousness is able to support it and receive its permeations Consequently this land consists of a morally neutral contaminated nature But if in the ten stages the essence of the container consciousness was good and uncontaminated then of the buddha land would not be capable of receiving any permeation at all because it would not be capable of supporting contaminated seeds  The essence of the container consciousness is morally neutral and contaminated How then could the Pure Land which is a conversion of this consciousness consist in a goodness that is uncontaminated Furthermore each sentient being has but one actual body and as long as he has it it is contaminated How then could a Pure Land of such a body be uncontaminated But in the case where those images of the Pure Lands are magical creations of the uncontaminated subsequently attained mind then they consist in the truth of the uncontaminated path because they consist in an uncontaminated image and arise from uncontaminated seeds Thisisthe perfection of confreresin the Pure Land Servants Since there must be servants the Scripture next teaches that it had as servants an immeasurable number of gods dragons humans and all manner of supernatural beings This means that that great palace has as its servants only such gods and so on for it does not have any other kinds of beings The phrase all manner  includes yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas The mahoragas are great pythons But how can the Pure Land transcend this triple world and yet have gods and so on as its servants All such beings belong within this triple world the Pure Land simply takes on the appearance of these in order to be adorned and thus there is no contradiction here Or perhaps these various magical creations appeared in order to bring sentient beings to maturity just as in converting King Kapphina innumerable universal monarchs appeared all about  Or perhaps these innumerable magical creations were bodhisattvas in the bodies of the gods and the dragons and so forth dwelling in the Pure Land in order to pay homage to the Buddha Or perhaps the Buddhas own transformation bodies took on the forms of these gods dragons and so forth But inasmuch as they are the servants of the Tathāgata there is no error here Such is the perfection of servants in the Pure Land The phrase it was sustained by enjoyment and delight in the taste of the great Dharma means that nourished by joy in the Dharma of the Great Vehicle they were able to dwell there This is the meaning of their sustenance But it has already been explained that the Pure Land surpasses anything in the triple world How then can there be any eating there Furthermore uncontaminated states of consciousness cannot be said to be eaten Eating can nourish sentient beings in this triple world but since these Pure Land beings have severed their existence they should not be said to eat at all it is because is the cause which gives them nourishment that the word sustenance is used here Now even you will admit that when one is born into the world of form and there enters a uncontaminated concentration he is said to be nourished therein He is not said to be nourished because in the past he has eaten because the past does not exist So it is with the above passage for they are said to be nourished inasmuch that is the cause which sustains them Although contaminated states are indeed obstacles to uncontaminated ones yet since they do sustain contaminated attachments in the earlier stages of the path those contaminated states are said to nourish In like fashion uncontaminated states although they sever contaminated states yet do sustain those uncontaminated states Thus they also can be said to nourish In this Pure Land all buddhas and bodhisattvas subsequently attain the uncontaminated state and it can be said of them that they are able to enjoy the taste of the great Dharma and thus to elicit great enjoyment and delight Furthermore the wisdom of true reality enjoys the taste of suchness and thus elicits great enjoyment and delight It is able to sustain the body and prevent it from coming to harm It can nourish good states and is thus said to nourish The phrase it brings about meaning and benefit for all sentient beings means that its itself can bring about all meaning and benefit for all sentient beings or that it can lead those sentient beings themselves to bring about all meaning and benefit The phrase it destroys the oppressive defiled proclivities of passion means that there one is far removed from the defiled proclivities of all passion and its oppression All the passions are called defiled proclivities and they are the causes of oppression Since these defiled proclivities of passion are not present there the oppression they bring about is also absent there Furthermore these passions refer to the one hundred and twentyeight basic passions The proclivities are lack of shame and so forth Defilements mean flattery deceit pride and so forth Oppression refersto the karmic actions that result from these If the obstacle to knowledge and itsinclination be termed a passion then its arising is also termed a defiled proclivity basic doubt is called a proclivity and its inclination a defilement the obstacle to knowledge and its inclination are said to be an oppression It is precisely the elimination of these oppressive defiled proclivities that is termed its beneficence Just as a ruler of some worldly region who might not actually cherish  b Chapter II might be described as conferring beneficence on them because he does them no harm just so the realization and attainment of liberation from those oppressive defiled proclivities of passion is a conferral of beneficence because it is an eminent blessed wisdom The phrase it expels all inimical forces means that there one is far removed from the inimical forces of passion the the aggregates death and the demon or that one can cause others to be far removed from these four inimical forces These four are the causes of dread since they can engender all kinds of dread Since they are absent there there is no dread The inimical force of passion refers to the one hundred and twentyeight passions and their accompanying inclinations The inimical force of the aggregates refers to the five aggregate heaps  The inimical force of death refers to the fact that all internal contaminated states are impermanent The inimical force of the demon refers to that ruler of the Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven in the world of desire  Since these four can diminish and injure all good things they are termed inimical forces From these four inimical forces all dread arises Because a tathāgata is eternally apart from these four inimical forces he is fearless Bodhisattvas from the first stage are also freed from them and thus lack any of the five fears of poverty bad reputation death falling into evil or going before crowds Such is the perfection of fearlessness in the Pure Land The Fourteenth Perfection The phrase it is arrayed by the Tathāgata to surpass all arrayments means that the Tathāgatas abode surpasses all the arrayed abodes of the bodhisattvas or of anyone else For it is only this abode that has been arranged and adorned by the Tathāgata himself Therefore it surpasses all other arrayed abodes and is called the perfection of abode Paths What are the paths along which one travels there The phrase its paths are great memory great understanding and great practice means that there great memory great understanding and great practice are the paths to follow Because they are that along which one travels they are termed paths This pathway has different names Great memory is the wisdom perfected from hearing for it articulates the unfailing meaning of what has already been heard Great understanding is the wisdom perfected from reflection for it rationally discerns and attains certitude Great practice is the wisdom perfected from the practice  for in virtue of the force of such practice it arrives at truth Such memory understanding and practice are great because they arise by taking as their content the teaching of the Great Vehicle and are its results Since it is by following these wondrous wisdoms that the Pure Land is traversed they are called its paths This means that they are called its paths because it is through these three wisdoms as the cause for becoming a bodhisattva that one realizes entrance into the Pure Land As the great memory of all tathāgatas they are identical with nondiscriminative wisdom since in virtue of such memory one peacefully abides in the truth of suchness Great understanding is identical with subsequently attained wisdom since it distinguishes all the conventional characteristics of the truth of all things It is these two which bring about the enabling action of the Pure Land and therefore they are also called its activity Since due to these two wisdoms one attains birth in the Pure Land they are called its paths In other words the practice of great memory is the practice of selfbenefit since it is uttered within while the practice of great understanding is the practice of benefiting others since it discerns externals This is the sequence whereby a tathāgata by means of his wondrous understanding gives rise to the two kinds of Pure Lands Thus they are called its paths Vehicles There must also be vehicles whereby one can ride along those paths Thus the Scripture next explains that its vehicles are great quiescence and wondrous insight Quiescence means concentration while insight means wisdom Thus the Scripture explains that its entrance gates are the deliverances of emptiness imagelessness and wishlessness This means that these three deliverances are the entrance gates to that great palace Deliverance refers to transcendent cessation Great emptiness and the other two are termed deliverance gates The Pure Land is entered through these gates Emptiness means the absence of self for selfhood is a state produced by clinging to what is entirely imagined Taking this as the content of concentration is what is meant by the deliverance gate of emptiness Since cessation lacks any image it is called imageless A concentration with such a content is what is meant by the deliverance gate of the imageless Wish means to seek after But insight into suffering in this triple world lacks anything it might seek after Thus it is called wishless A concentration with such an object is referred to as the deliverance gate of the wishless Because one enters the Pure Land through these three deliverance gates of emptiness imagelessness and wishlessness they are called its entrance gates The meaning of the word great is as explained above These paths vehicles gates and so forth which are associated with and located in the Pure Land serve the purpose of leading sentient beings to enjoyment and delight in the true merits  This is our interpretation of their function The line it rests on a kingly collection of great jeweled lotus flowers ornamented with innumerable collections of good qualities means that just as the earth rests on the windwheel and just as a palace in this world rests on that earth just so that great palace rests on that kingly collection of great jeweled lotus flowers ornamented with innumerable collections of good qualities This means that that palace is constructed from lotus flowers and great gems and thus arises from the collected goodness of innumerable good qualities Because these gems are the best among gems they are called great and because these flowers are the best among all flowers they are called kings of flowers Or perhaps because these flowers are the best of the lotuses that arise from the good roots of bodhisattvas they are called great while because they arise from the eminent good roots of buddhas the kings of Dharma they are called the kings of flowers Furthermore since these gems and flowers are rare they are said to be kings of flowers Because there is more than just a single one and because their petals are many they are said to be a collection This Scripture explains that the Bhagavat dwells among this collection of flowers and there places his palace If that palace refers to that Pure Land which is grounded on the Tathāgatas true enjoyment body then we say that such a palace is coterminous with the Dharma realm and in such a Pure Land each and every enjoyment body of the Buddha would be able to preach this Scripture as his basic theme But if that palace refers to the Pure Land which is grounded on the enjoyment body of a tathāgata as it is manifested appropriately to the bodhisattvas then its extent is undetermined and in such a Pure Land all buddhas in unison manifest a single body and preach this Scripture The extent of that palace cannot be determined The Scripture next describes how a buddha is different from other masters This is why it explains that the Bhagavats good qualities are preeminent Also so that others might engender pure faith it explains the perfection of the Bhagavats good qualities Understand that these include twentyone kinds of eminent good qualities Introductory Section The Buddhas Complete Enlightenment The phrase the Bhagavats purest enlightenment means that the Buddha Bhagavat is completely enlightened as to all necessary objects of understanding whether conditioned or unconditioned It means that in pure and wondrous perfection he is completely enlightened to all necessary knowables that he is completely enlightened to the universal nature of all just as it is and to the b limits of its existence Absence of Obstacles The phrase that  does not elicit the two refers to that preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat completely lacks obstacles This means that the Bhagavat lacks the two obstacles of passion and to knowledge which obtain among common worldlings and adherents of the lesser vehicles Common worldlings elicit transmigration and bring about attachment to that transmigration But the wordhearers and individually enlightened ones elicit cessation delight in and become attached to that cessation In contrast since the Bhagavat does not elicit these two obstacles it is said that he does not elicit the two The Second Quality Skillful Means in Converting Beings The phrase he has arrived at the imageless Dharma refers to the preeminent quality of the Buddhas skillful means in converting This means that the imageless Dharma is cessation The Buddha well understands the skillful methods whereby sentient beings according to their capacity are made docile and converted and in such a manner he comes to address them in order to lead them to enter and realize the imageless Dharma The Third Quality Discernment The phrase he dwells in the abode of awakening refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat discerns those who are to be made docile and converted This means that dwelling in great compassion day and night at the six times  he discerns the world The Fourth Quality Equality of Activity The phrase he realizes the equality of all buddhas refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat attains an activity identical with that of all Chapter III buddhas This means that he realizes that all buddhas are identical in their activity in virtue of this equality Elimination of Obstacles The phrase he reaches the place of no hindrance refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat eternally eliminates what must be eliminated This means that he has already realized liberation from the two obstacles of passion and to knowledge and is constantly apart from any obstacle Unfailingness of the Teaching The phrase his Dharma is unfailing refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat subdues the teachings of nonBuddhists This means that the true Dharma of the Buddha cannot be overturned by any teaching of the nonBuddhists since it has already subdued them in the very manifestation of that true Dharma Invincibility The phrase his activity is invincible refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat subdues inimical forces All actions are directed toward material form and and when they scatter the mind and hinder the good they are termed inimical forces But the minds of all Buddha Bhagavats are well set in concentration and well disposed so they are not scattered Because this quality has attained perfection no evil can hinder them Thus they are able to subdue all objects and in virtue of the fact that all their activity  Inconceivability of the Teaching The phrase that which he has established is inconceivable refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat establishes the Dharma This means that the Dharma established by the Buddha transcends the sphere of rational inquiry Equality of Time The phrase he attains equality in regard to the three times refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat makes declarations in the three times This means that without any obstacle he declares events of the past and future as if they were in the present Manifestation of Transformation Bodies The phrase his body issues forth to all worldrealms refers to that preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat descends from the Tuṣita Heaven This means that in all worldrealms whatsoever he manifests transformation bodies because at those times he enters his mothers womb Severance of Doubt The phrase his wisdom is unperplexed in regard to all things refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat is severed from all doubt This means that in regard to all things he has attained the wisdom of certitude which is able to expel all doubt The Twelfth Quality Appropriate Manifestation of His Body The phrase in all his actions he perfects great enlightenment refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat is able to manifest his body as appropriate to sentient beings in any vehicle This means that he completely understands the differences in the lineages and habits of all sentient beings and as appropriate manifests his body to them Absence of Uncertainty in Teaching The phrase in all doctrines his wisdom lacks uncertainty refers to the preeminent quality whereby in the wisdom that wondrously comprehends all doctrines the Bhagavat is able appropriately and constantly to teach and Chapter III admonish correctly This means that whereas all those who cling to uncertainty regarding any teaching lack such a profound ability to teach and admonish appropriately the Buddha Bhagavat alone in the full certainty of his wisdom that understands all doctrines is able to teach and admonish appropriately unfailingly and ceaselessly The Fourteenth Quality His Undefiled Body The phrase all the bodies which he manifests cannot be separated refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat is able to support his undefiled bodies This means that all the buddha bodies do not arise from unreal imagining because they lack the defilements of passion action and birth Perfecting Bodhisattvas The phrase his is the wisdom that is well sought after by all bodhisattvas refers to the preeminent quality of his uninterrupted skillful means whereby the Bhagavat brings those of buddha lineage to perfection This means that all bodhisattvas in order to maintain their buddha lineage without interruption intensively cultivate practice Such is not the case with the wordhearers Thus that buddha wisdom is well sought after only by the bodhisattvas The Sixteenth Quality Nonduality of the Dharma Body The phrase he attains that victorious far shore of the Buddhas nondual abode refers to the preeminent quality of the Bhagavats essence body This means that because the Dharma body of awakening is characterized by nondiscrimination it is said to be nondual The Buddhas nondual abode is precisely that Dharma body Its essence is suchness Such dwelling in nonduality is precisely that victorious far shore Since the Buddha has already realized this he is said to have attained it a The Seventeenth Quality Deliverance through the Enjoyment Body The phrase that undivided deliverance wisdom is brought to full perfection refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavats enjoyment body is differentiated This means that the enjoyment body is not divided because these enjoyment bodies of the Tathāgata are each separate things Because the wisdom of the Tathāgata is able to lead all sentient beings to engender deliverance speaks of the deliverance wisdom of the Tathāgata for in this wisdom the Buddha has already attained full perfection In the great assembly he manifests various bodies and thus the enjoyment of Dharma by all the bodhisattvas is also undivided The Tathāgata in the bodies manifested by his wisdom has arrived at full perfection Unlimited Suchness The phrase he has realized the equality of buddha lands without limit refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Tathāgata realizes the characteristic of suchness This means that suchness has no limits because it is far removed from any limiting descriptive marks whether conditioned or unconditioned and from any limiting marks of location Thus suchness is precisely the reality nature of the equality of buddha lands Because he has realized the universal equality of these buddha lands he completely knows all conditioned and unconditioned things without confusion The Nineteenth Quality The Pure Dharma Realm The phrase he reaches to the ultimate Dharma realm refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat attains the result Inexhaustibility The next two kinds of preeminent good qualities refer to the inexhaustibility of the Bhagavats good qualities The phrases he reaches to the limits of empty space and he will never come to an end refer to the two inexhaustible preeminent good qualities whereby the Bhagavats selfbenefit benefits others This means that just as empty space in its passage through the successive formations and dissolutions of the eons is constant and inexhaustible so all the Tathāgatas true and good qualities are also constant uninterrupted and inexhaustible Just as the future is not exhausted at any moment so his good qualities which benefit others will never come to an end for he constantly brings about benefit and joy for all sentient beings In the following section we are going to present another commentary  one which outlines the specific meaning of each of the scriptural phrases The words of the Scripture are the standard which are then explained in these interpretations Therefore this will be a summary of the doctrine which has just been explained on the twentyone kinds of preeminent good qualities This means that wordhearers do have obstacles to wisdom and do discriminate without limit as to time and place because they lack the functioning of wisdom in the awakened state The Tathāgata is not like them for in regard to time place and any discrimination at all his omniscient wisdom evolves without obstacle in the awakened state and lacks the dichotomy of either knowing or not knowing in regard to everything It is because of this that the Scripture next speaks of the purest enlightenment Nonduality The phrase he has arrived at the imageless state refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat is able to enter nonduality This means that he is able to enter suchness which itself is characterized by the constant absence of imagination by freedom from the proclivities of all passion and by purification from the descriptive marks of existence or nonexistence Effortless Activity The phrase he dwells in the Buddha abode refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavats effortless activity is never at rest This means that that activity by which he effortlessly benefitssentient beingsis never interrupted nor cut off because he dwells in that noble heaven that Brahmā abode Impartial Activity The phrase he realizes the equality of all buddhas refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavats bodies thoughts and actions are not discriminated because they are supported on the essence body This means that the activities whereby he benefits others are not discriminated one from the other because of the pure suchness wisdom of all buddhas because of his thoughts that bring benefit and happiness to all sentient beings and because of both his enjoyment and his transformation bodies Suppression of Obstacles The phrase he reaches the place of no obstacle refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat has already cultivated the suppression of all obstacles This means that he has already cultivated the holy path which suppresses all obstacles of passion and to knowledge and has already arrived at that place which is freed from all obstacles Place here means that on which he relies that to which he has gone Unfailingness of the Teaching The phrase his Dharma is unfailing refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat is not vanquished by any unorthodox teaching The Seventh Quality Invincibility The phrase his activity is invincible refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat cannot be overcome by the worldly factors of gain and so forth although he appears in the world Inconceivability of the Teaching The phrase that which he has established is inconceivable refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat establishes the true Dharma This means that that preeminent Dharma of twelve sections transcends the activities of all rational inquiry It is not something that fools can comprehend Because he proclaims all the individual and common descriptions  the Scripture says that he establishes it Nonduality The phrase he attains equality in regard to the three times refers to the preeminent quality whereby he is able truly to make declarations This means that he declares the past and the future as if they were present because the meaning of his words which encompasses the three times produces declarations in regard to what has appeared and in regard to what has yet to appear  Manifestation of Bodies The phrase his body issues forth to all worldrealms refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat at the same time and in all worldrealms whatsoever manifests enjoyment bodies and transformation bodies This means that in all worldrealms without limit he manifests bodies as wondrously colored as precious gems as appropriate to those to be converted The Eleventh Quality Severance of Doubt The phrase his wisdom is unperplexed in regard to all things refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat severs all doubt This means that he is firmly established and can lead others to become so firmly established Appropriate Manifestation of Bodies The phrase in all his actions he perfects great enlightenment refers to the preeminent quality whereby he leads to undertake various practices Discernment The phrase in all doctrines his wisdom lacks uncertainty refers to the preeminent quality of wondrous wisdom whereby the Bhagavat discerns the genesis of all future doctrines This means that his complete awareness transcends the range of the wordhearers and unfailingly knows the subtlest good seeds  just as one might recognize flecks of gold in stone pottery Nondiscriminative Manifestation The phrase all the bodies he manifests cannot be separated refers to the preeminent quality of the Bhagavats manifestations which flow from his perfect understanding This means that the Buddha Bhagavat just like a wishfulfilling gem renders visible the bodies of a tathāgata of a golden hue c Chapter III through the enabling power of all tathāgatas and the power of his own victorious understanding although he lacks any discrimination As the scriptures all explain all tathāgatas neither discriminate nor imagine to be separate one from the other Support of the Bodhisattva Mission The phrase his is the wisdom that is well sought after by all bodhisattvas refers to the preeminent quality of the skillful means whereby he makes docile the sentient beings to be converted through his unlimited bodies This means that his mission progresses in an uninterrupted continuity in conferring benefit on all the bodhisattvas who because of the Tathāgatas enabling assistance have attained wondrous wisdom through the process of hearing reflecting on and practicing the true Dharma Nonduality Replete with Perfections The phrase he attains that victorious far shore of the Buddhas nondual abode refers to the preeminent quality of the completion of the perfections of giving and so forth in the equality of the Dharma body This means that in the nondual Dharma body of the buddha land all the perfections of giving and so forth are equally complete without confusion The Seventeenth Quality Manifestation of Buddha Lands The phrase that undivided deliverance wisdom of the Tathāgata is brought to full perfection refersto the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat manifests undivided pure buddha lands according to his perfect understanding This means that he discerns the differences in the understandings of sentient beings and manifests all kinds of undivided buddha lands of gold and so forth Limitless Equality The phrase he has realized the equality of buddha lands without limit refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavats three bodies have no limit This means that having realized this universal equality without any division of before or after the three bodies of Buddha have no limitations of place in that buddha land in that pure buddha realm The Nineteenth Quality Unlimited Activity of the Dharma Realm The phrase he reaches to the ultimate Dharma realm refers to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat reaches to the limit of transmigration and constantly manifests and brings about benefit and happiness for sentient beings This means that because the Dharma realm is absolutely pure it reaches to the limits of transmigration and constantly gives rise to the teachings of the scriptures which flow from  in order constantly to manifest and bring benefit and happiness to sentient beings who are to be converted in the future as will be appropriate at that time Inexhaustibility The phrases he reaches to the limits of empty space and he will never come to an end refer to the preeminent quality whereby the Bhagavat never comes to any end This means that just as empty space is constant and never exhausted so the good qualities that arise from the Dharma realm of all buddhas are also  Just as the limit of the future has no final endpoint so the good qualities of all buddhas by their very nature are constant and inexhaustible because their efforts in bringing benefit and happiness to all sentient beings will never come to rest Their final limits cannot be specifically determined Therefore because the good qualities of the Dharma body of the Pure Dharma Realm of the true essence are eternal so the good qualities of the enjoyment body and the transformation body also never will come to an end although their nature is not eternal or uninterrupted However all tathāgatas originally elicit an encompassing vow to seek great wisdom for the sake of sentient beings If all sentient beings then attain final cessation at that time would not all the conditioned good qualities of the buddhas also come to an end there will never be such a time when all sentient beings a Chapter III will attain final cessation and thus the Buddhas good qualities will never come to an end From the beginningless beginning all sentient beings have been divided into five kinds of lineages  The first is the wordhearers lineage second is the lineage of the individually enlightened ones third is the tathāgata lineage fourth is the undetermined lineage and fifth is the lineage without transcendent potential Their descriptions are as presented in the scriptures and the treatises The first four of these will ultimately attain final cessation due to the compassionate skillful means of all buddhas although they have no fixed time period in which to do so But the fifth lineage because it lacks the causal power of worldtranscendent good potential will never reach a time of final cessation All the buddhas are able to do for them is to manifest their supernatural powers by means of their skillful means and teach them the doctrine of avoiding evil destinies and being born into good destinies But even though they might rely on that teaching and be reborn in the human destiny when they reach the place of no conceptualization and no nonconceptualization they will inevitably fall back and sink into evil destinies All the buddhas will again manifest their powers by skillful means and teach them the transforming power of the Dharma and they will again cultivate good and attain birth in good destinies But later they will again fall back and experience suffering  Again by their skillful means the buddhas will succor them In such a fashion their transmigrations will never come to an end and will not be able to lead them to ultimate final cessation Although other scriptures do declare that all the different kinds of sentient beings possess buddhanature and all will become buddhas this refers to the buddha lineage of the Dharma body or it is said as a skillful means and refers to a small part of sentient beings Or again it is said in order to lead those of an undetermined lineage to decide quickly to arrive at the result of supreme awakening For these reasons the Buddhas good qualities which benefit and bring happiness to sentient beings will never come to an end These good qualities which benefit others depend on the selfbenefiting good qualities and are therefore uninterrupted Therefore because the Tathāgatas conditioned good qualities arise from causes in his selfbenefiting good b qualities they will never come to an end although from time to time they may be suspended Because these good qualities of the Buddha do not come to an end he perfects the purest enlightenment All other interpretations must correspond to this one point for point The reason why the text first treats the Pure Land of all buddhas and then the Bhagavats good qualities is because it thus shows that all the Buddhas good qualities depend on that Pure Land and that the Bhagavat in depending on the Pure Buddha Land is so endowed with good qualities This refers to the great wordhearers and the great bodhisattvas Other scriptures say that they were his retinue because they were completely docile and completely liberated It is thus that they are referred to as the perfection of the Tathāgatas retinue This Scripture says that the immeasurable multitude of great wordhearers together with the great bodhisattvas being all docile sons of the Buddha abide in the Great Vehicle roam in the Great Vehicle and so forth Thus the wordhearers and the bodhisattvas each in their turn constitute the perfection of retinue There are five reasons why this Scripture first treats the wordhearers and only then the bodhisattvas In the fourth place the Scripture describes the great wordhearers before the bodhisattvas in order to cause those bodhisattvas to have respect for that great multitude of wordhearers for asthe scripturesteach it is not proper for bodhisattvasto lack respect for wordhearers and thusthis Scripture praisesthe good qualities of the wordhearers The Scripture says that in this world a great multitude of gods humans devas and so forth heard what the Buddha said were greatly elated received it in faith and put it into practice Earlier it was explained that the Pure Land is characterized by the pure conscious construction of the utmost mastery How then  can wordhearers and their like be included in that assembly without contradiction there is no contradiction If the wordhearers understanding were just the same as that of the bodhisattvas then there would be a contradiction There would be a valid objection only if the capability of the wordhearers were identical with  But although they dwelled in that same assembly the wordhearers were like men born blind because their karmic actions obstructed their to understand that pure wonder Thus they were said to be completely unable to express the content of that pure wonder But  it is precisely because they were unable to understand that they should not have been included within that assembly because even though they did not understand that pure wonder just as it is yet they did see the transformation body preaching on this earth Although that gathering was brought together into one yet in virtue of the force of their karmic actions what each one saw and understood was different It is like somebody seeing real gold and calling it fire Or it is like the four different kinds of sentient beings each seeing differently Or perhaps since they received the support of the Tathāgatas supernatural power they were caused to attain the sight hearing and enunciation of that wondrous Dharma for a short while There is no error in admitting that such transformations  for the Tathāgatas inconceivable power encounters no difficulty whatsoever in employing such states of meditation to deliver since he desiresto adorn that assembly in which he preaches the Dharma Or perhaps were magical creations of the Buddha himself or of the bodhisattvas They had heard c Chapter IV much retained and accumulated what they heard They thought good thoughts spoke good words did good deeds Their wisdom was swift quick incisive salvific penetrating great expansive unequaled They had perfected that wisdom jewel The phrase there was an unlimited community of great wordhearers means that because their number was difficult to count they are said to be unlimited Since they heard the Buddhas voice and entered the holy path they were called wordhearers Since they were monks who had left their homes they were called a community Since all of these wordhearers were of a lineage with extremely perceptive senses and perfections they were termed great Another opinion holds that they were called great because they all dwelled at the result stage of no training However the correct opinion holds that they were called great because these wordhearers although they had as yet attained but meager results were of undetermined lineage and were oriented toward great wisdom that is when determined their lineage would be that of the bodhisattvas Or perhaps they were termed great because of their large number Docility Being such a great community they were all docile One opinion holds that they were called docile because at the stage of training they were free from the one hundred and twelve kinds of discriminative gross passionsthat can be eliminated by insight and so they were not obstinate but like a tamed horse Another opinion holds that they were called docile because at the stage of no training they were free from the one hundred and twentyeight kinds of passion that can be eliminated by the practice of meditation were not unyielding like pure gold The correct opinion holds that they were called docile because being of a lineage that turned toward wisdom and having the capability to elicit great results they evolved skillful wisdom images in accord with the Buddhas intention Sonship The Scripture calls them sons of the Buddha because they are born of the true Dharma as if they were born from the Bhagavats mouth Another opinion holds that they are called sons of the Buddha because having become great wordhearers they are able to maintain the buddha lineage without interruption The Third Quality Liberation The phrase their minds were completely liberated means that they were free from the covetousness of the triple world As it has been taught Because they were free from covetousness their minds had attained liberation The phrase their wisdom was completely liberated means that they were already free from all defiled ignorance Pure Morality The phrase their moral discipline was completely purified means that as a scripture teaches Those who have completed the six branches of the rules for liberation are said to be completely purified in their moral discipline  This means that they dwelled in the complete selfprotection of pure morality and had perfected all their actions by modeling them on the rules for liberation They were most scrupulous in regard to even the smallest transgressions and received instruction in the path of training Or perhaps they were said to be completely purified because they had attained uncontaminated morality The correct opinion holds that they were said to have been completely purified because dwelling in the stage of no training they turned toward the Great Vehicle because their own morality was pure and because they practiced the bodhisattva precepts a Chapter IV The Fifth Quality Skillful Morality The phrase they came to seek joy in the Dharma means that when they sought the true Dharma they desired to reach great joy This means that buddha wisdom does not seek after other things Or perhaps when they sought the Dharma they avoided seeking things that might be censured or any bad conduct in order to lead others to that joy The correct opinion holds that these great wordhearers singlemindedly sought the joy of the Dharma and not fame profit or reputation The Sixth Quality Scripture Learning Because they were able to attentively listen to innumerable scriptures from beginning to end they are said to have heard much Because they were able to keep in mind the meaning of what they had heard it is said that they retained what they had heard Because they frequently cultivated in meditation these words and meanings and even memorized them it says that they accumulated what they had heard The Seventh Quality Wisdom The Scripture speaks of swift wisdom because since the three actions of body speech and thought were purified and they practiced in accord with wisdom they quickly penetrated the meaning of the Dharma and the moral discipline taught by the Buddha For the same reason it speaks of quick wisdom since all their actions were said to have been quick It speaks of incisive wisdom because they penetrated subtle meanings It speaks of salvific wisdom because they attained that wondrous wisdom that is able to transcend transmigration It speaks of penetrating wisdom because this wisdom is able to understand the cause for cessation Because it arrives at certitude it is called penetrating for it cessation inasmuch as it is able to understand its cause It is called great wisdom because it responds to questions with a certitude that is never exhausted It is called expansive wisdom because with its deep and wide perfection it reaches everywhere Other scriptures also describe it as a deep wondrous wisdom which means that others are unable to exhaust its depths It is called unequaled wisdom because it is superior to that of all those wordhearers of dull senses It is called the wisdom jewel because this wisdom is able to elicit the highest meaning They are said to have perfected that wisdom jewel because all these wordhearers were endowed with this wisdom The Three Insights The phrase they had completed the three insights means that they had attained the three insights of the stage of no training which are the insight of the wisdom which recalls former lives the insight of the wisdom that knows the death and birth  and the insight of the wisdom that exhausts the contaminated outflows These three insights which are attained by sharp faculties at the stage of no training are called the three insights because they are free from foolish views on either defilement or nondefilement or on the three times One opinion holds that insight has wisdom as its nature and since such wisdom is able to expel darkness it comes to be called insight Another opinion holds that since undefiled good roots are its nature reverses ignorance The Tenth Quality Concentration The phrase they attained that happy abode of the higheststate of insight means that they had realized the preeminent concentration that will not be reversed Fruitfulness The phrase very pure rich field means that being free from passion just like a good field they were able quickly to give rise to extensive great fruit Inspiring Conduct The phrase their deportment was inspiring means that they dwelled in the correct knowledge of allinspiring conduct Patience The phrase the perfection of their great patience and gentleness was without decrease means that they dwelled together at ease in the deep patience that understands suffering Perfection of Practice This means that all their practices had reached perfection Chapter V The Distinction between Wisdom and Cessation in Regard to the Great Wordhearers The basic of the Tathāgatas sacred Dharma is that sentient beings escape the sufferings of transmigration since this was so why then did again teach them the doctrine But all these great wordhearers dwelled in the stage of no training and when they had completed their last existence they would certainly have entered eternally quiescent cessation Why then did he lead them to seek great wisdom thereby experiencing suffering for such a long time We answer that in their transformed condition there is no experience of suffering Therefore the objection is invalid But because does involve the suffering implicit in all karmic formations this objection is certainly valid  although they do pass through these sufferings  yet there is no validity to the objection because they are led to attain great joy and happiness in the Tathāgatas three bodies and thus their transformed condition of existence is a manifestation of ultimate wisdom But  all great happiness does not go beyond cessation which they would have already attained  although they did have the happiness of calm quiescence yet they lacked the experience of that happiness for the happiness of such an awakening would have eradicated innumerable good qualities such as the happiness of experience the state of being both conditioned and uncontaminated is similar to cessation Because it is uncontaminated it is not included in the suffering implicit in all karmic formations But having already realized buddhahood would they have lacked this ability  from the beginningless beginning the basic nature of the reality of sentient beings is that the different lineages of those who convert and those who are to be converted are interrelated The absence of such an interrelationship implies the impossibility of conversion Thus by means of various kinds of skillful means the Tathāgata converts all sentient beings and leads them to attain the result of awakening If this be the case then those wordhearers whether they have eliminated seven rebirths or one rebirth whether they have eliminated rebirth in any superior world or whether they have just one remaining rebirth whether they have attained a totally nonreflective cessation in any of these stages or in all their births how could they once again cultivate wisdom causes for the duration of three incalculable eons although they do attain total nonreflective cessation in all the stages imbued with passion nevertheless because of the power of their vows they experience magical births and thus are able to cultivate wisdom causes for the duration of three incalculable eons Chapter V The state of total nonreflective cessation is not characterized by a multitude of causes and when it occurs there is a final cessation of rebirth But this is not an eternal state of nonbirth for while in virtue of the power of their vows taken in concentration dwelling for a long time within transmigration they do have causes which engender birth and thus their efforts are able to engender results for a long time In their present bodies they develop and grow until they finally realize buddhahood We answer that they abide only in cessation with remainder that is in their bodies But if they abide only in cessation with remainder and therein elicit the aspiration for supreme awakening how is it possible for them to realize that supreme awakening in just one lifetime The arhats certainly do not have any remaining support for another rebirth How much less could they have a continuity of many rebirths In many ways the Bhagavat depends on these wordhearers who have turned toward wisdom With a deep meaning he said Whoever has well cultivated the four supernatural powers he will be able to remain for one eon or again for another eon This another eon can mean more than just one additional eon But although they expand their life spans and elicit the aspiration for supreme awakening their practice is extremely halting because they c have a predilection for cessation They are not the equals of those bodhisattvas who have just elicited the aspiration and are beginning their practices But by increasing their life spans they maintain their sense bodies although each creates a transformation body and in the presence of their brethren they skillfully manifest final cessation in a cessation without any remainder  Because they do delight in cessation they journey to various worldrealms and approach buddhas and bodhisattvas in order to honor them Furthermore these wordhearers who turn toward wisdom whether in the stage of training or of no training are able to renounce their vows as wordhearers for in fact they are of undetermined lineage They are in these stages because their sense natures have differences and because their supporting causes have differences If they are in the stage of no training they will turn toward wisdom because of the force of their vows taken in concentration and because they manifest a body which has previously been created and variously equipped they will engender a continuity of results for a very long time indeed They will gradually increase their eminence until they realize awakening and their abilities will then become exhausted Although such results are directly produced by the contaminated causes  yet they are assisted by their uncontaminated vows taken in concentration This is what is termed the inconceivable transformation of transmigration If however they turn toward wisdom in the stage of training either their remaining passions have yet the force to produce rebirth and then in that last rebirth they will suppress passion because that last body will be a Chapter V equipped with the power to elicit vows in concentration and as explained above they will then reach awakening or since they have already turned their minds toward wisdom they have already suppressed all passion because the body they manifest is equipped with the power to elicit vows in concentration Those who have no passion are supported on the inconceivable bodies of transformation while those who are yet influenced by the force of passion are supported on the fragmented bodies of karmic maturation But when we speak of the transformations created by these wordhearers it is not necessary to make such fine distinctions These wondrously born bodhisattvas were of the highest order The Commentary explains They are called bodhisattvagreat beings because in seeking wisdom they understood all three vehicles so as to select the greatest Because their object was wisdom  they are called bodhisattvas  They have perfected their great vows whereby selfbenefit benefits others for they have sought great wisdom in order to benefit sentient beings Also the term being has the meaning of courage and thus they are called bodhibeings since they have progressed courageously in their quest for great wisdom Again they are called great beings because they completely understood all states of existence in order to select that of supramundane bodhisattvas Other say that all the multitude of wordhearers must respect all those bodhisattvas who for a long time have practiced celibacy Furthermore these bodhisattvas are honored in order to lead sentient beings to engender pure faith How much more then in the tathāgatas In praising the good qualities of these bodhisattvas the Scripture explains that they have three greatnesses in virtue of which they are called great beings The first is the greatness of their numbers in that they are immeasurable The second is the greatness of their good qualities in that they abide in the Great Vehicle roam in the Great Vehicle and so forth as explained in the Scripture The third is the greatness of their action in that they mitigate the passions of all sentient beings Such a benefiting and gladdening of sentient beings is the action of these bodhisattvas The phrase they assembled from all buddha lands means that they came and assembled to hear the Dharma from all kinds of buddha lands in the ten directions There must have been some bodhisattvas from this lower worldrealm among those bodhisattvas who assembled there but the Scripture says only that bodhisattvas from different places assembled there They did not come to that assembly just because they wanted to control indolence and pride rather they came from their worldrealms because they wanted to hear the Dharma and they were not led there by others Above the Scripture did not say that the multitude of wordhearers came to that assembly because they remained where they were When it says that they came to that assembly from different places this refers to the bodhisattvas The Scripture however speaks in general terms and so does not make this distinction In regard to the greatness of their good qualities we must recognize nine kinds of qualities The First Quality The Greatness of Their Zeal This means that they all dwelled in the Great Vehicle because of the force of their zeal Being firmly established in that Great Vehicle they save sentient beings cause them to escape transmigration and lead them to elicit the aspiration for supreme wisdom The Greatness of Their Cause This means that they traversed the Dharma of that Great Vehicle that is the ten stages in order to successively hear reflect on and meditate on  The Third Quality The Greatness of Their Object This means that their minds were equal in regard to all beings who are the objects of their compassionate actions for in virtue of their great compassion and impartial skillful means they had attained equality between self and others in regard to all sentient beings The Fourth Quality The Greatness of Their Time This means that they were free from all discrimination of kalpa and nonkalpa in that they were impartial to all time as if it were all one single instant kalpa is called vikalpa discrimination It is because they were free from all such discrimination in regard to all kalpas eons or all nonkalpas noneons that they did not discriminate kalpa from nonkalpa  they were able to practice for a long time without becoming weary The Fifth Quality The Greatness of Their Nondefilement This means that they had suppressed all inimical forces in that because they had abandoned all acquisitions they were able to suppress inimical forces As it is said When a bodhisattva knows that all acquisitions have no enduring reality and he does not covet them in his mind then he is able to suppress all inimical forces The Sixth Quality The Greatness of Their Attention This means that they were far removed from the thoughtbinding discrimination of all wordhearers and individually enlightened ones in that they had severed and were far apart from that kind of attention that occurs in the two vehicles The Seventh Quality The Greatness of Their Sustenance This means that they were sustained by enjoyment and delight in that expansive great taste of Dharma in that they took as their sustenance joy in the taste of the Dharma of the Great Vehicle The Eighth Quality The Greatness of Their Purity This means that they rose above the five dreads in that the purity of all their actions of body speech and thought delivered them from all dread The five dreads are insecurity the dread of evil spells the dread of dying the dread of evil destinies and the dread of going before crowds When they had realized the land of pure thought and happiness all these five dreads were removed The Ninth Quality The Greatness of Their Attainment This means that they had assuredly entered the state of no returning in that they singlemindedly had attained the prediction of omniscience for in this stage they assuredly would not retrogress In the first seven stages they still were involved in the work of intensified effort and therefore had not yet attained the effortless path of no returning But in the other stages in virtue of the fact that they were not so involved in the work of intensified effort they had assuredly entered the stage of no returning Then in the greatness of their action they mitigate the oppressive lands that torment sentient beings and appear before them This phrase means that all bodhisattvas are able to mitigate the oppressive lands of internal and external suffering that afflict sentient beings and for this purpose they render themselves visible to them Since their land is one of great mercy and compassion they c Chapter VI are able to mitigate the sufferings of all internal ills and the oppression that comes from the coveting of externals Because these two bring benefit and happiness to sentient beings those who have attained such are said to have come to the perfection of action Again there is a further commentary on these nine good qualities which is presented below The Greatness of Their Abiding The phrase they all dwelled in the Great Vehicle means that in virtue of dwelling in the stage of joy they had realized the allpervasive Dharma realm of ultimate truth for then they first realized the ultimate truth of the doctrine of the Great Vehicle and are therefore said to abide in the Great Vehicle The Second Quality The Greatness of Their Moral Discipline The phrase they traversed the Dharma of that Great Vehicle means that in the stage of purification they practiced the three kinds of bodhisattva moral discipline The doctrine of the practice of the Great Vehicle is identical with the three kinds of moral discipline The Third Quality The Greatness of Their Concentration The phrase their minds were equal in regard to all beings means that in the stage of illumination they had attained all preeminent concentrations elicited the four immeasurables and impartially brought benefit and happiness to all sentient beings The Fourth Quality The Greatness of Their Nondiscrimination The phrase they were free from all discrimination and so forth means that in the stage of radiance they had attained the thirtyseven factors favorable to wisdom were apart from all kinds of discrimination and did not distinguish discrimination from nondiscrimination Discrimination means the discrimination of the view of self which is abandoned by insight This is already severed in the stage of joy Nondiscrimination means the innate view of self which is abandoned by the practice of meditation In this stage it is severed All the states associated with these two kinds of selfview are called all the kinds of discrimination here for one differentiates them in terms of their operation Although they are progressively eliminated in the course of the stages yet this explanation in saying that they are abandoned at this fourth stage gives a general description of them just as the fourth meditation is said to be apart from both suffering and joy or the result of the third is said to be apart from the five lower obstacles when in fact these things are also abandoned progressively over the course of the stages But there are differences of opinion as to just which selfview is severed at this stage of radiance One opinion holds that at this stage the innate passions of the thinking consciousness are completely severed A second opinion holds that at this stage the innate selfview of the perceiving consciousnessis completely severed not of the thinking consciousness because in the seventh stage of farreaching there is yetsome subtle functioning of subtle passion If such were lacking there then the thinking consciousness would have no support for defilement and consequently would not be similar in support to the five sense consciousnesses If these subtle delusions of the thinking consciousness were already severed then the gross delusions of the perceiving consciousness would not function in the fifth sixth and seventh stages Then such a state would be similar to the diamondlike concentration asit occursin the two vehiclessince if the delusions of the thinking consciousness together with the subtle passion of the perceiving consciousness were both severed at the same moment then it would be the same asthe case of the arhat where the subtle passions of the thinking consciousness were firstsevered and the gross passion of the perceiving consciousness was severed later Therefore in thisfourth stage one attainsthe wisdom cessation of noself in the perceiving consciousness but the innate selfview is not yet severed and the subtle passion of the thinking consciousness in addition to some delusion in the perceiving consciousness remains to be severed by the practice of meditation When one reaches the diamondlike mind in the tenth stage of the Dharma cloud then all is instantaneously severed and annihilated because their seeds are uprooted by the practice of meditation The Fifth Quality The Greatness of Their Equality The phrase they suppress all inimical forces means that at the stage of invincibility they see that the Four Noble Truths are all of an equal nature and they suppress the inimical force that makes distinctions between appropriating transmigration and cessation The Sixth Quality The Greatness of Their Insight The phrase they were far removed from the thoughtbinding discrimination of all wordhearers and individually enlightened ones means that in the stage of presence they gain the insight that the twelve conditions which give rise to both defilement and purification are all of an equal nature and they are thus far removed from the thoughtbinding discrimination of the two vehicles which does distinguish between the defilement of oppression and the purification of joy The Seventh Quality The Greatness of Their Realization The phrase they were sustained by enjoyment and delight in that expansive great taste of the Dharma means that in the stage of farreaching they had realized the imageless truth and in the wisdom of emptiness they gave rise to preeminent practice and enjoyed the great Dharma The Greatness of Their Liberation The phrase they rose above the five dreads means that in the stage of steadfastness all passion no longer functioned for them It was because they had been liberated from the causes for the five dreads that they are said to have risen above these five dreads The Ninth Quality The Greatness of Their Attainment The phrase they had assuredly entered the state of no returning means that in the stage of unerring judgment they had certainly entered the state of no returning replete with all the ten bodhisattva practices The Tenth Quality The Greatness of Their Compassion The phrase they mitigated the oppressive lands that torment sentient beings means that in the stage of the Dharma cloud they had attained the great Dharma body had engendered a cloud of great compassion had poured down the great rain of the Dharma and had eradicated all the oppressive elements that torment sentient beings Furthermore these ten phrases from the Scripture could also be interpreted according to the ten perfections the ten great vows and so forth since from the stage of joy on each successive stage supports these practices of all the stages The phrase these wondrously born bodhisattvas were all of the highest order means that they were able to elicit a state of concentration replete with good qualities They are said to be wondrously born because these bodhisattvas had attained this state of concentration Because the names of these bodhisattvas were all expressive of Dharma just as Maitreya is so called after the doctrine of friendliness  these bodhisattvas are foremost among that multitude and thus they are said to be of the highest order Below the Scripture will only speak of bodhisattvas because it summarizes what has been here explained  and thus employs but one term  But the rest of that multitude should be understood also to be included in their number The intent of the transmitter of this doctrine was simply to summarize and not to exclude the others from that multitude Part Two The Content of the Teaching Chapter VII An Analysis of the Five Wisdom Factors The Scripture says At that time the Bhagavat addressed the wondrously born bodhisattvas as follows You wondrously born ones should understand that there are five factors that comprise the land of great wisdom They are the Pure Dharma Realm mirror wisdom equality wisdom discernment wisdom and dutyfulfillment wisdom The Commentary explains We have now explained the first part and dealt with the cause for the arising of this teaching This second part will explain the content of this sacred teaching The Intended Audience for This Teaching The Scripture saysthat addressed himself only to the wondrously born bodhisattvas for they were the recipients of this preeminent teaching Why did he not address himself to the multitude of wordhearers This is because the minds of the bodhisattvas were set on seeking the entirety of wisdom and only they having heard much Dharma would give rise to a preeminent understanding Only they having given rise to such a preeminent understanding would be able to penetrate  Only they having penetrated  would be able correctly to put it into practice Only they having correctly put it into practice would be able quickly to b carry it to completion Even if they were able to seek to hear such a doctrine they would not give rise to a preeminent understanding Even if they were to give rise to a preeminent understanding they would be unable correctly to put it into practice Even if they were correctly to put it into practice they would be unable to bring it to completion Thus he did not address them In sum there are four characteristics that establish the Buddhas Pure Land The Second Theme The Number of Factors Comprising Wisdom In number there are five factors  Later we will explain their specific natures Their number is really selfapparent from the Scripture text and it is here mentioned only to be perfectly clear about it for there are only five factors no more and no less In general there are two the conditioned and the unconditioned Unconditioned qualities are supported on the Pure Dharma Realm That Pure Dharma Realm is the unconditioned quality of suchness All are but the mental differentiations of the essence of suchness Conditioned qualities are supported by the four wisdoms because being uncontaminated the activity of these wisdoms is strong It is thus that wisdom is visibly manifested In ultimate truth in all consciousnesses and conscious states in all their varieties each wisdom singly comprises within itself all good qualities and aspects But in their perceptible aspects discernment wisdom includes the four meditations and gains deep insight into all bodies Equality wisdom includes the four correct efforts and the four immeasurables The four correct efforts although they are constituted by zeal are yet included within the Tathāgatas equality wisdom and have no gradations The four immeasurables because their action isimpartial and equal are included within equality wisdom Therefore the prayer formulae and concentration practices of other meditations recollections understandings and concentrations the wisdom of peaceful resolve penetrating unobstructed understandings the powers of the Tathāgatas exclusive eighty buddha qualities the powers of fearlessness and so forthall these in their various aspects are included within discernment wisdom The many aspects of wisdom insight of the supernatural powers are included within dutyfulfillment wisdom The supernatural powers and the buddha powers of the wisdom that exhausts contamination are included within all four of these wisdoms inasmuch as they continuously destroy contamination But inasmuch as they are directed toward cessation which exhausts contamination they are included within mirror wisdom and equality wisdom The wisdom powers of the seven allpervading practices are included within all four wisdoms All the powers of wisdom and all basic wisdoms in their many aspects are included within mirror wisdom c and equality wisdom The seven factors of wisdom in their many aspects are included within equality wisdom The true uncontaminated state of the ten wisdoms regarding suffering and so forth in their many aspects are included within mirror wisdom and equality wisdom Mindfulness of Dharma in its many aspects is included within mirror wisdom Severance from continuous karmic maturation in its many aspects is included within the Pure Dharma Realm and mirror wisdom The perfections whether they be uncontaminated or appear as contaminated in their many aspects are included within the Pure Dharma Realm and mirror wisdom but if they are really contaminated they are included within the last two wisdoms All the major and minor marks of a buddha in their many aspects are included within dutyfulfillment wisdom All other buddha qualities or their associated characteristics are also so included Thus these four wisdoms completely include all buddha lands all uncontaminated consciousnesses and conscious states whether they be taken together or distinguished into the varieties of their manifestation The Pure Dharma Realm includes the quality above all qualities which is suchness Thus these five factors together include the good qualities of all buddha lands The Fourth Theme The Meaning of the Five Factors The names refer to the Pure Dharma Realm to dutyfulfillment wisdom Third it is able to manifest all masterful activity in the great assemblies Dutyfulfillment wisdom  First it is able to manifest the various immeasurable innumerable inconceivable buddha transformations in all worldrealms whatsoever as they are appropriate to the sentient beings to be converted and matured Second its skillful means constantly and uninterruptedly bring benefit and happiness to all sentient beings Therefore it is named dutyfulfillment wisdom The Five Factors as Cause and Result Here we will treat these five factors from the standpoint of cause result and the distinctions of those results The cause is the Pure Dharma Realm because it is the enabling cause for engendering and increasing sacred Dharma The result is those sacred wisdoms that are engendered with it as their knowable content because it supports them There are four kinds of these sacred wisdom results which are distinguished according to their function This means that having the Pure Dharma Realm as their knowable content they support all doctrines as heard they realize the equality of self and others among all sentient beings they manifest the preeminent skillful means of the true Dharma and they bring about benefit to others Now we will treat these five factors from the standpoint of the essence cause and result of awakening The essence of awakening is pure suchness The essence of is that nondiscriminative wisdom which has as its knowable content The essence of is its constant and continuous causation of the wisdom of equality among all sentient beings the result of which is benefit for all sentient beings The essence of is the discernment of who can be converted and who cannot and as appropriate the fulfillment of that task  Now we treat these five factors from the standpoint of their differences as the results of buddha lands The result of wisdom and abandonment is the essence of buddha lands The result of abandonment is the Pure Dharma Realm because it is absolutely severed from all obstacles Wisdom is the four above wisdoms of mirror wisdom and so forth for these are manifestations of consciousnesses and conscious states in the lands of the result of awakening Among all good qualities wisdom is most eminent and it is named wisdom because in general it supports all conditioned good qualities Now we treat these five factors by summarizing what has been explained above In general they include all factors of awakening in buddha lands The Consciousness Converted by Each Wisdom Now we treat the question of which consciousnesses are converted by each of the four wisdoms The Summary of the Great Vehicle teaches that they convert the aggregate of consciousness since are states of consciousness they are unable to convert consciousness it is because these four are associated with the wisdom of the uncontaminated mind that we conventionally term them wisdoms and thus they are not karmic states of consciousness at all We answer that we should say both If we are talking about wisdom itself then it does ultimately exist But if we are talking about wisdom as the consciousness and conscious states that accompany wisdom then we say that it is conventional Since wisdom is the principal factor in this uncontaminated consciousness and these conscious states they are called wisdom By the conversion of the aggregate of consciousness one attains the mind associated with the four uncontaminated wisdoms This refers to the mind of mirror wisdom and so forth By the conversion of the container consciousness one attains the mind associated with mirror wisdom because it is able to support the seeds of all good qualities and to engender images of all bodies and lands By the conversion of the thinking consciousness  one attains the mind associated with equality wisdom because it is free of discrimination regarding self and others and has realized universal equality  By the conversion of the perceiving consciousness  one attains the mind associated with discernment wisdom because it is able to discern all things without obstacle By the conversion of c the five sense consciousnesses one attains the mind associated with dutyfulfillment wisdom because it is able to manifest and bring to completion external tasks But this opinion is not valid because it inverts the proper order and because discernment wisdom which enunciates Dharma and dispels doubts is not a function proper to the five sense consciousnesses Therefore in the stages of conversion of transmigratory consciousness the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with these four attain the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with these four results of awakening through their conversions According to the theory of a single image the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with mirror wisdom are nondiscriminative and have as their knowable content only suchness This is not a subsequently attained because its knowable content and mode of functioning are unknowable According to the theory of an ensemble of images mirror wisdom has as its knowable content all things As the Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle teaches mirror wisdom is not fooled in regard to all knowable content And this Scripture on the Buddha Land teaches Just as a multitude of images appear in a great mirror just so a multitude of images from all the internal organs the external objects of those organs and all the sense consciousnesses do appear in the wisdom mirror of the Tathāgata The phrase all the organs refers to the six sense organs All the objects refers to the six sense objects And the phrase all the consciousnesses refers to the six sense consciousnesses  Therefore the multitude of images from the eighteen realms do Chapter VII appear in this wisdom Therefore this wisdom has all things as its knowable content It is because this mirror wisdom always has all things as its knowable content that we say that the Tathāgata is omniscient If this were not so then since the other wisdoms certainly do not know all things the Tathāgata would not be called omniscient Therefore internally mirror wisdom has as its knowable content the seed of its own essence but externally it has as its knowable content all knowable things whether ultimate or conventional and it manifests all images of bodies lands and so forth When it takes as its content the limit of ultimate truth it is called nondiscriminative wisdom and when it takes as its content the limit of conventional truth it is called subsequently attained wisdom Although it does indeed have all things as its knowable content yet its mode of functioning is subtle and difficult to know just as the knowable content and the mode of functioning of the container consciousness because subtle are also difficult to know although it has as its knowable content the triple world It is not then the case that this wisdom because it is difficult to know and realize has as its content only suchness in nondiscriminative wisdom Although its essence is one yet its activities of truth are many and it is thus distinguished according to these activities and divided into the two wisdoms  There is no contradiction here Moreover it is only when it reaches to the truth of ultimate meaning that it can understand conventional truth Therefore although it is one mind its truth is said to have a before and an after Or perhaps what is designated assubsequently attained wisdom appears to be subsequently attained the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with equality wisdom One opinion holds that it has as its knowable content only mirror wisdom just as the defiled thinking consciousness has only the container consciousness as its content Another opinion holds that it has as its content only suchness the limit of reality because it has equality as its knowable content The correct opinion holds that this equality wisdom also has as its knowable content all things because it has as its content the equality between all a things The Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle teaches that equality wisdom has all sentient beings as its knowable content because its content is the equality between self and others and it manifests images of buddhas according to the prayer and aspiration of sentient beings This Scripture on the Buddha Land teaches that equality wisdom discerns both ultimate and conventional truth because it realizes the ten descriptive marks of equality Therefore it has as its knowable content all things If it did not have conventional truth as its content then it would be unable to manifest images of Buddha according to the prayers and aspirations of sentient beings Thus it is not correct to consider equality wisdom as having only mirror wisdom as its content on the analogy with the defiled thinking consciousness since this would disagree with the above quoted sacred doctrines as well as with other scriptures The consciousnesses and conscious states associated with discernment wisdom have astheir knowable content all common and individual marks without obstacle Therefore it has as its content the entire range of the knowable in regard to the knowable content of dutyfulfillment wisdom One opinion holds that the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with dutyfulfillment wisdom have as their knowable content the five sense objects because the Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle teaches that the five senses of a tathāgata are each transformed in regard to these five sense objects The correct opinion holds that dutyfulfillment wisdom also has as its knowable content all objects without any obstacle The Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle also teaches that dutyfulfillment wisdom gives rise to various transformations which are immeasurable and inconceivable in all object realms and thus brings benefit to all sentient beings Also this Scripture on the Buddha Land teaches that dutyfulfillment wisdom gives rise to all the transformations of the three actions of body speech and thought and discerns the differences in the eightyfour thousand states of mind of sentient beings and that it proclaims the antidote implements the four methods of discourse and experiences all the meaning of the past future and present If this wisdom did not have as its knowable content all knowable objects it would have no such abilities If this were not so there would be no memory or recollection of things perceived in the past just as if they have never been perceived at all Therefore the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with the four wisdoms are able to illumine and know their own essence this is contrary to the way things function in this world A knife does not cut itself The tip of ones finger does not touch itself if has ever noticed that lamps are able to illumine themselves But how do you know that lamps illumine themselves in the direct awareness of the absence of darkness it is apparent  If they did not illumine themselves they would still be enveloped in darkness and would not then be directly perceptible at all Therefore we know that lamps illumine themselves since lamps are not themselves darkness why must they illumine  Being of the nature of light lamps do not have to illumine themselves for as lamps they are never dark the essence of such things as a pitcher or a piece of cloth is not itself darkness but when they are not illumined by lamps they are enveloped in darkness and are not directly perceptible When lamps illu b mine them those lamps expel the darkness and cause them to be directly perceptible And so we say that they are illumined It is just the same with the lamps themselves When they are lighted the enveloping darkness is expelled and they themselves become directly perceptible This is why we say that the lamps illumine themselves Just like the light  they are able to both illumine other things and to illumine themselves They are not like knives at all and cannot be compared to such things The second is that which apprehends And the third is the selfawareness  These three aspects are neither identical nor different for they constitute aspects of the same structure The first three are as above and the fourth is an awareness of the awareness of the very  The first two aspects are external inasmuch as insight is into an image which appears as if external while the last two are internal  The first is simply the knowable object while the other three are both knowable objects and acts of knowing The third and fourth aspects are both direct perception for they occur simply by paying attention and being aware and are not the results of inference From this reasoning although is one yet it is a unified composite of many aspects Since these aspects are neither identical nor different from one another and since both the internal and external functioning of consciousness is accounted for this explanation avoids the fallacy of an infinite regress Its insights are of different varieties This verse means that the mind of sentient beings is a unified composite of two aspects Whether internally or externally all are entangled in of what is apprehended and the act of apprehending Although the consciousnesses and the conscious states of the four wisdoms have all these different aspects yet they consist in uncontaminated direct awareness This interpretation is allinclusive as has been explained in other treatises In this interpretation although the functions of the mind of wisdom are many yet its essence is one just as in the one Dharma there are many different meanings such as suffering of impermanence and so forth and yet the essence of that Dharma is one The Tenth Theme The Aspects of the Mind of Wisdom Now we treat the question of the dependently arisen imageand insightaspects of the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with these four wisdoms c If they lacked these aspects then such could not be termed wisdom at all  The first opinion holds that the true uncontaminated consciousnesses and conscious states  in virtue of the absence of obstacles immediately illumine objects present before them without any image that having issued from the evolutions of consciousness might appear  Therefore this uncontaminated mind is said to be imageless because it does not imagine Furthermore it is also said that the objects are inconceivable If one were to claim that it has no images then it would have no imageaspect If being nondiscriminative meant that it had no insightaspect then entirely lacking both imageand insightaspects it would be like empty space or the horns of a hare and not be termed wisdom at all It is rather because it does not cling to images that it is said to lack the images of things apprehended and the act of so apprehending and not because wisdom lacks the function of illumining objects that appear before it If the uncontaminated mind entirely lacked this imageaspect then the buddhas would not manifest the various images of bodies and lands But this contradicts the scriptures and treatises in many places If the conversion of the support of the aggregate of material form were itself completely unrelated to material form  then likewise the conversion of the other Chapter VII four aggregates would be unrelated to sensation conceptualization volition and consciousness is a serious error because it negates the nature of consciousness as otherdependent The third and correct opinion holds that the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with uncontaminated nondiscriminative wisdom illumine its own essence and therefore have no distinct imageaspect because they are nondiscriminative and because their object suchness is not separated from its essence But images of objects do appear and are directly present and illumined in the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with subsequently attained wisdom just as they are in the contaminated mind because it is discriminative and because its objects are separate from its essence if the uncontaminated mind understands objects that are separate from its essence then is it not the case that even though it lacks any images that appear as those objects yet it does take them as objects the Collection of Remarks on the Means of Valid Cognition does not state that because there are no images that appear as atoms in the five sense consciousnesses there are no objects at all Therefore the uncontaminated seeds in the uncontaminated mind which in perception are identical with those objects arise and although as objects they appear to be contaminated yet they are uncontaminated just as the uncontaminated mind may appear to be contaminated while in fact it is not so Note that all this analytical argumentation is reasoning according to conventional truth and is not the truth of ultimate meaning for the truth of ultimate meaning is beyond words and transcends thinking and thus lacks both an imageaspect and an insightaspect is unable to speak about consciousnesses and conscious states is beyond fabrication and is inconceivable The Number of Wisdoms Conscious States We now treat the question of how many conscious states are associated with the consciousnesses and the conscious states of the four wisdoms There are twentyone The Sequence of Attaining the Four Wisdoms Next we treat the question of the sequence in which these four wisdoms are attained Once the aspiration for the mind has occurred then one gradually progresses because of the external permeations  The consciousnesses and conscious states associated with mirror wisdom are converted at the moment of diamondlike concentration when all contaminated seeds and karmically maturing consciousnesses are destroyed At this moment one attains the first actual manifestation of the uncontaminated seed of the result of awakening Supported on that fullness will never come to an end but will be constantly and uninterruptedly associated with equality wisdom a Chapter VII When the bodhisattva at the first stage of joy initially attains insight then this equality wisdom is first actually manifested Thereafter in the successive stages practice causesit to grow into itsfullness When uncontaminated insight becomes present this wisdom is completely manifested but if the contaminated mind is yet present then it is at times interrupted In this manner it develops up until the tenth stage of the Dharma cloud After this last stage it will continue without ever coming to an end and be constant and uninterrupted Just like the contaminated container consciousness it always functions in synergy with thinking consciousness so when uncontaminated mirror wisdom functions together with equality wisdom this equality wisdom is also uninterrupted The consciousnesses and consciousstates associated with discernment wisdom are also present in the first stage of joy When insight is initially attained this wisdom is first actually manifested Due to subsequent cultivation it gradually increases However when the contaminated mind is yet present or when the mind is absorbed  then it is interrupted In this manner it develops until the stage of the result of awakening But if one enters the concentration of destruction then it will not be actually manifested The consciousnesses and conscious states associated with dutyfulfillment wisdom according to one opinion are actually manifested in all the stages above the first stage of joy because they are involved in disseminating the Dharma The Seeds of These Four Wisdoms Now we treat the question of the seeds of the consciousnesses and conscious states associated with these four wisdoms The original beginningless nature of reality does not arise from permeation This original nature is innate in b the five lineages  But immediately on the arising of the aspiration  these seeds do develop and increase through the permeations of external objects  From the first stage on they follow their course and become manifest By repeated permeations they increase and become eminent until the realization of diamondlike concentration From that point although they are frequently manifested yet are not again influenced by permeation nor are they again caused to increase since the fullness of their merits cannot be increased in virtue of the fact that being supported on pure consciousness they are neither undetermined nor capable of being influenced by permeation and in virtue of the fact that in this manner we avoid attributing gradations to the merits of earlier and later buddhas The consciousnesses and conscious states associated with these four wisdoms are entirely good and are fully encompassed within the truth of the uncontaminated path for all buddhas lack any contaminated seeds In this manner these five factors are both conventional and ultimate truth Inasmuch as they do not rely on names and words the objects of their faculties all ultimately exist But inasmuch as they do rely on names and words these objects all conventionally exist We now rest our explanations and must return to commenting on the text of the Scripture The Discernment of These Five Factors The fourth characteristic of discernment treated under the First Theme before the above extended explanations is itself divided into three parts The first is the discernment of the differences between the five factors The second is the discernment of phenomenal wisdom which is experienced as being all of one unified taste The third is the discernment of all the good qualities that characterize the Pure Dharma Realm in the concluding verses  and the relationship between the three bodies and the five factors You wondrously born ones should realize that the Pure Dharma Realm is like empty space which although all kinds of descriptive marks of every color are present in it yet cannot be said itself to have any descriptive mark of color at all because its essence is of one taste only Just so the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm although it too pervades all knowables with all their descriptive marks yet cannot itself be said to have any kind of descriptive mark at all because its essence is of one taste only The Commentary explains Now we will explain the marks of the Pure Dharma Realm It may be objected that the Pure Dharma Realm of all Tathāgatas is of the essence of suchness and that suchness is the common mark of all things But since all things do have various distinctions so should the Pure Dharma Realm But if it has these various distinctions then how can it be pure it is like crystals which support various kinds of common marks yet in themselves have no marks at all In order to respond to this objection gives the first simile of empty space It says that it is like empty space in which all kinds of descriptive marks of every color are present The words all kinds refer to all the different kinds for worldly space pervades all similar and dissimilar descriptive marks by which material forms being limited by their bodies are differentiated The term descriptive mark is defined as that whereby the essence of a thing is apprehended in acts of understanding and clearly appears  The phrase yet cannot be said to have any characteristics of color at all means that no perceptible descriptive marks of any kind of material limitation can be attributed to empty space The words cannot be said mean that the c nature of empty space does not correspond to words and is ineffable for the nature of empty space is such that one cannot attribute to it any manifesting descriptive marks or any manifested descriptive marks But if one looks up into empty space there are various descriptive marks and one can indeed say that these various descriptive marks do exist this looking at the various perceptible descriptive marks in space is not looking at space and therefore only by convention does one say that has these various perceptible descriptive marks just as of blue and yellow of longness or shortness do not ultimately exists why is it then that  which universally pervades all material forms without having any descriptive marks is said to have an essence of one taste only it is of one unobstructed taste and has no descriptive marks whereby it might be differentiated because empty space is not associated with those various perceptible descriptive marks and does not become identified with them The sentence just so the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm although it too pervades all kinds of knowables with all their various descriptive marks yet cannot be said to have any kind of descriptive mark at all because its essence is of one taste only means that the Dharma realm is just like empty space in that both although they universally pervade all material limited forms cannot be said to have any perceptible form at all Even though we say that empty space exists this is said only by convention and does not mean that it ultimately exists for empty space does not depart from its own essence and take on other descriptive marks Although by conventional meaning we speak of empty space as this or that yet the true nature of empty space is ineffable The Pure Dharma Realm is just like this for although by conventional designation we say this and that about emptiness yet the true nature of emptiness is ineffable As noted above the Pure Dharma Realm is like a crystal because it is the cause which supports the various descriptive marks common to things Rather although when one looks into empty space it to be associated with the various perceptible material forms yet it does not have any kind of perceptible form at all Just as space at times is associated with smoke mists clouds and so forth and due to our own power of unreal imagining its forms are seen  When we are looking at these various descriptive marks of smoke mists and clouds we are not looking at empty space because empty space cannot be seen We see these material forms and descriptive marks because of the enabling force of our own unreal imagining and such is not the Pure Dharma Realm Although the Pure Dharma Realm has no real perceptible descriptive marks nor any enunciation of Dharma yet it does issue forth in the different identifiable presentations of the Dharma which do have perceptible descriptive marks But it does not on that account itself have these various descriptive marks They do not cause the Dharma realm to be identified with those descriptive marks because the Pure Dharma Realm is apart from all namesAll names are objects of that understanding that is engendered from discrimination Since the Dharma flows forth from the great compassion of all tathāgatas it is able continually to express meaning beyond speech It would indeed be a wondrous sight to see the empty sky painted with a multitude of colors Even if many words were used to describe it its ineffable beauty would still surpass all those words As it has been said Oh Sāgaramati if one all kinds of colors painted on the imperceptible invisible unobstructed unmanifested empty sky he would stand immobile rapt in wonder All Buddha Bhagavats have realized this profound ineffable Dharma and by the use of words they are able to proclaim and teach its profundities for the sake of all sentient beings for this is why they preach Because they have the crystal Dharma realm as their nature and are pure the objection commits the fallacy of a dissimilar example and such reasoning violates either the first or the other two rules of logic in a that either the reason in the premise does not apply to the other two members of the syllogism or that it is neither necessarily present in the example nor absent in all dissimilar cases The Descriptive Mark of Purity The Scripture says Just as empty space although it pervades all material forms and is not apart from them yet is not defiled by their imperfections so the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm although it pervades the minds of all sentient beings since it is their reality and is not apart from them yet is not defiled by their imperfections The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Pure Dharma Realm pervades all knowables then it must also be associated with the defiled descriptive marks common to all of them such as covetousness and so forth How then can it not itself become defiled as the other contaminated consciousnesses and conscious states are presents this second simile on empty space in order to respond to this objection The phrase just as empty space pervades all material forms and is not apart from them meansthat there is no other place  Thusitsaysthat is not apart from them But they cannot be said to be either identical with it nor different from it because they all function within space and cannot be seen apart from it Only if there were no distinction between space and these material forms would that empty space itself have the material forms and therefore must like them be inconstant The phrase yet it is not defiled by their imperfections means that although empty space contains within it all material forms yet it is not defiled by the imperfections of those material forms Imperfections of material form refer to all the different kinds of descriptive marks of blue yellow and so forth which represent the causesthat engender and increase covetousness anger and so forth They are called imperfections because such dark rainclouds and fog can cause empty space to lose its pure appearance and hinder the vision of that purityAlternately it is consistent to interpret these imperfections of material form to refer to the descriptive marks of such objects as they increase within the mind It is not the case however that empty space itself is defiled by these imperfections of material form b Chapter VIII The phrase just so the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm pervades the minds of all sentient beings since it is their reality and is not apart from them means that just as the Buddhas own mind is ultimately pure because its original nature is luminous and pure just so are the minds of sentient beings The original nature is ultimate and pure The original nature of the mind is suchness The minds of all sentient beings are equally  How can it be stated that their minds are equally  It is so stated in virtue of the nature of emptiness This means that the original nature of the mind its reality nature pervades the minds of all sentient beings Therefore we use the term equally to express this reality nature of their minds The phrase since it is their reality and is not apart from them means that the originally pure minds of sentient beings although originally pure are firmly established as the Tathāgatas purity of mind only when far apart from adventitious obstacles and defilements The equality of the minds of all sentient beings consists in the essence of the full perfection of ultimate meaning because the mind of equality of all sentient beings is the descriptive mark of that ultimate meaning and is not therefore differentiated from it Because the minds of all sentient beings are characterized as the ultimate meaning of mind they manifest and move in nondifferentiation The phrase and yet it is not defiled by their imperfections means that it is originally pure Imperfections refer to covetousness and so forth all of which are able to lead the mind to commit faults and become defiledAlthough such imperfections function by an adventitious discrimination they are not the essence of the mind  That essence cannot be completely lost and it is able to bring about purification We are here dealing with a mystery The pure luminous reality nature of the original mind is what is meant by mind It is not true that apart from this mind there is any other nature of a pure mind How then can it be that the minds of sentient beings have covetousness and so forth such are supported on the power of their own discrimination for until the faults of the mind have been completely severed these do arise through the power of ignorance This means that just as the original nature of empty space is pure but appears to be impure through the presence of illusory descriptive marks that appear due to cataracts damaging the pupils of the eyes just so the original nature of the Dharma realm is pure but appears to be impure through the illusory descriptive marks that appear due to the causal force of covetousness arising from ones own discrimination because cataracts of ignorance damage the wisdom eye But that universally pure wisdom eye is itself never defiled Furthermore inasmuch as the Pure Dharma Realm is nondiscriminative such universal purity is termed the Dharma body of all tathāgatas their true essence because it is constantly without change Thus it is said that all sentient beings have the seed of a tathāgata and that all sentient beings have buddhanature in order to lead the minds of sentient beings to decide to enter the Great Vehicle To say that all sentient beings will become awakened is like saying that everything is inconstant when we know that the Pure Dharma Realm is not inconstant or like saying that everything is suffering  If the word all did not here mean just a small part of all sentient beings and not the complete entirety then it would contradict what has been explained above concerning the five lineages It would then imply that the good qualities of all buddhas would finally come to an end because there would be nobody left to save And this contradicts what has been explained above concerning the Tathāgatas good qualities for they will never come to an end they are never of no benefit and they abide in the world with the purpose of saving beings and to seek wisdom Although all sentient beings have the Pure Dharma Realm they do not realize it just as a man born blind does not see the sun or moon because he is held within the power of his obstacle  As the verse says It is due to the defilement of sentient beings that the Pure Dharma Realm does not appear  just as the moon in a broken basin But it pervades the entire world for its Dharma shines like the sun From this reasoning the above objection that the Pure Dharma Realm itself becomes defiled because it is associated with the defiled descriptive marks of all passions such as covetousness and so forth and is thus just like c Chapter VIII the other contaminated consciousnesses falls into the fallacy of an uncertain reason Although empty space is associated with the defilements of material forms it is not itself defiled And although consciousness and conscious states are associated with the passions of covetousness and so forth they still have as their essence the Pure Dharma Realm and are still pure The example of the objectorsreasoning isthusinconsistent  It israther the case that those whose dispositions are impure see their own minds as defiled and on that accountsay that the Dharma realm is defiled But those whose dispositions are pure see that the Dharma realm is always pure because although associated with the defilements of covetousness and so forth it is originally pure and undefiled Because this Dharma realm pervades everything it is like empty space and is not defiled by the imperfections of any sentient being Those who say that the Dharma realm pervades everything  in virtue of the fact that emptiness is something that is clung to have not demonstrated their thesis The Third Simile Again just as empty space encompasses all the actions of body speech and thought and yet itself has no arising activity just so the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm encompasses all the transformations of wisdom and all phenomenal activities and yet that Pure Dharma Realm itself has no arising activity The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm has suchness as its essence then it has no fabrication and no arising activity How then could it come to encompass the arising of wisdom which is cause for those phenomenal activities that benefit sentient beings On the other hand if it does encompass the arising of wisdom then it would have an arising activity and then how could the Tathāgatas suchness be its descriptive mark In order to respond to this objection presents this third simile on empty space The phrase just as empty space encompasses all the actions of the body speech and thought means that although empty space does not have any purposeful activity yet it is able to encompass these three actions of sentient beings a inasmuch as the two actions of body and speech have a solidity of shape they indeed can be contained  we say that those are contained in empty space because they are not prevented  for all occurrences of solid objects are not prevented from being contained The case of thought is analogous for its occurrence is not prevented and thus we can say that it also is encompassed within empty space Furthermore we conventionally describe empty space on analogy with the case where solid objects when not prevented move about in something else Why can we not then conventionally describe empty space by analogy with the case where in a similar fashion the action of thought immediately after being destroyed again arises from something else within which it is contained  If it were otherwise then a really existent space would pervade all places and then how could it encompass  If one were to hold that the substance of space were really existent but not solid and that when other things arose they could thus be said to be contained within  then we could claim that the substance of all things of the world of no form  which have no solidity really did exist and were able to contain  and thus that they could also be called empty space  Other scriptures do say that that which is without matter is called empty space but this is said from the defiled descriptive marks of common worldly knowledge Therefore empty space contains the three actions of the body speech and thought without any logical contradiction Although it has no purposeful activity it is able to include  It is just like the brightness of the sun of the moon or of lamps which although not discriminating this from that yet when they arise are able to illumine Chapter VIII all material forms Or it is like the wishfulfilling gem which although without purposeful activity is yet able to fulfill the desires of sentient beings Other examples could be adduced to the point that empty space is manifested in everything The phrase just so the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm encompasses all transformations of wisdom and all phenomenal activities that benefit sentient beings means that the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm maintains and abides in its own essence and without purposeful activity establishes those activities that universally benefit sentient beings The term wisdom means mirror wisdom and the other three wisdoms  The words all transformations refer to the transformations of bodies words and thoughts The phrase all activities that benefit sentient beings means that these activities are able to bring supreme happiness and benefit to sentient beings The Pure Dharma Realm is able to encompass all of these because when it arises it is their enabling cause Arising activity refers to purposeful activity that is able to cause the mind to reject some objects and choose others Activity means the movement of the mind for the agitation that characterizes the minds thinking has such activity Therefore the above passage means that the Pure Dharma Realm is able to encompass all wisdoms all transformations and all phenomenal activities that benefit sentient beings although it lacks any purposeful activity or mental agitation An alternate reading says that it encompasses the transformations of all wisdoms and the phenomenal activities that benefit sentient beings This would mean that it encompasses all enjoyment and transformation bodies because as the cause that benefits sentient beings it is inexhaustible because it is extremely great and extensive and because it is unobstructed Although it is nondiscriminative the enabling power can give rise to these bodies This means that just as empty space issues forth in the activities of the arising of the forms it encompasses in virtue of the fact that the reality nature has the power to produce all kinds of different activities and yet empty space itself had no constructed nor fabricated discrimination of I and mine just so the Tathāgata dwelling in the uncontaminated realm b and lacking any purposeful or fabricated discrimination of I and mine yet in virtue of the power of his great vow previously cultivated is able to engender phenomenal activities that benefit sentient beings through the transformations of all wisdoms It is due to that previously elicited vow that even when asleep or in the concentration of destruction he awakens and leaves that concentration at the appropriate moment although he has no purposeful activity As the Ocean Wisdom Scripture teaches It is just like a monk who resolves at the sound of the bell and then enters into the concentration of destruction Although in that concentration he would not hear the sound of the bell since he would have all discrimination yet due to the force of his resolve he would awaken from that concentration at the appropriate time The Fourth Simile The Descriptive Mark of Being Unconditioned The Scripture says Just so is the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm in which all wisdoms transformations and phenomenal activities that benefit sentient beings appear to be born and to perish and yet that Pure Dharma Realm itself is not born and does not perish The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Pure Dharma Realm pervades all knowables and is not free from following upon them then that Pure Dharma Realm must have a birth and a destruction On the other hand if it does not have a birth or a destruction then it cannot pervade all knowables and be free from following upon them all In order to respond to this objection the Scripture presents this fourth c Chapter VIII simile on empty space The phrase again it is like empty space in which all kinds of material forms and descriptive marks appear to be born and to perish means that just as empty space pervades all forms  so it also includes these forms and descriptive marks and is not free from following upon them all But although all these forms appear to be born and to perish the nature of empty space itself is not born and does not perish Thus the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm pervades all knowables and encompasses all wisdoms all transformations and phenomenal activities that benefit sentient beings and is not free from following upon them all But although such wisdoms are successively born and perish yet the Pure Dharma Realm is neither born nor does it perish This means that their conventional descriptive marks appear to be born and to perish but it is not the case that in the truth of ultimate meaning any real things are ever born or ever perish In the Pure Dharma Realm all wisdoms transformations and phenomenal activities that benefit sentient beings are also like this The Fifth Simile The Descriptive Mark of No Increase Nor Decrease The Scripture says Again just as in empty space all kinds of material forms and descriptive marks appear to increase and decrease and yet empty space itself has no increase and no decrease just so in the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm the sweet dew of the Tathāgatas sacred Dharma which has both increase and decrease is manifested and yet that Pure Dharma Realm has no increase and no decrease The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Pure Dharma Realm pervades everything and is not apart from the appearance of the Tathāgatas sacred Dharma which has both increase and then subsequent decrease and destruction then that Pure Dharma Realm must likewise have increase and decrease And if this is so then the Pure Dharma Realm cannot be pure In order to respond to this objection the Scripture presents this fifth simile on empty space The phrase just as in empty space all kinds of material forms appear to increase and decrease means that the Tathāgatas sacred Dharma is most truly eminent and pure when compared to the heterodox teachings of the nonBuddhists because it is like a rich liquor or a sweet dew It can lead others to cessation and the eternal life Thus the holiness realized through the devout practices of this sacred Dharma attains the result of no training Because the many divisions have already been present for a thousand years it is said that the Buddhas true Dharma has lasted a thousand years But this does not mean that the BuddhaDharma is only a thousand years old The tradition of the wordhearers was divided into many sections only a hundred years after the Buddhas passing but the bodhisattva tradition remains the same for more than a thousand years for the one taste of purity does not engage in crafty debates  It was after that thousandyear period that there arose the two different interpretations of the Sarvāstivādins and the ūnyatāvādins  Thus it is said that the Tathāgatas Dharma has lasted a thousand years The phrase and yet the Pure Dharma Realm has no increase nor decrease means that it is only by conventional truth that the Tathāgatas Dharma has increase or decrease but in the truth of ultimate meaning the Pure Dharma Realm is its nature and it has no increase nor decrease just as material forms have no arising nor passing away Having the Pure Dharma Realm as its essence and lacking increase and decrease in the truth of ultimate meaning it is like empty space for it too is characterized as having no increase nor decrease When it is said that it appears this means that its transformations within conventional consciousness appear as having increase and decrease but such is not its true nature in the Pure Dharma Realm for it is apart from the characteristics of fabrication and discrimination The Descriptive Mark of No Movement The Scripture says Just as in space material forms and descriptive marks in the ten directions are limitless and inexhaustible because the realm of empty a Chapter VIII space is limitless and inexhaustible and yet empty space itself has no going or coming no moving or changing justso isthe Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm in that although it establishes benefit and happiness for all sentient beings in the ten directions and its various kinds of activities are limitless and inexhaustible because the Pure Dharma Realm is limitless and inexhaustible yet that Pure Dharma Realm has no going or coming no movement or changing The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Tathāgata has the Dharma realm as his essence and also bestows benefit and happiness on all sentient beings whether they are going or coming the Dharma realm is not separated from this and just as other things it must also have going and coming as for example being born and so forth If this be so then the Dharma realm cannot be pure On the other hand if the Dharma realm has no activity of going or coming then it cannot bestow that benefit and happiness on sentient beings in the ten directions In order to respond to this objection the Scripture presents this sixth simile on empty space The phrase just as in space material forms and descriptive marks in the ten directions are limitless and inexhaustible because the realm of empty space is limitless and inexhaustible means that the worldrealms in the ten directions are limitless and inexhaustible and thus all the various material forms and descriptive marks in them are also limitless and inexhaustible Lacking limits in any direction both as to time and as to place they are said to be limitless and inexhaustible The phrase and yet empty space itself has no going and coming no moving or changing means that empty space encompasses everything pervades everything and yet has no activity The phrase just so is the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm in that although it establishes benefit and happiness for all sentient beings in the ten directions and its various kinds of activities are limitless and inexhaustible means that those activities of bringing benefit and happiness are limitless and inexhaustible as explained above The phrase because the Pure Dharma Realm is limitless and inexhaustible means that the Pure Dharma Realm is limitless and inexhaustible because although it has no movement its enabling force can issue in activities that bring benefit and happiness to limitless sentient beings in limitless worldrealms in the ten directions The phrase and yet the Pure Dharma Realm has no going or coming no moving or changing is to be understood as follows In the phrase no moving and no changing the first is the explanation of going and coming while the second is an interpretation  The phrase the Pure Dharma Realm has no going or coming and so forth means that it has no limitation nor any restrictions of material form If it had any limitation or restriction of material form then like all things it could be said to go and to come to move and to change from place to place and then it would not be limitless and unrestricted The Dharma realm is like empty space but it can be said to have the activities of going and coming of moving and changing In general this means that in the truth of ultimate meaning the Pure Dharma Realm is the essence of all tathāgatas and is pervasively present in the conscious streams of all sentient beings Due to the maturing force of their own good seeds and the enabling cause of the Pure Dharma Realm when a consciousness arises then the activities become clearly manifested and expressed in words as the benefit and happiness which the Tathāgata brings to all sentient beings Were it not for such activity such an enabling cause then it would not happen that the Tathāgatas Dharma body would be able to have any activity of bringing benefit and happiness to sentient beings As a scripture teaches Good sons the Tathāgata lacks any going or coming whatsoever We did say above that the Tathāgata does go and come but thisrefers to his enjoyment and transformation bodies Again just as in empty space the three thousand worldrealms appear to be destroyed and created and yet the realm of empty space is neither destroyed nor created just so in the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm there appears the realization of supreme awakening which has unlimited descriptive marks and there is manifested the entrance into final cessation and yet that Pure Dharma Realm does not perfect supreme awakening nor does it enter cessation b Chapter VIII The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Pure Dharma Realm is apart from going and coming then how can it reach to supreme awakening and final cessation since it neither goes nor comes anywhere On the other hand if it does have going and coming then this would contradict what is taught  Just as worldrealms appear to be destroyed and created and yet empty space is neither destroyed nor created just so in the Pure Dharma Realm although all buddhas appear to realize supreme awakening and final cessation yet in the truth of ultimate meaning the Pure Dharma Realm does not realize any supreme awakening nor final cessation Just as in empty space the appearances of the destructions and creations of all worldrealms are conventional truths and not the truth of ultimate meaning since in great emptiness such things have emptiness as their nature just so the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm manifests the realization of supreme awakening which has unlimited descriptive marks and final cessation but this is said in conventional truth and not in the truth of ultimate meaning for the realization of supreme awakening and the entrance into final cessation do not really exist because all dependently coarisen aggregates have no essence If the Pure Dharma Realm be considered in the truth of ultimate meaning then the existence of these two supreme awakening and final cessation is not an ultimate existence for that which ultimately exists does not cast off its own descriptive marks and take on other descriptive marks If one allows that the Pure Dharma Realm casts off what is not supreme awakening to realize supreme awakening and casts off what is not final cessation to attain final cessation then such is not the truth of ultimate meaning But if this be so then other things would likewise  The destructions of worldages would be constant destructions and at no time would they not be being destroyed The creations of worldages would c be constant creations and at no time would they not be being created Pots and pans at no time would not be pots and pans for all these things would also ultimately exist And if this be so then ascetics would not have to cross over a world filled everywhere with the flaming fire and go to that other realm but would suffer the flames of that fire in this  Those who have not attained any preeminent concentration or powers of mastery would both realize supreme awakening and negate supreme awakening would both attain final cessation and negate final cessation Thus although one first the state of supreme awakening and then that of final cessation yet because pure suchness does not lose its own descriptive mark so the Pure Dharma Realm neither realizes supreme awakening nor enters cessation It is because these two do have increase as their own descriptive mark that they do not ultimately exist Theirs is a transcendental nondiscriminative wisdom a realization ofsupreme awakening In thisstate taking suchness astheir content of understanding they do not manifest any discrimination in regard to these two  and thus there is no supreme awakening or final cessation This profound meaning is expressed as follows  Your Majesty should know that because all things are not born all buddhas manifest nonattainment and nonrealization Because clinging to the imagined is nonexistent so the discrimination of birth and so forth does not exist Again just as in regard to the various material forms that depend on empty space changes such as destructions and conflagrations a Chapter VIII can occur and yet the realm of empty space is not changed thereby and suffers no affliction just so in the realm of sentient beings which depends on the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm sinful actions of body speech and thought against the various precepts can occur and yet the Pure Dharma Realm is not thereby changed and suffers no affliction The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Pure Dharma Realm pervades all kinds of sentient beings then how can those sentient beings have any sin In the Pure Dharma Realm there is no sin because its essence is pure On the other hand if they did have sin then they would be afflicted and just like the adherents of the lower vehicles would not attain utmost purification It is in order to respond to this objection that presents this eighth simile on empty space The phrase just as in regard to the various material forms that depend on empty space and so forth shows that this objection is invalid for just as in regard to such material forms as grasses and trees which depend on space changes such as being destroyed and so forth can indeed occur and yet empty space is not changed thereby since although it encompasses them it is neither afflicted nor oppressed by any of their sufferings such as being destroyed and so forth just so in the realm of sentient beings which depends on the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm all kinds of sins can occur and yet that Pure Dharma Realm is not changed thereby nor does it suffer any affliction Although sentient beings are within the Pure Dharma Realm it is apparent that in virtue of their own imagining they do engender the two kinds of sins in their actions of body speech and thought for householders can commit evil sins such as injuring their parents and monks can commit sins as appropriate to their station But all sins have only a conventional existence and the Pure Dharma Realm is not changed by such transgressions for its essence is not altered afflicted or oppressed If due to such suffering it were to become inconstant then it would have sin and be like the wordhearers Such however is not the Pure Dharma Realm Since it is able to remain constant in the face of all suffering it has no sin and is like unto empty space Furthermore it is only in their conventional existence that all the material things are destroyed in space and not in their ultimate existence Likewise although sin and the establishment of the precepts are present in the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm these are established conventionally and do not ultimately exist The three actions of body speech and thought become evil only because of the way in which they arise and not because their essence  There is nothing that is established as really existing in virtue of its own arising force Likewise evil actions of the body  for is a composite of the elements of the earth and so on The actions of speech like the sound of a drum are not themselves evil Likewise actions that are not externally indicated do not really exist for nonactivity is their only nature Actions of thought do not ultimately exist for they are determined to be evil only by being associated with the power  The causes do not exist therefore the resultant do not exist Therefore in the Pure Dharma Realm neither karmic actions nor their results ultimately exist because they all arise from imagination are engendered from the evolutions of conventional consciousness and are established as so characterized The Descriptive Mark of Not Being an Aggregate The Scripture says Again just as dependent on empty space great earths great mountains bright lights waters fires Indras retinue of stars and suns and moons of all kinds can occur yet the realm of empty space is not characterized by these just so dependent on the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm the aggregates of discipline concentration wisdom liberation and liberationwisdom can occur and yet that Pure Dharma Realm is not characterized by them The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Pure Dharma Realm pervades all things then it must be characterized by the uncontaminated aggregates of moral discipline  concentration  wisdom  liberation  and liberationwisdom  b Chapter VIII In order to respond to this objection the Scripture presents this ninth simile on empty space Just as dependent on space the earth  and so forth can occur and yet empty space does not take on the marks of being an aggregate in virtue of being associated with the common marks of the earth and mountains just so although the aggregates of discipline and so forth can occur in dependency on the Tathāgatas Dharma realm yet that Dharma realm is not identical with these pure aggregates You should understand that uncontaminated pure discipline is here called the aggregate of discipline Uncontaminated concentration is called the aggregate of concentration Uncontaminated wisdom is called the aggregate of wisdom The eminent understanding of the stage of no training is called the aggregate of liberation The first three are causes for the last two One opinion holds that the wisdom that has as its content liberation at the stage of no training is called deliverance wisdom and the other wisdoms are simply called wisdom But another opinion holds that all five of these uncontaminated aggregates are present both in the stage of training and in the stage of no training but whereas they are only partially realized in the stage of training they are fully realized in that of no training for all bodhisattvas and buddhas are endowed with these five  Thus although these five aggregates depend on the Dharma realm yet that Dharma realm is not to be identified with their descriptive marks and they do not lose their own descriptive marks as the five  Note that the five clinging aggregates of material form sensation conceptualization volition and consciousness and these five uncontaminated are the same in regard to the Dharma realm for they all are aggregates and not to be identified with that Pure Dharma Realm In summary we do affirm that there are no phenomenal qualities such as discipline and so forth in that Pure Dharma Realm and yet there are true approaches to those good qualities therein for its enabling causality engenders and increases all conditioned good qualities which are not identical with those true good qualities of the empty Dharma realm since they are unconditioned These conditioned qualities being dependent on this Dharma realm engender and increase all good qualities but they are comprised in the conditioned transmigratory aggregates But since they are not interrupted nor exhausted they are said to be eternal It is not true however that they will never come to an end for all eternity for having been engendered they will inevitably perish since they are comprised in aggregates Again in empty space causes and conditions develop and arise and the spheres of the three thousand worldrealms can occur and yet the realm of empty space itself has no arising activity just so in the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm immeasurable descriptive marks and the spheres of all the buddha assemblies are encompassed and yet the Pure Dharma Realm has no arising activity The Commentary explains Again there is an objection for if the Pure Dharma Realm of all buddhas is its essence then there is no differentiation in the enjoyment of this and that How then could have any differences in assemblies On the other hand if there is a differentiation in what is enjoyed  then how can it be the Pure Dharma Realm of all the buddhas In order to respond to this objection presents this tenth simile on empty space The above passage shows that this objection is invalid for it is just like empty space In empty space causes and conditions arise and the encircling of the enveloping windwheel which the three thousand worldrealms can occur Even though empty space has no discriminative thought that might differentiate I and mine yet it is able to encompass all these spheres of the different worldrealms Another scripture expresses this same idea There can be various buddhas and buddha lands and buddha assemblies Yet the Dharma realm is not differentiated in the enjoyment of I and mine nor does it have any potentiality for creating differentiation between subject and object Although the Tathāgatas Dharma body has no images of differentiation or fabrication yet due to the power of original vows and eminent practice enjoyment and transformation bodies do give rise to all the buddha lands replete with their various descriptive marks Thus arise all the differentiations in buddha assemblies all of which are but evolutions of conscious construction But all these differentiations do not really exist Just as by the power of his previous vow to benefit all sentient beings a universal monarch might perform eminent actions and engender wondrous and varied differentiations such as excellent women and so forth  just so all buddhas because they desire to benefit all sentient beings engender eminent actions and in the enabling power of these actions give rise to various Pure Lands thus constituting the differences in the enjoyment of Dharma in all the assemblies From this we can understand that the descriptive marks of the Dharma realm are profound that its places are profound that its actions are profound The profundity of its descriptive marks means that it is apart from the ten kinds of impure defects and thus has the ten descriptive marks of purity The ten descriptive marks of purity are nondiscrimination nondefilement no purposeful activity not being conditional no increase nor decrease no movement being eternal having no affliction not being an aggregate and not distinguishing I and mine The profundities of action refer to the actions of transformations The profundity of place means that have no movement and a are in fact fully replete assemblies in the Tathāgatas Pure Land All these places are metaphorically expressed through analogy with empty space for that is employed to express all the descriptive marks of the Dharma realm As a scripture teaches All the metaphors we rely on express the Tathāgatas qualities such as discipline and so forth analogically but they all slander the Tathāgata except the metaphor that employs the analogy of empty space because the immeasurable qualities of the Tathāgata such as his discipline and so forth are indeed analogous to empty space Chapter IX Mirror Wisdom The First Simile Next wondrously born ones is mirror wisdom which reflects all kinds of images as in a great mirror Thus dependent on the Tathāgatas wisdom mirror a multitude of images of all senses objects and consciousnesses are reflected But you should understand this mirror to be only a simile and should recognize that the Tathāgatas wisdom mirror is entirely universal It is thus that this mirror of wisdom is called mirror wisdom The Commentary explains We interpret that mirror wisdom by analogy with a mirror which is an impartial cause of the arising and manifestation of images of all things This means that the eighth consciousness of all tathāgatas is able to manifest and engender all images of all wisdoms just as a great mirror is able to manifest all images of this world for is associated with wisdom The phrase all senses refers to the six internal sense organs of the eye ear and so forth The word objects refers to the six objects of those sense organs that is material form and so forth These six internal sense organs and their six external objects are the twelve bases  The term all consciousnesses refers to the mind and mental states of the last three wisdoms which have as their content those twelve bases that is all these consciousnesses that together with the twelve bases constitute the eighteen realms says a multitude of images because differences in the various functionings do appear Later on this Scripture says that at all times mirror wisdom being always supported b on all objects is elicited together with the perceptible appearances of the various wisdom images Other passages are to be interpreted in accord with this for it is termed mirror wisdom because it can cause the arising of wisdom images Equality wisdom takes as its content mirror wisdom with all its dependently coarisen things Discernment wisdom takes as its content all common and individual descriptive marks  as does dutyfulfillment wisdom The mind and mental states of these three wisdoms in all the objects they apprehend both internally and externally appear in the likeness of all these individual and common things and various images clearly appear distinctly  Therefore all those images arise with the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom as their cause They are said to appear because they are clearly and distinctly manifested and understood Others lack such capacity for it is through mirror wisdom that one is designated as capable of manifesting  inasmuch as it brings about images of dependently coarisen things just as a bright mirror manifests all its images An alternate interpretation is that in the phrase all senses objects and consciousnesses we are dealing with three distinct items and not the eighteen realms The senses are the six sense organs the objects are their six spheres but the consciousnesses are the first six consciousnesses that is the five sense consciousnesses and the perceiving consciousness These include all the multitudinous images of the eighteen realms that is all knowables in the world All these images do appear as appropriate to the specific nature of the other three wisdoms  Because discernment wisdom and the other wisdoms are all able to manifest the universal nature of reality just as it is and to the limits of its existence they have as their content in the pure conscious construction associated with the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom Because these three wisdoms give rise to their respective wisdom images they are said to manifest them In general Chapter IX such a description applies only to the understanding of a tathāgata but for the sake of analysis we say they manifest their characteristics Furthermore the eighteen realms are all present to the consciousnesses and the conscious states associated with the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom and thus their images appear therein since when the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom arises it is able entirely to illumine all objects All senses their objects and the consciousnesses clearly appear as images in this wisdom because it apprehends their descriptive marks and causes them to appear Although mirror wisdom has no discrimination of subject and object yet all knowable images do appear in it just as in a mirror for this is the mode of functioning of this wisdom Although the Tathāgata has no discrimination between subject and object between unity and difference yet he is able to be aware of the images of things characterized either as individual or as common as they arise in his mind and since he is thus aware he can explain these individual and common marks of all things without failure It is in virtue of these images that the Tathāgata is perfected in his neverfailing memory of things for due to this all knowables are at all times clearly apparent in his mirror wisdom and in the other three wisdoms If this were not so then how could the Tathāgata be called omniscient If there were no mirror wisdom or if there were not the other three wisdoms then he would not be able constantly to be aware of the individual and common marks of all things One might proffer the opinion that has such a profound ability for omniscience in virtue of his continuity for a verse says It is because of his continuity that has such a profound ability and is omniscient just as a fire consumes everything  It is not the case that he knows everything simultaneously But these are untrue words for when the minds of nonbuddhas apprehend one thing they do not apprehend other things or know other things and therefore they are not omniscient In the above opinion would at one moment know only one aspect of the common marks of all things If however this were so then the Tathāgata would be termed omniscient only by conventional meaning But this is not so for then he would not truly be omniscient as omniscience means to be allknowing in ultimate meaning c Furthermore in virtue of the fact that mirror wisdom is their content in the continuity of the minds of tathāgatas there appear all the images of the senses objects and consciousnesses of other beings in both worldtranscendent and good worldly states for if there were no mirror wisdom then these images would not so appear They arise and are understood because of the force  This means that the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom is their enabling cause and that all the senses objects and consciousnesses of all worldtranscendent and good worldly states arise because of it just as a multitude of images appear in a bright mirror Although each sentient being has his own causal force yet only in virtue of the enabling power of mirror wisdom do these appear  It is just like seeds which would not produce their sprouts without the earth and so forth or the images of things which would not be reflected without a mirror But if this be so then the Bhagavat would be just like Maheśvara who in the false view is thought to be the cause of the world Can it really be held that is the universal cause of all the results in the world If there were not any image in that mirror then how could there be any analogies  It is from the union of the thing and the mirror that there comes to be a content for understanding It is because images do thus appear that we are able to use such analogies It is because of the maturation force of the permeation of the images that are perversely clung to by all sentient beings that images appear which seem to objectify the maturation of ones own consciousness Thus in this world arrogant pride arises and people think that they see images on the mirror of the self arguing that there is no other mirror in which they a Chapter IX could arise Understand that the descriptive marks of all objects are appearances of the evolutions of consciousness and so do not ultimately exist apart from conscious construction for that is their ultimate meaning However the doctrine of conscious constructiononly does not mean that there are no conscious states and does not teach that there is only one consciousness Each sentient being has the eight consciousnesses and their accompanying conscious states Although all material forms and so forth do have their specific classifications  they all arise from conscious construction through the permeations whereby consciousness matures for it is the nature to be so differentiated But even when these changes appear they are still not apart from conscious construction By conventional speech we differentiate the content of these conscious states but such is not ultimate truth for in the truth of ultimate meaning all things have no separate essence Even suchness although it is not an evolution of consciousness is not apart from conscious construction for it is the real nature of consciousness and is revealed by the common mark of the essencelessness whereby both the self and things are empty Both worldly mirrors and the Tathāgatas wisdom are nondiscriminative and both are able to present images without discrimination It is termed mirror wisdom because is the cause of  The Second Simile Nondiscrimination The Scripture says In a great mirror suspended in some high unshakeable place by a fortunate rich man limitless people passing by could see their virtues and imperfections and then might come to desire to hold onto their virtues and discard their imperfections Just so the Tathāgata has suspended his mirror wisdom in the Pure Dharma Realm which being uninterrupted is unshakeable because he desires to lead limitless innumerable sentient beings to gaze upon purity and to come to desire to hold onto that purity and discard all defilements The Commentary explains The phrase in some high  place means the pinnacle or the acme The Pure Dharma Realm is undefiled suchness and its ground is called the ground of peace because whether as support or as content it is uninterrupted The term unshakeable means that since that mirror wisdom is supported on and has as its content understanding the Pure Dharma Realm it exhausts the limits of transmigration and follows along in a constant continuity without interruption This means that mirror wisdom is eternally separated from the oscillations of discrimination This first wisdom has always been and always will be and thus its continuity is uninterrupted The other three wisdoms equality discernment and dutyfulfillment wisdoms although they have no imaginings yet do have a kind of nonclinging and nonpurposeful discrimination They are realized in a temporal sequence and may be activated or not Thus they are not unshakeable This mightseem to imply that the consciousnesses of these other wisdoms can be lacking in the state of awakening Thus one opinion holds that at the concentration of destruction equality wisdom is not manifested for the treatises explain that in the concentration of destruction there is no thinking consciousness It isfurtherstated that in one aspect destroys the constantly active consciousnesses and conscious states When the treatises explain that thinking is absent  they refer to the absence of defiled thinking and do not mean that thinking consciousness is lacking altogether As long as one has not yet attained the selfless wisdom that realizes the emptiness of b Chapter IX things this is the support for the constant manifestation of clinging to the discrimination of things As long as one has not yet attained the selfless wisdom that realizesthe emptiness ofself this clinging is constantly active because it is supported on this  If a perceiving consciousness arises then at the same time the container consciousness functions in synergy with these two consciousnesses When one of the five sense consciousnesses arises then it functions in synergy with these three consciousnesses and so forth until when all five of the sense consciousnesses arise at the same time then simultaneously the container consciousness functions in synergy with all these seven consciousnesses  Know then that in the three states of the transcendent path the concentration of destruction and the state of no training a consciousness of thinking also exists for its mode of functioning joined together with equality wisdom and apart from any discriminative clinging to defiled things is subtle and not opposed to that concentration of destruction Because the other two wisdoms are also not constantly active in the state of awakening they also are not unshakeable Why then has the Tathāgata securely placed this mirror wisdom in the Pure Dharma Realm In order to lead limitless innumerable sentient beings to gaze upon purity Why should they gaze upon purity So that they may come to desire to hold on to that purity and discard all defilements Defilements here refer to the qualities of passion and karmic rebirth To discard means to suppress and sever for whether on the worldly or transcendent path one suppresses and severs them either for a time or finally Purity refers to all the good which can cause the minds of sentient beings to become purified To hold on to means to support for firmly establishes nurtures and matures the seeds and seeks to realize deliverance according to ones commitment This means that all tathāgatas when they were bodhisattvas came to aspire after the perfection of all kinds of benefit for sentient beings and entertained the joyous thought of benefiting and gladdening all sentient beings Supported on the Pure Dharma Realm they subsequently amassed the spiritual equipment of happiness and wisdom by their practices and turned back to seek a continued presence in this world of transmigration All this was due to the fact that the skillful methods of mirror wisdom were earnestly cultivated  Having realized this wisdom which has as its content the Pure Dharma Realm their continued presence was without movement and although they had no purposeful discriminative fabrication yet that continued presence was an enabling cause for leading sentient beings according to their dispositions to establish nurture and mature the seeds of immeasurable good roots to attain worldly joy and transcendent deliverance Therefore arose from the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom and their transformed existence functions to proclaim the essence of the Dharma to all sentient beings in order that they might know the differences between defilement and purity hold on to purity and discard defilement Its mirror surface is pure and without dust and brings happiness and benefit to all sentient beings for its light illumines everywhere The Commentary explains It is pure because being apart from differentiation it isfree from adventitious dust The phrase free from dust means that it has been completely c Chapter IX purified from dust inasmuch as it is separated from anything that obfuscates the above two  The term shines is used because of the surface of that mirror The term clearly refers to that purity The phrase it illumines everywhere is used because of that freedom It is said that that mirror wisdom is buddha wisdom because it is forever apart from the obstacles of passion and to knowledge which are termed dust and thus it is said that it is eternally separated  Passion refers to the bonds of all the passions of craving anger and so forth which in the state of bondage and guilt keep people drowsy for whether outwardly manifested or not they all have the force to obstruct the arising of the holy path and the attainment of cessation The obstacle of passion meansthat they scatter the body and the mind The obstacle to knowledge refers to ignorance in regard to all knowables which while not being itself a defilement obstructs the universal wisdom  But it does not obstruct cessation for we see that the wordhearers do attain cessation even though they have this obstacle These two obstacles are also termed defiled hindrances They are rendered quiescent by pure wisdom since they would defile that pure wisdom Thus comes to control this adventitious dust these hindering obstacles The phrase it is eternally separated from them means that they never arise again Because it is eternally separated from these obstacles mirror wisdom is always pure and thus it is said that it has a wellpolished surface The phrase it is the support for concentration means that is supported on mirror wisdom because it arises in dependency on it The term support is also applicable to concentration for on the path of uninterrupted deliverance it is the support that engenders the utmost purification Thus either concentration or wisdom may be termed a support The most basic concentration is the preeminent diamondlike concentration for through its power obstacles are eternally severed In this case wisdom is that which is supported for it is upheld in the power of concentration The term support means that this wisdom arises in virtue of the uninterrupted nature of that concentration for in the power of that concentration the utmost purification becomes separated from all discrimination and has no discrimination in virtue of the arising of mirror wisdom This wisdom then is that which is supported because it is supported by concentration a It is bright because of its original purity which is bright pure and without dust It is pure because it is apart from the obstacle of passion It is without dust because it is apart from the obstacle to knowledge The phrase it brings happiness and benefit to all sentient beings for its light illumines everywhere means that this wisdom is able to bring about all benefit and happiness for all sentient beings because it is supported on concentration Because of its activity its light illumines everywhere Because its essence is the pure mirror the text uses the term light It clearly illumines everywhere because it is free from the obstacles of passion and to knowledge Therefore mirror wisdom is originally pure far apart from the two obstacles is bright pure and without dust Although it cannot be seen it gives rise to the enjoyment and transformation bodies is able to produce all wisdoms and is able to perfect all benefit for sentient beings Again just as the basic nature of a mirror is to depend on conditions whereby various images and appearances arise in it just so the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom gives rise to various wisdom images and appearances because it always depends on conditions The Commentary explains if mirror wisdom is the cause whereby images of all wisdoms arise for all sentient beings then how can it not become differentiated  How can the essence of this wisdom not itself be differentiated Moreover if at all times it constantly is able to be the cause  then how could it at some particular time all at once give rise to images of all sentient beings and of the other wisdoms It is not true that the essence of a mirror is itself differentiated because its images are different It is not true that it gives rise to its images either constantly or all at once for it must wait on a host of conditions Therefore mirror wisdom does give rise to various different images because at all times it waits on this host of conditions but it itself does not become differentiated because those images are different just as the shades of blue are not differentiated  It is not true that it gives rise to the images Chapter IX of all sentient beings and the other wisdoms either constantly or all at once because it must wait on the presence of the proper occasions and conditions to be able to give rise  This means that the pure consciousness associated with mirror wisdom has two functions The first is the function of being a direct cause for innate in that pure consciousness are all the pure seeds of wisdom that are able to manifest and give rise to bodies and lands if they encounter the conditions Only then will it be able to give rise to the different modes of activity that characterize the consciousness and the conscious states associated with equality wisdom and the other wisdoms The second function is being the enabling cause for if sentient beings are equipped with their own direct causes then in virtue of the arising of the vow power from the pure roots in the pure consciousness of a buddha that pure consciousness lends them assistance in order to lead them to attain an unhindered growth and maturity Thus although the essence of mirror wisdom is one yet it is able to manifest and give rise to all these images of Dharma but it is not true that it arises all at once for it must wait upon external conditions The Fifth Simile The Characteristic of Not Clinging to I and Mine The Scripture says Asin a mirror not just one but a multitude of images arise and yet there are no images at all within that mirror and it has no movement and no activity just so in the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom not just one but a multitude of wisdom images arise and yet there are no images at all within that mirror wisdom and mirror wisdom has no movement and no activity The Commentary explains if all these wisdom images are already essentially present in mirror wisdom how then could mirror wisdom arise conditionally On the other hand if they are not essentially present then how is it able to produce all these wisdom images since it has no movement or activity One never sees a potter who without any movement or activity is able to make a new pot The above passage from the Scripture is intended to respond to this objection It says that there is not just one because there are many b images They are a multitude because their varieties are innumerable If a mirror were to rely on just one kind of image there would be only one reflection and thus the Scripture says not just one  There is rather a multitude because it does reflect numerous varieties In this fashion although there are at first no images in the mirror yet it gives rise to many images without itself having any movement or activity of deliberation or discrimination Just so is mirror wisdom for although at first it has no images of any wisdom yet it is able to give rise to various images of wisdom Since it depends on a variety  those are not just one but a multitude Although it gives rise to these wisdom images yet it has no movement or activity of deliberation of discrimination This means that just as a mirror although nondiscriminative yet is able to give rise to many images just so mirror wisdom although it does not cling to I and mine nor purposefully discriminate subject from object is able to give rise to the images of the various wisdoms Again just as a mirror is neither united to nor separated from all its images because it does not accumulate them and because it is the cause for their manifestation just so the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom is neither united to nor separated from all its wisdom images because it does not accumulate them and because it does not lose them The Commentary explains if mirror wisdom is united to all its wisdom images then how could it not itself become differentiated since they are differentiated On the other hand if it is not united to them then how can it be their cause We never see seeds able to cause sprouts when they are not united with those results If the rays of the sun were not absorbed by quicklime stones they would not become luminous The Scripture presents the above passage in order to respond to this objection A worldly mirror although able to be the cause for the arising of a multitude of images yet is not united to those images because before they arise they have no essence that might be accumulated c Chapter IX But neither is a mirror separated from them because it is the cause of their manifestation and thus it is not ununited to them either It is because of this that those exist at all Although it is such a cause of the appearance of images yet the mirror itself does not become differentiated because those images are different Mirror wisdom is also like this inasmuch as although it is able to cause the production of wisdom images it is neither united to nor separated from those wisdom images because it neither accumulates nor disperses them The phrase it is not united means that before they have arisen they have nothing that could be accumulated The phrase it is not separated means that there must be that mirror wisdom for these wisdom images to arise for were it lacking they would not arise The phrase because it does not lose them is to be understood as follows The meaning of the word lose is to be separated from to fall away from to become absent for its opposite is not to lose Because retains and does not forget the descriptive marks of the content mediated through the images it gives rise to the Scripture says that it does not lose them Thus in mirror wisdom are manifested all knowables all the wisdoms of this triple world and all sentient beings If there were no such universal knowledge mirror wisdom would not arise for it does arise only by knowing everything Therefore the Scripture says that it does not lose them because this wisdom does not forget the descriptive marks of any object Because it does not lose them it is not apart from them Although it can thus cause the arising of wisdom images yet it does not become differentiated because those images are different for they issue forth in a nondiscriminative manner as if from a mirrorAlthough a worldly mirror can cause the arising of many images it is not to be identified as being either united to or separated from those images Just so mirror wisdom is not to be identified as either joined to or separated from its wisdom images although it is able to cause their arising Although seeds are able to cause sprouts yet they cannot be said to be either joined to or separated from them Even the finest parts of the rays of the sun are not identical with the material bodies  but because their common characteristics are united and joined together a unified image that seems to be identical with the material body appears in consciousness  Thus all the causes and results we see in the world are causes without thereby being either united to or separated from  Only if they were not related as cause and result would their characteristics be definitively united Again just as the lustrous surface of a mirror is the supporting cause for the arising of all images in all places just so the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom does not cut off the luster of all innumerable practices and it is the supporting cause for the arising of all wisdom images that is the wisdom images of the wordhearers vehicle the individually enlightened ones vehicle and the Great Vehicle because he desires to lead all wordhearers to attain deliverance through that wordhearers vehicle all the individually enlightened ones lineage to attain deliverance through that individually enlightened ones vehicle and all those of the Great Vehicle to attain deliverance through that Great Vehicle The Commentary explains how can it be possible that this wisdom can be able at all times to give rise to all the images of Dharma in the three vehicles In order that a worldly mirror might reflect all images on its surface various efforts are undertaken to polish both sides of its surface so that it may become capable of causing the manifestation of all images in all places Just so is mirror wisdom All tathāgatas when they were yet bodhisattvas were unable to give rise to the images of Dharma of all the wisdoms of the three vehicles because their lineage was yet covered over by obstacles But through the intense cultivation of uninterrupted immeasurable practices they became lustrous and at the moment of diamondlike concentration they eradicated all obstacles and were perfected in purification Then they became capable of producing the wisdoms of the three vehicles and such images were not severed for both the range and the time period of their unlimited were unlimited This explains the cause whereby pervades all places Due to the intense cultivation of many practices for an immeasurable time mirror wisdom is able to give rise to the wisdom images of the three vehicles a Chapter IX Furthermore this mirror wisdom is free from all defilement in all places and at all times and its various practices are fully perfected because its adornments are most fully purified Therefore at all times and in all places it is able to produce all images for as already explained that preeminent diamondlike concentration severs all obstacles and realizes the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom and thus its various wonderful adornments at all places and times are able to produce the images of the three vehicles The term deliverance means cessation All individuals of the three vehicles have their own seedlineage as the direct cause for that deliverance and the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom as the enabling cause By their own intense efforts and the Buddhas skillful assistance they cultivate and amass good spiritual stores elicit the path sever the obstacles of passion and to knowledge and as appropriate to each realize cessation In the case of wordhearers and individually enlightened ones of determined lineage who abide in the state of no training their bodies and minds which had been influenced by previous actions of passion are spontaneously destroyed because they delight in tranquility and cessation and have eternally severed all those obstacles of passion which might elicit actions and engender rebirths They will never be reborn again because they have no remaining support  Thus all their conditioned states whether contaminated or uncontaminated whether manifested or unmanifested are accordingly severed and destroyed There remains only the conversion of the support unfabricated and undefiled suchness the Pure Dharma Realm the liberation body  This is called cessation without remainder eternal beatific ultimate quiescent unfathomable inconceivable But inasmuch as they lack the adornments of conditioned pure qualities and do not engender benefit or happiness for sentient beings they are not like tathāgatas at all Those wordhearers and individually enlightened ones of undetermined lineage who abide in the state of no training although they have no passion  yet do delight b in wisdom By the power of their vows they maintain their bodiesin continuity and cultivate the practice of the Great Vehicle until they attain diamondlike concentration wherein all obstacles are destroyed and they realize the three bodies of BuddhaAlthough they do have conditioned uncontaminated qualities they do not have an uncontaminated body or mind and therefore they do realize cessation without remainder The term remainder here meansthe contaminated body and mind of the triple world If bodhisattvas also severed the two obstacles completely when they reached the buddha result then we would have to say that they also would enter cessation without remainder  Thus some of those in the two vehicles first enter cessation with remainder and afterward cessation without remainder But when bodhisattvas first realize the tathāgata realm they immediately realize these two cessations for in virtue of the fact that their contaminated bodies and mind are completely exhausted they are said to have no remaining support for any continued presence in the world Yet because they create appearances of contaminated bodies and minds they are said to have some remaining support Because they have realized compassion and wisdom without interruption they are also said to have entered nonabiding cessation that is cessation that abides neither in the transcendence of no remainder or the immanence of maintaining a remaining support Inasmuch as when uncontaminated wisdom has penetrated truth one severs all impurity and realizes  it is called the cessation of penetrating discernment The ultimate stage of not discriminating things as if they were real is termed cessation How then can the wordhearers and the individually enlightened ones attain this ultimate cessation for they have not yet destroyed the permeations from the obstacle to knowledge Since those wordhearers and individually c Chapter IX enlightened ones have no vow power they turn their minds toward the ultimate state of no training and having exhausted the measure of their long lives become eternally extinct Just as in a mirror great images such as the great earth high mountains large trees and broad palaces and lodges can occur and yet that mirror is not measured by them just so in the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom wisdom images from the stage of joy to the stage of awakening can occur wisdom images of all worldly and transcendent doctrines can occur and yet that mirror wisdom is not differentiated by these The Commentary explains if mirror wisdom is able to give rise to wisdom images then in the same measure that they are differentiated so it also would be differentiated Although a worldly mirror is able to cause images of the earth and so forth yet that mirror itself is not measured by those  Even in a small mirror such great images of mountain ranges and so forth occur and in a large mirror images of small pebbles occur Although these images are of material forms yet the mirror is not measured by the size of its images Similarly mirror wisdom although it givesrise to the immaterial forms of all the wisdom images of the ten stages of worldly and transcendent doctrines is not measured by the size of those wisdom images Therefore the wisdom mirror of all buddhas istermed the storehouse of great wisdom for it isthe foundation for transcendent and worldly wisdomsAs explained the Bhagavat perfects this mirror wisdom of the storehouse of great wisdom and is able to engender omniscience Understand that the term wisdom in this Scripture denotes all good qualities for the pure consciousness associated with mirror wisdom is replete with all the good seeds whereby selfbenefit benefits others This wisdom is able directly to cause the arising of wisdom images in ones own body and to enable the arising of those images in the bodies of others This is so because mirror wisdom is able to create and manifest bodies and give rise to the Dharma enunciated through wisdom and by these evolutions from the mind of wisdom give rise to the images of the other wisdoms Alternatively it can be interpreted to mean that perfected by the permeations of the power of the compassionate vow becomesthe enabling cause for the good doctrine of the other wisdoms and thus it brings it about that in the bodies of others the good doctrines of wisdom are easily attained engendered and increased As a scripture says All good states of sentient beings arise from the enabling power of the Tathāgatas compassionate vow The Ninth Simile Just as a mirror is not a cause of images when there are obstacles placed in front of it just so the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom is not a cause of wisdom images for sentient beings who have the obstacle of hearing untrue doctrines under the influence of bad teachers for they are unfit vessels The Commentary explains since mirror wisdom is the cause whereby those in the three vehicles attain deliverance it does give rise to all wisdom images Moreover perfected by the permeations from the compassionate vow is the enabling cause for all worldly and transcendent wisdom images Why then does not this true wisdom arise among nonBuddhists for if it is constantly present to them as the cause for those  then it would never be ineffective even in the case of nonBuddhists Although a worldly mirror is able to cause the manifestation of all images yet when intervening obstacles for example a wall are placed in front of it it cannot cause those images to arise Just so is the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom for although it is able to cause the arising of wisdom images yet it cannot cause them to arise for those who have the obstacle of delighting in hearing perverted doctrine under the influence of bad teachers for they are vessels unfit for the reception of hearing the true Dharma Therefore does not arise among the nonBuddhists but rather is always rejected and nullified This is because their good seeds are suppressed and their evil seeds find opportunity to increase From the beginningless beginning the times when sentient beings have cultivated good have been few but the times when they have wrought evil have been many Therefore good states even though they a Chapter IX encounter favorable conditions are yet difficult to nurture and evil states even though they meet only the weakest opportunity still prosper Just as a mirror cannot give rise to images in darkened places just so the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom cannot give rise to wisdom images among those sentient beings who foolishly delight in the enjoyment of evil The Commentary explains Just as wisdom images do not arise when external conditions are present so also they do not arise when internal conditions are present whereby in virtue of previous actions people delight in the darkness of evil and ignorance Those who delight in evil are aflame with all the passions of covetousness anger and so forth but even more so are they heavily inclined toward delusion for they do not understand the relationships between the causes and results of good and evil All the Buddhas doctrines that have appeared in this world do bring benefit and happiness to all sentient beings The good field of the Three Jewels nurtures the immeasurable accumulation of bliss for all in the world and transcendent to the world But instead of desiring to hear receive delight in and base themselves on that Dharma some stop up their ears and embrace the perverted teachings of nonBuddhists which bring neither benefit nor happiness They turn toward and base themselves on and thus nurture and bring about a multitude of sufferings immeasurable evil actions and various kinds of evil powers The pull of ignorance in obstructing good is heavy indeed We must then earnestly cultivate the light of wisdom for one weighed down by ignorance is not a fit vessel for good The Eleventh Simile Perpetually Unfit Vessels The Scripture says Again just as a mirror cannot give rise to images that are far distant just so the Tathāgatas mirror wisdom cannot give rise to images in those sentient beings who because of their actions are defective in regard to the Dharma or who do not believe for they are unfit vessels b The Commentary explains Wisdom images do not arise because of the force of both internal and external obstacles The first refers to those who due to actions in former lives are defective in regard to Dharma and are thus unable to hear the true Dharma for a long time This means that they will pass through immeasurable eons without hearing the BuddhaDharma of any buddha because they have slandered the true Dharma in a former life This obstacle is a result of their own actions and so wisdom images do not arise for them and they do not hear true Dharma for their bodies lack such  Why then do we say that they have slandered that true Dharma Or that this is the result  their ability to obstruct wisdom images which might arise does not mean that their not hearing the true Dharma is itself the result or the obstruction Rather the result and the obstacle are their defectiveness in regard to the Dharma and their unsound sense organs and obtuse bodies and minds for this is the reason why they are unable to hear and accept the true Dharma It is the natural outcome of their actions The second case refers to nonbelief that is those who do not have any lineage who have no potential for cessation who do not delight in cessation and who have no seeds of the transcendent path They have a perpetual obstacle against the realization of suchness Upon hearing the transcendent Dharma they do not believe or accept it and they will never attain cessation in any of the three vehicles Because the continuity of their bodies and minds is impure they are unfit vessels for the sacred Dharma Both for a time and for all time they do not engender any transcendent meritorious images Just as polluted water is unable to reflect the image of the moon so mirror wisdom is unable to engender any wisdom images for these sentient beings then mirror wisdom has these nine kinds of preeminent characteristics sure enunciation nondiscrimination purity from obstacles being the cause of the arising of wisdom images no clinging to I or mine not forgetting any knowable giving rise to wisdom images at all times and in all places being the source that is able to give rise to all wisdoms and being unable to give rise to wisdom images in unfit vessels These three are included in the ninth characteristic for they all are unfit vessels in whom images cannot arise equality wisdom is replete and perfected with ten kinds of descriptive marks Understand that these are the results of the practices of the ten stages We will consider them one by one Each is realized in equality wisdom cultivated to completion and perfected in the equality wisdom of the buddha land This is why it is said above that equality wisdom is replete and perfected with ten kinds of descriptive marks In general terms in each of the stages one realizes the immeasurable reality nature of equality cultivates completion and perfects the equality wisdom of the buddha land It realizes the supreme delight in all its marks because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains The phrase all its marks refers to all the major and minor marks of a great personage They are said to be equal because all these marks are far apart from the pattern of clinging to what is entirely imagined Another scripture says Because the Tathāgata is said to have the marks of a great personage he has no marks and thus it is said that he has the marks of a great personage The term supreme implies regal mastery Another scripture teaches Bhagavat I now understand that because everything has no essence c there is no poverty and no wealth The term delight refers to that delight which comes from the force of imagining whereby one engenders delight in regard to agreeable things and sorrow in regard to disagreeable things But is called the understanding of equality between the agreeable and the disagreeable because in it nothing is clung to by imagination and there is no delight in clinging to  The phrase it takes supreme delight in all its marks because of the reality nature of equality refers to the realization of the stage of joy This is what bodhisattvas first realize and then through progressive cultivation in the subsequent stages of skillful methods they cause it to grow until in the final stage of awakening they bring it to full perfection After this last stage no longer increases for they have then realized its full perfection It should be understood that this is the full perfection of equality wisdom The Experience of Conditioned Arising The Scripture says It realizes the conditioned arising of all experience because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains There are two kinds of dependent coarising internal and external Internal dependent coarising refers to the twelve branches of ignorance and so forth External dependent coarising refers to of all things such as seeds sprouts and so forth The internal is examined by the harmony or disharmony of the two modalities of defilement and purification The external is examined in ascertaining that this exists because that exists that because this arises that arises This means that sprouts come to be because of seeds for sprouts are born because seeds have been born In these two kinds of dependent coarising all things exist as results because their causes exist for results arise only in virtue of the arising of their causes The meaning of dependent coarising is the meaning of no purposeful activity It is the meaning of the essencelessness of emptiness It is the meaning of no real personal essence Because experiences these the Scripture uses the term experience Or perhaps because sentient beings are able to experience it uses the term experience for all dependently coarisen things are the content of experience and therefore all experience arises conditionally It is far removed from all clinging to imagination and is called the understanding of equality because it has no purposeful activity is empty has no essence and no real personal essence The term it realizes means that all things are experienced as dependently coarising as the reality nature of equality This wisdom is fully perfected because as explained above its realization is cultivated unto that full perfection Therefore the reality nature of the equality of dependent coarising is identical with the reality nature of the equality of all things As it has been taught Oh bhikṣu the entire Dharma realm is the conditionally produced conditionally arising reality nature As seen by the tathāgata the entire Dharma realm is the dependently coarisen Dharma realm Again another scripture teaches One cannot see even the most insignificant thing that is not dependently coarisen In this Scripture dependent coarising is termed the reality nature of the equality of dependent coarisingAccording to this profound meaning it issaid If one gains insight into dependent coarising he sees into the reality nature If one gains insight into the reality nature he sees all buddhas The above passage was presented in this Scripture because the actual nature of dependent coarising isthe ultimate Dharma the ultimate truth of awakening because the equality is not different from place to place No Marks The Scripture says It attains a state far removed from all differentiating marks and without marks because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains The term differentiating marks refers to the differences in the marks of all that is created and destroyed within material form and the other four aggregates It is far removed from all these separate differentiating marks because is the common descriptive mark  Such a common mark is a descriptive mark because this mark is a nomark As a scripture teaches The reality nature has only one b mark and that is a nomark This absence of any descriptive mark is precisely the equality of the reality nature The term realizes is used because this understands the reality nature of equality whereby all states of clinging to imagination are seen to be absolutely and eternally nonexistent As explained above equality wisdom is fully perfected because this realization is cultivated unto full perfection And its being far removed from no marks means that it is not the case that it has no marks Because it does not have no marks this Scripture terms it the equality  The rest is as above The Fourth Mark A broad refuge is great compassion because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains There are three kinds of compassion The first is that which is focused on sentient beings as its object The second is that which is focused on the Dharma as its object The third is that which has no object at all When bodhisattvas first elicit the aspiration for wisdom in many ways they cultivate the compassion that is focused on sentient beings as its object In sundry manners this compassion is contaminated because of its conventional conditioned object When they are cultivating true practice in many ways they cultivate the compassion that is focused on the Dharma as its object Another opinion holds that the only object is the Dharma realm because any discrimination of external objects is nonexistent Therefore it is called compassion without an object because it does not focus on either sentient beings or the Dharma Its universally equal activity understands all that which is conventionally valid for the nature of sentient beings is universally equal because the dependently coarisen universal reality nature is universally equal because essenceless suchness is universally equal Therefore it is termed equality wisdom Thus the objects associated with this wisdom include all the three compassions However it is said to be objectless because its action is nondiscriminative and equal The great compassion associated with equality wisdom in the land of the Tathāgata is perfected by a multitude of descriptive marks and constantly appears The Tathāgata certainly has objectless compassion and even if the other two are not specifically mentioned they are also perfected by him With universal equality the Tathāgata saves all sentient beings through these three compassion It is not only that he confers some small happiness on them Rather he constantly brings about salvation for all inasmuch as he moves in that equality whereby all sentient beings and all doctrines are essenceless suchness Thus the Scripture uses the term great compassion He is not similar to wordhearers who can bring some small benefit to sentient beings for a short time but are unable to save all sentient beings Being superior to all such wordhearers he does deliver all sentient beings inasmuch as he has amassed over a long time the completed perfection of blessed wisdom and spiritual stores and thus the Scripture uses the term a broad refuge  This broad refuge and great compassion pervade everywhere and are said to be equal that is the reality nature of equality for they are nondiscriminative Or perhaps this phrase is employed because that broad refuge and great compassion have as their content that reality nature of equality As explained above this equality wisdom is fully perfected because this great compassion is cultivated unto full perfection Unrejecting Compassion The Scripture says Unrejecting is its compassion because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains The compassion of the wordhearersis unable to save allsentient beings for its activity includes only a limited number ofsen c tient beings in this realm of desire and arises only for a limited time period But the great compassion of the tathāgatas is universally able to save all sentient beings for its activity includes all sentient beings in the triple world and arises constantly The term nonrejecting means that without refusal constantly saves and does not abandon sentient beings His compassion always arises without fail to save suffering sentient beings from the three sufferings as appropriate to each Just as an adult would take pity on a child arises equally for all sentient beings It does not fall away even for a single moment in its maturing of sentient beings because the realm of sentient beings is limitless The Tathāgata is always associated with great compassion and one cannot say that this compassion arises or appears only at certain times As a scripture teaches Good sons you must not say that the great compassion of the Buddha Bhagavats arises or appears for all sentient beings only at certain times The reason why it constantly and always appears is that if that great compassion of all Buddha Bhagavats was not grounded on wisdom then they could not have realized supreme awakening But the tathāgatas have already realized that great wisdom and constantly entertain the thought that they must establish all the good roots of sentient beings that they must elucidate the Dharma for those who do not yet understand it In this manner the tathāgatas always give rise to great compassion for sentient beings Again another scripture teaches Night and day at the six times the Tathāgata beholds the world how then can it be said that his compassion arises always  the phrase the six times means a constant continuity without interruption  Thus there is no contradiction here Great mercy and compassion have benevolence nonviolence and nondelusion as their essence In their conferral of happiness and deliverance from suffering the mode of functioning does differ but both include the three kinds of sentient beings and so forth Either this is itself the reality nature or it takes as its content that reality nature of equality As explained above equality wisdom is fully perfected because this compassion is cultivated unto full perfection Transformation Bodies The Scripture says It manifests itself according to the dispositions of all sentient beings because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains According to the earnest desires of sentient beings they see different transformation bodies of the Tathāgata for that is the manner in which the Tathāgata manifests his transformation bodies Although the Tathāgata abides in a state of no fabrication yet his pure consciousness associated with mirror wisdom manifests gemlike wondrous transformation bodies in virtue of the enabling power of equality wisdom Sentient beings say that they see these bodies exterior to their minds because he causes their good roots to mature so that images of these bodies appear in their minds As a scripture teaches There are such manifestations because of the compassionate good roots of all tathāgatas for they cause the minds of gods humans and so forth to be transformed in various ways and to see the bodies of those tathāgatas as if they were colored golden Again another scripture teaches If the sentient beings to be converted as appropriate to each see the colors of the vaiḍūrya or maṇigem  this is because he is able to manifest these various gem colors and thus cause their own minds to be so transformed He manifests the universal equality of the appearances of all tathāgatas The Scripture uses the phrase the reality nature of equality because in this way it identifies universal equality with that reality nature This means that in accord with the earnest desires of sentient beings to be converted in common  all tathāgatas make visible the appearances of transformation bodies for each manifests the same appearance at the same place and at the same time thus causing the mind of sentient beings to be transformed and thus bringing benefit and happiness to them When they mature then a each sentient being individually perceives the descriptive marks of the world  and yet there is no contradiction here between that common nature of those descriptive marks and the individual perceptions of beings for these descriptive marks occur at the same place and time for all individuals It is similar to the descriptive marks of the transformation bodies Thus as explained above equality wisdom is fully perfected because it is cultivated unto perfection The Tathāgatas Words The Scripture says Its words are to be respectfully received by all sentient beings because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains When sentient beings hear words that are able to mature their good roots they will be delighted and realize the happiness of pure faith The Tathāgata manifests such words for although he has no fabrication yet in virtue of the power of his compassionate vow he does manifest such wordsAnd those sentient beingsto be converted are variously transformed in this fashion because of their own eminent powers of understanding The Scripture says that are to be respectfully received because all gods humans and so forth should not oppose them It is taught furthermore that the Buddhas words are not in vain because if these words were not addressed to the mental functioning  they would not be manifested Although there are sentient beings who do not follow the Buddhas words yet because do transform and bring benefit in the future they will certainly come to believe in and accept them Those words are all equal because by the above explanation such enunciated words are manifested by all buddhas in common It is precisely this equality that is called the reality nature Equality wisdom is fully perfected because as explained above this manifestation is cultivated unto perfection The One Taste of Tranquility The Scripture says Tranquility in the world is all of one taste because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains The term world here refers to the five contaminated aggregates The term tranquility is used because from moment to moment controls through the two destructions whereby they are rendered quiescent and brought to cessation Tranquility in the world is identical in meaning to suchness and since this is full perfection the Scripture says that it is of one taste Furthermore the term world means that since the pattern of clinging to what is entirely imagined is absent from the original nature it is called tranquility Because suchness is manifested in this tranquility it is said to be of one taste And this is the reality nature of equality As explained above equality wisdom is fully perfected because this one taste is cultivated unto perfection The suffering and happiness in all worldly states is of one taste because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains In general these eight are of two kinds the four disagreeable ones which are suffering and the four agreeable ones which are pleasure inasmuch as they produce delight The arhat dwells constantly in one taste for when he attains gain he is not delighted when he encounters loss he is not downcast when he finds happiness he is not covetous when he is suffering he is not cantankerous As a scripture teaches The world of the arhat is of the one taste of equality just as if it were empty space The fool imagines that there are distinctions in the world but the eight worldly states are everywhere the same for the arhat because he is far removed from such imaginings And this is the reality nature of equality As explained above equality wisdom is fully perfected because this one taste is cultivated unto perfection The Nurture of Good Qualities The Scripture says It cultivates the final stage of immeasurable good qualities because the reality nature of equality is fully perfected The Commentary explains Good qualities here refers to the meritorious states of the virtues favorable to wisdom The Scripture uses the term cultivates because equality wisdom permeates nourishes and matures deliverance Although equality wisdom is nondiscriminative like the maṇigem it causes the good qualities of different individuals to increase and mature unto deliverance through the enabling power of buddhas and bodhisattvas The phrase the final stage means that it causes deliverance for it is able to attain final cessation in the three vehicles One cannot say however that it causes worldly pleasure Such august wisdom is termed the reality nature of equality because it is far removed from the pattern of clinging to the imagined Or perhaps this Scripture usesthe phrase reality nature of equality because all the bodhisattvas cultivate the preeminent qualities of the virtues favorable to wisdom and come to that final stage As explained above equality wisdom is fully perfected because these good qualities are cultivated unto perfection c Chapter XI Discernment Wisdom The Scripture says The First Cause Just as the realm of the physical world supports the realm of sentient beings just so the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom supports the approaches of all recollective formulae and concentrations and without obstacle expounds the wondrous Dharma of the Buddha The Commentary explains The phrase just as the physical world supports the realm of sentient beings means that the physical world which consists of the windwheel at the base and which is an evolution from the individual minds of sentient beings is able to support the realm of sentient beings the world of sensation which is also an evolution from the individual minds of sentient beings In like fashion the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom is able to support all the approaches of recollective formulae and more broadly of all the wondrous doctrines of the Buddha for it is associated with them and is able to elicit them Recollective formulae refer to those superior recollective wisdoms which are able to support immeasurable buddha qualities and hold them without failure In one teaching it can support all teachings In one expression it can support all expressions In one meaning it can support all meanings how is it possible that in but one teaching it can support all teachings this means that the inconceivable power of the superior recollective wisdom of buddhas and bodhisattvas manifests the simple meaning of all doctrinal expression in the imageaspect of their own minds It is also able to manifest the approaches to inconceivable inexhaustible good qualities for their insightaspect and selfawareness aspect both have such an unlimited preeminent potential and both support everything and cause things not to be forgotten Concentration refers to those superior contemplations which include all the various concentrations such as the concentration of the heroic journey and which are able to bring to victory all transcendent and worldly concentrations Since the other are incapable of leading one to victory the above concentration is called that of the heroic journey Or perhaps because such is the action of that heroic land of buddhas and bodhisattvas are called heroic journeys for only buddhas and bodhisattvas at the stage of the Dharma cloud attain these concentrations All other concentrations are to be interpreted in accord with the explanation of this Scripture that is both recollective formulae and concentrations are to be explained as approaches because just like the three approaches of emptiness wishlessness and imagelessness they are able to engender all kinds of good qualities The phrase without obstacle it expounds refers to the four absences of obstacles in regard to the Dharma its meaning its explanation and its interpretation Due to these four is able to expound as stated in this Scripture All the words of the wondrous Dharma of all buddhas all the unlimited buddha qualities of the Tathāgatas ten powers and fearlessnesses must be similarly explained Discernment wisdom is able to support all these qualities because it converts the perceiving consciousness and attains a dynamic energy for the purified perceiving consciousness associated with this wisdom is associated with a Chapter XI and able to engender all good qualities and is thus said in the Scripture to be able to support them Again just as the world is the direct cause for consciousnesses that spontaneously engenders all kinds of immeasurable images just so the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom is the direct cause for consciousness that simultaneously engenders immeasurable images of all knowables of wondrous wisdoms without obstacle The Commentary explains This passage explains discernment wisdom as the cause for engendering Discernment wisdom is able simultaneously to know all knowables because it is the cause whereby consciousness engenders the images of all knowables The term world here means the entire receptacle world Just as the receptacle world is able to be generative cause for the consciousness of sentient beings with all the various images in unlimited space just so the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom is able unobstructedly to understand at one time and in one place all knowable realms which are like empty space because it is the generative cause for consciousness with its images of all the unlimited worldly and transcendent object realms This means that the discernment wisdom of all tathāgatas is able to understand all objects and has a multitude of images that appear as those knowable objects just as a multicolored painting has a multitude of images In its insightaspect the nature of this wisdom is to be the generative cause for consciousness with these images and it is said to be their generative cause precisely because it can manifest them It is not however their direct cause for arise from the seeds in the converted container consciousness Here the term cause refers to a conditional cause because insight engenders images or because the essence engenders activity Although that essence is undifferentiated in itself inasmuch as the aspects of consciousness are differentiated can be regarded as a cause This is similar to the engendering of that insightaspect from the imageaspect in transmigratory consciousness only in wisdom the direction is reversed since a tathāgata does not wait upon images of sensation in order to gain insight Delighting The Scripture says Just as in the world there are various things to play with and the adornments of parks groves pools and so forth can be deeply enjoyed just so in the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom there are various things to play with and the adornments of the perfections the virtues favorable to awakening the ten powers the fearlessnesses and the exclusive buddha qualities can be deeply enjoyed The Commentary explains This passage explains discernment wisdom as the cause for delight Just as in the physical world there are many things to play with and the beautifully adorned brilliant splendor of parks groves pools and so forth bring joy and delight to sentient beings just so the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom in many ways is able to play upon the perfections the virtues favorable to awakening and so forth and their beautifully adorned brilliant splendor brings joy and delight to all bodhisattvas The perfections refer to the six perfections When expanded through analysis they become ten for the last four are stages of skillful method Alternately when analyzed they number eightyfour thousand for as a scripture teaches If one analyzes their distinctions their number is immeasurable The virtues favorable to awakening number thirtyseven but by extension they also are immeasurable The ten powers are the wisdom powers of knowing the possible and so forth which are all comprised in the wisdom faculties of the Tathāgata asthe faculties of his knowledge The fearlessnesses refers to the absences of the four dreads which are comprised in his five supernatural faculties and are the faculties of his knowledge that is faith zeal recollection concentration and wisdom There are eighteen exclusive buddha qualities As a scripture teaches The many aspects of these qualities are comprised in this wisdom and being associated with them it can bring them to completion Thus this wisdom has all adornments Just as the world is completely arrayed with the wondrous adornments of the continents the islands the sun and the moon the Heaven Chapter XI of the Four Celestial Emperors the Thirtythreefold Heaven Suyāma Heaven Tuṣita Heaven Nirmāṇarati Heaven Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven Brahmakāya Heaven and so forth just so the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom examines the complete array of the wondrous adornments of the causes and results of both worldly and transcendent degeneration and prospering as well as the full realization of wordhearers individually enlightened ones and bodhisattvas without exception The Commentary explains It is just as in the physical world the immeasurable continents are wondrously adorned and arrayed without being confused with one another The term continents refers to the four great continents of Jambudvīpa  The term islands refers to the eight small islands of Cāmara which in pairs surround those four continents The mention of the sun and the moon includes all the heavenly constellations The Heaven of the Four Celestial Emperors refers to those gods who dwell on each of the four sides of the fourth level of Mount Sumeru The Thirtythreefold Heaven means that because each of these four sides of that mountain peak has eight emperor gods with the addition of Indra at their center we arrive at this number  The Suyāma Heaven means that because these gods having come of age  experience pleasure it is called the coming of age  The Tuṣita Heaven is where those bodhisattvas who will become embodied as buddhas in the future are transformed through the Dharma Because they cultivate the fullness of joy  it is called Tuṣita The Nirmāṇarati Heaven is where gods take pleasure in all the pleasures that they themselves bring about for they are narcissistic The Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven is where they take pleasure in pleasures that they cause others to bring about and when these pleasures are present they control them The Brahmakāya Heaven is called brahma because it is apart from desire and tranquil The word kāya here means his multitude The phrase and so forth refers to all the heavens above these mentioned here  so the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom examines the causes and results of all worldly and transcendent degeneration and prospering and all the full arrangement of the wondrous adornments of the three vehicles without confusing one with c another Worldly degeneration refersto the causes and results of evil destinies Worldly prospering refers to the causes and results of good destinies Inasmuch as they are worldly devolution or evolution they are respectively called degeneration and prospering Degeneration also refers to loss and destruction while prospering refers to increase and growth The causes and results of the two vehicles are termed transcendent degeneration The causes and results of the Great Vehicle are termed transcendent prospering Degeneration means falling back while prospering means forging ahead The term full realizations refers to the result state as it occurs upon the manifestation of the causal issue of the three vehicles Only at this full realization is one said to have attained the result of awakening Because discernment wisdom examines the differences in these states and their marks this wisdom does resemble them and yet with no confusion in its mode of functioning it clearly manifests  Therefore this Scripture uses the phrase the complete arrayment of wondrous adornments The Fifth Cause Experiencing The Scripture says Just as the world is extensively experienced by sentient beings just so the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom manifests itself to all buddha assemblies and pours down the rain of the Dharma to lead sentient beings to experience the joy of that great Dharma The Commentary explains Due to the enabling power of the karmic actions of sentient beings the seeds common to their container consciousnesses evolve and engender the various prerequisites that make them able extensively to experience the physical world In like fashion the purified consciousness of the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom assisted by equality wisdom as its enabling cause and evolving in synergy with mirror wisdom manifests enjoyment bodies to various assemblies warms them with its flaming ardor and pours down the rain of the great Dharma in order to lead all worldtranscendent bodhisattvas to experience joy in that great Dharma Furthermore with the assistance of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom this purified consciousness also manifests transformation bodies to various assemblies warms them with its flaming ardor and pours down the rain of a Chapter XI the great Dharma in order to lead those sentient beings who are to be converted to experience the joy in that Dharma here on this earth Just as in the world the five destinies of the hells hungry ghosts  animals humans and gods are all possible just so in the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom the examining of the unlimited causes and results associated with these five destinies comes to be fully manifested The Commentary explains Due to the enabling power of the karmic actions of sentient beings the patterns of their own container consciousnesses evolve and engender the possibilities of differences in the causes and results of the five destinies In a like fashion the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom because it has as its content the causes and results of these five destinies distinguishes and reveals the two characteristics that resemble the causes and results of these five destinies Yet it does not speak discriminately because it itself does not engender any of those undetermined states of the devas the gods the hungry ghosts or the animals The causes of the five destinies means that those in the intermediate state between death and rebirth have these five destinies as the means of being reborn It is in virtue of the four kinds of birth established by the differences in the ways of being born that those in the intermediate state become included among those who are born Thus the causes referred to in this Scripture are their karmic actions of passion and so forth and their results are the five destinies Examining Realms The Scripture says Just as in the world all the realms of desire  form  and no form are all possible just so in the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom the differences associated with the unlimited causes and results of these three realms come to be manifested The Commentary explains Due to the enabling power of their actions in the world the common and individual patterns of the container consciousnesses of sentient beings evolve and engender the possibilities of differences in the causes and results of the three realms Included within the world are both the sentient realm and the nonsentient realm that is the realm of sentient beings and the physical world If this were not so then would not include those in the intermediate state  nor those in the formless realm who have only a form engendered from concentration and no form produced by karmic action or physical location These three realms are established within the world with their respective  This means that in the physical world there are only the realms of desire and of form of the sentient and the nonsentient But in the realm of sentient beings there are all three realms  These three only exist in the realm of sentient beings for the physical world only supports the realms of the sentient and the nonsentient while the world of sentient beings can support the realms of sentient beings In a like fashion the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom has as its content the causes and results of all three realms and in it are manifested the differences in their patterns It is not that this wisdom engenders these causes and results but as explained above they are examined by it This means that in virtue of the fact that discernment wisdom is universally able to examine all objects the images of all realms destinies and births the causes and results of the consciousnesses and conscious states supported on the maturation of all karmic actions and influenced by the actions of passion do indeed appear  This means that discernment wisdom which arises from the enabling power of the mirror wisdom of all tathāgatas although it does not cling to subject or object and is far removed from all the obstacles of passion and to knowledge yet in virtue of its examination of the elements of all causes and results it is able to enunciate them and reflect their images just as a pure b Chapter XI mirror reflects a multitude of images Although mirror wisdom is unconfused about all objects and is able to manifest all images without exerting any effort yet it is nondiscriminative But this wisdom is able to discriminately manifest all the images of objects If it also were nondiscriminative then it would be unable to examine the elements of the causes and results or to enunciate the Dharma without doubt for the various assemblies This passage definitely establishes that uncontaminated mind and mental states do have the imageaspect a question treated above as Theme Ten in Chapter Two Part Two for the unlimited causes and results of the five destinies and the three realms do come to be manifested in this wisdom of the Tathāgata There is an opinion that because the Tathāgatas wisdom is bright and pure although the images of all objects do appear in it yet those images are not evolutions of that wisdom because they are not pure this opinion is invalid because all images of things are evolutions of the mind and mental states of sentient beings and thus there is no dichotomy between pure consciousness and impure images But  if these images are evolutions of the mind and mental states of sentient beings how can they be manifested in buddha wisdom at all It is impossible for one kind of cause to engender another kind of consciousness for such contradicts sound reasoning But then these images are the same as images in other minds and cannot be manifested in the mind of wisdom these images of objects are manifested by the Tathāgatas uncontaminated mind just as the image of defecation might appear in a bright mirror Although it might appear to be impure yet it is not so That mind and mental states have as their content the reality nature and even if they have other content they still do not act like pincers nor like lamps  for they have no movement at all Rather just as the nature of a bright mirror is originally pure wisdom manifests images that appear like objects and is thus able to consider them If the images of these things did not appear in this consciousness then although they had the power to engender mind and mental states they could not be called the content  just as the five sense organs and so forth are not called the content of consciousness although they also have the power in the presence of the images of objects to engender consciousness As said elsewhere Is nondiscriminative wisdom limited in any way Since its content is suchness and it is not apart from the essence of wisdom it cannot be limited in any way But the conventional wisdom that is subsequently attained although not apart from suchness in virtue of the fact that it is discriminative does not realize the essence of suchness for it has as its content an image of suchness brought about through its own evolutions One cannot then object that the uncontaminated images of objects in the uncontaminated mind are similar to the objects in the minds of common worldlings or that although they appear to be uncontaminated in fact they are contaminated The basic principle of conscious constructiononly is established to mean that although the images evolved by conscious construction seem to imply a existence in reality there is no essence If this were not so then material form and so forth would exist just the same as mind and mental states And this would invalidate the principle of conscious constructiononly This principle means that their real existence is not apart from consciousness If consciousness and conscious states were not distinct from material form and so forth but instead were yoked to them then that would be objects only Just as in the world Mount Sumeru and the other great jeweled lofty peaks can appear just so in the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom the broad deep Dharma which draws upon the power of all buddhas and bodhisattvas can appear The Commentary explains This passage explains discernment wisdom as the cause of pouring down the rain of Dharma In this world there arise all the jeweled mountains because of the enabling power of the karmic actions ofsentient beings In like fashion the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom givesrise to all deep doctrines because of the enabling power of the action of that true Dharma which influences all sentient beings for it draws upon the might of all buddhas and c Chapter XI bodhisattvas The Scripture says that it draws upon the power of all buddhas and bodhisattvas because this doctrine reveals the power of the mastery of all buddhas and bodhisattvas and is able to draw upon their august powers This means that the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom is able to engender the images of Dharma in the consciousnesses associated with mirror wisdom or that it itself is able to manifest these images of Dharma Since its objective is the maturation of good roots are manifested in the minds of the sentient beings to be converted Just as in the world the broad deep unperturbed sea can appear just so in the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom the doctrine of the deep Dharma realm which is unperturbed by inimical forces nonBuddhists or false teachers can appear The Commentary explains This passage explains discernment wisdom as the cause for suppressing inimical forces In the world there arises the unperturbed great sea because of the enabling power of the karmic actions of sentient beings In a like fashion the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom gives rise to the doctrine of the Dharma realm which doctrine is unperturbed due to the enabling power of the action of the true Dharma in influencing sentient beings The Dharma realm is the imageless truth of emptiness The Scripture refers to this Dharma realm as the doctrine of the Dharma realm All nonBuddhists depend on their own opinions but the truth of the emptiness of the Dharma realm controls such opinions and is apart from all such opinions As a scripture teaches The Buddha Bhagavat is called the sun of great wisdom because he is universally able to illumine and understand everything a The Tenth Cause Severing Doubt The Scripture says Just as the world is surrounded by large and small mountain ranges so the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom is surrounded by all the individual and common marks in regard to which it is unconfused The Commentary explains This world of Mount Sumeru its seven surrounding mountain ranges the eight great seas and the four continents are encircled and surrounded by an outer small range of mountains whose total number reaches a thousand Again all this is encircled and surrounded by the next mountain range Such a total is termed a small chiliocosm that is one thousand such worlds all surrounded by their respective mountain ranges because its number reaches a thousand Furthermore all these are again encircled and surrounded by the next mountain range and such is termed a medium chiliocosm  for their number reaches yet another thousand All these are yet once more encircled and surrounded by a great mountain range which is itself supported below on the great windwheel Such is termed a great chiliocosm that is one thousand of the medium chiliocosms which contain one thousand of the small chiliocosms which contain one thousand worlds This is what the Scripture refers to in the phrase it is surrounded by large and small mountain ranges In a like fashion the Tathāgatas discernment wisdom universally knows all individual and common marks and is able to sever all worldly doubts The cause of such doubts is confusion in regard to such individual or common marks but lacking any such confusion this wisdom understands all these marks It is able to sever the doubts of others because it itself has no doubt at all Being apart from the obstacles of passion and to knowledge mirror wisdom is unconfused in regard to all individual and common marks and is able to engender this wisdom Because it supports and preserves this wisdom this discernment wisdom is said to be surrounded However although mirror wisdom is able to know all individual and common marks yet being nondiscriminative it is unable to enunciate the Dharma for others or to sever their doubts But this discernment wisdom is Chapter XI both able to know all and can enunciate the Dharma and sever all the doubts of others because it is discriminative Furthermore it is the very essence of this wisdom to know the individual and common marks of all things and it is surrounded by these two kinds of conditioned marks The individual marks are like the mountains of the small range while the common marks are like the mountains of the large range Mirror wisdom is able to support  just as from below the windwheel supports the great chiliocosm since is supported by the direct insight of the Tathāgatas pure wisdom which as direct perception is directed only to individual marks how is it able to know the common marks of all things If these common marks are known by direct insight and not by inference then how can the two means of cognition be held to be based on these two kinds of marks as is done by Dignāga in his Collection of Remarks on the Means of Valid Cognition The first holds that these two sources of true knowledge are established on these two marks only in the fragmented mind but that that does not apply to the state of concentration Even if the concentrated mind has all marks as its content  all are supported by direct insight  The second opinion holds that the concentrated mind has as its content only the individual marks But it also understands the common marks because it draws forth its skillful methods from those common marks The truths manifested are then spoken by skillful method and are termed the knowledge of common marks Otherwise they would be termed knowledge of individual marks It is from this reasoning that we say suchness is the common mark of all things which are empty and selfless and that suchness as the manifestation of the two emptinesses  is not their common mark The correct third opinion differs only slightly from the above second opinion of that treatise on Buddhist logic Dignāgas Collection of Remarks on the Means of Valid Cognition which accepts the existence of individual and common marks That text says that in the truth of ultimate meaning all things are termed individual marks because individual and common marks are each contained in their own nature and are not intermingled If the discriminative mind establishes a general category and is able to express its b meaning it then penetrates through all things  just as one might string flowers together Such is called a common mark  Thus it is that the discrimination of the fragmented mind conventionally establishes the objects of inferential thinking But all concentrated minds are far apart from such discrimination and is called direct perception Although these minds do have as their content the suffering and impermanence of all things yet because each one of these things exists singly they are said to be the individual marks which are the contents of the direct perception of wisdom Therefore suchness although it is expressed as a common mark is in fact the individual nature of all things is their individual existing mark It is not a common mark because one cannot say that it is either identical with nor different from all things that is with their common marks This is why it is called both a common mark and an individual mark Thus when that treatise says that the truth of ultimate meaning of all things is termed their individual mark although it expresses itself differently from this Scripture on the Buddha Land yet there is no contradiction Next wondrously born ones is dutyfulfillment wisdom The Commentary explains Understand that dutyfulfillment wisdom brings about the transformation bodies of the Tathāgata Furthermore there are three kinds  The first transformation is again of three kinds The transformations of speech also are of three kinds  Dutyfulfillment wisdom is able to engender transforming activities in regard to the three actions  for the transformations of these three constitute the transformation body You should understand that the essence of this is manifested in and through these three transformations and their activity It is not that these three transformations are themselves the essence of wisdom Rather they are the images that appear through wisdom The pure consciousness associated with mirror wisdom developing in synergy with the enabling power of dutyfulfillment wisdom brings about the manifestation of the transforming activity of these three actions and is thus itself manifested Understand that each of the four wisdoms is able to engender all these activities Just as one by one the senses grasp all things and yet none lacks a principal activity so it is here The teaching of this Scripture definitely demonstrates that the mind and mental states of the three actions all have their transformations All the qualities of this gross mind and these mental states as they appear in the Tathāgatas wisdom lead those in inferior positions to come to understanding if the qualities of this mind and these mental states present to the Tathāgata are differentiated then how can it be that the Tathāgata has long since realized awakening How could he be able to manifest the various transformation bodies which are themselves characterized by covetousness anger and so forth another scripture does teach that he transforms immeasurable kinds in such a manner that they are conscious And it is also taught that transformation bodies are said to be both conscious and not conscious because they have a consciousness that is otherdependent but not a consciousness that is selfdependent This means that his transformation of mind is manifested in dependency on his ultimate mind The imageaspect of his real mind appears as if it had the activities of thinking It is just as in a mirror fire does not have a separate subsistence but arises in dependence on a multitude of causes Although we say that the mind and the mental states of others have no direct relationship with this transformed mind because they have no real function in its regard yet in truth this transformed mind and transformed material form do have a real function in their regard because they function like actual material form and thus we say that they have  Because the manifestations of the gross marks of such a transformation of mind are easy to understand even apes and monkeys know the Tathāgatas mind But if it were the real mind of the Buddha  then even the great bodhisattvas would be unable to understand it c Chapter XII The First Transformation Supernatural Powers The Scripture says Just as because of the efficacious physical actions of sentient beings they seek various profitable endeavors take up farming enter a kings service and so forth just so because of the actions of the efficacious transformations of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom he manifests various skillful endeavors to suppress all cleverness and conceit among sentient beings and thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the actions of the transformation of the body which consists of a transformation manifested through supernatural powers They are called efficacious because they cause the mind to venture forth Because of their ongoing efficacious action zeal is attained by those of good lineage while diligent practice is attained by others This is why such action is termed efficacious In virtue of such an action of bodies sentient beings in the world practice the three correct actions  The phrase and so forth indicates any kind of such endeavors Dutyfulfillment wisdom in synergy with zeal engenders the action of transforming bodies Because of this transforming action when one becomes a bodhisattva he manifests various kinds of skillful endeavors just as a craftsman might In this wisdom the descriptive marks of physical actions are manifested because he desires to suppress cleverness and conceit He manifests very skillful methods because in the path of awareness of the equality between compassion and wisdom he first manifests supernatural powers The Scripture says that he leads beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma because he first causes beings to elicit faith just as by manifesting his supernatural powers he saved Kāśyapa The Scripture says that he matures them because he has the profound ability to make them docile They are liberated because he leads both those of lineage and those of no lineage to be liberated respectively from the triple world and from evil destinies Because of the transforming power of his Dharma those of lineage are led to elicit the holy path and to be liberated from the triple world while those of no lineage are led to cultivate worldly a good and constantly to be reborn in good destinies Being attentive to their good roots in order to preach the true Dharma to them he leads to be liberated from the triple world Assuaging suffering by emitting his brilliant light he establishes in good destinies Another interpretation holds that these three actions mean that he causes them to engender the elements conducive to liberation and the elements conducive to insight and then to engender the holy path Yet another interpretation holds that these three mean that he causes them to enter the path of insight the path of practice and the path of no training Just as because sentient beings experience bodily actions they experience the objects of the various material forms and so forth just so because the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom experiences transformed bodily actions the Tathāgata goes to all the various places where sentient beings are born adopts their life form and dwells in an honored position among them Because he thus adopts their lifestyle he supports all kinds of sentient beings Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the action of the transformation of the body which consists in the transformation manifested through the experience of being born The Scripture uses the term experience because wherever they are born in the world sentient beings experience the objects of material form through their senses The term bodily action is used because their bodies are constantly active In all places of birth and at all times dutyfulfillment wisdom manifests births and experiences objects This means that it manifests transformation bodies in all places among gods Chapter XII and humans It manifests a birth of the same kind as those among whom it dwells whether they be of the kṣatriya or brahmin class In other births the Buddha supports all lower classes and brings benefit and happiness to them The manifestation of the bodily action of this wisdom whether in synergy with mirror wisdom or manifested under its own power are all to be understood in this fashion Manifesting the Results of Actions The Scripture says Just as because sentient beings experience bodily actions they experience the good and evil results of what they do just so because the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom experiences transformed bodily actions the Tathāgata manifests and experiences all the practices that were difficult to cultivate in former times and in former births Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the action of the transformation of the body which consists of the transformation manifested as the results of actions The term bodily actions is used because it is the body that acts Because such are the results of previous actions the word results implies the presence of a cause Or perhaps when the body experiences the results of previous actions because it has a constant activity the Scripture uses the term bodily actions It is in virtue of these bodily actions that we experience the results of the craving and hatred that flow from those previous actions Dutyfulfillment wisdom experiences bodily actions inasmuch as it manifests transformation bodies and in virtue of this action it manifests and experiences everything As the Vessantarajātaka and other Jātakas explain all former times depend upon those former births The various practices of asceticism formerly cultivated are here termed the practices that were difficult to cultivate Or perhaps those practices refer to the practices whereby the b transformation body of this present age attained wisdom by first practicing asceticism and then abandoning such practices This means that he first manifested and cultivated practices of asceticism to convert the sentient beings who imagined that such practices would put a stop to evil and give rise to good and that this was the method to attain wisdom but then he demonstrated the method of attaining wisdom by abandoning asceticism to show that it is not just by the practice of the precepts that one attains purification for that is attained through the cultivation of concentration and wisdom As a scripture teaches At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha Maitreya Tathāgata uttered this admonishment O bhikṣus where is great wisdom in receiving the tonsure If this were not so then why would Maitreya who had already shown reverence to immeasurable tathāgatas and nurtured all his good roots when he remembered the former births from the beginning have uttered such a heavy and harsh criticism You should understand that these words were intended to convert and save for those who in virtue of listening to these words will attain salvation are led through them to abstain  Just as because of the action of encouraging speech sentient beings draw out their discussions and encourage one another just so because of the transformed action of the encouraging speech of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom the Tathāgata pleasingly declares various kinds of doctrines that accord joy in the skillful wonders of his scriptures and their meaning When those of little intelligence first hear they respectfully believe Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and to mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the action of the transformation of speech which consists in the transformation of encouraging speech The term encouraging means that this speech selected to bring Chapter XII about joy is capable of doing so in virtue of the fact that upon hearing such words one develops and elicits great joy This means that because of the enabling power of the minds of sentient beings which develop speech the images of speech appear in each of their individual consciousnesses as the enabling condition and they then cause the minds of others also to elicitsimilar verbal images Upon hearing such words from another one engenders joy The transforming speech of dutyfulfillment wisdom must be understood in like fashion for it manifests wondrous sounds and causes the minds of others to be converted This means that upon hearing the Buddhas speech they engender joy The phrase the Dharma that accords joy means that gods humans and all those in the three vehicles joyfully hear in accord with the power of that cause and discern the Dharma The phrase the skillful wonders of his scriptures means that his writings manifest beauty and bring about that joyful hearing The phrase the skillful wonders of its meaning means that those meanings being truly reasoned and clear are easy to understand The phrase when sentient beings of little intelligence first hear they respectfully believe means that the Buddhas utterances are endowed with the sixty qualities   Even those of foolish intelligence engender faith and understanding when they hear it How much more would those of intelligence do so This dutyfulfillment wisdom is able to manifest transformed speech and proclaim all skillful wondrous scriptures and meanings It is able to engender a joyful mind in sentient beings It is able to confer good and manifest all things because the Buddhas voice proclaims the deep Dharma that is difficult to fathom Thus this wisdom is able to confer other things as well for through all treatises through all material forms and even through empty space it is able to bring forth the enunciation of Dharma through this transformation of speech Just as because of the skillful speech of sentient beings they indicate and attend to the task of summoning one another to destroy evil and praise good just so because of the transformed action of the speech of skillful method that arises from the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom c the Tathāgata establishes the correct rules of training to destroy all madness and praise all sanity Furthermore he establishes some in the practice of faith and others in the practice of the Dharma Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the action of the transformation of speech which consists in the transformation of the speech of skillful method It is just like the teachings associated with skillful speech in the world which manifest all that must be done and all that must be left undone in order to benefit dear friends It is because its efforts arise in regard to sentient beings who are crazed with passion that it is termed skillful In like fashion the Tathāgata from his great compassion establishes the rules of training for sentient beings in order to cause them to suppress all evil and cultivate all worldly good By establishing differences in the stages of the holy path he causes them to enter that correct path and transcend the triple world Dutyfulfillment wisdom is able to engender such transformed speech and carry through to completion its tasks This means that the stopping of evil and the development of all good is the function of this kind of speech Explanatory Speech The Scripture says Just as because of the explanatory speech of sentient beings they develop explanations for meanings not understood and clarify all treatises just so because of the transformed explanatory speech of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom he severs the immeasurable doubts of all sentient beings Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the action of the transformation of speech which consists in the transformation of explanatory speech In accord with the differences in the thinking and dispositions of sentient beings dutyfulfillment wisdom manifests the actions of its transformed speech It enunciates various meanings and severs all doubt This means that in uttering one sound it expresses all meanings and all sentient beings attain benefit as appropriate to eachAs a scripture teaches In one sound a Chapter XII the Buddha explains all meanings and sentient beings attain understanding as appropriate to each whether they be fearful or joyous whether they are yet troubled or have severed their doubts This transformed speech evolved from the inconceivable power of the Tathāgatas primal vow in one sound is able to sever all doubt Again just as because of the truly certain thinking of sentient beings they attain certitude as to what is possible and what is impossible just so because of the transformed thinking of certitude of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom he has certain knowledge of the eightyfour thousand different mental activities of sentient beings Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the transformation of thought which consists in the transformation of the thinking which attains certitude Because the thinking associated with dutyfulfillment wisdom is able to engender this transformation the Scripture says it is an action of transformed thinking This wisdom is able to attain certitude as to the differences in the eightyfour thousand mental activities of the sentient beings to be converted Alternately it is the images of that transformed thinking appearing in the imageaspect of this wisdom that are able to bring about certitude in regard to the eightyfour thousand mental activities for these images lead one to understand and attain the benefit of the truth of ultimate meaning These eightyfour thousand mental activities are the different states of the seething minds of sentient beings in regard to the eightyfour thousand defiled objects in the wearisome functioning of their minds These states are able to hinder the eightyfour thousand perfections the recollective formulae the concentrations and so forth The Scripture of the Fortunate Eon elucidates their descriptive marks from the cultivation of the first perfection to the last that manifests the buddha essence explaining how each of the three hundred and fifty are endowed with the six perfections  Thus we arrive at two thousand and one hundred which regulate the eightyfour hundred mental activities of craving anger delusion and so forth of sentient beings When we include the four great elements and the six faults that arise from inadvertence and thus multiply that above number by ten we arrive at the number of eightyfour thousand  By cultivating these one attains perfection in the eightyfour thousand recollective formulae and concentrations Just as because of the constructive thinking of sentient beings they bring forth all kinds of emergent actions just so because of the transformed action of the transformed constructive thinking of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom he examines all the actions which sentient beings might do what they should do and what they should not do and he constructs rules to lead them to choose that which they should do and to abandon what they should not do Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the transformation of thinking that consists of the transformation of constructive thinking In examining all the actions of sentient beings if evil actions are not done there will be benefit but if they are done then loss ensues If good actions are done there will be benefit but if they are not done loss ensues He examines thus because he desires to lead them to choose benefit and abandon loss For their benefit he constructs and supports the antidote and he constructs the rules of abstinence so they will avoid loss Because the thinking associated with dutyfulfillment wisdom is able to engender such transformations it is called the action of transformed thinking Although all tathāgatas in all things lack any purposeful effort they cause the minds of sentient beings to evolve these transformed images that bring about  Therefore this thinking is termed constructive b Chapter XII Alternately these transformed images appearing in the imageaspect of this wisdom enable sentient beings to examine the benefit or loss of all their actions and cause them to understand how to attain the benefit of the truth of ultimate meaning Again because of the emergent thinking of sentient beings they bring about all their actions just so because of the action of the transformed thinking of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom and in virtue of his desire to proclaim the antidote he manifests that corpus of names phrases and words that bring about joy Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the action of the transformation of thinking that consists in the transformation of emergent thinking The thinking associated with dutyfulfillment wisdom is able to engender the two actions of the body and speech Inasmuch as it employs such speech the Scripture terms it emergent thinking Or perhaps it is so termed because this thinking emerges from wisdom for it is that which is able to bring forth such transformations Since this enunciated doctrine consists of that corpus of names phrases and words it manifests such a corpus of names phrases and words In speaking this corpus in accord with the dispositions of sentient beings the Tathāgata leads them to desire to engender within themselves the antidote Thus this transformed thinking appears in the imageaspect of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom evolves that corpus and proclaims to sentient beings the antidote for all actions In this power he causes the individual minds of all sentient beings themselves similarly to be transformed The profundity of that Dharma enunciated by the Buddha engenders in them the desire to engender within themselves the antidote Just as because sentient beings think upon their experiences they bring forth experiences of suffering and happiness just so because of the transformed action of thinking upon experience of the Tathāgatas dutyfulfillment wisdom in virtue of the fact that he declares things in fixed and unfixed terms in returning the question and in maintaining silence he manifests the meanings of the past present and future as appropriate at each instant Thus because of his power in very skillful methods he leads all sentient beings and causes them to enter the sacred Dharma and mature unto liberation The Commentary explains This passage explains the action of the transformation of thinking which consists of the transformation of thinking upon experience The term thinking upon experience means that thinking upon experience can move the mind to experience suffering or happiness The term the action of transformed thinking means that the thinking associated with dutyfulfillment wisdom can engender the transformation of such thinking It truly understands all questions and answers accordingly because it declares and answers through the four kinds of responses It reveals the meanings of immeasurable doctrines in the three times and understands them as they really are Since it already knows the essence of each thing as it really is its declarations in regard to each thing are indefectible The distinguishing answer is directed to such questions as Will all that is destroyed certainly arise again or Is it not true that there is only one jewel of Buddha Dharma and Sangha Such questions are answered by distinguishing and their meaning is not fixed The returning of the question is directed to such questions as Are the bodhisattvas in the ten stages ranked in degree or Chapter XII Are the Jewels of Buddha Dharma and Sangha eminent or inferior Such questions are answered by returning the question What is it that you expect from such a question The silent answer is directed to questions such as Is the real essence of the self good or evil or Is the color of the child of a sterile woman black or white Questions such as these receive a silent answer because they are the utmost of foolishness and deserve no answer You should understand that among these three kinds of transformations  the actions of the transformations of body and speech are either associated with ones own body or with the bodies of others or they are unassociated with either Thus there are three kinds of supernatural transformations the transformations through supernatural powers the transformations through admonition and instruction and the transformations thought to the minds  These transformed actions of buddhas in all their varieties are constantly and consistently inconceivable Because these activities their numbers and their lands are inconceivable his benefit to sentient beings is ceaseless and its emergence is inconceivable These three transformed actions of all tathāgatas because they place first their desire to mature sentient beings Therefore they are called the utmost of skillful method It is thus that a scripture teaches The Buddha Bhagavat is called the joy of great wisdom because he is able to uproot all the ills of passion a Part Three The Practice Based on the Dharma Chapter XIII The Experience of Wisdom The First Question Then those wondrously born bodhisattvas spoke to the Buddha and said Bhagavat is it only the Tathāgata in the Pure Dharma Realm who experiences this phenomenal wisdom all of one taste Or can bodhisattvas also be said to experience itThe Buddha addressed those wondrously born bodhisattvas and said You can also experience this phenomenal wisdom all of one taste The Commentary explains This question is about the experience of that phenomenal wisdom all of one taste When the buddha realm was discussed earlier it was said only that the essence of the Tathāgatas Pure Dharma Realm was all of one taste that the Buddhas mirror wisdom and the other wisdoms in that realm all experience that one unified taste and are without movement or activity Those wondrously born bodhisattvas doubt that it is only the tathāgatas  and thus they penetratingly raise this question Alternately as explained above these five factors constitute the realm of great wisdom The essence of the Pure Dharma Realm is of one taste only Mirror wisdom is also of one mark only because it depends upon this Pure Dharma Realm and takes it as its content thus giving rise to nondiscriminative  Equality wisdom which also has that suchness as its content and is apart from the discrimination of subject and object is also of one taste only The other two wisdoms are also of one mark only because in order to benefit others they also rely on suchness and have no discrimination of one thing from another But if only buddhas experienced this phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste then would have no relationship with anyone else It was because they wanted to settle this question that those asked Since it is in the Pure Dharma Realm that this phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste is realized does this imply that others lack the experience of this wisdom all of one unified taste The Scripture uses the term experience because are able to experience that which is to be experienced that is the content of suchness of one unified taste Although that unity may become differentiated so as to be manifested yet in it is always undifferentiated Again it is said that because being equal in regard to subject and object it unites both it is ultimately unified and undifferentiated The term taste means the inner core the one taste that takes as the content of its experience the suchness of the Dharma realm The term wisdom means that wisdom which being able to experience correctly holds to mirror wisdom equality wisdom and the other two  for in various manners it has suchness as its content Alternately the term one taste means the ability to experience the nondiscrimination of wisdom while phenomenal refers to its result because it arises by having as its content the Pure Dharma Realm Again perhaps the Scripture uses the term one taste because this ability to experience is indifferent to all sensations and remains equally the same in the face of either suffering or happiness while the term phenomenal refers to its result this state of indifference which is associated with mirror wisdom and the other wisdoms Because that arises from this power  we call it the result Again perhaps this wisdom is termed phenomenal wisdom because characterized by an absence of purposefulness in indifference to all karmic activity it emerges everywhere as able to experience that one taste Or perhaps the term experience is used because wisdom in itself is able to experience its own essence while it is of one taste because it lacks the b Chapter XIII two discriminations of self and others It is phenomenal because that is the result constantly emerging apart from these two thoughts The Scripture explains that bodhisattvas are also able to experience this wisdom But if bodhisattvas are also able to experience it then why does the Scripture say that these five factors constitute the realm of great wisdom  the Scripture does say that the buddha realm is constituted solely of these five factors but it does not say that they constitute only that buddha realm for they are able to constitute also all the realms of the bodhisattvas Which Bodhisattvas Experience Wisdom The Scripture says Then those wondrously born bodhisattvas addressed the Buddha and said Which bodhisattvas experience this phenomenal wisdom all of one unified tasteThe Buddha addressed those wondrously born ones and said Those bodhisattvas who have realized patience of the state of no arising and abide in the doctrine of no arising when they attain the understanding of patience they will gain mastery over the two conceptions Inasmuch as they have banished these two conceptions of self and others they will attain the mind of equality From this point on the conceptions that differentiate between self and others will never again occur for those bodhisattvas and they will experience the phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste The Commentary explains The wondrously born bodhisattvas ask the question Which bodhisattvas experience this phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste in order to show the difference between those bodhisattvas who have attained the patience of the state of no arising in the Great Vehicle and those bodhisattvas who in the stage of intensified effort have not yet experienced the phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste The phrase those bodhisattvas who have attained the patience of the state of no arising refers to those bodhisattvas from the first stage of joy who have realized the suchness manifested through the two emptinesses of self and things They have understood that the imagined pattern of all things neither arises nor is destroyed They have understood the purity of the original nature and the cessation that is its essence Thus they experience this phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste This state differs from that in the path of insight of the two vehicles which does realize the suchness manifested through the emptiness of arising  but does not realize the suchness manifested through the emptiness of things and is not yet able to see the equality of all things nor to experience the phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste Bodhisattvas who have not yet entered the ten stages are also unable to realize this wisdom because they have not yet gained insight into suchness and that equality wisdom of one unified taste has not yet appeared to them According to one opinion there are three kinds of bodhisattvas in the ten stages The first are those who have begun to elicit the aspiration for wisdom These are those who in the first stage of joy have already entered the path of insight and understand that their true nature is unborn in virtue of the fact that their uncontaminated minds have engaged in the cultivation of meditation The second are those who have already cultivated that practice These are they who in the first six stages have already attained the path of cultivation in virtue of their progression in the cultivation  The third are those who have attained the state of no returning These are they who above the first three stages have already perfected the path of the cultivation  who no longer need to engage in effort and are beyond the path of intensified effort for because they abide effortlessly in the sixth stage of presence all their passions will never arise again since from moment to moment their progress is irreversible Among these only those who have attained the eighth stage of steadfastness realize that all things are originally unborn and do not arise Only these attain the universal purification of this superior wisdom of patience They constantly engender uncontaminated and abide effortlessly Because they have attained this state the Scripture says that they have realized the patience of the state of no arising As a scripture teaches In the eighth stage all bodhisattvas are apart from conceptualizing things Lacking I and mine they understand that all things are neither eternal nor transient are not born and do not arise They understand the equality of self and others This means that they attain the effortless control of these two conceptions and realize the mind of equality in regard to everything for from this state they are free from c Chapter XIII these two conceptions because they are free from effort and intense practice and because they are entirely uncontaminated and extremely purified Therefore they are said to experience the phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste Bodhisattvas in the first stage although they have already realized the equality of self and others yet do have effort intense practice and purposeful activity and inasmuch as they are not yet purified they are not yet established  The Request for Examples The Scripture says Those wondrously born bodhisattvas again spoke to the Buddha and said We request the Tathāgata to give some clear examples so that all we bodhisattvas might understand this profound meaning and might broadly proclaim and disseminate it in accord with such a purified understanding so that when sentient beings hear they will quickly understand this patience of the state of no arising The Commentary explains Those wondrously born bodhisattvas present their request that express this sublime meaning clearly in examples so that it might clearly be understood Thus all those bodhisattvas as well as others on hearing this Dharma might understand its profound meaning and understand that patience of the state of no arising The First Example The Buddha addressed those wondrously born ones and said The gods of the Thirtythreefold Heaven before they have entered the grove of unity are entirely unable to have that unified experience which lacks I and mine in both its nature and its experience But on entering that grove of unity they nondiscriminately experience at will Because of the good qualities of that grove of unity it can cause those gods to enter and all their karmic actions in both their nature and their experience will become a unified experience without any deliberation In like fashion bodhisattvas before they have realized the patience of the state of no arising are entirely unable to attain the mind of equality which is totally equal and detached They are nondiscriminative in the manner of the wordhearers and the individually enlightened ones because they yet have the two conceptions that distinguish between self and other Thus they are unable to abide in the experience of the phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste But after they have realized that patience of the state of no arising they banish these two conceptions and then attain the mind of equality thereby becoming different from wordhearers and individually enlightened ones Thus they are able to abide in detachment and experience this phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste The Commentary explains These gods of the Thirtythreefold Heaven have a grove of unity which has been formed from the unified blissful power of all those gods All the gods who are not in this grove are differentiated as superior and inferior in regard to the nature of their palaces and the experiences of their pleasures and they have discriminative experiences of I and mine But on entering that grove they abandon all discrimination of superior and inferior in both its nature and its experience Being all equal they lack I and mine and their unified experience is able to engender equality Because all these gods share in the enabling power of the unified blissful action of equality their container consciousnesses are changed and make this grove appear at the same place and time with the same single image Because of the enabling power of that grove of unity their evolving consciousnesses are similarly changed and although individually each experiences it is said that there is no differentiation  In a similar fashion those bodhisattvas of the two vehicles who have not yet entered the ten stages have not yet realized suchness in the patience of the state of no arising manifested through the two emptinesses  for they must yet sever their attachment to differentiation in the path of insight They are not free from the two discriminative conceptions of self and other They are thus unable to abide in the experience of the phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste because they have not yet attained the equality and detachment associated with uncontaminated equality wisdom Another opinion holds that bodhisattvas below the eighth stage still must expend effort and are yet in the path of intensified effort Subtle passion still emerges in them They have not yet attained the patience of the state of no a Chapter XIII arising because they are not yet purified They are thus unable to abide in the experience of the phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste because they have not yet attained the equality associated with discernment wisdom in a mind of equality and detachment Again wondrously born ones  The many large rivers and small streams before they have entered the great sea each have a different riverbed and their waters are different Their amount of water is small and their water level increases and decreases They each differ in the action of their flow In small part they support the life of water creatures But when they enter the great sea they have no differences in their beds and their waters do not differ The amount of their waters is unlimited and their water level does not increase or decrease The action of their flow is one They are an extensive and great support for water creatures In like fashion bodhisattvas who have not yet realized the great sea of the Tathāgatas Dharma realm each have a different course and their wisdoms differ They have but little wisdom and that wisdom increases and decreases They are each different in the action of the course of their wisdom In small part they are a support for the maturation of the good roots of sentient beings But when they have realized the great sea of the Tathāgatas Dharma realm they have no differences in their course Their wisdoms are not differentiated and are unlimited Their wisdom does not increase or decrease They experience the phenomenal wisdom of one unified taste and are the support for the maturation of the good roots of immeasurable sentient beings The Commentary explains The large rivers refers to the Ganges and the other four great rivers The small streams refers to all the other small rivers The phrase before they have entered the great sea each has a different riverbed means that different terrains determined their respective courses Their waters are different because until they reach the sea some are pure some turbid some muddy and some beautiful The amount of their water is small because they have not yet reached the sea Their water level increases and decreases because there are variations in the amount of rainfall They each differ in the amount of their flow because there are differences b in velocity power and development In small measure they support the life of water creatures because they are a support only for a small number of small aquatic sentient beings The sentence when they enter the great sea they have no differences in their bed and so on indicates the direct opposite of the above Understand that is described as an extensive and great support because it supports a large number of enormous creatures The phrase in like fashion bodhisattvas who have not yet entered the great sea of the Tathāgatas Dharma realm means that they have not yet realized the Buddhas Pure Dharma Realm That they each have a different support means that they take different tathāgatas as their respective supports Their wisdoms differ because each differs in the meditational practices to which he is devoted They have but little wisdom because they await the realization of buddha wisdom Their wisdom increases and decreases because the characteristics of all their lands are not preeminent and because the characteristics of their respective concentrations are not preeminent They are each different in the action of the course of their wisdoms because all these bodhisattvas differ in the number and extent of their respective concentrations They thus differ in their actions and each according to the enabling cause of his endeavors is able to perform actions in the realm of sentient beings But beyond this they do not progress and thus they are different from one another The sentence in small part they are the support for the maturation of the good roots of sentient beings means that they are a support for the maturation of good roots for a small section of sentient beings and in small measure Because of the enabling power of all these bodhisattvas and in accord with their abilities they do cause the good roots of others to mature But inasmuch as the concentration of these bodhisattvas is not yet that of a tathāgata being small in number and extent the benefit and happiness which they bring to the sentient beings they convert is itself small The sentence when they have realized the great sea of the Tathāgatas Dharma realm means that they realize the Pure Dharma Realm of awakening That they do not have any difference in their support means that their support is purified suchness for in the uncontaminated realm there are no differences between buddhas Neither are there such differences in the case of these bodhisattvas Their wisdoms are not differentiated because their characteristics are similar to mirror wisdom and the other wisdomssince they neither discriminate Chapter XIII nor differentiate between themselves and others Their wisdom is unlimited because they understand unlimited knowables Their wisdom neither increases nor decreases because it is universally purified and because the objects ofsuch universal wisdom are neither few nor many They experience the phenomenal wisdom all of one unified taste because their characteristics are all similar to the actions of equality wisdom and the other wisdoms They are the support for the maturation of the good roots of immeasurable sentient beings because the inexhaustible stores of their blissful wisdom are universal Because they attain the Dharma body and exhaust the limits of transmigration they are the support for the maturation of the good roots of all sentient beings whatsoever According to one opinion the difference between these two examples is that the first describes the difference between those bodhisattvas who have not yet attained the patience of the state of no arising which some think occurs in the first stage of joy the eighth stage of steadfastness and those bodhisattvas who have already attained that state The second example of the great sea then treats the difference between those bodhisattvas who have not yet entered the eighth stage of steadfastness or the tenth stage of the tathāgata realm and those bodhisattvas who have already entered  The first example explains that the meritorious qualities of these bodhisattvas are difficult to understand just like that grove of unity while the second example explains that the meritorious qualities of these bodhisattvas are inexhaustible just like the great sea c Chapter XIV The Concluding Verses The Scripture says Then the Bhagavat recited these verses The Commentary explains These four verses summarize what has been explained above In outline they interpret the descriptive marks of the buddha land of the Pure Dharma Realm In the Tathāgatas land all conditioned and unconditioned qualities are comprised within the Pure Dharma Realm and all are the descriptive marks of that Pure Dharma Realm for here descriptive marks refer both to that which is described and to that which describes  Of these four verses the first three and a half explain these descriptive marks while the last half of the fourth verse presents the conclusion Asecond opinion holdsthat these verses demonstrate that the Pure Dharma Realm has six descriptive marks that together support all the merits of the buddha realm They are  essence  cause and  result which are considered as  action  associated qualities and  differentiation The first verse treats the first mark and then each halfverse treats one of the subsequent five marks Suchness in all things is characterized by purification from the two obstacles The Commentary explains According to the first opinion above this treats the Pure Dharma Realm and means that suchness manifested through the emptinesses and noself of all things is original purity which is free from the two obstacles  Being free from all defilement it is able to be the support for all good states Therefore it is termed the Pure Dharma Realm The phrase all things here means all transcendent and worldly all contaminated and uncontaminated aggregates spheres and elements Suchness is the true nature of all things the indefectible nature which is neither identical to nor different from all those things Although its essence is of one taste only yet it is many in virtue of the imageaspect  and thus one may say that there are two suchnesses the noself of the emptiness of personhood and the noself of the emptiness of things However suchness is not actually emptiness or noself for it is free from discrimination and severed from fabrication It is called emptiness and noself because in meditating on the insights of emptiness and noself one destroys the clinging to I and mine that obstructs suchness One may say there are three suchnesses good bad and morally neutral for suchness is the true nature of these three states One may say that there are four suchnesses those associated with the three realms and that not so associated for suchness is the true nature of these four things One may say that there are five suchnesses mind mental states unassociated things material form and the unconditioned because suchness is the true nature of these five things One may say that there are six suchnesses the five aggregates of material form sensation conceptualization karmic formations and consciousness together with the unconditioned states because suchness is the true nature of these six things One may say that there are seven suchnesses as is explained in the Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning the suchness of the flow of transmigration which is the true nature of that flow from the beginningless beginning the suchness of descriptive marks which is the true nature of all things manifested by emptiness and noself the suchness of conscious constructiononly which is the true nature of all things as conscious constructiononly the suchness of steadfastness which is the true nature of the a Chapter XIV truth of contaminated suffering the suchness of wrong conduct which is the true nature of the truth of the origin of karmic torment the suchness of purification which is the true nature of the truth of the cessation and which is good and uncontaminated and the suchness of right practice which all conditioned and unconditioned good states Or one may say that there are eight suchnesses as is explained in the Perfection of Wisdom scriptures the suchness of no arising the suchness of no destruction the suchness of no annihilation the suchness of no eternalism the suchness of no unity the suchness of no multiplicity the suchness of no coming and the suchness of no going for suchness has been manifested through these eight negations Or one may say that there are nine suchnesses suchness as manifested in the ninefold path which removes the nine obstacles Or one may say that there are ten suchnesses suchness as manifested in the severance of the ten ignorances in the course of the ten stages These are the ten Dharma realms explained in the Summary of the Great Vehicle In this manner we could multiply the number indefinitely for all things are different marks of suchness and yet that suchness is neither one nor many Discriminative language is entirely unable to explain this But inasmuch as it is free from illusion and mistake it is conventionally termed suchness Inasmuch as it is able to support all good qualities it is conventionally termed the Pure Dharma Realm Inasmuch as it has nothing that can be negated it is conventionally termed ultimate existence Inasmuch as it has nothing that can be affirmed it is conventionally termed emptiness and nonexistence This is the content realized by the eminently holy path of nondiscrimination The phrase the two obstacles refers to the obstacle of passion and the obstacle to knowledge The obstacle of passion is so called because it torments and disperses the body and mind and renders them agitated The obstacle to knowledge is so called because it covers over the indefectible nature of knowables and causes them not to appear in the mind The obstacle of passion has as its principal element the belief in self that clings to I and mine as b well as the one hundred and twentyeight basic passions together with their secondary passions Both the acts they engender and the results they attain are included because they are rooted in passion The obstacle to knowledge has as its principal element the belief in self that clings to all imagined things as well as to the mind and all the mental states of ignorance the love of things together with affection for malicious thoughts and so forth Both the acts they engender and the results they attain are included in this obstacle for they are rooted in clinging to things and in ignorance A first opinion holds that in contaminated minds and mental states whether good bad or morally neutral in the mind and mental states of those in the lower vehicles both clinging to things and ignorance are present because in such minds the noself of things cannot be understood and an imageaspect and insightaspect similar to arises bad or neutral that is defiled or undefiled It does not mention good because it is impossible for that which is not good to be associated with the good mind since their natures are incompatible Furthermore good states of mind must of necessity be associated with the good roots of the absence of delusion Delusion is ignorance and it is impossible for both delusion and the absence of delusion to coexist in the same mind since they are incompatible just as covetousness and the absence of covetousness or anger and the absence of anger  And it is impossible for clinging to things unaccompanied by delusion for in the absence of ignorance there would be no erroneous clinging at all It is just as the clinging to a real self must be accompanied by ignorance Moreover all good mental states have no illusory clinging The understanding of noself which accompanies the good mental states of faith and so forth have insight into the two emptinesses as their principal way of functioning Therefore the good mind whether contaminated or uncontaminated is definitely not associated with these two clingings to self and to things with ignorance or with desire because this would contradict the principles of the Dharma In the maturing neutral mind and all its mental states ie the container consciousness and the five sense consciousnesses there is no clinging to things and no ignorance because their power of discrimination is insignificant and they are unable to engender attachment If they did have such clinging and engendered a belief in real things and a real self then the container consciousness having ignorance could be associated only with the five mental states  because it would be comprised in both ignorance and wisdom Moreover then when insight into the emptiness of things first occurred this consciousness would be severed since clinging to things is incompatible with the disciplining of the obstacle and cannot function together with it And if it were so  then the other contaminated seeds would have no support and the good states of meditation could not permeate it for it would not be permeable One cannot say that permeate the pure mind associated with mirror wisdom because that mind is not undefined Indeed it may not yet have even been attained if this be the case then would not the results of maturations which are present in the other active consciousnesses also be of the same nature that is without clinging to things clinging to things is not present in the five sense consciousnesses because they have no significant role in discriminating or examining  The Summary of the Great Vehicle teaches that It is only the c thinking consciousness that is able discriminately to imagine We should then admit that these five do not have such discrimination as their content Since they do not discriminate or gain insight by examining they cannot imagine a self and consequently they cannot imagine any things  Yet it is true that desire hatred and so forth which arise from the imagined self and imagined things of the thinking consciousness do engender in these five sense consciousnesses movements of desire anger and so forth for those do not consist in insight Although these consciousnesses do not have the ability to gain insight yet they are supported on those states of desire hatred and ignorance that is by the two obstacles Therefore the discriminating and examination of the two clingings are present only in the sixth perceiving and the seventh thinking consciousnesses If desire anger and so forth were not supported by the insights  then such examination would also be absent in the five sense consciousnesses Therefore the obstacle of passion in all its states of selfclinging is present essentially only in these two consciousnesses when they are bad defiled and undefined If in the state of no training of the lower vehicles the obstacle to knowledge which engenders clinging to things is present in that undefiled and undefined mind then in that state of no training there would be no mental states that were bad defiled or undefined But from the viewpoint of a bodhisattva it is yet impure and they consider such a mind to be defiled Thus the obstacle to knowledge is considered as both undefiled and as defiled for its one essence is seen differently in these two viewpoints The obstacle to knowledge is present within the obstacle of passion because it is the support for that obstacle of passion inasmuch as one necessarily imagines a self in clinging to imagined things as real From such permeations there arises the seed  which while being one in essence yet has many functions Although arise simultaneously yet Chapter XIV they are severed progressively because the power of the holy path is realized step by step if the obstacle to knowledge is considered by those of the two vehicles to be undefiled and undefined to which of the undefined categories does it pertain it pertains to the category of undefined maturation because it arises from the maturing consciousness if this be so then what might the categories that are not undefined consist of these include all other categories such as the enabling cause  because the mind of undefined deportment and the other two undefined categories have no tenacious clinging are not universal and in essence do not have the two obstacles if there is no clinging to things in the good undefiled undefined mind  why are they unable to understand the emptiness of things If they have no selfclinging why are they unable to understand the emptiness of birth they are unable to understand the emptiness of birth because of the presence of innate selfclinging in their thinking consciousness They are unable to understand the emptiness of things because of the presence of innate clinging to things in their thinking consciousness We do not state this because the uncontaminated wisdom of all buddhas and bodhisattvas also has these two aspects How then is it that they do not cling to things Only if because of these two aspects they were to falsely imagine that fixed natures existed external to conscious construction would we say that they cling  Therefore the obstacle to knowledge present in the thinking consciousness always accompanies the other six consciousnesses in all the triple world The phrase characterized by purification means that the basic nature of suchness is pure It is covered over by those two obstacles just as pure space seems to become impure because of the obstacles of mists and clouds But when one attains the transcendent path wherein suchness is realized and the seeds of these two obstacles are gradually eradicated then when diamondlike concentration appears one destroys all the seeds of all obstacles entirely just as a strong wind blows away mists and clouds and then one attains the ultimate conversion of support to the Pure Dharma Realm This is termed the characteristic of purification and is the Pure Dharma Realm of the five factors explained above  According to the second opinion  this verse treats one of the six descriptive marks of the Pure Dharma Realm that is the mark of its essence Its mastery of doctrinal wisdom and in its content are characterized by inexhaustibility The Commentary explains The otherdependent conditioned factor of mirror wisdom is here called doctrinal wisdom That mirror wisdom has as its content the conditioned pattern of otherdependency because it does manifest images and is not confused about them The phrase its content refers to suchness and is not to be taken as indicating that doctrinal wisdom Although suchness is beyond words yet inasmuch as it is associated with the ability to engender meaning it is without thereby implying any logical contradiction Because that doctrinal wisdom has as its content  the text uses the term its content This does not mean that doctrinal wisdom is itself the content Mirror wisdom has as its content the pattern of full perfection that consists of the truth of ultimate meaning for it exhausts the limits Chapter XIV of transmigration and internally realizes that  This means that mirror wisdom has as its content all the common and individual marks of all things because its content includes the patterns both of otherdependency and of full perfection  As a treatise explains The pattern of clinging to the imagined is the content only of common understanding The pattern of full perfection is the content only of holy wisdom The pattern of otherdependency is the content both of common understanding and of holy wisdom The imagined pattern is not realized by the arhats because it has no reality if this be so then the wisdom of the arhats does not know everything for there would be some objects not known to wisdom But if one understands that this pattern is not existent then that is not itself merely imagined The appearance in the mind of really existing essences is comprised in the essenceless pattern of otherdependency and the truth of suchness is comprised in the essenceless pattern of full perfection Therefore holy wisdom takes the pattern of the imagined as its content only in the sense that it knows it to be nonexistent The term mastery means that mirror wisdom is endowed with the ten masteries and its various wondrous functionings are unhindered because it is the completion of the practice of the six perfections The phrase characterized by inexhaustibility means that it exhausts the limits of transmigration because without cessation or interruption it constantly perdures The word characterized means that which is characterized and that which so characterizes ie the mind that functions with this mirror wisdom for show the essence  Therefore this passage treats the mirror wisdom of the five factors The four wisdoms which are the result of awakening in one aspect constitute the essence The state of conditioned merit is precisely mirror wisdom which due to its enabling power converts the container consciousness away from supporting the heavy dross b and converts it into the pattern of purified otherdependency  far removed from all discriminative thinking Its mode of functioning which is realized internally is able to manifest all objects without discrimination That state of conditioned merit is equality wisdom which due to its enabling power converts the thinking consciousness away from clinging and to the pattern of purified otherdependency It takes asits content mirror wisdom the other wisdoms and the Pure Dharma Realm in universal equality The phrase its content then refers to the other two wisdoms which due to their enabling power convert the other six consciousnesses away from worldly discrimination into the pattern of purified otherdependency Whether in transcendent or in the subsequently attained wisdom which is both worldly and transcendent the content subsequently attained is both suchness and doctrinal wisdom for the pattern of otherdependency is taken as their content is called inexhaustible because mirror wisdom and equality wisdom are constant and uninterrupted Although discernment wisdom and dutyfulfillment wisdom are at times interrupted yet because the occasions on which they temporarily come to awareness are limitless they are also said to be inexhaustible The term characterized here refers to all the descriptive characteristics of the essence of the Pure Dharma Realm which arises conditionally for it is pure otherdependency  It is said to be pure because it is indefectible The term wisdom Chapter XIV means that the manifestation of such content consists in the functioning whereby that content is illumined and realized internally in the pattern of full perfection  Because these knowables are able to manifest the essence  they are said to be its characteristics Because of the cultivation of suchness in all respects full perfection is realized The Commentary explains This means that with the first insight at the stage of joy one attains nondiscriminative equality wisdom and gains insight into the universal equality of suchness In the subsequent stages it is progressively cultivated and becomes ever more purified until in the stage of awakening one realizes full perfection This ultimate purity is the realization of the Pure Dharma Realm the realization that truth and its embodiment are entirely equal This means that in the first stage of joy nondiscriminative wisdom gains an initial insight into that Pure Dharma Realm and then in the path of insight the three consciousnesses sever the one hundred and twelve fundamental passions and their secondary passions which must be severed by insight and destroy part of the undefiled ignorance and the heavy dross of discriminative clinging to things The seeds of wisdom which reveal this initial insight into the Pure Dharma Realm increase from this point on through the stages In the path of practice this nondiscriminative wisdom gains insight into the other suchnesses of the Dharma realm In all the other practices of hearing reflecting and meditating upon the Dharma in the wisdoms of intensified practice in its skillful methods it progressively cultivates  As appropriate at each stage gradually suppresses the sixteen passions and their secondary passions which must be severed through meditation and again as appropriate at each stage gradually destroys that undefiled ignorance and that innate clinging to things in all of their aspects The seeds of this wisdom which manifest the other the Dharma realm increase c because of this causal power until in the land of awakening one realizes the full perfection of the Dharma realm and the four wisdoms The Second Half of the Second Verse The Scripture says It establishes the two for all sentient beings and brings about inexhaustible results in all respects The Commentary explains  this passage refers to discernment wisdom This means that discernment wisdom is able to enunciate the wondrous Dharma for sentient beings The phrase the two refers to the benefit and happiness it establishes for sentient beings They are inexhaustible because these two permeate the limit of transmigration and are always active without ceasing Such istheir result because thisisthe result of wisdom Therefore this passage treats the discernment wisdom of the five factors This means that the Pure Dharma Realm and the four wisdoms are all able to establish benefit and happiness for sentient beings They are said to bring about benefit because they cause sentient beings to cultivate the causes of goodness They are said to bring about benefit because in causing them to support goodness they lead to avoid evil and to bring about happiness Again they bring about benefit because they cause them to eradicate their suffering and they bring about happiness because they cause them to elicit joy Understand that this is the result of the Dharma realm in this world or in any other world in this world or transcendent to this world Indeed all the aspects of these two are inexhaustible because they arise from the Pure Dharma Realm and the four wisdoms The First Half of the Third Verse The Scripture says It has the activity of the very skillful methods of the transformations of body speech and thought Chapter XIV The Commentary explainsAccording to the first opinion this verse treats dutyfulfillment wisdom This is then what is meant by its activity Alternately activity refers to this wisdoms skillful method whereby it can engender the three transformations of body speech and thought This meansthat the Pure Dharma Realm and the four wondrous wisdoms can engender the three transformed actions of body speech and thought as well as their accompanying skillful methods Dutyfulfillment wisdom engenders the three actions of body speech and thought Discernment wisdom engenders skillful activity for it examines which methods would be most appropriate  The other two wisdoms and the Pure Dharma Realm engender the activity of skillful methods because they are spontaneously able to relate to all actions as skillful methods The transformations of the body are three The first is the transformation of ones own body for example the changing of ones own body into that of a universal monarch or the creations of various material forms from former existences The second is the transformation of the bodies of others for example the changing of King Māra into a buddha body or the changing of āriputra into the daughter of a god for in these bodies of others are manifested various kinds of transformed appearances  The third is that not joined to any body such as the manifestation of the great earth as the sevenjeweled  the manifestation of immeasurable buddha bodies or the emitting of a light to illumine limitless realms These creations are not joined to any body at all They manifest transforming action in acting upon the various kinds of sentient beings and nonsentient material forms for example a shaking of the earth an emitting of light a raising up of a fragrant wind for such things are done in order to benefit sentient beings All these are termed the actions of the Buddha in transforming bodies In a similar fashion the transformations of speech are three The first is that of ones own body for the Buddha by transforming his own body does manifest a Brahmā voice and universally addresses himself to unlimited worldrealms in various kinds of speaking The second is that of the bodies a of others for he causes wordhearers and his great sons to proclaim the deep Dharma of the Great Vehicle through the Brahmā voice of the Buddha It is thus that wordhearers and all bodhisattvas speak for previously they were incapable of such a deeply wondrous Dharma Their ability is created by the Tathāgatas transforming activity and not through their own power The third is that not joined to any body such as the creations of various mountains seas grasses trees and so forth even of empty space which emit voices and enunciate the great Dharma All these are termed the action of the Buddhas transformation of speech The transformation of thought is of only two kinds The first is that of ones own body which consists in the transformation of various images in the mind and mental states of ones own mind The second is that of the bodies of others which means that one causes various images to appear in the mind and mental states of others These are only images but they do appear as if they have been elicited from the insightaspect of the minds of those beings According to one opinion that which is called the transformation of ones own thought is that which in virtue of meditation leads to the understanding in ones own mind of Dharma beyond ones own ability  That which is termed the transformation of the thought of others consists in the exercise of an assisting activity upon sentient beings so that the dullwitted may understand the deep subtle Dharma and so that the forgetful may attain correct recollection thought cannot be so transformed because it has no material form A treatise explains Because thought has no material form it cannot be transformed Again it is taught The transformation body is without mind and mental states these texts refer to the concentration powers of those in the lower vehicles and common worldlings which is slight and incapable of manifesting things without an material form The inconceivable concentration of all buddhas and bodhisattvas is entirely capable of creating and manifesting such things without any preexisting material form Otherwise how could the Tathāgata manifest desire hatred and so forth How could wordhearers and animals know the thought of the Tathāgata How could this Scripture teach that he creates immeasurable kinds of transformation bodies and causes them to be conscious How could it teach b Chapter XIV that he creates the activity of thinking How could it teach that he has otherdependent mind All these created material forms have the same effect on the senses of beings as do real material forms but inasmuch as these images appear in the mind through the modification of the senses they do not actually operate in the same way as real material forms if this be so then why does he not transform the unconscious gods and cause images to appear in their minds these unconscious beings already have the imageaspect in their minds and mental states  Why would he again cause such images to arise in their minds and make them conscious When images appear they do become sentient and are no longer reckoned among the unconscious Therefore the transformations of thought are of only the two kinds explained above It is fully endowed with the two limitless doors of concentration and recollective formulae The Commentary explains According to the first interpretation this verse treats the accompanying merits supported by the four wisdoms Concentration refers to the eightyfour thousand concentrations while recollective formulae refer to the eightyfour thousand recollective formulae They are called doors because they engender all conditioned merits and all uncontaminated states and bring about benefit for sentient beings through the supernatural powers they call forth These two are limitless because of their two adornments of merit and wisdom They are limitless because their varieties consist of the eightyfour thousand merits and wisdoms or because they are perfected through the practice of meditation for immeasurable eons The first five perfections are termed merit while the last five are termed wisdom Or as appropriate to the nature of each they are all accompanied and endowed with these two  Each of the four wisdoms is endowed and always associated with these two adorned doors  The verse says that it is fully endowed because they also have the Pure Dharma Realm as their support since concentrations and recollective formulae are not apart from the Pure Dharma Realm It displays the differentiations of essence enjoyment of Dharma and transformation The Commentary explains According to the first interpretation this verse refers to the differentiation of the three bodies which is the perfection of the five factors Although the Pure Dharma Realm which is the basic support for all tathāgatas is undifferentiated yet because of the evolutions of the various marks of the three bodies the verse uses the term differentiations  The term essence means that the essence of the Tathāgatas first body of his own essence is eternal and unchanging and thus is called the essence It is also called the Dharma body because it is the support for all the qualities such as the fearlessnesses the powers and so forth The enjoyment of Dharma means that the next enjoyment body is able to enjoy various kinds of great doctrines both for itself and for others The term transformation means that the transformation body is able to manifest various kinds of creations because he desires to benefit and gladden sentient beings This is the general interpretation of the meaning of the three bodies c Chapter XIV Moreover the Dharma body is characterized by suchness as the ultimate conversion It is the support for the equality of all buddha qualities and it is able to engender all masterful activity which becomes revealed in the increase of stainless doctrines It is the essence of the equality of all tathāgatas It is subtle wondrous and difficult to fathom Thus a scripture teaches The Dharma body of all buddhas is not associated with reflective thinking and is not an object for reflection It manifests all masterful activity which is elicited from the increase of all stainless doctrines Such transforming activity of each tathāgata is subtle wondrous and difficult to fathom These dwell in this world manifest various forms and enunciate various doctrines They mature the multitude of lower bodhisattvas those in the two vehicles and common worldlings and cause them respectively to enter that great land to transcend the triple world and to be delivered from evil destinies And a treatise explains that one attains the essence body through the conversion of the container consciousness in the attainment of mirror wisdom that issues from that conversion of the container consciousness This Scripture teaches that dutyfulfillment wisdom engenders all the creative activities The Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle teaches that in all realms dutyfulfillment wisdom engenders all the various kinds of immeasurable inconceivable creations Another treatise explains that equality wisdom is able to manifest various buddha bodies in accord with the predilections of the bodhisattvas in the Pure Lands It also states that discernment wisdom is able to manifest all masterful activity in the great assemblies and to enunciate the Dharma without doubt Furthermore it is said that one attains the enjoyment body because of the conversion of the active consciousnesses Therefore we know that these middle two wisdoms support the enjoyment body Furthermore of all the ten meanings of the three bodies of Buddha wisdom is the preeminent support Therefore we know that all of the three bodies attain wisdom The four wisdoms are all associated with that essence and are manifested to bodhisattvas in the stages In one aspect their subtle marks support the enjoyment body while inasmuch as they are manifested to bodhisattvas not yet in those stages in another aspect the functioning of their crude marks manifests the transformation body All the scriptures teach that pure suchness is the Dharma body The Treatise in Praise of Buddha expounds that the Tathāgatas Dharma body has no arising and no passing away The Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle teaches that the basic nature of the Buddhas essence body is eternal  The Treatise on the Diamond Scripture teaches that the good qualities propounded and discussed in the scriptures mean that the Dharma body does have a cause whereby one is enabled to realize it while the other two bodies have a cause whereby one is enabled to produce them  All the scriptures and treatises state that the ultimate conversion of support is the Dharma body This conversion of support is precisely purified suchness Since this is not the path of wordhearers we know that the Dharma body has as its nature only the suchness of the Pure Dharma Realm Also the Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle teaches that mirror wisdom is the enjoyment body This passage does not mention mirror wisdom because it teaches that mirror wisdom is an enjoyment and thus that mirror wisdom supports the enjoyment body not the Dharma body Furthermore there are two kinds of enjoyment body The first is ones own enjoyment body which is the completion of practices for three innumerable eons The second is the enjoyment body for others whereby all the bodhisattvas enjoy Dharma Therefore the enjoyment body includes all the characteristics commonly associated with the four wisdoms  and one aspect of creative Chapter XV transformation of dutyfulfillment wisdom inasmuch as it is the enjoyment body for others All the scriptures and treatises teach that the transformation body is the manifestation of various images for sentient beings who have not yet entered the stagesleading to conversion for itsimages constitute knowable objectsfor those sentient beings Therefore we know that these images are not the qualities of ultimate meaning but only its creative functioning The scriptures and treatises state only that dutyfulfillment wisdom is able to engender this creative functioning and not that that is the transformation body Although the three bodies are comprised in the preeminence of wisdom yet the Dharma body is said to be wisdom only by convention because it is a realization supported by wisdom while the transformation body is said to be wisdom only by convention because it is the functioning of wisdom and because in its manifestation it appears like wisdom For these reasons there is no logical error in calling these bodies wisdom but both the enjoyment body and the transformation body are involved in arising and passing away for they are involved in the realm of transmigration The Three Bodies as Eternal if this is so then how can the scriptures teach that all the buddha bodies are eternal they are eternal because of the Dharma body which is the support for the other two Although the enjoyment body and the transformation body are characterized by arising and passing away yet they are also said to be eternal because always experiences joy in various doctrines without ceasing and manifests numerous creations in the ten realms without interruption Therefore they always experience joy and always take on human form The Ornament of the Scriptures of the Great Vehicle teaches that the three bodies are eternal in basic nature in the state of not resting and in continuity  The term basic nature refers to the essence body because the basic nature of this body is eternal The phrase state of not resting refers to the enjoyment body because it always experiences joy in the Dharma without b interruption The term continuity refers to the transformation body because it manifests an inexhaustibility of creative transformations Therefore the Dharma body is eternal because it is free from all discrimination and fabrication and has no arising nor passing away Although the other two bodies from moment to moment do arise and pass away yet they are also said to be eternal because they rely on that eternal body without interruption and continue without ceasing As a scripture teaches The aggregates of material form sensation and so forth as they pertain to the Tathāgata are all eternally abiding From this doctrinal principle do not arise and do not pass away because they arise from the cultivation of uncontaminated seeds Still we have the absolute declaration that that which arises is destined to pass away because all material form and mind are seen to be impermanent and an eternally abiding material form or mind has never yet been seen The Dimensions of the Three Bodies What are the dimensions  The Dharma realm has suchness as its essence and suchness is the real nature of all things Since things have no limit the Dharma body has no limit It pervades all things and there is no place wherein it is not present It is like empty space and one cannot say that its dimensions are either large or small However from its perceptible marks we say that it pervades all places The enjoyment body both has material form and does not have material form All things that have no material form have no dimensions and cannot be said to be either large or small Just like the body on which it is supported and which is its content so may be said to pervade everywhere Now there are two kinds of material form concrete form and magically created form Concrete form indicates those actions of the major and minor marks of the form body produced by practice for three incalculable eons ie the historical form of an historical buddha such as ākyamuni Through the conversion of the five sense organs a contaminated form body attains the form of the Buddhas uncontaminated five sense organs adorned with Chapter XV its immeasurable major and minor marks Such a body encompasses the Dharma realm and is called the true Pure Land But in transmigration its actions do have limitations The dimensions of this body which is a creative transformation of the container consciousness are not determined as to size Because the good actions of humans in Jambudvīpa are minimal a form body attained therein would be at most six feet and four inches Good actions in Pūrvavideha are more eminent and a body there would be twelve feet and eight inches In such a fashion as the good actions progressively increase the dimensions of the body thereby realized will become progressively larger until a body in the final heaven of the world of form attains a dimension of sixteen thousand leagues because the actions that produce forms therein are preeminent The dimensions of such bodies become so large because of the accumulated permeations of good and pure roots during the bodhisattva practices in the ten stages As a scripture explains At the realization of diamondlike concentration the body attained fills the entire Dharma realm and pervades the true Pure Land because all obstacles are destroyed and the measure of the power of such good roots is infinite This is because the transformed body and land of the pure consciousness associated with mirror wisdom are unlimited The consciousnesses of all buddhas create at the same place and the same time so that the similarity of their characteristics is not mutually incompatible They will never come to an end be interrupted or cease Thus they are able to cause all buddhas to experience broad delight and are thus called enjoyment bodies and enjoyment lands Such bodies and lands are known only by buddhas and are not realized through the five senses of any bodhisattva But the material organs of are able to perceive all sense objects because they are without obstacle These excellent marks of all buddhas which are beyond the sight  the limitless proclamation of Dharma and the functioning of all their sense organs are so unlimited because they are universally perfected Magically created material form is the manifestation of various kinds of bodies and various kinds of major and minor marks through the power of the compassionate vow for the sake of leading the multitudes of bodhisattvas to enter that great land Various kinds here means that their voice depends upon the kind of land and their dimensions are not determined c Transformation bodies are the manifestation of magically created bodies through that same power of the compassionate vow for the sake of converting all sentient beings who have not yet entered the stages Such a transformation body both has a material form and does not have a material form It does not have form because it isthe action of the transformation of thought and thought has no material form and because the marks of all such qualities such as the supernatural powers the fearlessnesses and so forth have no material form thus have no material form and no dimensions But it does have material form because it is the action of the transformation of body and speech brought about in accord with the occasion place and multitude of sentient beingsto be converted forspeech has material formAsthe Scripture explains such a manifested body is not determined as to its size Differentiation and the Three Bodies Are all the tathāgatas differentiated from one another or not They are undifferentiated because the true nature of the Dharma body is common to all tathāgatas But we conventionally say that they are differentiated because the causes that render them experientially present are differentiated The other two bodies are each influenced by different causes and their different compositions are distinct from one another But they do not cling to these differentiations and we say that they are undifferentiated because being similar in the same place their actions of benefiting and gladdening are equal one to the other Therefore we say that all tathāgatas in the three bodies are undifferentiated because the Dharma realm which supports them in the action of their basic aspiration is undifferentiated because their intention of benefiting and gladdening is undifferentiated and because all the phenomenal activity they perform in unison is undifferentiated Individual Qualities and the Three Bodies But do have conditioned and individual qualities or not It is ultimately true good and original purity because it is far removed from all defiled states because it is the basic support for all good qualities and because it is the true nature of all good qualities Therefore it is said to be endowed with all those good qualities but it does not have any of the qualities whereby one differentiates material form from mind The Buddhas enjoyment body is endowed with all its true material and mental qualities and manifests these transformed qualities for the sake of others The Buddhas transformation body is endowed only with those qualities associated with the magical creations of its manifested material and mental  Therefore each of the three bodies is said to have qualities surpassing in number the sands of the Ganges River The Sixth Theme The Relationship of Beings with Tathāgatas Are all the beings to be converted common to all tathāgatas or not They are all equal in merit and wisdom For three incalculable eons they have all cultivated the course of their vows They have all in the same identical manner sought wisdom in order to save all beings Therefore it is said that the beings converted by one buddha are converted by all buddhas That buddha saw that the good roots of the sentient beings to be converted by ākyamuni would come to maturation before the good roots of those sentient beings to be converted by Maitreya He also saw that the preparatory course of Maitreya would be completed before that of ākyamuni Thus he entered into the concentration of fire and caused ākyamuni to witness it For seven days and seven nights ākyamuni while standing on one foot praised that buddha in a single verse and was thus led to surpass Maitreya and become a buddha before him Furthermore when the Buddha was about to enter cessation he said All those who were to be saved by me have already been saved Also a another scripture teaches At the time of his cessation the Buddha saw that one who was to have been converted by him was actually found to be in the realm of no conceptualization and no nonconceptualization and that therefore he had to be reborn into this world in order to be converted by him That being in the realm of no conceptualization and no nonconceptualization died and did come to be reborn into this world That transformation body created by the Buddha taught him the wondrous Dharma and he became an arhat whereupon that transformation body disappeared and was not seen again Moreover all the scriptures in many passages teach that there is a determined relationship between the one who converts and those whom he converts Therefore those to be converted are not common to all buddhas In the basic natures of the lineages of sentient beings there is a relationship whereby either many are related to one or one is related to many  During their preparatory course bodhisattvas whether in common or not have not matured sentient beings in the identically same manner thus on becoming buddhas they either convert in common or they convert singly If all the beings to be converted were common to all buddhas then why would there be many buddhas One buddha alone would be adequate to convert all beings Since then there would be but a single buddha dwelling always in the world and through his teaching converting sentient beings then any other buddha would have entered quiescence Then even that single buddha would not convert all beings by leading them to enter the Great Vehicle for that would be rendered useless since there would be no need for anyone to realize buddhahood because no further buddhas would be necessary to convert anyone Rather that single buddha would convert beings by leading them to enter the other vehicles and attain quiescence for that would be the easiest course of action What sensible person would reject what was easy and hold onto what was difficult Who would light a lamp to assist the sun Therefore the beings to be converted are not common  b Chapter XV On the other hand if the beings to be converted were never common  then bodhisattvas would not elicit their broad vows nor successively attend upon all the buddhas They would not cultivate the Great Vehicle persons like Sudhana would encounter no spiritual friends and buddhas would not entrust those they have converted to later buddhas  This refutes the opinion that those to be converted are never common to all buddhas Therefore it is not true that those beings are never common  Therefore although each and every buddha has the ability to convert all sentient beings nevertheless sentient beings are not disposed to being converted by all those buddhas with whom they have no relationship for they have never seen or heard  But though each and every buddha never comes to an end and always abides in the world teaching and converting innumerable kinds of sentient beings yet they manifest particular transformation as appropriate whether they manifest wisdom or cessation whether they are called ākyamuni or Maitreya or anything else The abiding of the transformation left behind in the case of the being who was reborn into the realm of no conceptualization and who finally attained salvation by seeing the appropriate transformation of ākyamuni is not incompatible with this principle that transformations are shared by all buddhas How is this so If that particular being was converted by all tathāgatas  then what buddha was it who came before him to convert him all buddhas have the power of their compassionate vows and it is impossible that just a single buddha would convert him while all the others remained inactive Each buddha with which he has a relationship manifests a transformation body at the same place and at the same time through his subsequently attained wisdom Since the visible qualities of those transformation bodies are all similar one to the other they are not mutually opposed Therefore in unison were the enabling cause that led the consciousness of that being to be converted and changed so that he might witness one buddha manifesting his supernatural powers and teaching the Dharma The Seventh Theme Differences between the Three Bodies Moreover the essence body is quiescent and peaceful for it is the support for merits that directly relate to selfbenefit But inasmuch as it is the enabling cause of benefit to the multitudes it is also related to benefit for others Therefore it is included in the benefit of the other two bodies inasmuch as it is the support for the benefit and merit of those two bodies The enjoyment body has two aspects The first is the aspect of ones own enjoyment of the Dharma and is the actual form body which is realized in the completion of selfbenefiting practices and which leads to ones own experience of wondrous joy The second is the aspect of the enjoyment of the Dharma for others which consists in the form bodies that are magically created so that the great multitude of bodhisattvas might enter that great land and which are realized by the full perfection of the practices of benefiting others cultivated for three incalculable eons It manifests various forms and teaches various doctrines to lead all bodhisattvas to experience joy in the great Dharma Because of these two aspects there is no contradiction in saying that this enjoyment body consists only in selfbenefit or in saying that it consists only of benefit for others or in saying that it consists of both The transformation body consists of benefiting others because it manifests all the descriptive marks of transformation in order to benefit others Thus the three bodies have four aspects that can be expressed in four phrases The first is enjoyment without transformation for that isthe true enjoyment body of selfbenefit The third is both transformation and enjoyment for that isthe varied transformation body manifested to bodhisattvas in the stages experience because such a body does cause all those bodhisattvas to enjoy the Dharma c Chapter XV It is changed according to circumstances and is undetermined The fourth is neither experience nor enjoyment for it is the essence body Other texts say that the Buddha has two kinds of bodies his birth body and his Dharma body Here the Dharma body includes both the essence body and the true enjoyment body for the first is the support for all meritorious doctrines and the second is the accumulated perfection of all those meritorious doctrines Furthermore another scripture says that there are ten kinds of buddhas The first five of these are conventional while the last five are ultimate meaning They are included as appropriate in the three bodies and in this manner one should understand their varieties and their descriptions The Second Half of the Fourth Verse The Scripture says This Pure Dharma Realm is enunciated by all buddhas The Commentary explains This Pure Dharma Realm of all Tathāgatas is enunciated in the same fashion by all buddhas That fully perfected buddha land is differentiated in the five kinds of factors and in the three bodies Alternately it is differentiated into the six characteristics of essence cause result action associated qualities and functioning Therefore these four verses summarize all the marks of the buddha land As explained above this is the overall theme enunciated in this sacred teaching The Concluding Passage The Scripture says At that time the Bhagavat finished teaching this Scripture and the entire assembly of the wondrously born bodhisattvas great beings all the great wordhearers gods humans and devas in this world all heard this doctrine of the Buddha and all of them elicited great joy received it in faith and upheld it in practice The Commentary explains This passage explains that upon hearing this teaching that multitudinous assembly relied upon its doctrine and received it in faith Drawn on by the compassionate vow of the Buddhas pure consciousness and changed by the enabling power of this Scripture the good roots in their minds matured and became manifest as described above in the text The Concluding Verses of the Commentary I have now expounded all the deep words and meanings of this Scripture on the Buddha Land according to my ability May the merits spread among all kinds of beings and may they all quickly realize the unexcelled result May all the merits that arise from the writing of this Commentary afterward issue in excellent results And may they continue without end to benefit and gladden all sentient beings Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka of the Sung Samghavarman and others All great instructors of old who had heard much about the very profound doctrine and who had understood the noble path already explained the meaning of everything striving with energetic effort different in state has never been obtained yet The Abhidharmahrdayasastra has already been explained by very learned ones sometimes is an extreme summary sometimes also a broad unlimitedness In this way the manifold explanations are not in accordance with the siitras Only this treatise is extremely clear and conformable to  are not understood even by wise ones extreme summaries are hard to understand and what is extremely elaborate makes one fall back from knowledge  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya With my explanation I abide in the middle and I ornament with what is meaningful out of elaborate explanations Elaborate explanations are called vibhasa  in Sanskrit The explanations that abide in the middle are provided with the meanings of a Vibhasa In explaining the meaning of the Abhidharmahrdaya by Dharmaresthin the different instructors have been unequal as to conciseness What Dharmaresthin explained is the most concise Upasanta has an explanation of eight thousand stanzas I urge all disciples to reflect with special energy on the meaning of the Abhidharmavibhasa it is the noble order should study One has to comprehend in a right way be without defilement and cross transmigration because of relying on what is proper according to the Abhidharmavibhasa Bhadanta Dharmasresthin and I Dharmatrata ornament the Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya together and being free from whatever elaborateness or conciseness we explain what is real What in further establishing what is real is called Abhidharma and what is called Vibhasa  Answer Instructing  and revealing the meaning of the true nature regarding what the Muni has said concerning the very profound meaning of the conventional truth and of the absolute truth  is called Abhidharma Moreover the ability to make the meaning of the sutras become visible is as a shining light When the specific characteristic marks are grasped then the factors of enlightenment are that Abhidharma when their provisions are grasped it is the nature of the five aggregates liberation are called Abhidharma Furthermore i in order to open the mind of everyone a vibhasa distinguishing question and answer searches for what is real and strives for being conformable to the sitras regarding the real nature explained by the Muni As such manifold meanings as what i is called nature characteristic marks name  Stage  basis  aspect supporting object  mindfulness knowledge faculties   concentration period of time being good and realm still having learning to do to be abandoned through vision of the truth  taking meaning as supporting object acquired by effort and also acquired by nonattachment where being produced for the first time being included associatedness causes and conditions  fruit and being with fruit come up regarding the unlimited factors the explanations have to be manifold These manifold explanations are called Vibhdsasastra Just as the two knowledges knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge that were concisely explained by the honoured Buddha are explained in unlimited distinctions in the Vibhasa  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya This socalled knowledge of the law is with the nature of pure wisdom it is with the characteristic marks of knowledge As to name it is called knowledge of the law because of first knowing the doctrine It is in six stages  is with the realm of sexual passion as basis is with the sixteen aspects is with the four noble truths as object and is with the four applications of mindfulness As it is with the characteristic marks of knowledge it is knowledge it is with three faculties and is associated with three samadhis the three faculties are contentedness satisfaction and equanimity the three samddhis are being with initial thought and with sustained thought being without initial thought and with sustained thought being without initial thought and without sustained thought since it falls in the three periods of time it takes the three periods of time and being free from the periods of time as supporting object it is good and takes the three kinds as supporting object it is unattached and takes the realm of sexual passion and what is unattached as supporting object it is still having learning to do and having no more learning to do and takes the three forms as supporting object still having learning to do having no more learning to do and neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do it is with uninterruptedness and takes the three forms as supporting object to be abandoned through vision of the truth to be abandoned through the spiritual path and uninterruptedness name is its supporting object and it takes meaning as supporting object it is to be acquired by effort and to be acquired by nonattachment since it is produced in the realm of sexual passion it is included in the element of factors in the factor sensefield and in the aggregate conditioning factors It is associated with the element mind Preface  with the element of factors and with the element consciousness of the mind It is with the specific nature of three causes and is what arises through three causes Since it is with the specific nature of the four conditions it is what arises through the four conditions That what arises first is the pure natural fruit and the fruit of human effort what arises simultaneously only is the fruit of human effort Being with fruit is three fruits the former two and the fruit of disjunction the dominant fruit is not spoken of In this way all factors have to be known Question That the antidote for the root of the everlasting chain of dependent origination is explained in the Abhidharmavibhasa is already known Why is what is real spoken of Answer In order to know what is real When one does not call in question the discussions are hard to understand Because supreme knowledge dees not arise one does nct know the highest truth Because one does not know the highest truth one does not see defilement and the fault of formations Because one does not see the fault one falls in the woeful courses In the opposite case one is born with the gods and is with disjunction Question As you already said why you speak what is real should be spoken of Answer This treatise is the most excellent one of all treatises as it is possessed of the display of all objects Compared to the Abhidharmasastra it makes wisdom increase At the moment the five faults It is good to proclaim the three periods of time Having compassion with heretics and instructors of wrong treatises since long respecting the masters of the doctrine of former excellent right treatises and the order of nobles and generally making great worship and faith arise regarding them  display the true merit of the three treasures in order to open the recollection on Buddha on the doctrine and on the samgha of beings Tos begin this treatise this stanza has to be explained ayz bring homage to the Most Superior One of olden times the Venerable who is free from defilement who is with the safe dispensation and who is possessed of every explanation the athat who has understood the noble truths Homage is to produce good awarenesses and to let them evolve toward the desired fruit to pay homage with the whole body Of olden times is former Who is to be considered as former It is the Most Superior One because He manifested the substratum of reverencing Which meaning does Most Superior One have He is called  Most Superior One because He suppresses defilement As is said in a stanza Know Upaka that all buddhas such as I are already free from impure influence Therefore we are called Most Superior Free from defilement Bonds of defilement burn ones body and mind The WorldHonoured One brought happiness to beings in endless times Since He  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ended burning eternally He is called free from defilement Because of this speaking of satisfaction one should know that He is free from defilement Therefore safe dispensation is spoken of subsequently Safe is abiding at ease dispensation is teaching Because the dispensation brings safety it is called safe dispensation Concisely safe for oneself and safe for someone else are to be spoken of Being free from defilement is safe for oneself the safe dispensation is safe for someone else Because of not overturning  this He is known as having the safe dispensation Therefore who is possessed of every explanation is subsequently spoken of Explanation is teaching it exactly is the safe dispensation Possessed of is because He explains what is splendid manifests what is determined and explains what is real without overturning things Because He does not oppose the two truths He is said to be possessed of Therefore worshipping Him is called reverencing the doctrine Arhat is having reached the extreme abode with the essential marks completed Therefore arhat is subsequently spoken of Therefore He is called arhat this is speaking of the adept in an absolute way After the adept is spoken of understanding the highest truth of the seeker is subsequently spoken of The highest truth is the four noble truths that are not overturned After studying the eight forms of patience and the eight knowledges one understands this highest truth Because although abiding in the path of vision the four no ble truths are not enclosed yet he is also called one who understands the highest truth because he definitely The Elements  will understand them Question Why paying homage Answer  Ail two kinds of characteristic marks of the collections of factors are known by the Muni He also manifests them to others Now I explain one part Because His body speech and mind are mauneya He is called Muni alr are all Siitras Vinaya and Abhidharma explained by the Omniscient and transmitted to the present Knowing is knowledge and vision of what is meaningFactors is grasping Because of grasping a specific nature something is called factor Because there are collections of factors collections of factors are spoken of Good factors are the collection of good factors The same applies to bad and to neutral factors Two is the name of a number Characteristic marks is the configuration Question Which two characteristic marks Answer Specific characteristic marks and general characteristic marks Specific characteristic marks are the ones that are not general Exactly belonging to this they do not belong to that just as what is characterised by hindrance is matter it is to be compared in this way  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya General characteristic marks are general to this and belong to that just as matter is impermanent it is to be compared in this way They belong  Question If what is characterised by hindrance is matter the specific characteristic marks are also the general characteristic marks because when observing  four aggregates  is the specific characteristic mark  because when observing ten forms of matter is the general characteristic mark of these ten forms As the specific characteristic mark in this way exactly is observed as general characteristic mark the two kinds specific characteristic marks and general characteristic marks are therefore not settled Answer because of the one specific thing Because hindrance is the characteristic mark of that matter it is called the specific characteristic mark of matter Because of the differences in the multitude of forms of matter ten forms are spoken of Your statement Because when observing  specific characteristic marks and general characteristic marks are not settled is not right Because are not to be mingled Just as a father and a son just as a fruit and a seed just as the truth of frustration and the one of the origin just as hearing and being decided When observing specific characteristic marks it are no general characteristic marks when observing general characteristic marks it are no specific characteristic marks Just as one person  is called both father and son because of the father he is called son because of the son he is called father When observing the father the son is not observed when observing the son the father is not observed Stating that It is not settled is not right Because it is already setThe Elements  tled This is the meaning of father and son that is settled Whether good or bad whether right view or false view production of proximate action has been spoken of elaborately regarding them If there were no meaning of father there also would be no false view concerning fatherhood and no right view concerning fatherhood If there were not these there also would be no cleanliness or filthiness If there were neither cleanliness nor filthiness there also would be no liberation If there were no proximate action there also would be no causes and fruits If there were no causes and fruits there neither would be all factors Do not state that there is no fault Therefore the meaning of father and son is settled What is already settled cannot be settled again If what is already settled could be settled again this then would be nonfinal Therefore the meaning of specific characteristic marks and of general characteristic marks is settled Question Should all factors Buddha knows be spoken of Answer Question Which should be spoken of Answer He also manifests them to others Now I explain one part Manifesting is the meaning of becoming manifest others are pupils If what is meaningful is conferring benefits one follows the religious life as is said in the SimSapavanasitra Regarding this explaining the doctrine to others I now explain one part what the Tathagata knows is very wide and unlimited If even such as Sariputra cannot explain it completely how much more is this the case for other humans  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question Which factors did the Worldhonoured One speak of Answer Impure ones and pure ones in this way all  All impure formations are without self satisfaction permanence and cleanliness Because of not seeing impurity such things as what is relating to a self are falsely grasped Because these impure formations are not selfwilled they are without self because the three forms of frustration are settled they are without satisfaction because of the power condition they are without permanence because of being the residence of defilement they are without cleanliness Question What are these impure formations Answer The five aggregates arisen by defilement Question If impure formations are without self satisfaction permanence and cleanliness then how are beings grasped by them Answer Because of not seeing impurity such things as what is relating to a self are falsely grasped Since beings do not know the characteristic marks of impure formations yet they grasp a self satisfaction permanence and cleanliness Because they are covered by gesture they do not know the nonself because they are covered by deportment they do not know this frustration because they are covered by a series of similarities they do not know imThe Elements  permanence because they are covered by a thin skin they do not know unpleasantness Because in this way they do not know they grasp a self satisfaction permanence and cleanliness Question Which characteristic marks form impure formations Answer  Increase of defilement is what the Nobie explained to be impure The Wise One speaks of defilement by means of this name impurity If there is a basis and if there is a supporting object increase of such defilements as belief in a self is as is explained in the chapter Contaminants  Because these formations arise from impurity because impurity arises and because they are the residence of impurity therefore impurity is spoken of It is not right that pure supporting objects do not increase from minor to middle to excessive Because of increase of bases it is no not increasing Increase of bases is no increase of supporting objects Question Answer The Wise One speaks of defilement by means of this name impurity Defilement is said to be called impurity Because all sense are permanently impure and because  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya mental impurity streams uninterruptedly it should therefore be known that since defilement increases formations are impure Answer Because defilement grasping and conflict are produced they are also called defilement aggregate grasping  and conflict This is what is said by the Noble  Exactly these impure formations are called defilement aggregate grasping and conflict Because defilement grasping and conflict are produced This is what is said by the Noble Because such defilements as belief in a self frustrate beings they are called defilement because of grasping the own person they are called grasping because of disturbing the mind they are called conflict There are three kinds of conflict conflict defilement conflict aggregate and conflict dispute Conflict defilement is one hundred and eight defilements conflict aggregate is dying conflict dispute is the one opposing the other It should be known that this conflict defilement is spoken of Such defilements as belief in a self make impure formations arise Because they arise from defilement they are said to be defilement because they arise from grasping they are said to be the aggregate grasping because they arise from conflict they are said to be conflict The Elements  The characteristic marks of the aggregate grasping have already been spoken of Now the characteristic marks of the aggregates should be spoken of   formation that is free Srom defilement and also liberated Srom impure influences This and the previous aggregate grasping are the aggregates spoken of by the Noble It should be known that when a formation is free from such defilements as belief in a self and from impure influences it is a pure formation AJ these pure formations and the aggregate grasping previously spoken of are said to be with the characteristic marks of an aggregate The difference between an aggregate and the aggregate grasping is that the combination of proceeding and not proceeding is an aggregate and that also proceeding is the aggregate grasping Question Answer  The socalled aggregates matter and feeling conceptual identification conditioning factors and consciousness The succession of these five aggregates is spoken of conformable to being coarse and subtle The five aggregates are the aggregate matter and the aggregates feeling conceptual identification conditioning factors and consciousness What is the aggregate matter  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya sb All matter of the past future and present in this way it is spoken of elaborately When already produced and already extinguished is said to be past when not produced yet and not extinguished yet is said to be future when already produced and not extinguished yet is said to be present What abides in ones own person is called inwar what abides in someone elses person and is not relating to beings is called outward Furthermore the meaning of inward and of outward is as is said with the sense What is resisting is called coarse what is unresisting is called subtle When stating It is not settled this is not right because of observing Because when observing not being settled appears to be not right when observing what is coarse it is not what is subtle What is defiled is called unpleasant matter what is undefiled is called pleasant matter Past and future are called remote present is called near The meaning of remote is fourfold as is explained in the chapter Formations All this is an absolutely concise explanation Ageregate matter is a concise name but the actual entity is not concise To feeling conceptual identification conditioning factors and consciousness the same applies as to the aggregate matter The difference between them is that feeling of ones own person is called inward and that feeling of someone elses person is called outward The inward supporting object and the outward supporting object are produced from the power preparation and produced from the power object Coarse is the group of five forms of consciousness subtle is of the stage of the mind  as The Elements  The same applies to the stages of what is defiled and of what is undefiled The same applies up to the aggregate consciousness Conditioning factors are the aggregate conditioning factors The outward should be known as beings and as what is not relating to beings Question Which characteristic marks do matter up to consciousness have Answer The characteristic mark hindrance is the characteristic mark of matter subsequent wakefulness is the characteristic mark of feeling subsequent knowledge is the characteristic mark of conceptual identification realisation is the characteristic mark of conditioning factors differentiating is the characteristic mark of consciousness Because although this matter of the past is without hindrance it was hindrance because although matter of the future is no hindrance yet it will be hindrance Although atoms are one by one no hindrance the multitude of atoms combined then is hindrance Although what is unmanifesting is no hindrance it also is hindrance because matter that is manifesting is hindrance just as when a tree moves the shadow also moves To the other four aggregates the same applies as to the past and the future of the aggregate matter Question Why is the aggregate matter spoken of first and up to the aggregate consciousness Answer The succession of these five aggregates is spoken of conformable to being coarse and subtle The aggregate matter is the most coarse one among these five aggregates because five forms of consciousness depend on it and because it is the object of the six forms of consciousness  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya Therefore it is spoken of first Although the aggregate feeling is no matter it is explained as matter since it proceeds aimed at what is coarse just as I in person have feelings that proceed in this way The same applies up to the aggregate consciousness as most subtle one therefore it is spoken of last Furthermore is spoken of first since one cannot know the original alternative  a man is with the appearance of a woman a woman is with the appearance of a man because of being attached Because of satisfaction when feeling what is desired desire for matter is produced Because of conceptual identification that is overturned satisfaction when feeling what is desired is produced Because of defilement conceptual identification that is overturned is produced Because of depending on the mind defilement is produced Furthermore because of two forms of observing matter entering the Buddhist doctrine is the gate of immortality contemplation of the repulsive  and mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out This contemplation of the repulsive is observing derivative form  mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out is observing the fourth element Therefore the aggregate matter is spoken of After observing matter the fault of feeling is seen After seeing the fault of feeling conceptual identification is not overturned After conceptual identification is not overturned defilement does not proceed After defilement does not proceed awarenesses are patient These then are the five aggregates spoken of in succession Now they shall be spoken of in reverse order After the aggregate  consciousness is obThe Elements  served defilement is thin After defilement is thin con ceptual identification of factors is produced When conceptual identification of factors is produced desired feeling does not arise Because desired feeling does not arise matter is comprehended Therefore the aggregate matter is spoken of first and up fo the aggregate consciousness Question What should be differentiated when speaking of the aggregate matter Answer  The material sense are tenfold What is unmanifesting is supposed to be materia That these differentiate the aggregate matter is what the Muni has said  The material sense are tenfold Eye matter ear sound nose smell tongue taste body and tangible As is said in the chapter Actions these forms of matter are one by one said to be the aggregate matter  That which is called aggregate consciousness exactly is the sense mind Regarding the eighteen elements it is further said to be sevenfold The aggregate consciousness exactly is the sense mind and in relation to the eighteen elements the seven elements of awareness are spoken of There are three aggregates more the three unconditioned ones that are  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya unmanifesting These are said to be the factor sensefield and are further also said to be the element of factors The other three aggregates are the aggregate feeling the aggregate conceptual identification and the aggregate conditioning factors The three unconditioned ones that are unmanifesting are space calculated cessation and uncalculated cessation These seven factors are said to be the factor sensefield and are also said to be the element of factors Question Why do feeling and conceptual identification establish a separate aggregate and do the other accompanying mental factors establish the one aggregate conditioning factors Answer For proceeding in transmigration  two roots of contention should be known That is why feeling and conceptual identification are separated and two kinds of aggregate are established Beings proceed in transmigration because of two things satisfaction when feeling what is desired and overturned conceptual identification Because of satisfaction when feeling what is desired craving proceeds because of adherence to overturned conceptual identification views proceed Concerning the two roots of contention when frequently craving for sensual pleasure the bond desire for craving arises from feelThe Elements  ing and the bond desire for views arises from conceptual identification Through feeling trances are developed and through conceptual identification immaterial ones are developed Furthermore accompanying mental factors either are sensual or unsensual To sensual factors feeling applies to unsensual factors conceptual identification applies Therefore they are spoken of according to their meanings  Question All five aggregates are conditioning factors Why is one aggregate conditioning factors spoken of Answer  Although the five aggregates are conditioning factors there is one that receives the name conditioning factors  Because of the many conditioned factors it is said to be the only aggregate conditioning factors Because in the aggregate conditioning factors there are many conditioned formations such as associated and dissociated ones Those that are associated are such things as thinking those that are dissociated are such things as acquisition Question They are all the aggregate conditioning factors Why do the scriptural texts only speak of one form of thinking as the aggregate conditioning factors Answer Because of superiority because of excessiveness and because of being the first What is characterised as making is characterised as conditioning factor and  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya that thinking is with the nature of making When there are other aggregates they all belong to the five aggregates Now they shall be spoken of as to authenticity  When the aggregate of factors is spoken of elaborately it totals eighty thousand Such other aggregates as moral precepts are all included in th five aggregates The eighty thousand aggregates of factors are all included in the aggregate matter because of what Buddha said concerning the nature of speech Some say that the nature of name is included in the aggregate conditioning factors Of such other five aggregates as moral precepts this aggregate moral precepts is included in the aggregate matter and the aggregates concentration wisdom liberation and cognition and vision of liberation are all included in the aggregate conditioning factors When there are the names of other aggregates they all belong to the five aggregates  Question What is arranged as stated to be calculated as aggregate of factors Answer  The aggregate of factors is scriptural texts and treatises In this way all explanations and formations that are antidote are one by one calculated as that which The Elements  is called aggregate of factors Some say that all scriptural texts and treatises are one by one called aggregate of factors In this way the number for scriptural texts and treatises is six thousand Some further say that what is established as aggregate is oneby one what is established as aggregate of factors Moreover it is said that such things as what is established as aggregate and what is established as element are calculated as aggregate of factors Spoken of in this way there are eighty thousand formations in relation to beings That is why the Worldhonoured One explained the antidote according to what is formed All are calculated as aggregate of factors Question Previously it has been said The material sense are tenfold what is unmanifesting is supposed to be material These are called aggregate matter What are the sense Answer The socalled eye ear nose tongue body and mind matter sound smell taste and tangible The rest is then said to be the factor sensefield This sense eye is serene matter formed by the four elements where consciousness of the eye The same applies to the ear nose tongue and body the difference is accordingly that where the form of consciousness depends on  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The sense mind is awareness mind and consciousness because of name meaning action period of time and nominal designation The following differences made by such things as name should be known Name it is called awareness it is called mind and it is called consciousness Meaning becoming manifest is the meaning of awareness deliberation is the meaning of mind and differentiating is the meaning of consciousness Action farreaching knowledge is awareness previous knowledge is mind and what arises successively is consciousness Period of time the past time is mind the future time is awareness and the present time is conscious ness nominal designation of elements is awareness nominal designation of sense is mind and nominal designation of aggregates is consciousness Furthermore when differentiating such things as greed hatred and delusion there are unlimited objects then Contrary to this defiled awarenesses are said to be disturbed Awarenesses associated with sloth are said to be inferior Awarenesses associated with energy are said to be superior Little frequented clean awarenesses and defiled awarenesses are called bad Much frequented clean awarenesses are called good Such defiled awarenesses as scarce faculties that are easy to acquire scarce antidote and scarce subsequent proceeding are said to be small Contrary to this good awarenesses are said to be big Of such defiled awarenesses as not practising spiritual practice which is obtaining and spiritual practice which is development it is said that they are not to be practised Contrary to this of good awarenesses it is said they are to be practised The Elements  Defiled awarenesses regarding being liberated of the specific nature and being liberated are said to be not liberated Sometimes there are awarenesses that are liberated of the specific nature but no being liberated sometimes there are awarenesses that are liberated but no being liberated of the specific nature sometimes there both are awarenesses that are liberated of the specific nature and being liberated sometimes there neither are awarenesses that are liberated of the specific nature nor being liberated Being liberated of the specific nature but no being liberated are pure awarenesses of the seeker Being liberated but no being liberated of the specific nature are impure awarenesses of the adept Both being liberated of the specific nature and being liberated are pure awarenesses of the adept Neither being liberated of the specific nature nor being liberated are impure awarenesses of the seeker and awarenesses of the worldling The sensefield matter is threefold colour configuration and their combination Colour is blue yellow red and white In this way it is spoken of elaborately Configuration is bodily made matter Their combination is such as forming a painting sound with the four elements appropriated sound with the four elements unappropriated and sound with combined causes With the four elements appropriated is sound arising because of the throat lips and tongue with the four elements unappropriated is sound arising because of such as wind bells and trees with combined causes is sound arising because of ruffling on a drum or whistling on such as a shell These sounds are one by one twofold The sensefield smell is threefold agreeable smells disagreeable smells and neitheragreeablenordisagreeable smells The sensefield taste ter salt and astringent hot sour sweet bit Question Is at the moment of tasting a taste in respect to the different tastes consciousness of the tongue first or is sensation of consciousness of the body first Answer When first sensing such as cold and heat then consciousness of the body is first and consciousness of the tongue is last When first differentiating such tastes as hot then consciousness of the tongue is first and consciousness of the body is last The sensefield tangible is elevenfold the four elements and the seven forms of derivative form The seven forms of derivative form are harsh polished light heavy cold hunger and thirst What is harsh is rough what is polished is soft what is light cannot be weighed what is heavy is substantial what is cold seeks heat hunger longs for nutriment thirst longs for beverage Question Because of increase of which element are there harsh and polished up to hunger and thirst Answer Sometimes it is said that there is no gradual increase with retribution of action one first acquires harsh as fruit of the four elements up to hunger and thirst It is further said that because of increase of water and fire there is polished because of increase of earth and wind there is harsh because of increase of earth and water there is heavy because of increase of wind and fire there is light The Elements  because of increase of water and wind there is cold because of increase of wind there is hunger and because of increase of fire there is thirst Question How many tangibles can produce consciousness of the body Answer Some say that it can be produced from harsh up to thirst one by one Moreover it is said that five tangibles can produce it the four elements and what is harsh The same applies up to hunger and thirst It is further said that the eleven forms can equally produce consciousness of the body Because they are the object of consciousness of the body there is no fault There are two kinds of specific characteristic marks the specific characteristic marks of the substance and the specific characteristic marks of the sensefield The specific characteristic marks of the substance are of the general object the specific characteristic marks of the sensefield are because of the object with specific characteristic marks Of these eleven forms two forms are bound to the realm of sexual passion hunger and thirst are not bound to the realm of form nine forms are bound to the realm of sexual passion and to the realm of form Although dress of the realm of form cannot be weighed the other can both be weighed and be piled up Although there is no disaster of cold and heat there is supporting influence In relation to hunger and thirst it is sometimes said that they are a natural fruit because beverage and nutriment can break them off The Abhidharmikas say that matter by retribution cannot be continued after having been broken off The Kasmiris say that hunger and thirst  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya cannot be known because of being obstructed by a good or a bad retribution after nutriment is digested that are to be known again hunger and thirst of the wealthy is a good retribution and hunger and thirst of the poor is a bad retribution The factor sensefield is the four forms of unmanifesting matter as is explained in the chapter Actions  Accompanying mental factors are as is explained in the chapter Formations Formations dissociated from awarenesses are as is explained in the chapter Miscellany  The unconditioned ones shall be spoken of later in this chapter Among the inwardsenses the sense eye is spoken of first because its object is coarse among the outward sensefields the sensefield matter is spoken of first because its specific nature is coarse Because of being the gate through which frustration and satisfaction enter the senses are spoken of Moreover the meaning of killing is the meaning of sense awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are extinguished regarding them  Question What is the difference between sensefield and the sensefield tangible Answer The sensefield tangible exactly is a sensefield but the sensefields are not the sensefield tangible When an inward sense that is not being part of it is in relation to some sensefield it is not the sensefield tangible Since the supporting object is different it does not produce contact and it called not being part of it Because of where tangible abides in somthing is called sensefield tangible If the tangible were empty it would only be this sensefield because of being the gate through which contact enters just as a The Elements  window in Indian window is an entrance for wind Because of that where the tangible abides in it is as a noble dwelling  Also the sense feeling should be spoken of because awarenesses and accompanying mental factors that are supported by the tangible are that to which the tangible adheres and that which makes the tangible proceed they are that which is realised because of the  power of the tangible Therefore the sensefield tangible is SP oken of Noble dwelling a middle region is called noble dwelling the border region is called dwelling of the mlecchas  Question How is it that all twelve sense are in one body Answer  Although the actual entities made in one body each are different twelve kinds are differentiated because of basis supporting object and specific nature All twelve sense are in one body but the actual entities each are different If the actual entity is the sense eye this actual entity is nothing up to and including the factor sensefield if the actual entity is the factor sensefield this actual entity is nothing up to and including the sense eye Question What makes the sense eye an actual entity up to the factor sensefield an actual entity Answer The eye is an actual entity because it sees matter Matter is an actual entity because it is that in which the eye  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya proceeds The same applies up to the factor sensefield If for instance twelve persons are in one room their activity each is different The same applies to this Moreover since basis and supporting object are different twelve are spoken of with the group of six forms of consciousness there are six bases and six supporting objects Moreover twelve are spoken of because of difference in specific nature when it concerns the specific nature of eye it is nothing up to and including the specific nature of factor when it concerns the specific nature of factor it is nothing up to the specific nature of eye Question Ten sense and one part of one sensefield are material Why is only one sensefield said to be the sensefield matter Answer cp Although there is a multitude of matter only one sensefield matter is spoken of The one sensefield matter should be known because of being the object of three eyes Among these sense the object of three eyes the fleshly eye the divine eye and the noble eye of wisdom is called sensefield matter Because matter is coarse twenty forms are spoken of socalled blue yellow red white long short even uneven quadrangular round high inclined smoke cloud dust fog sunshine shadow radiance and darkness Such eight things as long are with a threefol differenThe Elements  Question All twelve sense are with the nature of a factor Why is only one factor sensefield spoken of Answer y Although all these factors are all a factor sensefield only one is the factor sensefield because of a multitude of factors in it Although all these are all a factor sensefield only one sensefield is with a multitude of factors material factors and immaterial factors associated and dissociated factors conditioned and unconditioned factors Therefore only one factor sensefield is spoken of Because furthermore the three characteristic marks of the conditioned are the essential marks it is not contradictory Those characteristic marks belong to the factor sensefield Therefore only one factor sensefield is spoken of Moreover all factors are manifested by their names This name belongs to the factor sensefield Factor is the true characteristic marks the gate of liberation which is emptiness because one senses a factor by means of a previous factor That emptiness belongs to the factor sensefield It is not right that belief in a self can sense itself because it would be proceeding in an overturned way The doctrine is the highest truth extinguishing in nirvana This doctrine is the factor sensefield Question In the scriptural texts the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of unlimited sense Why are only twelve sense spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer ag Eight spheres or two or four spheres of these ten spheres of totality and the five sensefields of liberation are all included in the twelve The first eight spheres of the ten spheres of totality and the eight spheres of mastery are with the nature of the root of merit absence of greed They all belong to the factor sensefield When taking the whole group then there is the nature of the five aggregates and all belong to the sense mind and to the factor sensefield  The last two spheres of the ten spheres of totality and the four immaterial bases are with the nature of four aggregates and all belong to the sense mind and to the factor sensefield The two spheres are the sphere of the one who does not conceptually identify and the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification The sphere of the one who does not conceptually identify is with the nature of ten sense exception made for the sensefields smell and taste When speaking about the four immaterial ones then the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification Are the eighteen elements that were spoken of eighteen in kind or eighteen in name Answer Seventeen kinds of elements are spoken of Sometimes twelve are spoken of The object that which depends and the basis differentiate them to eighteen kinds The eighteen elements either are of seventeen kinds or of twelve kinds When the element mind is taken away then the six forms of consciousness are lost when the six forms of consciousness are taken away then the element mind is lost When for instance otherwise trees are taken away then the wood is lost when the wood is taken away then trees are lost Such as fingers and fist are also to be compared in this way When the element mind is taken away then the six forms of consciousness are lost when the six forms of consciousness are taken away then the element mind is lost  Question If this is right why then are eighteen elements spoken of Answer The object that which depends and the basis differentiate them to eighteen kinds Because of three things eighteen elements are spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya because of the basis because of that which depends and because of the object The basis is six bases the element ye up to the element mind That which depends is the six elements of consciousness the element consciousness of the eye up to the element consciousness of the mind Object is six outward elements When stating that since the last awareness of an arhat does not make the last form of consciousness arise it is not the element mind this is not right since it is because of other conditions that the last form of consciousness is not successive just as earth that has no seed Furthermore the eighteen elements are established because of the tangibility Contact of the eye arises because of three reasons eye matter and consciousness Because of the receptacle because of nutriment and because of the hungry one the Teceptacle is the element eye nutriment is the element matter the hungry one is the element consciousness of the eye Question Twentyone elements should be spoken of two eyes two ears and two nostrils make six the element tongue the element body the seven elements of awareness and the six outward elements Answer Two eyes are said to be one element because the two are one specific thing The same applies to ear and nose the two are combined and are said to be one element The Elements  Although there are two eyes they are said to be one element because they are one specific thing because they together are one formation of the four elements because they are to be seen as one specific thing If they were not one specific thing there would be two faculties Because they are that on which one form of consciousness depends Neither can the two eyes as basis of consciousness of the eye be two faculties because one form of consciousness depends on one sense and because objects are concerned one sense in total also only accepts the object of one sense Two eyes together take one kind of matter because when one eye looks at matter it is then not clearly understood When two eyes look at matter it is then clearly understood That two ears and two nostrils settle one element is also as is said with the eye In order to ornament the body two eyes two ears and two nostrils arise Because the one with one eye is not respected lovingly by others such as the eyes arise in pairs and the body and tongue arise alone  Although the Honoured Buddha has in this way been speaking of manifold elements they all belong to the eighteen elements They shall now be spoken of successively  In the scriptural texts the Worldhonoured One said that when there are other elements they each one according to its specific nature all belong to the eighteen elements When the Worldhonoured One said that the other elements all belong to the eighteen elements it is because of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya three things because of the basis because of that which depends and because of the supporting object Just as the Worldhonoured One said to Kausika In the world there are manifold elements all views spoken of by means of the name of an element All these belong to the element of factors When He spoke about the sixtytwo elements this is as is said in the Bahudhatukasatra and in other scriptural texts everything that is spoken of by means of the name of an element belongs each according to its meaning to the eighteen elements Question What is the difference between aggregate sense and element Answer  Element is said to be all factors These exactly are the twelve sense Exception made for the three unconditioned factors the rest are then said to be the five aggregates All factors are said to be the eighteen elements because they are not free from their basis because of that which depends and because of the supporting object All these factors exactly are said to be the twelve sense The seven elements of awareness are the sense mind Exactly this is difference in meaning Exception made for the three unconditioned ones the other factors are said to be the five aggregates because of having the appearance of a collection Question When all factors are said to be elements and the The Elements  elements exactly are sense and exception made for the three unconditioned ones are said to be aggre gates then why did the Worldhonoured One speak of three kinds Answer The Muni observed liberation of desire unequalness of faculties and difference in ignorance of beings and therefore He has been speaking of aggregates sense and elements Beings are with three forms of liberation of desire an elaborate one a concise one and a medium one For the elaborate one He speaks of the elements for the medium one He speaks of the sense for the concise one He speaks of the aggregates The same applies to minor middle and excessive faculties For those who are stunned because of depending on nature he speaks of the elements The meaning of nature is the meaning of element For those who are stunned because of depending on wealth He speaks of the sense  The meaning of gate of transportation is the meaning of sense For those who are stunned because of depending on fate He speaks of the aggregates because aggregates are the factor dying For the beginner He speaks of the elements for the one with little activity He speaks of the sense for the one who has had activity He  speaks of the aggregates For those who are ignorant regarding matter and awarenesses He speaks of the  elements  for those who are ignorant regarding matter He speaks of the sense   Samyuktabhidharmahydaya for those who are ignorant regarding accompanying mental factors He speaks of the aggregates Question What is the meaning of aggregate sense  and element  Collection is the meaning of aggregate The meaning of gate of transportation is said to be sense The meaning of different nature is said to be element This is the difference between the three The class of eleven forms of unlimited matter is generally spoken of as aggregate matter just as a storehouse or as an army corps Just as for instance with a fourfold army each form is different but they are called army corps The same applies to matter although there are eleven  they are with one and the same characteristic mark matter and are called aggregate matter Just as the Abhidharma says When observing the aggregate matter well one atom is included in one part of one element of one sense and of one aggregate When not observing well one atom is stated to be included in one element one sense and one aggregate To the aggregates feeling conceptual identification conditioning factors and consciousness the same applies as to the aggregate matter The meaning of gate of transportation is said to be sense Because frustration and satisfaction pass through it The meaning of different nature is said to be element Just as in one mountain there are many natures the  The Elements  nature of gold the nature of silver and so on In this way in one body there are manifold natures that each are different and are therefore said to be the eighteen elements Question Why is it that eighteen elements twelve sense and five aggregates are spoken of and not more or less Answer  An object something which depends and a basis is what factors largely need Therefore elements sense and aggregates neither are more nor less That what the elements largely need are six bases six things that depend and six supporting objects If these bases would be more then these would be no basis since there would be nothing that depends  because if they were less then that which depends would have no basis Also all sense are likewise limited by basis and supporting object Why are aggregates attached to matter Because of attachment to pleasant feeling Why are they attached to pleasant feeling Because conceptual identification is overturned Why is conceptual identification overturned Because of being associated with defilement When defilement depends on the mind the mind exactly depends on the mind as has been said Since the mind takes factors as supporting object it makes consciousness of the mind arise because free from this basis it has no other basis  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The specific nature of elements sense and aggregates has already been spoken of and also their reasons  Now the elements shall be spoken of elaborately Moreover all elements are spoken of Eight kinds are neutral The rest is thengood or bad One of the elements is visible Of the eighteen elements the element matter is visible It is visible because it is visible here or there If is furthermore visible because it manifests the activity of the mind of a person It is furthermore because it makes itself visible that it is where the eye proceeds in Know that seventeen are invisible because they do not have this characteristic mark Moreover it is said that all elements are visible because they are the object of the eye of wisdom As is said in the stanza The Wise One sees that all these factors are selfless As is said in the Abhidharma The seeker sees the path because he sees the path of the four noble truths Therefore eighteen elements are visible Eight kinds are neutral Eight elements are neutral five feelings smell taste and tangible Because they are without defined liked or disliked fruit they are said to be neutral The other ten elements are defined because they are good or bad the elements matter sound and the one of factors and the seven elements of awareness The Elements  Good bodily gesture is good matter bad bodily gesture is bad matter other matter is neutral The same applies to sound and to verbal gesture Seven elements of consciousness that are clean awarenesses are good awarenesses associated with shamelessness and with disregard are bad the rest is then neutral When the element of factors is associated with awarenesses it is as explained with awarenesses when dissociated it is as explained in the chapter Miscellany  There are four forms of good of the specific nature of what is associated of what appears simultaneously and of the absolute truth The specific nature that is good is shame modesty and the three roots of merit what is associated exactly is awarenesses and accompanying mental factors associated with these what appears simultaneously exactly is bodily and verbal action produced by these and formations dissociated from awarenesses the highest truth is nirvana This is the fourfold good When the specific nature is bad it is shamelessness disregard and the three roots of demerit  what is associated exactly is awarenesses and accompanying mental factors associated with these what appears simultaneously exactly is bodily and verbal action produced by these and formations dissociated from awarenesses the highest truth is proceeding in danger What is contrary to both is neutral Question All factors are the twelve sense This is exactly what has been defined by the Worldhonoured One Why are they said to be neutral Answer It is not because something is absolutely not spo  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya ken of that it is said to be neutral The good ones are defined as good the bad ones are defined as badwhen they are not defined as good or bad they therefore are said to be neutral Just as causesand fruits are defined at the moment of causes and of fruits When otherwise then they are neutral but sometimes are not said to be called neutral Just as elucidation is spoken of in the scriptural texts  Does everything have to die is elucidation by absolute affirmation Does everything that dies rearise is called elucidation by analysing  When it is asked whether life is superior this is called elucidation by questioning Are the five aggregates and beings different is called elucidation by saying the matter is to be avoided Elucidation by absolute affirmation is that when it is asked whether beings All beings have to die Elucidation by analysing is that when it is asked whether everything has to die and when having died has to rearise one has to answer according to analysis Those who have defilement and die shall rearise those who do not have defilement do not rearise when having died Elucidation by questioning is that when it is asked whether a persons life is superior or not one has to ask a counterquestion do you ask  If one states that one aims at the course The Elements  gods No If one states that one aims at the woeful courses one has to answer Elucidation by saying the matter is to be avoided is that when it is asked whether aggregates and beings are different or equal one has to avoid Because it is not proper If for instance there is the question whether it is good to respect the child of a stone lady or not then how can one answer Respect or Do not respect since a stone lady does not have a child In this way there are aggregates and no beings How is their being different or being equal to be achieved Because it is not proper there is no answer The Abhidharmikas say that elucidation by absolute affirmation is that when it is asked whether the Tathagata has nothing to which He is attached and whether He is fully awakened whether He explained the doctrine well whether the disciples of the Worldhonoured One have a good destination whether matter is impermanent and feeling conceptual identification conditioning factors and consciousness are impermanent whether frustration the origin cessation and the path are differentiated well one should answer in an absolute way Elucidation by analysing is that when it is stated Explain the factors to me it should be asked There is a mhultitude of factors either past or future or present The explanation of which factors do you desire When it is stated Explain the factors of the past to me it should be asked Also the factors of the past are manifold either the aggregate matter or the aggregates feeling conceptual identification conditioning factors and consciousness Which one should be explained When it is stated Absence of greed it should be asked There are two forms of absence of greed manifesting and unmanifesting Which one should be explained Such discussion is called elucidation by analysing Elucidation by questioning is that when the factors are asked for a counterquestion should be asked There is a multitude of factors Which do you ask for It is no differentiation as to past future and present up to manifesting and unmanifesting With the one with minor awarenesses it is elucidation by analysing with the smart one it then is asking a counterquestion to let him answer himself This is called elucidation by questioning Elucidation by saying the matter is to be avoided is when it is asked whether the world is finite or infinite The same applies to such as the empty space where there was a garland of flowers is undefined as to whether it is fragrant or not fragrant This is called elucidation by saying the matter is to be avoided  Defined and undefined have already been spoken of The twelve that are resisting shall now be spoken of Of one element one part is spoken of Pp sp The Elements  Ten elements and seven are resisting The same is true for the one part Resisting of the object of the obstruction and of the supporting object are spoken of The elements eye ear nose tongue and body and the seven elements of awareness these twelve elements are said to be resisting One part of the element of factors is also said to be resisting accompanying mental factors Moreover ten material factors are said to be resisting The seven elements of awareness and one part of the element of factors are also said to be resisting Question Which kinds of resisting are spoken of Answer Resisting of the object of the obstruction and of the supporting object are spoken of  The threefold resisting is resisting of the object resisting of the obstruction and resisting of the supporting object Resisting of the object is as is said in the Prajfaptisiitra For the eye matter is resisting up to for the mind factors are resisting That the element mind is already spoken of should be known since the seven elements of awareness and one part of the element of factors are already spoken of Therefore it should be known that twelve elements and one part of one element are resisting Five outward elements and one part of the element of fac Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tors are unresisting as is said in this and such scriptural b texts When one observes on earth then one does not observe in water In this way it is spoken of elaborately Resisting of the obstruction is that all places obstruct since all are opposed to one another When something has one then there is no second place because of the collection of atoms because of the obstruction because of differentiating and because of leaning on abodes Know that the eight that are unresisting among these should be spoken of elaborately Resisting of the supporting object is awarenesses and accompanying mental factors that proceed regarding  an object It should be stated like this If there is resisting of the object of a factor is this resisting of the obstruction of that factor Four sentences are to be made sometimes resisting of the object is no resisting of the obstruction the seven elements of awareness and what is associated with awarenesses of the element of factors Sometimes resisting of the obstruction is no resisting of the object five outward elements Sometimes both resisting of the object and of the obstruction five inward elements Sometimes neither resisting of the object nor of the obstruction matter that is included in the factor sensefield what is unconditioned and formations dissociated from awarenesses If there is resisting of the object of a factor is this resisting of the supporting object Resisting of the supporting object is resisting of the object but sometimes resisting of the object is no resisting of the supporting object five inward elements The Elements   There are fifteen impure ones The other ones are twofeld Three are of the three forms of existence There are four in the realm of sexual passion Fifteen elements are absolutely impure five inward elements five outward elements and five elements of consciousness Because they arise through impure influence because they make impure influence arise because they are the residence of impure influence and because impure influence is produced from them they are said to be impure If the principle is uncertain it is because it is a companion of impurity and being impure is spoken of Just as when nutriment is mingled with poison The other ones are twofold The element mind the element of factors and the element consciousness of the mind these three elements are twofold either impure or pure When they arise through impure influence they are impure in the opposite case they are pure Three are of the three forms of existence The element mind the element of factors and the element consciousness of the mind can be acquired in the three forms of existence sensual existence material existence and immaterial existence pure when not bound Although to be acquired in the group of the three realms no specific nature is acquired There are four in the realm of sexual passion The element smell the element taste and the forms of consciousness of these objects are not in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness because these are without desire for solid food Three sensefields are with the nature of solid food That this one also has to be without  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the tangible is not right then The nature of the sensefield tangible is twofold either the nature of solid food or not when were the nature of solid food and would abide in the realm of form that there would be a mistake that is without the nature of solid food because the body is subtle Smell and taste are absolutely with the nature of solid food Therefore this is without them Because the objects are absent there neither is the form of consciousness of them Question If this one is without smell or taste and there neither is consciousness of them the element nose and the element tongue also have to be absent Answer Because one is supplied with the faculties because the faculties proceed in mutual dependence there are these two faculties Eleven abide in two forms of existence Sensual ex istence and material existence Five inward elements the elements matter sound and tangible and consciousness regarding these objects these eleven are not in the realm of formlessness because this is free from the nature of matter  Five are with initial thought and with sustained thought Three are with three aspects The rest are without Seven should be known as with supporting object Of the factor sensefield one part is spoken of Five are with initial thought and with sustained thought Five elements of consciousness are with initial thought and with sustained thought because of being The Elements  coarse Three elements are threefold the element mind the element consciousness of the mind and what is associated with awarenesses of the element of factors The realm of sexual passion and the first trance are with initial thought and with sustained thought Intermediate trance is without initial thought and with sustained thought Higher stages and all dissociated ones of the element of factors are without initial thought and without sustained thought Question There are four forms of factor stage with initial thought and with sustained thought either with initial thought and with sustained thought or without initial thought and with sustained thought or without initial thought and without sustained thought or neither with initial thought and with sustained thought nor without initial thought and with sustained thought nor without initial thought and without sustained thought What is with initial thought and with sustained thought Answer Exception made for initial thought and sustained thought of the realm of sexual passion and the first trance the other awarenesses and accompanying mental factors Question What is without initial thought and with sustained thought Answer What is without initial thought and without sustained thought Answer Matter and formations dissociated from aware Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya nesses What is neither with initial thought and with sustained thought nor without initial thought and with sustained thought nor without initial thought and without sustained thought because they are without supporting object Seven should be known as with supporting object Of the factor sensefield one part is spoken of The seven elements of awareness are said to be with supporting object Because they have this supporting object they are called with supporting object just as a person who has children is said to be with children One part of the element of factors is with supporting object accompanying mental factors as one part without supporting object is what are no accompanying mental factors Consciousness of the eye and the associated factors take matter as supporting object up to consciousness of the body and the associated factors take the tangible as supporting object Consciousness of the mind and the associated factors take all factors as supporting object Because all factors are the object This does not mean that a supporting object is implied Also the above mentioned consciousness of the eye and the one of the body are alike  Nine are unappropriated One is both conditioned and unconditioned Seventeen elements should be known as The Elements  absolutely conditioned Nine are unappropriated Nine elements are unappropriated When matter is present is with what is calculated asa faculty and is not without the organic it is called appropriated When is broken off destroyed or oppressed awarenesses and accompanying mental factors appropriate it because they abide in it In the opposite case they do not appropriate it Nine elements are said to be unappropriated because the seven elements of awareness the element sound and the element of factors are without being broken off The rest are twofold When the five inward elements are present they are appropriated because of producing knowledge through such things as breaking off In the past and in the future they are unappropriated because awarenesses and accompanying mental factors do not abide in them Matter smell taste and the tangible are appropriated when they are present and are not without the organic With these it is just as when awarenesses and accompanying mental factors abide in the faculties because they are not without the organic The one element of factors is conditioned and unconditioned With this  there are three forms that because of permanence are unconditioned Because the other factors are impermanent they are conditioned Therefore one is both conditioned and unconditioned Seventeen elements should be known as absolutely conditioned Because they are impermanent seventeen elements are absolutely conditioned because they arise and disappear because they are settled by the three character Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya istic marks of the conditioned because they are with cause because they fall in the aggregates because they fall in the periods of time and because they are minor middle and excessive In the opposite case they would have been unconditioned With blameworthiness and with retribution defiled and obscured There are ten that are to be practised In one element there are views Also being with accompanying mental factors is spoken of The seven elements of awareness and the elements matter sound and the one of factors are twofold either with blameworthiness or blameless What is defiled is with blameworthiness what is undefiled is blameless To what is defiled and to what is obscured the same applies as to what is with blameworthiness and being blameless When five elements of consciousness the element matter and the element sound are good or bad they are with retribution when they are neutral the are without retribution When the element mind the element consciousness of the mind and the element of factors are bad or goodimpure they are with retribution when they are neutral or pure they are without retribution Question Why are they with retribution when they are bad and goodimpure and without retribution when they are neutral and pure Answer Just as for instance outward elements arise through combination of three things If there is seed someThe Elements  thing solid and irrigation with water there is covering of grassland and because of the power of the combined specific natures sprouts and leaves achieve to arise If there is seed then although there is something solid there is no covering of grassland if there is no irrigation with water and because the conditions are not supplied sprouts and leaves do not arise If there is seed but there is not something solid then there is covering of grassland although there is irrigation with water but because the specific natures are not solid sprouts Just as three things are differentiated for the outward elements also three things are differentiated regarding inward production Bad and goodimpure factors are as the first kind if they are solid are irrigated with the water of craving and are with covering of other fetters the sprouts of the forms of existence achieve to arise because of the power of the combined specific natures of the many conditions Pure factors are as the second kindif they are solid and are without irrigation with the water of craving and covering of other fetters the sprouts of the forms of existence do not arise because the conditions are not supplied Neutral factors are as the third kind although they are irtigated with the water of craving and are with covering of other fetters the sprouts of the forms of existence do not arise because the specific natures are not solid There are ten that are to be practised What is good among the seven elements of awareness and the elements matter and sound are to be practised what is bad or neutral is not to be practised When the element of factors is good and conditioned it is to be practised when bad and neutral calculated cessation are not to be practised  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question Why are what is bad and neutral and calculated cessation not to be practised Answer Because of the desired fruit something is to be practised Because what is bad and neutral are without the desired fruit they are not to be practised Since calculated cessation by its nature is a fruit but does not arise in succession it is not to be practised Know that the eight elements that are blameless without retribution undefiled and nonobscured are not to be practised In one element there are views In the element of factors there is an eightfold view such five views as belief in a self conventional view  view of still having learning to do and view of having no more learning to do View is because of observing because of being decided because of harsh feeling and because of deep penetration into the conditions Viewing factors with defiled wisdom is as seeing colours in a dark night conventional view is as seeing colours in a clear night view of still having learning to do is as seeing colours on a dark day view of having no more learning to do is as seeing colours on a clear day Also being with accompanying mental factors is spoken of It exactly is this element of factors that has accompanying mental factors such as feeling and conceptual identification Because there are these accompanying mental factors being with accompanying mental factors is spoken of Know that seventeen elements and one part of oneelement are no accompanying mental factors One element is with the nature of a view One element is with the nature of a view the element eye because it can see Know that sixteen elements and one part of one element are no view The Elements  Question What has vision Is it vision of the eye Is it vision of consciousness of the eye Is it vision of wisdom associated with consciousness of the eye Is it vision of a combination Why being perplex They are all wrong If one states that it is vision of the eye then why is there no vision at the moment is together with another form of consciousness Why are all objects not acquired together If one states that it is vision of consciousness of the eye the characteristic marks of consciousness are not the characteristic marks of vision and what is without eye should also have vision If one states that it is vision of wisdom associated with consciousness of the eye does further wisdom associated with consciousness of the ear hear If one states that it is vision of a combination this then is unfixed sometimes consciousness of the eye is twentytwo factors sometimes twentyone factors and sometimes twelve Answer The eye sees matter when it is homogeneous It is no vision of consciousness of the eye not of wisdom and not of a combination because converted matter is not seen The eye sees matter when it is homogeneous Therefore there is no vision at the moment is together with another form of consciousness because when together with another form of consciousness it would be idle and the eye present would not be homogeneous Because of this reason all objects are not acquired together Because if homogeneous faculties would abide together with another form of consciousness they would be no more faculty being homogeneous is spoken of There are no  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya two forms of consciousness that proceed together because there is no second condition as direct antecedent Question If the eye does not see matter when without its consciousness then it is vision of consciousness and no vision of the eye Which function does the eye further have Answer If consciousness is settled then this is also settled If this is not being part of it then it is because also the cause is not being part of it To this the same applies as to feeling that is not free from conceptual identification and conceptual identification that is not free from feeling If it were vision of consciousness of the eye who would further be conscious If it were vision of wisdom who would further know If it were vision of a combination then the meaning of the activity of each factor would be different If there is separation there is no combination If it were vision of a combination there should be two determined specific factors This meaning is not right it were vision of consciousness of the eye there should be vision of converted matter because of that which is unresisting The same applies further also to wisdom and to a combination It is not right that it is because of what is unresisting that consciousness of the eye is not conscious of converted matter that which is not seen Because one has to differentiate What should be differentiated is that should be stated why consciousness of the eye is not conscious of converted matter aad should be said that it is because the eye proceeds in respect to one object that consciousness of the eye is not conscious of converted matter The eye is with that which is resisting Because it is with that which is resisting it does not see converted matThe Elements  ter and therefore consciousness of the eye is not conscious Consciousness should have two specific natures both consciousness and vision The same applies to the rest Moreover if it were vision of consciousness of the eye why would it not be conscious That consciousness of the eye is not conscious of converted matter is already known It should further be known because the eye proceeds in respect to one object It should further be said that it is not right that it is not conscious of converted matter because it depends on hindrance that is resisting because of depending on what is unresisting Consciousness of the eye has a twofold basis the eye and the mind that is subsequently extinguished If there were no vision of converted matter because of depending on that which is resisting there should be vision of converted matter because of depending on that which is unresisting When explained otherwise it would be wrong It is not right that no converted matter is seen because the eye is a unique basis and the mind is a general basis It also is not because the basis is not being part of such characteristic marks as matter It also is not because the eye is matter that consciousness of the eye is matter It also is not because the eye is without supporting object that it is without supporting object that because it is dissociated from the eye it is dissociated All such are wrong Furthermore also the mind is a unique basis Depending on the mind consciousness of the eye would have to arise and never has another kind of consciousness arisen depending on that because awarenesses one by one proceed in succession That is why also the mind is a unique  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya basis It is not right that when consciousness and vision are directly connected consciousness exactly is with visionbecause four things are not to be mingled The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of vision hearing sensation and consciousness as four kinds that are not to be mingled If consciousness exactly were with vision there would only be three kinds hearing sensation and consciousness because vision would exactly be consciousness It is not in this way It should therefore be known that it is vision of the eye It isnot right that when differentiating the function of consciousness four kinds are established not seeing converted matter has previously already been explained to be wrong Since vision and consciousness are separated the meaning of their names each is different lighting of the eye is called vision differentiation following awarenesses is called consciousness If one further states that if it were vision of the eye there should be correspondence with the amount of an eye a mistake arises automatically because consciousness is infinite That consciousness is infinite has been said by the Worldhonoured One As the Worldhonoured One said The eye has vision That consciousness has vision is not right Just as stating The mind is conscious of factors Is there still consciousness in other factors If one states that it exactly is the case that the mind is conscious of factors it should be known that the same applies to the eye As has been said Oh brahmanas the eye is a gate because it sees matter This is another name for vision You are confused regarding what has been said In awarenesses and accom panying mental factors there is no place The Elements  Statements about entering and leaving regarding these are not right This exactly is what has been said in these scriptural texts Because of being conscious of factors the mind is a gate There is no consciousness of factors in another factor Therefore it is exactly in the eye that there is vision From consciousness of the eye is without vision up to here all seven sections begin with a question and explain what is wrong The other six sections explain that such things as consciousness are no vision or explain the differences in opinion of other people and in the end that which is right is examined and one dissociates oneself from that which is wrong in order to settle what is meaningful  There are ten that are calculated as atomic Nine elements are formed by the four elements Of two elements one part is spoken of The inward elements are said to be twelve  These exactly are with the nature of faculties There are ten that are calculated as atomic Because they are composed of parts because they obstruct because they are hindrance to a great extent and because of depending on places the ten material elements are a collection of atoms It should be known that eight elements are no collection of atoms Nine elements are formed by the four elements Exception made for the element tangible the other nine materialelements are formed by the four elements because they arise through the four elements and because the four elements are their cause The four elements are the five causes for arising Two elements should be differentiated the element tangible and the element of factors either are formed by the four elements or not formed by the four elements The nature of the four elements in the element tangible is that they are not formed by the four elements Seven kinds of derivative form are formed by the four elements Bodily action and verbal action that is in the element of factors is formed by the four elements the rest element of factors is not formed by the four elements The seven elements of awareness are not formed by the four elements Eleven forms are of the four elements the sense eye depends on them up to the factor sensefield depends on them not the sense mind Also derivative form is elevenfold the sense eye up to the factor sensefield not the sense mind Sometimes it is said that the four elements on which the sense eye depends make the sense eye arise The same applies to the other  It is further said that the four elements on which the sense eye depends make three sense arise the sense eye the sense body and the sensefield tangible oo Fh same applies up to that on which the sense tongue depends The difference between them is said to be the specific faculty That on which the sense body depends makes two sense arise the sense body and the sensefield tangible The same applies to that on which the sense matter sound smell and taste depend Moreover it is also said that all four elements make matter and sound arise All matter of the realm of sexual passion is not free from smell or taste The same applies to that on which the factor sensefield depends That on which the sense eye depends makes seven sense arise the sense eye the sense body and five objects The same applies up to that on which the sense tongue depends That on which the sense body depends makes six sense arise exception made for such four faculties as the eye The same applies to that on which the factor sensefield depends That on which the sensefield matter depends makes five sense arise The same applies up to that on which the sensefield tangible depends It is further said that that on which the sense eye depends makes eleven sense arise the same applies up to that on which the factor sensefield depends Regarding these four elements as reason four sentences should be made differentiating the four elements with mutual different characteristic marks that produce derivative from with mutual different characteristic marks There are the four elements with mutual equal characteristic marks that produce derivative form with mutual different characteristic marks there are the four elements with mutual different characteristic marks that produce derivative form with mutual equal characteristic marks there are the four elements with mutual different characteristic marks that produce derivative form with mutual different characteristic marks there are the four elements with mutual equal characteristic marks that produce derivative form with mutual equal characteristic marks Which four elements with mutual equal characteristic  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya marks produce derivative form with mutual different characteristic marks The four elements characterised by the tangible that produce eleven kinds of derivative form Which four elements with mutual different characteristic marks produce derivative form with mutual equal characteristic marks The four elements characterised by solidity humidity heat and trembling that produce derivative form characterised by being tangible Which four elements with mutual different characteristic marks produce derivative form with mutuai different characteristic marks The four elements characterised by solidity humidity heat and trembling that produce eleven kinds of derivative form Which four elements with mutual equal characteristic marks produce derivative form with mutual equal characteristic marks The four elements characterised by being tangible that produced derivative form characterised by being tangible Question What is the difference between the four elements and derivative form Answer The four elements are the cause derivative form is the fruit Characterised by solidity humidity heat and trembling are the four elements When matter arises with the four elements as cause and is without the characteristic marks of the four elements it is derivative form Furthermore what is visible is the four elements what either is visible or invisible is derivative form Such sayings The inward elements are said to be twelve  The five inward material elements and the seven elements of awareness these twelve are inward elements Know that six elements are outward The Elements  Question Are they said to be inward because of the factors or are they said to be inward because of the person If they are said to be inward because of the factors all factors are without self if they are said to be inward because of the person the factors are without person Answer They are said to be inward because of the factors but not all factors are meant Because of that on which awarenesses and accompanying mental factors depend they are said to be inward This element mind both is basis and that which depends these five material elements are basis but are not that which depends although accompanying mental factors are that which depends they are no basis the rest neither is basis nor that which depends These exactly are with the nature of faculties Exactly these twelve are said to be faculties In one element there are faculties In the element of factors eleven factors are faculties the rest are no faculties it should be known that five outward elements and one part of one element are no faculties One element is said to be homogeneous Seventeen elements fall in a period of time Of one it is one part Three are actions Seventeen are homogeneous and partially homogeneous Exception made for the element of factors the other elements are said to be homogeneous and partially homogeneous Because of differentiating the periods of time this element eye that is homogeneous is threefold already having seen matter in the past seeing matter in the present and  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya having to see matter in the future When partially homogeneous it is fourfold already being extinguished not having seen matter in the past extinguishing not seeing matter in the present the future period of time is twofold nonarisen factors and arisen factors With arisen factors it shall extinguish not having seen matter The same applies to the other material elements When the seven elements of awareness are nonarisen factors of the future they are partially homogeneous The rest is homogeneous One element is said to be homogeneous The element of factors is absolutely homogeneous not partially homogeneous because all elements of factors are the object of consciousness of the mind When stating that also the other elements should also be not partially homogeneous this then is not right when the eye sees matter it is homogeneous and when not seeing  it is partially homogeneous The difference is that when the eye were completely homogeneous the other would also all have to be homogeneous when completely partially homogeneous the other would also all have to be partially homogeneous that when matter is seen it is only homogeneous The same applies to the ear the nose the tongue the body sound smell taste and the tangible The highest truth is as is said with the eye worldly business is as is said with matter Question Are all simultaneous factors somehow either homogeneous or partially homogeneous The Elements  Answer Indeed The ten material sense sometimes are partially homogeneous Such characteristic marks as birth are homogeneous because they are included in the element of factors With nonarisen factors mind is partially homogeneous The associated and the simultaneous factors are homogeneous because they are included in the element of factors Question Which meaning do homogeneous and partially homogeneous have Answer At the moment of being homogeneous being homogeneous is spoken of The element eye is twofold a part with possession of function and a part without possession of function Because the part with possession of function is a part because of the part without possession of function being homogeneous is spoken of Also the part without possession of function is a part because of the part with possession of function Therefore it is also said to be homogeneous The two parts both acquire the characteristic marks of being homogeneous Question What that is calculated as part is called partially Answer Since the part without possession of function is a part because of the part with possession of function it is said to be partially homogeneous Because of having toJachieve the power of the part with possession of function To this the same applies as to a person who has children Seventeen elements fall in a period of time Seventeen elements fall in what is the three periods of time that is why the three periods of time are spoken of either past or  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya future or present produced and already extinguished is past not produced yet is future already produced and not extinguished yet is present Furthermore not made yet is said to be future made is said to be present what is made that is already extinguished is said to be past One element has to be differentiate when the element of factors is conditioned it falls in the three periods of time when unconditioned it does not fall in the periods of time Three are actions Three elements are with action the elements matter sound and the one of factors What is bodily manifesting within the element matter is action the other material elements are no action What is verbal manifesting within the element sound is action the other sounds are no action Bodily and verbal action within the element of factors and thinking are action the rest element of factors is no action The characteristic marks of action shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Actions q  Neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do should be known as fifteen elements These are all to be abandoned through the spiritual path All other elements are threefold Regarding these three elements fully taking the moral precepts and negligence in relation to moral precepts are spoken of Neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do should be known as fifteen eleThe Elements  ments Ten material elements and five elements of consciousness are neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do because they are impure Exactly these elements are to be abandoned through the spiritual path because of the antidote knowledge All other elementsare threefold The other three elements the element mind the element of factors and the element consciousness of the mind are all threefold either still having learning to do or having no more learning to do or neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do either to be abandoned through vision or to be abandoned through spiritual practice or not to be abandoned Mind associated with still having learning to do is still having learning to do patience regarding the law in relation to frustration Up to mind associated with vajropamasamadhi is still having learning to do Mind associated with having no more learning to do is having no more learning to do knowledge of destruction and knowledge of nonorigination Up to mind associated with the conventional view of the adept is having no more learning to do Mind associated with neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do it is good defiled and neutral There are three forms of good acquired by effort acquired by nonattachment and acquired by genesis There are two forms of defiled bad and obscuredneutral There are four forms of neutral what is relating to deportment craftsmanship arisen by retribution and magic To the element consciousness of the mind the same applies as to the element mind The element of factors either is still having learning to do  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya or having no more learning to do or neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do bodily and verbal action of the seeker and the aggregates feeling conceptual identification and conditioning factors are still having learning to do exactly these are having no more learning to do impure bodily and verbal action included in the element of factors the aggregates feeling conceptual identification and conditioning factors and what is unconditioned are neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do The meaning of still having learning to do and of having no more learning to do shall be spoken of elaborately i in the chapter Actions  Since these three elements are with patience  as antidote they are to be abandoned through vision with knowledge as antidote they are to be abandoned through spiritual practice when knowledge is pure they are not to be abandoned The meaning of to be abandoned through vision and to be abandoned through spiritual practice shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Contaminants Regarding these three elements fully taking the moral precepts and negligence in relation to moral precepts are spoken of That which is good bodily manifesting of the element matter is fully taking the moral precepts that which is bad bodily manifesting is negligence in relation to moral precepts The element sound is verbal manifesting The element of factors only is unmanifesting The characteristic marks of fully taking the moral precepts and negligence in relation to moral precepts shall be spoken of elaborately i in the chapter Actions  Seventeen are said to have something higher One element is said to be twofold Seventeen are fruit and with fruit The Elements  The Awakened One has said that one is threefold Seventeen are said to have something higher Exception made for the element of factors seventeen elements have something higher because they are conditioned One element is said to be twofold The element of factors either is with something higher or without superior the conditioned element of factors and space and uncalculated cessation are with something higher because calculated cessation is good and because it is permanent it is said to be without superior Seventeen are fruit and with fruit Exception made for the element of factors the other seventeen elements are fruit and with fruit because conditioned factors arise in mutual dependence their nature is weak The Awakened One has said that one is threefold The element of factors is threefold either fruit and not with fruit or fruit and with fruit or neither fruit nor with fruit Fruit and not with fruit is calculated cessation fruit and with fruit is the conditioned element of factors neither fruit nor with fruit are space and uncalculated cessation  Three elements are with a threefold supporting object The same is further true for one basis Five are single Or different Three elements are with a threefold supporting object The elements consciousness of the eye of the ear and of the mind are with a threefold supporting object good bad and neutral That on which the element consciousness of the mind depends is also threefold good bad and neutral Five are single The basis of five forms of consciousness is single When taking the basis that equally produces concerning five faculties and what is produced by the mind that is subsequently extinguished then one is neutral because the element mind is good bad or neutral Furthermore four sentences should be made concerning the part that is basis and the part that is condition as direct antecedent of consciousness of the eye Sometimes the part that is basis is not the part that is condition as direct antecedent sometimes the part that is condition as direct antecedent is not the part that is basis sometimes the part that is basis is also the part that is condition as direct antecedent sometimes not the part that is basis is not the part that is condition as direct antecedent The part that is basis that is not the part that is condition as direct antecedent is the faculty eye that is produced together with consciousness of the eye the part condition as direct antecedent that is not the part that is basis are accompanying mental factors that are subsequently extinguished the part that is basis that is also the part that is condition as direct antecedent is the mind that is subsequently extinguished neither the part that is basis nor the part that is condition as direct antecedent is exception made for the above concretised The same applies up to the basis of consciousness of the body The Elements  Questicn Is the basis of consciousness of the mind the condition as direct antecedent Answer The basis of consciousness of the mind is the condition as direct antecedent Is the condition as direct antecedent somehow the basis of consciousness of the mind Answer It are the accompanying mental factors associated with the basis of consciousness of the mind Question If consciousness of the eye has the element mind as basis why is it called consciousness of the eye and is it not called consciousness of the mind Answer Because the eye is a unique basis just as seed and sprouts just as drumroll and sound The eye is the unique basis of consciousness of the eye the mind is the general basis Because the group of the six forms of consciousness arises according to the proceeding of the condition as direct antecedent The elements consciousness of the nose consciousness of the tongue and consciousness of the body  these three elements only take what is neutral as supporting object because smell taste and the tangible are absolutely neutral The element mind exactly is with the group of six forms of consciousness because free from this there is nothing else The element of factors is not spoken of When associated with awarenesses it is as is said with awarenesses What arises subsequently to the eye is vision What arises subsequently to the element ear is hearing  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya What arises subsequently to three elements is sensation What arises subsequently to the element mind is consciousness What arises subsequently to the eye is called vision what arises subsequently to the ear is called hearing what arises subsequently to three elements is called sensation what arises subsequently to the mind is called consciousness These three elements are acquired by effort and acquired by nonattachment The nature of the higher faculty acquired through spiritual practice is of four members or of five members and is fruit of trance Therefore what arises subsequently is each established differently What arises subsequently to the other three does not have that part as characteristic marks and therefore one is established together  Question What is the meaning of sensation Answer Its object is only neutral Awarenesses of sensation proceed in it The three forms of consciousness that arise subsequently are then called sensation Smell taste and the tangible are absolutely neutral Because they are neutral they are said to be with sensation That is why the three forms of consciousness that arise subsequently are called sensation The Elements   Two objects are not felt when near Both remote and near is one object The rest is absolutely felt when near Two objects are not felt when near Consciousness of the eye and consciousness of the ear feel their objects not when near because it is as when the eye is suppressed matter is not seen The same applies to the ear when it is suppressed then it does not hear Although it is deep within outward sounds are felt when remote When stating that what is remote is also not seen or heard this then is not reasoned Consciousness of the mind feels all objects whether remote or near Exception made for oneself and for what is associated and what is simultaneous all other factors are felt The rest is absolutely felt when near Because basis and supporting object are without intervals consciousness of the nose of the tongue and of the body feel their objects when near Basis and objects are even Bases of consciousness of the nose of consciousness of the tongue and of consciousness of the body these three forms of consciousness take even objects Since the faculty nose and atoms of smell are even consciousness arises The same applies to the faculties tongue and body and atoms The place where there is combination of a faculty with its object consciousness arises Of two elements they are said to be unfixed The same is true for the object of one element The basis of five elements is sometimes together  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The basis of one element is said to be remote Of two elements they are said to be unfixed Basis and supporting object of consciousness of the eye and of consciousness of the ear are both unfixed The element consciousness of the eye either is with a big basis and a small supporting object as seeing the tip of a hair or the basis is small and the supporting object is big as seeing a grape The same applies to consciousness of the ear The same is true for the object of one element The object of consciousness of the mind is unfixed The object is either big or small Because all factors are the object and because the basis is shapeless being big or small cannot be spoken of Because free from the element mind the six forms of consciousness have no other body is not spoken of Accompanying mental factors are as has been said with awarenesses The basis of five elements is sometimes together The group of five forms of consciousness is sometimes together with the basis together are the five faculties remote is the mind that is subsequently extinguished The basis of one element is said to be remote The basis of the element consciousness of the mind is said to be remote it is this mind that is subsequently extinguished The Elements  Eleven elements have two The five inward elements the element sound and five elements of consciousness are twofold The elements matter smell taste tangible and mind and the element consciousness of the mind these six elements are threefold One is fourfold The element of factors is fourfold Question What does being two three and fourfold apply to Answer Arisen by retribution is the fruit of retribution of good and bad action the three woeful courses are fruits of bad action humans and gods are fruits of good action Because it is accumulated through the eyes and through provisions through religious life The same is true for instantaneous and inherent in the substance To the elements ear nose tongue and body the same applies as to the eye The element sound is also twofold accumulated and outcoming Question Why is it that sound is not arisen by retribution Answer Because it arises by present effort Sound arises by present effort retribution is what is produced by former action Sound is what arises according to desire retribution is not what arises according to desire   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Furthermore between sound and sound there is separation  and between retribution and retribution there is no separation If sound were arisen by retribution it were as matter never to be abandoned and sound is to be abandoned Therefore it is not arisen by retribution Five elements of consciousness are arisen by retribution and outcoming The elements matter smell taste and tangible are threefold arisen by retribution outcoming and accumulated Instantaneous is that the element mind arises together with patience regarding the law in relation to frustration The same applies to the element consciousness of the mind The element of factors is fourfold arisen by retribution instantaneous outcoming and inherent in the substance Arisen by retribution is the fruit of retribution of good and bad action Instantaneous is what belongs to patience regarding the law in relation of frustration Outcoming is exception made for what belongs to patience regarding the law in relation to frustration the other good conditioned element of factors and exception made for retribution the other nonobscuredneutral conditioned element of factors and the defiled element of factors The unconditioned element of factors is only inherent in the substance  When the elements body eye and matter arise it is in the specific stage and in another stage When consciousness of the eye arises it is equally in the specific and in another stage The Elements  When arising in the realm of sexual passion the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye is in the realm of sexual passion and matter is in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the eye arises in the realm of sexual passion If one in this way arises in the stage of the first trance the body is in the stage of the first trance the eye is in the stage of the first trance and matter is in the stage of the first trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance This is called the specific Another stage is when one arises in the realm of sexual passion and the eye in the stage of the first trance sees matter in the realm of sexual passion the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye is in the stage of the first trance matter is in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the first trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye and matter are in the stage of the first trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If one arises in the realm of sexual passion and the eye in the stage of the second trance sees matter in the realm of sexual passion the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye is in the stage of the second trance matter is in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the stage of the first trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye in the stage of the second trance matter is in the stage of the first trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the second trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye and matter are in the stage of the second trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya If one arises in the realm of sexual passion and the eye in the stage of the third trance sees matter in the realm of sexual passion the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye in the stage of the third trance sees matter in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the first trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye is in the stage of the third trance matter is in the stage of the first trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the second trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye is in the stage of the third trance matter is in the stage of the second trance and consciousness of the eye ariss in the stage of the first trance If the third trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye and matter are in the stage of the third trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance When arising in the realm of sexual passion and the eye in the stage of the fourth trance sees matter in the realm of sexual passion the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye in the stage of the fourth trance sees matter in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the first trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye is in the stage of the fourth trance matter is in the stage of the first trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the second trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye is in the stage of the fourth trance matter is in the stage of the second trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the third trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye is in the stage of the fourth trance matter is in the stage of the third trance and conThe Elements  sciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance If the fourth trance is seen the body is in the realm of sexual passion the eye and matter are in the stage of the fourth trance and consciousness of the eye arises in the stage of the first trance As is said with arising in the realm of sexual passion the same applies up to arising in the fourth trance The difference is that the eye of a lower stage does not see matter of a higher stage If one arises in a higher stage the eye of a lower stage is not present a The element ear is as has been said previously The elements nose and tongue are with the specific stage The body and the tangible are spoken of according to the stage Consciousness of the mind is multiple The element ear is as has been said previously To consciousness of the ear the same applies as to consciousness of the eye previously spoken of The element nose is said to be with the specific stage When arising in the realm of sexual passion the body is in the realm of sexual passion the nose is in the realm of sexual passion smell is in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the nose arises in the realm of sexual passion The same applies to the element tongue The body and the tangible are spoken of according to the stage Because consciousness of the body has to be differentiated When arising in the realm of sexual passion the body is in the realm of sexual passion and the tangible is in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the body arises in the realm of sexual passion  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The same applies to the first trance When arising in the second trance the body and the tangible are in the second trance and consciousness of the body arises in the stage of the first trance Because the tangible of the specific stage is sensed consciousness of the body does not arise in another stage The same applies to the third and to the fourth trance Consciousness of the mind is multiple Either the mind is of the specific stage factors of the specific stage and consciousness of the mind arises in the specific stage or it is another stage The specific stage when arising in the realm of sexual passion the mind is in the realm of sexual passion and factors are in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the mind arises in the realm of sexual passion The same applies up to arising in the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification Another stage at the moment one arises in the realm of sexual passion and is with meditative attainment meditative attainment of the first trance is produced in succession to good awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion This is the mind in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the mind that arises in the stage of the first trance The factors either are bound to the three realms or not bound When in succession to the first trance good awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion are present the mind is in the first trance and consciousness of the mind arises in the realm of sexual passion The factors either are bound to the three realms or not bound When meditative attainment of the second trance is in succession tothe first trance the mind is in the first trance and consciousuess of the mind arises in the second trance The factors either are bound to the three realms or not The Elements  bound In this way the succession in reverse order and the transgressing one of the second trance and the first trance of the first trance and the second trance of the first trance and the third trance of the third trance and the first trance up to the sphere of  neitheridentificationnornonidentification should be spoken of elaborately The difference is that this meditative attainment is the element mind and that meditative attainment is consciousness of the mind When trance is consciousness of the mind the factors are either bound to the three realms or not bound When the immaterial ones are consciousness of the mind the factors are to the specific stage a higher stage and not bound Moreover when concerning meditative attainment magic awareness that is the fruit of the first trance of the realm of sexual passion is present in succession to the clean first trance the mind is in the first trance and consciousness of the mind arises in the realm of sexual passion The factors are a magic creation of the realm of sexual passion When exactly in succession to the first trance as fruit of the realm of sexual passion the clean first trance is present the mind is in the realm of sexual passion and conscious ness of the mind arises in the first trance The factors either are bound to the three realms or not bound The same applies up to the fourth trance When arising is arising in the stage of the first trance when having gone down in the realm of sexual passion the mind is in the realm of sexual passion and consciousness of the mind arises in the stage of the first trance The factors either are bound to the realm of form and to the one of formlessness or not bound When arising in the realm of sexual passion having gone down in the stage of the first trance the mind is in the stage  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya of the first trance and consciousness of the mind arises in the realm of sexual passion The factors either are bound to the three realms or not bound The same applies up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification What goes down is the mind what arises is consciousness of the mind but the factors are of the specific stage of a higher stage and not bound  Sometimes one acquires the element eye or consciousness that depends on it the two are both acquired or not acquired It is also matter And abandoning Tf one acquires the element eye Sometimes the element eye acquires accomplishment when it was not accomplished yet not the element consciousness of the eye when arising in the second in the third and in the fourth trance having gone down in the realm of formlessness When arising in the realm of sexual passion the faculty eye is acquired gradually  Or consciousness that depends on it Sometimes the element consciousness of the eye acquires accomplishment when it was not accomplished yet not the element eye when arising in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance having gone down in the stages of the higher three trances Exactly when abiding consciousness of the eye is present Sometimes the two are both acquired Sometimes both the eye and the element consciousness of the eye are acquired when arising in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance having gone down in the realm of formlessness The Elements  That both cannot be acquired is that neither the element eye acquires accomplishment when it was not accom plished yet nor the element consciousness of the eye acquires accomplishment when it was not accomplished yet not losing the faculty eye when arising in the realm of sexual passion or when arising in the brahmaheaven and in the realm of sexual passion death in the brahmaheaven arising in the second in the third and in the fourth trance having gone down in the second in the third and in the fourth trance arising in the realm of formlessness having gone down in the immaterial ones It is also matter When the element matter acquires accomplishment when it was not accomplished yet this exactly is the element eye that acquires accomplishment when it was not accomplished yet Sometimes the element eye not the element matter gradual acquisition of the faculty eye when arising in the realm of sexual passion When the element matter acquires accomplishment when it was not accomplished yet is this the element consciousness of the eye Four sentences have to be made the element matter acquires accomplishment when it was not accomplished yet not the element consciousness of the eye arising in the higher three trances having gone down in the realm of formlessness The element consciousness of the eye acquires accomplishment when it was not accomplished yet not matter this exactly is arising in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance having gone down in three trances Exactly when abiding consciousness of the eye is present Both the element matter that acquires accomplishment when not accomplished yet and the element con Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya sciousness of the eye arising in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance having gone down inthe realm of formlessness Neither the element matter nor the element consciousness of the eye exception made for the above concretised And abandoning As acquisition has been spoken of also abandoning should in this way be spoken of elaborately  The element matter is with two forms of consciousness as consciousness The same is true up to for the tangible All other thirteen elements are absolutely the supporting object of consciousness of the mind The element matter is with two forms of consciousness as consciousness consciousness of the eye and consciousness of the mind The element consciousness of the eye is with specific characteristic marks the element consciousness of the mind is with specific characteristic marks and with general characteristic marks The same is true up to for the tangible The element sound is with two forms of consciousness as consciousness consciousness of the ear and consciousness of the mind The element consciousness of the ear is with specific characteristic marks the element consciousness of the mind is with specific characteristic marks and with general characteristic marks  Up to the element tangible is with two forms of consciousness as consciousness consciousness of the body and consciousness of the mind Consciousness of the body is The Elements  with specific characteristic marks and consciousness of the mind is with specific characteristic marks and with general characteristic marks because the group of five forms of consciousness has specific characteristic marks as object because they are no indecision because of the present object because of being instantaneous All other thirteen elements are absolutely the supporting object of consciousness of the mind The five material faculties the seven elements of awareness and the element of factors these thirteen elements are absolutely with consciousness of the mind consciousness is with specific characteristic marks and with general characteristic marks This consciousness of the mind is twofold with mingled supporting object and also with unmingled supporting object The unmingled supporting object exactly is the supporting object of these thirteen elements  the mingled supporting object is when the supporting objects of the thirteen and the five objects are one by one combined up to the compound supporting object of the eighteen elements  Concerning indecision consciousness is threefold for the one of the mind in the sensual existence In the one of form and in the one of formlessness it has to be differentiated The other elements are of one form Concerning indecision consciousness is threefold for the one of the mind in the sensual existence In consciousness of the mind of the realm of sexual passion there is a  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya threefold indecision indecision regarding the specific nature indecision that is recollection and indecision that is defining  This indecision regarding the specific nature is initial thought indecision that is recollection is mindfulness of the stage of the mind indecision that is defining is unfixed wisdom of the stage of the mind These three forms of indecision are the forms of indecision of consciousness of the mind of the realm of sexual passion In the one of form and in the one of formlessness it has to be differentiated Consciousness of the mind of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness sometimes is threefold when not concentrated in the stage of the first trance Having entered concentration it is twofold when not concentrated it is threefold Consciousness of the mind in three trances when not concentrated is twofold exception made for indecision regarding the specific nature when not concentrated it is single indecision that is recollection Some say that the realm of formlessness is without being not concentrated in this case it is only of one form indecision that is recollection When saying that there is being not concentrated it is single when concentrated and twofold when not concentrated The other elements are of one form The group of five forms of consciousness is said to be the rest These only have indecision regarding the specific nature because of not conferring benefits Question In this way the essential marks have already been differentiated What includes factors the specific nature or the other essence Answer It is the specific nature The Elements  Why  Factors are free from other essence Each abides in its own nature That is why it is said that all factors are included in their specific nature Factors are free from other essence The element eye is free from seventeen factors because of the other essence The same applies to the other elements It cannot be said that when free from a nature something is included in it becauseof different characteristic marks That is why it is said that they are what is included in the specific nature and not in another essence Each abides in its own nature All natures each abide in its specific characteristic marks because this nature is not with the characteristic marks of something else It should be said that abiding is nothing else than being included That is why it is said that all factors are that which is included in their specific nature The meaning of including is that the specific nature is not empty of specific nature nothing else just as matter is not empty of matter Moreover it is said that the meaning of mutual adherence is including As is said in the scriptural texts that the centre of a pavilion is that on which the rafters rest this is the summit of a pavilion As has been said that it is just as a thread adheres to dress just as a door adheres to a doorpost just as an axe adheres to firewood Sometimes it is said that it is included in effort As has been said that those five faculties start with wisdom because they are included in it Sometimes it is said that combination is including the four ways to convert beings can convert beings Sometimes it is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya said that being conformable is including As has been said that right view right conceptualising and right effort Sometimes it is said that something is called including because of grasping because a teacher converts by means of the doctrine that is richness This conventional nonsense is not the eventual converting That the specific nature is included in the specific nature is the eventual highest truth There are three degrees in converting What is spoken of here is being grasped by the specific nature because in this way being included in the specific nature does not abandon the highest truth Being included in the specific nature has already been spoken of The element eye is included in one element in one sensefield and in one aggregate it is not included in seventeen elements eleven sense and five aggregates Furthermore the right eye is included in the right eye the left eye is included in the left eye The right eye is twofold Arisen by retribution is further twofold retribution of good action and retribution of bad action Retribution of good action is included in retribution of good action retribution of bad action is included in retribution of bad action Retribution of bad action is threefold the three woeful courses animal birth in included in animal birth the same applies to ghosts and to hell Retribution of good action is twofold The Elements  humans is included in humans and gods is included in gods The past is included in the past the future and the present Up to ksana that is included in ksana Of the elements one element is spoken of The same is further true for aggregates and senses In this way an aggregate a sense and an element include all factors One element is the element of factors one sense is the sense mind one aggregate is the aggregate matter Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions volume one  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions Volume Two Chapter Two Formations Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others It is not right that since factors are included in their specific nature they arise through their specific power  Eventually none can arise because their functioning would be free froma companion Through the multiple power condition all factors achieve to arise Eventually none can arise because their functioning would be free from a companion The specific nature of the formations is weak and they cannot arise by themselves Question If they cannot arise by themselves how then are they supposed to arise  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer Through the multiple power condition all factors achieve to arise It is as when a person and a boat use one another they achieve to cross over to the other bank To grasping an object the same applies as to awarenesses and accompanying mental factors that arise through the power of their development That awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arise from a companion should be spoken of first  At the moment an awareness is produced this awareness definitely has a companion  the collection of accompanying mental factors and of formations that are dissociated When proceeding formations are mutual causes for arising When a certain awareness has a basis when it has a supporting object and when it arises at a certain ksana a certain collection of accompanying mental factors arises Question What is the collection of accompanying mental factors Answer Conceptual identification desiretodo and contact and wisdom mindfulness thinking and resolve attention concentration and feeling Formations  These are said to be the collection of awarenesses  Conceptual identification Grasping appearance regarding an object Desire for feeling regarding a supporting object Genesis of an object of contact regarding the combination of basis supporting object and awarenesses Wisdom Certainty and decisiveness regarding a supporting object Mindfulness Recollection and no forgetting regarding a supporting object  Thinking The proceeding of an awareness formed regarding merit or evil or what is contrary to both Resolve When the conceptual identification is made to accept the limits Showing comprehension regarding a supporting object Concentration Not being disturbed when feeling a supporting object   The Noble said that these arise each time an awareness arises They proceed in one and the same supporting object and are further permanently associated These ten factors arise together with every good bad and neutral awareness Because they are to be acquired with  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya every awareness they are said to be factors arising with every awareness a They proceed in one and the same supporting object All proceed in one and the same supporting object as awarenesses and they are not without one another they definitely are without second And are further permanently associated Because they do one thing they proceed together and are permanently associated with awarenesses Question What is the meaning of associated Answer The meaning of equality is the meaning of associated Question Accompanying mental factors either are more or less how can the meaning of equality be the meaning of associated Answer Because of the equality of substance If in one awareness there were one conceptual identification and a second feeling it would not be the meaning of associated because with one awareness only conceptual identification arises This is also true for the other accompanying mental factors That is why the meaning of equality is the meaning of associated Furthermore the meaning of equality of time of basis of aspect and of supporting object is the meaning of associated Equality of time because they arise at the moment of one ksana Equality of basis if an awareness arises depending on the eye this is also true for the accompanying mental factors Formations  Equality of aspect if an awareness proceeds in blue when arising this is also true for the accompanying mental factors Equality of supporting object if an awareness arises taking matter as supporting object also these take matter as supporting object That is why being permanently associated is spoken of That accompanying mental factors are associated with all  has already been spoken of Being dissociated shall now be spoken of  The roots having shame and modesty The roots are two roots of merit absence of greed and absence of hatred Destruction of covetousness regarding life and means of living is called absence of greed  destruction of hatred regarding what is relating to beings and what is not relating to beings is called absence of hatred  Despising oneself regarding what is vicious is called shame Being ashamed for someone else regarding what is vicious is called modesty Clean awarenesses regarding the three treasures and regarding the four noble truths is called faith Body and mind that are free from what is evil is called tranquillity Doing good effort and not doing what is free from what is evil is called heedfulness  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Not suppressing someone else is called kindness Restlessly doing the desired effort of abandoning that which is bad that is already produced and that is not produced yet and of making that which is good that is already produced and that is not produced yet arise is called energy Equality of awarenesses is called equanimity These ten good factors are associated with every good awareness when associated with impure or pure  five forms of consciousness they are said to be factors arising with every good awareness because they are associated with consciousness of the mind  Factors arising with every good awareness have already been spoken of Factors arising with every defiled aware ness shall now be spoken of  False resolve unreasoned attention without comprehension forgetfulness lack of confidence sloth distraction ignorance excitedness and heedlessness Overturned resolve is called false resolve Falsely grasping an object is called unreasoned attention Overturned certainty is called without comprehen False recollection and accepting forgetting  Inaccurate awarenesses regarding the three treasures and regarding the four noble truths is called lack of confidence Not doing the effort of abandoning that which is bad that  is called Formations  is already produced and that is not produced yet and not making that which is good that is already produced and that is not produced yet arise is called sloth Dragged along by the objects following the supporting objects in disturbance is called distraction O Not knowing what is equivalent to the previous is called ignorance Awarenesses that move fiercely and do not rest is called excitedness Being free from doing good effort is called heedlessness  There are ten factors arising with every defiled awareness every defiled awareness Shamelessness and disregard are said to be factors arising with every bad awareness There are ten factors arising with every defiled awareness every defiled awareness Such ten factors as false resolve are together with every defiled awareness in the realm of sexual passion in the realm of form in the realm of formlessness in the group of five forms of consciousness and in the stage of consciousness of the mind That is why they are said to be factors arising with every defiled awareness Question Also lethargy is together with every defiled a wareness Why is it not established as a factor arising with every defiled awareness Answer Because of being conformable to meditative at tainment Beings are too lethargic to produce concen tration quickly That is why it is not established Concerning whether factors arising with  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya every awareness are also factors arising with every defiled awareness four sentences should be made Factors arising with every defiled awareness have already been spoken of Factors arising with every bad awareness shall now be spoken of Shamelessness and disregard are said to be factors arising with every bad awareness Not despising oneself regarding everything that is vicious is called shamelessness not being ashamed for others regarding everything that is vicious is called disregard Because they are associated with every bad awareness these two factors are absolutely bad That is why they are established as factors arising with every bad awareness Factors arising with every bad awareness have already been spoken of Factors arising with defiled awarenesses to Formations  a limited extent shall now be spoken of  Anger vengefulness deceit selfishness envy spite craftiness hypocrisy arrogance and violence Such defilements are said to be factors arising with defiled awarenesses to a limited extent Anger arising in succession to not seeing what is conferring benefits as conferring benefits not doing what should be done and doing what should not be done is called anger Anger arising in succession to not seeing what is desirable as desirable not doing what should be done and doing what should not be done is called vengefulness Making the characteristic marks of agreeing in order to deceive someone else is called deceit Being selfish regarding richnesses is called selfishness Not standing the benefits  respectS fame and merit of someone else and being with an envious mind is called envy The mind that is heated when reflecting on Covering the specific nature and following what is conformable to the moment in a deceiving way is called craftiness Concealing ones own vicious things because of fame is called hypocrisy Opposing the lineage tichnesses matter power religious life fully taking the moral precepts wisdom and right action of someone else and a mind of esteeming oneself high is called arrogance   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Wanting to suppress someone else is called violence These ten factors are said to be factors arising with defiled awarenesses to a limited extent They are to be abandoned through the spiritual path and are not to be abandoned through the path of vision They are in the stage of the mind and are not with five forms of consciousness They do not arise together with one awareness  If there is one then there is no second because the formation of each one is different Question What is the difference between factors arising with every awareness factors arising with every good awareness factors arising with every defiled awareness factors arising with every bad awareness and factors arising with defiled awarenesses to a limited extent Answer Factors arising with every awareness are fourfold good bad obscuredneutral and nonobscuredneutral Factors arising with every good awareness are only good Factors arising with every defiled awareness are twofold bad and obscuredneutral Factors arising with every bad awareness are only bad In the class of bad awarenesses there are twentyone accompanying mental factors Three views of the one of sexual passion have one less For two views three forms must be excluded Tn the class of bad awarenesses there are twentyone acFormations  companying mental factors What is bad is exception made for belief in a self and extreme view what is associated with defilement of the realm of sexual passion Because the disliked fruit is settled when proceeding something is called bad  Together with such a mind of greed hatred pride and per plexity twentyone factors arise the ten factors arising with every awareness and such ten factors as sloth sloth ignorance lack of confidence heedlessness excitedness lethargy initial thought sustained thought shamelessness and disregard Three views of the one of sexual passion have one less Together with a mind associated with false view adherence to particular views and adherence to moral precepts and vows of the realm of sexual Passion twenty factors arise exception made for wisdom For two views three forms must be excluded Together with such a mind associated with belief in a self and extreme view of the realm of sexual passion eighteen factors arise exception made for wisdom and for shamelessness and disregard The rest is as is said previously Exception made for shamelessness and for disregard because these are absolutely bad because there is no second wisdom since vision exactly is wisdom  Good ones of the one of sexual passion are with twentytwo With the unique one there are twenty Neutral ones are said to be with twelve Regret and sleepiness both exactly are an increase  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Good ones of the one of sexual passion are clean awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion The desired fruit is settled when proceed There are three forms Together with these awarenesses twentytwo factors arise the ten factors arising with every awareness the ten factors arising with every good awareness initial thought and sustained thought With the unique one there are twenty That awareness that is alone is called unique There are twenty accompanying mental factors that arise together with the defilement ignorance exception made for one defilement Neutral ones are said to be with twelve Nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion are fourfold arisen by retribution relating to deportment craftsmanship and magic awareness Together with these four forms of neutral awarenesses twelve ac companying mental factors arise the ten factors arising with every awareness initial thought and sustained thought Regret and sleepiness both exactly are an increase That awarenesses successively change is called regret It is good bad and neutral In this category of awarenesses there is increase with regret The rest is as has been said previously It should be known that regret is threefold it is only good bad and nonobscuredneutral because of the specific power The Vaibhasikas do not want regret is neutral because regret is intense Sleepiness is called grasping an object when body and mind are obscured This is called sleepiness It  Formations  arises together with all five categories of awarenesses Exactly with these categories of awarenesses there is increase of sleepiness When regret and sleepiness arise together gene is increase with the two regarding three categories Question This explains awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion How is it further in the realm of form Answer The Jirst trance is Sree from bad ones The rest is to be known as in sensual existence For intermediate trance initial thought is excluded The first trance is free from bad ones This one has four categories of awarenesses good unique obscuredneutral and nonobscuredneutral ones Exception made for shamelessness and for disregard these categories of awarenesses are all as has been said with the realm of sexual passion This category of good ones is with twentytwo  together with craving  pride and perplexity nineteen arise there are eighteen that arise together with the five views and with the unique one Because shamelessness and disregard are absolutely bad nonobscuredneutral ones are with twelve This realm of form and realm of formlessness are with out regret For intermediate trance initial thought is excluded The rest is as has been said with the first trance Higher the same is true for sustained thought The second the third and the fourth trance and the realm of form Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya lessness are without sustained thought That awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arise through the power of a companion has already been said Matter shall now be spoken of  It should be known that the atoms that are in four faculties are tenfold Nine in the faculty body in the rest eight This is the stage with smell It should be known that the atoms that are in four faculties are tenfold Four faculties are with a tenfold atom that arises together the four elements matter smell taste and the tangible the faculty eye and the faculty body The same is true for the faculties ear nose and tongue Nine in the faculty body For the rest there are nine kinds in the faculty body This only goes for the faculty body as kind the rest is as has been said previously  In the rest eight Free from the faculties the atoms of matter smell taste and the tangible are eightfold Question In which realm are these atoms spoken of Answer This is the stage with smell The atoms in the realm of sexual passion are combined with smell Smell and taste are not without one another if there is smell then there is taste Concerning the atoms of the realm of form there is no nature of solid food and that is why it is free from smell or taste The atoms of the four faculties of the realm of form are eightfold For the rest the atoms of the faculty body are sevenfold The outward atoms are sixfold Formations  Question If the atoms of the faculty eye are tenfold why is the eye not exactly matter but is it exactly another kind In this way the dharmanature has to be mingled and it has to be contrary to the Abhidharma the Abhidharma says that the faculty eye is included in one element in one sense and in one aggregate Answer There is a twofold atom the atom of the substance and the aggregated atom The atom of the substance is that the atoms of the faculty eye exactly are atoms of the faculty eye The other atoms are all said to be a specific substance It is because of these atoms that the Abhidharma says that the faculty eye is included in one element in one sense and in one aggregate The aggregated atom is a multitude of substances The aggregated atom is spoken of among these Because of abiding in specific characteristic marks the essential marks are not mingled To this the same applies as to the characteristic marks of factors associated with awarenesses that each are different and are not mingled The meaning of the fourfold remoteness shall be spoken of later in this chapter Question It has been said previously that when awarenesses arise accompanying mental factors definitely arise together and that there are formations that are dissociated Of these accompanying mental factors have already been spoken of How are the formations dissociated from awarenesses Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  All conditioned factors are with birth duration decay and disappearance Also these have the four characteristic marks When proceeding they make one another All conditioned factors have the four characteristic marks birth duration decay and disappearance Because they are produced in the world they are with birth because after being produced their specific substance is established they are with duration because when abiding there is deterioration of the power they are with decay because when already decaying their power is broken they are with disappearance These characteristic marks are said to be formations dissociated from awarenesses Question When all conditioned factors have the four char acteristic marks should the characteristic marks further have the characteristic marks Answer These also have the four characteristic marks They exactly arise together with these characteristic marks birth of birth duration of duration decay of decay and disappearance of disappearance Question If it is so then nonfinal Answer When proceeding they make one another When proceeding the characteristic marks and the secondary characteristic marks make one another arise it is not nonfinal Fundamental birth makes birth of birth arise and birth of birth makes fundamental birth arise In this way duration and duration of duration make one another abide decay and decay of decay make one another decay Formations  of disar IPP disapp and di make one another disappear Question When proceeding the characteristic marks and the secondary characteristic marks make one another How many factors do the fundamental characteristic marks make Answer It should be known that with the four fundamental characteristic marks the characteristic marks each make eight factors It should be known that the secondary characteristic marks the characteristic marks o the characteristic marks characterise only one The four fundamental characteristic marks one by one make eight factors exception made for itself fundamental birth makes eight factors arise three characteristic marks four secondary characteristic marks and that factor exception made for itself duration makes eight factors abide exception made for itself decay makes eight factors decay exception made for itself disappearance makes eight factors disappear three characteristic marks four secondary characteristic marks and that factor because the specific nature does nct make itself and the specific nature does not make itself disappear Just as the tip of a finger does not touch itself Question How many factors do the secondary characteristic marks make Answer It should be known that the secondary characteristic marks the characteristic marks of the characteristic  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya marks characterise only one These four secondary characteristic marks each make one factor secondary birth makes fundamental birth arise secondary duration makes fundamental duration abide secondary decay makes fundamental decay decay secondary disappearance makes fundamental disappearance disappear That formations make one another arise when proceeding has already been spoken of In the way they arise simultaneously they are not mingled Now shall be explained y Different nature and characteristic marks are said to be forms of remoteness The same applies to place and time Moral precept seed and the four elements forms of consciousness and difference in nature Different nature and characteristic marks are said to be forms of remoteness The same applies to place and time There are four forms of remoteness socalled remoteness in nature remoteness in characteristic marks remoteness in place and remoteness in time Question What is the factor remoteness Answer Remoteness in nature is as in one body good moral precepts and bad moral precepts that are unmanifesting arise successively Although produced simultaneously in one body they are equally with the nature of being unmanifesting but their nature each is different Therefore remoteness is spoken of  Remoteness in characteristic marks is the way the four vFormationst elements support ong another when proceedingand abiding in one place togetherare comb body Because their characteristic marks each z remoteness is spoken of   Remoteness in place is the way  the places India and China  although arisen simultaneously are combined to settle one body As these places are different remoteness is therefore spoken of Remoteness in time is the iway  the eyes make consciousness of the eye arise Because of remoteness in time between what arises later and what had arisen first remoteness is spoken of  different  That all formations arise simultaneous mingled has already been spoken of   Formations s Ase from causes The efficient one the simultaneous one the homogenegus ne the pervasive one the associated one and the one of retribution Conditioned factors arise from this sixfold cause The efficient cause the simultaneous cause he homogeneous cause the pervasive causeS the associated cause and the cause of retribution These sixcayses include all causes These six causes make  egnditioned formations arise The name of the causes has already been spoken of Now their characteristic marks shall be spoken of one by one Similar ones and dissimilar ones are all each exception made for their specific nature the efficient cause because there is no obstruction at the moment of arising Similar ones and dissimilar ones are all each exception made for their specific nature the efficient cause When proceeding similar and dissimilar factors are exception made for their specific nature a cause the efficient cause Because there is no obstruction at the moment of arising Exception made for the specific nature all natures each abide in something else at the moment a factor arises and arising is not hindered just as because one depends on earth one does clean and foul action because one depends on space one acquires coming and going Just as at the moment consciousness of the eye arises seventeen elements are no obstruction That is why all elements arise in this way Question Why is the specific nature no efficient cause regarding the specific cause Answer Because the specific nature does not make itself and because it is not is own basis The specific nature does not support destroy enjoy hurt grasp or break the specific nature does not make it increase or decrease does not settle or ruin it What is not obstructed is called efficient cause Because the specific nature is without that which is not obstructed regarding the specific nature the efficient cause is not Formations  established Question If what is not obstructed is the efficient cause then why do all factors not arise simultaneously or disappear simultaneously do they not disappear at the moment they arise or do they not arise at the moment they disappear Answer Because of not being combined Although there is the efficient cause there must be a combination for arising Neither is it the case that all factors simultaneously have a combination for arising or a combination for disappearing Neither is it the case that one combination has two fruits Question If this is true then why is it so that when there is one killer among beings and the other beings are no ob struction the killer is with blameworthiness and not the other beings Answer Because they are without the part of bad aware   nesses  and moreover do not do action As outward things arise through the supremacy of all beings why does taking what is not given Answer Because there is no part of enjoyment and because there is no fruit of human effort When all beings would have the part of enjoyment and the fruit of human effort regarding this those who take away would acquire the blameworthiness of taking what is not given regarding this Neither is it one thing that is the enjoyment and the fruit of human effort all beings  Samyuktabhidhatmahrdaya The threefold supremacy is the own supremacy the supremacy  o moral restraint and the supremacy of the con y whet one Gan protect oneself not fo vilation wheH those objects that produce defilement are present one supremacy of moral restraint is asavery learned nbcauise of the protection of the doctrinie he does no  blaimwvorthiness whert objects that prodiice defilement are present ThE supremacy of thGontemporaries is as when there is a respected venerable because there is the protection of the contemporaries one does no blameworthiness when objects that produce defilement are present decor The efficient cause has already been spoken of The simultaneous cause shall now k be spoken of g Those natures that Gre produced simultaneously that are with

sintitiltaneous Cause Formations  When proceeding they are causal When they are produced simultaneously and make a fruit when proceeding they are the simultaneous cause Although eleven sense fieldsy arise simultaneously these make no fruit when proceeding While the homogeneous cause is with one and the same fruit at a different moment the simultaneous cause concerns formations that arise simultaneously because of the power of proceeding Awarenesses are in relation to accompanying mental factors also formations dissociated from awarenesses that proceed in succession to awarenesses and matter that proceeds in succession to awarenesses are in relation to awarenesses The eye is in relation to what is of equal nature what is of equal nature is in relation to the eye and the four elements are the simultaneous cause when proceeding Because derivative form that is resisting has no fruit when proceeding it is no simultaneous cause Question What is the meaning of companion Answer If there are awarenesses then there is such a factor minor then minor middle then middle excessive then excessive It has to be compared in this way There are ten such companions the socalled one genesis one duration one disappearance one fruit one basis one retribution good then good bad then bad neutral then neutral for arising they all fall in one period of time The tenfold companion has already been spoken of The impure path for abandoning fetters among these is with an eightfold companion exception made for the bad and the neutral The conventional path of preparation the path of liberation the superior path  and the other goodimpure awarensses are with a sevenfold companion exception made for the bad the neutral and the  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya fruit of disjunction The pure path for abandoning fetters is with a sevenfold companion exception made for the bad the neutral and the retribution The pure path of preparation the path of liberation and the superior path are with a sixfold companion exception made for the bad the neutral the fruit of disjunction and the retribution Bad awarenesses are with a sevenfold companion exception made for the good the neutral and the fruit of disjunction Neutral awarenesses are with a sixfold companion exception made for the good the bad the fruit of disjunction and the retribution There is that which is simultaneous that also is the simultaneous cause and there is that which is simultaneous that is not the simultaneous cause Regarding eight factors this eye both is that which is simultaneous and the simultaneous cause the four characteristic marks and the four secondary characteristic marks Regarding the eye the characteristic marks are that which is simultaneous and the simultaneous cause Regarding the eye the secondary characteristic marks are that which is simultaneous and not the simultaneous cause Regarding eight factors birth is that which is simultaneous and the simultaneous cause exception made for the specific nature of birth itself the eye and the other characteristic marks and the secondary characteristic marks Regarding birth the five factors that make this arise are that which is simultaneous and the simultaneous cause The other secondary characteristic marks are that which is simultaneous and not the simultaneous cause The same applies to the other characteristic marks secondary characteristic marks The same applies up to the sensefield tangible  and Formations  Regarding fiftyeight factors the sense mind is that which is simultaneous and the simultaneous cause the ten factors arising with every awareness the forty characteristic marks of the factors arising with every awareness and the eight factors of the characteristic marks and the secondary characteristic marks of the sense mind Regarding the rest it is that which is simultaneous and not the simultaneous cause Regarding the sense mind there are fiftyfour factors that are that which is simultaneous and the simultaneous cause exception made for the four secondary characteristic marks Moreover it is said that fourteen factors are that which is simultaneous and the simultaneous cause regarding the sense mind ten factors arising with every awareness and the four characteristic marks of awareness The other eightyfour factors are that which is simultaneous and not the simultaneous cause Also the factors arising with every awareness have to be spoken of in this way Fiftyfour factors are that which is simultaneous and the simultaneous cause regarding awarenesses exception made for the secondary characteristic marks of awarenesses This explanation is good Because if it were different it would be contrary to the Prakaranapada of the Abhidharma it is spoken of in this way St exception made for birth duration decay and disappearance of such factors as belief in a self it is as all other defiled ones the truth of frustration The simultaneous cause has already been spoken of The homogeneous cause shall now be spoken of It is also said to be for that which has not arisen yet What is similar of the specific stage is cause Sometimes it is said to be regarding another stage That which has arisen previously for that which arises later That which has arisen previously in the past is the homogeneous cause in relation to that which has arisen later in the past and in the present Question Is that which has already arisen that is the cause for that which has already arisen further the cause for that which has not arisen yet Answer It is also said to be for that which has not arisen yet That which has not arisen yet is future In this way that which has arisen previously is the cause for that which arises later It should be known that that which is past and that which is present is the homogeneous cause regarding that which is future and that that which is future is without homogeneous cause regarding that which is future because there is no former or later Question What among that which has arisen previously is the homogeneous cause regarding that which has arisen later and regarding that which has not arisen yet and what is not It is the specific stage The realm of sexual passion is the cause for the realm of sexual passion not for another stage Up to neitheridentificationnornonidentification is the cause for the stage of neitheridentificationFormations  nornonidentification not for another stage Because causes and fruits interrupt the stages Question What of the specific stage is cause for the specific stage and what is not Answer What is similar is the homogeneous cause also in the specific stage what is similar is the homogeneous cause not what is dissimilar just as what is good is the cause for what is good what is defiled is the cause for what is defiled and what is neutral is the cause for what is neutral because what is similar and similar factors are successive in the way  that what is good arises when practising what is good that what is bad arises when practising what is bad that craftsmanship arises when practising craftsmanship and that what is relating to deportment arises when practising what is relating to deportment This is said to be the inward part The same applies to the outward part that arises according to the seed Question Is something absolutely the homogeneous cause for the specific stage How is it further for another stage Answer Sometimes it is said to be regarding another stage another stage has to be differentiated Just as pure factors are a cause when proceeding in all nine stages because they are free from craving and because they do not fall in the realms What is minor is the cause for what is excessive it is not what is excessive that is the cause for what is minor Because what is impure is bound to craving it falls  in the realms That is why it is only the specific stage The manifold homogeneous causes have already been spoken of good factors are not the cause for all good factors Now shall be explained  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  There are nine forms of defiled ones They are mutual cause when proceeding It is what is acquired by rearising What is arisen by application is not minor There are nine forms of defiled ones These defiled ones are ninefold from minorminor up to excessiveexcessive They are mutual cause when proceeding Because they are present successively when proceeding and all rearising is achieved suddenly  Question The nine forms of defiled ones are mutual cause when proceeding How is the rest Answer It is what is acquired by rearising If what is acquired by rearising is good this also is ninefold and mutual cause when proceeding Question How is further what is arisen by application Answer What is arisen by application is not minor When arisen by application it is arisen through learning through reasoning and through personal realisation These are the cause for what is equal and for what is supreme not for what is minor in this way they are the cause for what is minorminor up to the cause for what is excessiveexcessive What is excessiveexcessive is only the cause for what is excessiveexcessive up to for what is minorminor it is no cause Furthermore what is through learning is the cause for what is through learning the cause for what is through reasoning and the cause for what is through personal realisation Furthermore what is through reasoning is the cause for what is through reasoning and the cause for what is Formations  through personal realisation it is no cause for what is through learning because it is minor What is through personal realisation is only the cause for what is through personal realisation because they are minor Furthermore development of wisdom is fourfold warmth summit patience and the highest worldly factor This factor warmth is the cause for the four forms summit for three patience for two and the highest worldly factor is only the cause for the highest worldly factor These are said to be goodimpure factors What is nonobscuredneutral is fourfold What is arisen by retribution is the cause for the four forms what is relating to deportment for three craftsmanship for two and magic awareness is only the cause for magic These are said to be impure Of the pure factors patience regarding the law in relation to frustration is the cause for patience regarding the law in relation to frustration up to the cause for knowledge of nonorigination knowledge of nonorigination is only the cause for knowledge of nonorigination The homogeneous cause has already been spoken of In this way receiving fruit and giving fruit of this homogeneous cause shall now be spoken of  Such homogeneous causes as the good ones are receiving fruit and are not giving one Sometimes they are giving one and are not receiving one Sometimes both or neither are spoken of Four sentences have to be made about good homogeneous  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya causes that are receiving fruit but are not giving one Receiving and not giving acquisition of final abandoning at the moment the roots of merit are abandoned Sometimes giving and not receiving acquisition of primary arising at the moment the roots of merit arise successively Sometimes both abiding of other specific natures when not cutting away the roots of merit Neither exception made for the above concretised Moreover what is defiled Receiving and not giving final abandoning of acquisition of what is defiled at the moment one has to acquire the fruit of arhatship Giving and not receiving primary acquisition at the moment of falling back from the fruit of arhatship abiding of other specific natures when not with nonattachment yet Neither exception made for the above concretised Being without supporting object has already been spoken of Factors with supporting object Receiving and not giving defiled and neutral awarenesses that are present in succession to good awarenesses Giving and not receiving good awarenesses that are present in succession to defiled and neutral awarenesses Both good awarenesses that are present in succession to good awarenesses Neither exception made for the above concretised Defiled and neutral awarenesses are also to be spoken of in this way Formations  The homogeneous cause has already been spoken of The pervasive cause shall now be spoken of  For the ones of frustration and for the ones of the origin regarding the specific stage perplexity views and ignorance are said to be the pervasive cause They are produced prior to defilement For the ones of frustration and for the ones of the origin regarding the specific stage perplexity views and ignorance are said to be the pervasive cause Because they support the objects because of absolute certainty because of two forms of contaminants because every defilement is included in the truth of frustration and in the one of the origin Views perplexity associated ignorance and unique ignorance all these contaminants as the kind of defilement to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and through the one of the origin are no practising of effort They are also said to be a pervasive cause because they burn and because they are at the side of defilement Because of difference in knowing annihilation and because of difference in realms hey are with the specific stage and not with another stage Question Who are they the pervasive cause for For which part are they the pervasive cause Answer They are produced prior to defilement The past is the pervasive cause for the past for the present and for the future the present is the pervasive cause for the future Moreover defiled awarenesses arise successively All pervasives should be known in this way The per vasives shall be spoken of in the chapter Contaminants The pervasive cause has already been spoken of The associated cause shall now be spoken of  Factors that are with one and the same aspect with one basis and that are also simultaneous and proceed in one object are said to be the associated cause When an awareness proceeds in aspect basis moment or object such accompanying mental factors as enjoyment are precisely proceeding in this aspect this basis this moment and this object When these accompanying mental factors proceed exactly this awareness proceeds because their nature is weak Arising through the power of proceeding is as when binding rushes Therefore it is said that awarenesses are the associated cause regarding accompanying mental factors and that accompanying mental factors are that cause regarding accompanying mental factors and regarding awarenesses Awarenesses are not that cause regarding awarenesses Because of three things at one ksana no two awarenesses arise together a first awareness does not wait for a later awareness the specific nature of all facFormations  tors does not look after itself  Because matter and formations dissociated from awarenesses are without supporting object they are without associated cause The associated cause has already been spoken of The cause of retribution shall now be spoken of  What is bad and what is goodimpure is included in the three periods of time Because these are with retribution they are said to be called cause of retribution When what is goodimpure and what is bad fall into the formations of the three periods of time  the forms of birth are successively regarding transmigration and retribution arises This is what is good that is with a desired fruit and what is bad that is with a disliked fruit There is action that makes one sensefield arise as retribution the faculty life When acquiring the sense mind then there are two sense  the sense mind and the factor sensefield The same applies to the sensefield tangible When acquiring the sense body then there are three sense the sense body the sensefield tangible and the factor sensefield The same applies to the sensefields matter smell and taste When acquiring the sense eye then there are four sense the sense eye the sense body the sensefield tangible and the factor sensefield The same applies to the senses ear nose and tongue There is action that either is with five six seven eight nine ten or eleven sense as retribution It should  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya be known that because action is manifold also retribution is manifold as since outward seeds are manifold the fruits are also manifold just as such as rice sweet Sugar and grapes That which is not manifold is just as such as wheat It should be known that the same applies to the inward chain of dependent origination There is action of one period of time with retribution in three periods of time there is no action of three periods of time with retribution in one period of time because the fruit is not inferior to the cause In this way action of one ksana is with fruit in many ksanas there is no action of many ksanas with fruit in one ksana In the realm of sexual passion one aggregate as cause of retribution acquires one fruit acquisition bodily action and verbal action four aggregates as cause of retribution acquire one fruit good and bad awarenesses and accompanying mental factors In the realm of form one aggregate as cause of retribution acquires one fruit good awarenesses and accompanying mental factors without successively proceeding action the five aggregates as cause of retribution acquire one fruit good awarenesses and accompanying mental factors with successively proceeding action In the realm of formlessness one aggregate as cause of retribution acquires one fruit acquisition and meditative attainment of cessation four aggregates as cause of retribution acquire one fruit good awarenesses and accompaFormations  nying mental factors One kind of action is only with one kind of body because such actions as the one to be felt in this life each are different That it is contrary to the Aniruddhasitra is not right Because this speaks about the beginning it is spoken of in this way Because of the retribution of once giving he was born in a great notorious family and once born he was conscious of his former existences Now he saw the fruit of giving himself there was increase of clean action The retribution increased up to destruction of impure influence Speaking of this root is as the seed of one grain Moreover it is said that at this moment of once giving there is a multitude of formations Regarding the one reason one utters a wish either the wish to belong to gods or the wish to belong to humans That such is the specific nature of the causes has already been explained Receiving fruit and giving fruit of these causes shall now be spoken of Five are receiving fruit in the middle period It is also said that two are giving fruit With giving fruit extinguished is one Two causes should be differentiated  Five are receiving fruit in the middle period The present is called the middle period Five causes are receiving fruit when abiding in the present time It is also said that two are giving fruit When the associated cause and the simultaneous cause abide in the present time they are giving fruit The moment they are receiving fruit exactly is the moment they are giving fruit That is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya why it is said that two are giving fruit With giving fruit extinguished is one Extinguished is called past When the cause of retribution was abiding in the past time it was giving fruit Two causes should be differentiated The homogeneous cause and the pervasive cause either are giving fruit when abiding in the present time or when in the past time Because it is disturbed the efficient cause is not spoken of Receiving fruit and giving fruit of a cause is already spoken of Establishment in a period of time shall now be spoken of  The efficient cause is all factors Two causes are said to be in two periods of time The other three are said to be in the three periods of time They are the dominant one the natural one the one of retribution and the one of human effort The efficient cause is all factors Two causes are said to be in two periods of time The other three are said to be in the three periods of time All factors conditioned and unconditioned ones are said to be the efficient cause the homogeneous and the pervasive cause are said to be past and present the other three causes are said to be in the three periods of time The causes are already differentiated as to the three periods of time whether fruit and cause are with fruit shall now be spoken of the homogeneous cause and the pervasive cause have the natural fruit the cause of retribution has the fruit of retribution the associated cause and the simultaneous cause have the fruit of human effort All causes have already been differentiated That factors arise from causes shall now be spoken of  Awarenesses and accompanying mental Jactors arisen by retribution the defiled ones all arise from five causes This meaning should be known Awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arisen by retribution the defiled ones all arise from five causes Awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arisen by retribution and defiled awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arise from five causes The five causes of the awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arisen by retribution are the efficient cause the simultaneous one the homogeneous one the associated one and the cause of retribution The efficient cause at the moment these factors arise similar and dissimilar factors abide in being not obstructed The simultaneous cause arising from the power of proceeding they make a companion when proceeding and formations dissociated from awarenesses arise as companion The homogeneous cause homogeneous factors that have arisen previously The associated cause what proceeds together in  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya one supporting object The cause of retribution when this is good or bad so is its fruit Exception made for the pervasive cause because retribution is neutral For defiled awarenesses and accompanying mental factors the cause of retribution is excluded because they are defiled they arise from the pervasive cause The other four causes are as has been said previously Dissociated ones and all associated factors with the exception of the primary pure arise from four causes Matter arisen by retribution and formations dissociated from awarenesses arise from four causes exception made for the pervasive cause because of being neutral exception made for the associated cause because of being without supporting object Defiled matter and formations dissociated from awarenesses arise from four causes exception made for the associated cause because of being without supporting object exception made for the cause of retribution because of being defiled All other associated factors with the exception of the primary pure Goodimpure awarenesses and accompanying mental factors what is relating to deportment craftsmanship magic awareness and accompanying mental factors and exception made for that which is associated with patience regarding the law in relation to frustration the other pure awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arise from four causes exception made for the pervasive Formations  cause and for the cause of retribution  For the other dissociated ones that are homogeneous it should be known that it is threefold As well as for the other associated pure factors that have primarily arisen the efficient cause the simultaneous cause and the homogeneous cause not the associated cause because of being without supporting object Two causes have already been excluded previously As well as for the other associated pure factors that have primarily arisen Just as factors associated with patience regarding the law in relation to frustration also these are with three causes for arising the efficient cause the simultaneous cause and the associated cause Because there is nothing that is pure that has arisen previously there is no homogeneous cause there neither are the pervasive cause nor the cause of retribution  The ones that are dissociated among this are from two causes It should be known that what arises from one cause definitely does not exist The ones that are dissociated among this are from two causes In the class of the primary pure matter and formations dissociated from awarenesses arise from two causes the efficient cause and the simultaneous cause  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya All conditioned factors have already been spoken of In this elaborate explanation there definitely is not that which arises from one cause Because the specific nature is weak Up to the arising ot one atom it are also exception made for itself all other factors that are the efficient cause and the simultaneously arisen birth duration decay and disappearance that are the simultaneous cause Summarising the meaning of this general explanation four kinds of factors have been spoken of those arisen by retribution defiled ones all other undefiled ones with the exception of those arisen through retribution and the primary pure and those associated with and dissociated from the primary pure and the ones that have arisen by retribution up to the primary pure factor Those associated with the ones arisen by retribution arise from five causes exception made for the pervasive cause those dissociated from the ones arisen by retribution arise from four causes exception made for the pervasive cause and for the associated cause In this way for the ones associated with and dissociated from the defiled ones the difference is that exception has to be made only for the cause of retribution they arise from the pervasive cause Exception made for tnuse arisen by retribution and the primary pure all others that are associated with the undefiled ones arise from four causes exception made for the pervasive cause and for the cause of retribution the ones that are dissociated arise from three causes exception made for the pervasive cause for the associated cause and for the cause of retribution the ones that are associated with the primary pure arise from three causes the associated cause the simultaneous cause and the efficient cause the ones Formations  that are dissociated arise from two causes the efficient and the simultaneous cause The causes have already been spoken of Such causes have been spoken of by the Worldhonoured One because of the power of converting and because of the power of awaking for the true characteristic marks Now the conditions shall be spoken of The one as direct antecedent and also the condition as supporting object the dominant one and the one as cause That factors arise from the four conditions has been said by the Worldhonoured One Since the nature of all factors is included in the power  Pp condition and in the power object there is rearising because the nature is weak All conditions are included in the four conditions the one that prepares the implication is the condition as direct antecedent the one that prepares the adherence is the condition as supporting object the part that is not obstructed is the dominant condition the one that prepares the seedfactor is the condition as cause  Exception made for the last awareness of the arhat the other awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are permanently with formation once arisen This is said to be the condition as direct antecedent  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Exception made for those that are associated with the last awareness of the arhat all other past and present awarenesses and accompanying mental factors one by one are with successive arising Because these awarenesses one by one are with successive arising and are without intervals they are called condition as direct antecedent That which is associated with the last awareness of the arhat is no condition as direct antecedent because there are no other successive awarenesses Because future awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are not produced yet they are without other awarenesses that are successively and they also are without condition as direct antecedent There also is no establishment of former and later and succession in effort in the future When former and later and succession in effort were established in the future the meaning of development of right effort would be destroyed Development of right effort and development of false effort have to arise successively according to contribution When stating that in succession to one awareness a second awareness either good or defiled is established it is so that when at the moment of right conceptualising a good awareness makes a defiled awareness arise this is uncalculated cessation and that when at the moment of conceptualising on false effort a defiled awareness makes a good awareness arise this in uncalculated cessation That it is as seed both makes sprouts and gruel   if there is the combination for sprouts then sprouts arise and gruel does not arise if there is the combination for  then gruel arises and sprouts do not arise is not right Because it has already been said previously that former and later are not being part Formations  It is not right that because the last awareness of the arhat is the element mind it should be condition as direct antecedent because the contribution of the condition is different When stating that as the last awareness of the arhat is no basis for Gonsciousness of the mind but is called element mind because it acquires the characteristic marks of a basis in this way also the last awareness of the arhat should be called condition as direct antecedent because it is without intervals successively this is not right Because the contribution of the condition is different Because of characteristic marks an element is established just as the incorporeal eye does not see matter because consciousness of the eye is empty but because it also acquires the characteristic marks of a basis it is also called element eye The last awareness of the arhat is as has been said previously Arising through conditions is established because of action The last awareness of the arhat constitutes the action of the condition as direct antecedent Successive arising without intervals of accompanying mental factors that are not being part of it is also to be spoken of in this way What is permanent is not as the homogeneous cause and the pervasive cause Question Why are matter and formations dissociated from awarenesses no condition as direct antecedent Answer Because of disturbance What is not disturbed is said to be the condition as direct antecedent Because matter and formations dissociated from awarenesses are disturbed they are no condition as direct antecedent because they are good bad neutral impure and pure simultaneously and are present in the formations of different  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya realms The realm of sexual passion is with a threefold conceptualising wisdom through learning wisdom through reasoning and wisdom through rearising no wisdom through personal realisation because of being unfixed In succession to this wisdom through learning and wisdom through reasoning of the realm of sexual passion the noble path is present in succession to the noble path a three fold conceptualising is present The realm of form is with a threefold conceptualising wisdom through learning wisdom through personal realisation and wisdom through rearising no wisdom through reasoning because the realm of form is fixed In succession to this wisdom through learning and wisdom through personal realisation the noble path is present in succession to the noble path wisdom through learning and wisdom through personal realisation are present The realm of formlessness is with a twofold conceptualising wisdom through personal realisation and wisdom through rearising In succession to this wisdom through personal realisation the noble path is present in succession to the noble path wisdom through personal realisation is present This meaning shall bespoken of elaborately in the chapter investigations  Sometimes a factor is successively to an awareness but is not without intervals with this awareness Without intervals but not successively both or neither should be known Sometimes a factor is successively to an awareness but is not without intervals with this awareness Exception Formations  made for the ksana of the first meditative attainment the successiveness of the other ksanas of meditative attainments and the production of the awareness of trance Without intervals but not successively Birth duration decay and impermanence of this ksana of the first meditative attainment and birth duration decay and impermanence of the successive awarenesses Both The ksana of the first meditative attainment and exception made for the production of the awareness of trance the other successive awarenesses Neither Exception made for birth duration decay and impermanence of the ksana of the first meditative attainment birth duration decay and impermanence of such other Asanas of successive meditative attainments Four sentences have to be made concerning the fact whether a factor is successively to an awareness and without intervals with meditative attainment Sometimes a factor is successively to an awareness and is not without intervals with meditative attainment the ksana of the first meditative attainment and other suc cessive awarenesses with the exception of the production of the awareness of trance Without intervals with meditative attainment and not successively to an awareness birth duration decay and impermanence of such other successive meditative attainments with the exception of birth duration decay and impermanence of the ksana of the first meditative attainment Both other successive meditative attainments and the production of the awareness of trance with the exception of the Asana of first meditative attainment Neither birth duration decay and impermanence of the ksana of the first meditative attainment and birth duration  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya decay and impermanence of other successive awarenesses with the exception of birth duration decay and impermanence of the production of awareness of trance Meditative attainment of cessation is that which is implicated by awarenesses and what is made by awarenesses that is why it is successive to awarenesses Because it is contrary to awarenesses it is no condition as direct antecedent of awarenesses Although preyiously without intervals successive to concentration the production of the awareness of trance is again the condition as direct antecedent for awarenesses because it is no awareness The condition as direct antecedent has already been spoken of The condition as supporting object shall now be spoken of  Objects are in relation to every awareness and accompanying mental factor That is why all factors are said to be called condition as supporting object According to the substance all factors are the supporting object of awarenesses and of accompanying mental factors consciousness of the eye and what is associated has matter as supporting object up to consciousness of the mind and what is associated have all factors as supporting object Regarding consciousness of the eye in relation to one form of matter one certain knowledge arises When stating that this moreover is vision of a multitude of matter this is not right multitude is pride just as the turning of a wheel of fire Formations  it is no wheel Identifying it with a wheel is pride When one does not clearly see the difference in matter one can accept the generality as when observing a wood Sound smell taste and tangible should also be known in this way The condition as supporting object has already been spoken of The dominant condition shall now be spoken of When it is the efficient cause this exactly is the dominant condition It should be known that the socalled condition as cause is said to be the other causes It should be known that because exception made for the specific nature all natures are not obstructing the efficient cause previously mentioned exactly is the dominant condition Since at the moment a factor arises its own substance is made something is called dominant condition because of superiority The dominant condition has already been spoken of The condition as cause shall now be spoken of It should be known that the socalled condition as cause is said to be the other causes Exception made for the efficient cause the other causes are said to be the condition as cause The conditions have already been spoken of That factors arise according to conditions shall now be spoken of Awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arise from the four conditions two meditative attainments from three  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The rest is spoken of regarding two Awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arise from the four conditions Awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arise from the four conditions They arise because of being implicated by what precedes This is their condition as direct antecedent The object is their condition as supporting object Exception made for the specific self all other factors are their dominant condition The other causes are according to what is proper said to be their condition as cause Two meditative attainments from three Meditative attainment without conceptual identification and meditative attainment of cessation arise from three conditions awarenesses and accompanying mental factors that precede the two meditative attainments are their condition as direct antecedent good factors of the specific stage that have arisen previously and the four characteristic marks produced simultaneously with them are their condition as cause the dominant condition is as has been said previously The rest is spoken of regarding two Exception made for meditative attainment without conceptual identification and meditative attainment of cessation the other formations dissociated from awarenesses and matter all these factors have two conditions for arising the condition as cause and the dominant condition That factors arise from conditions has already been explained The limitation of conditioned factors shall now be spoken of Formations   There are three forms of limitation the one in name the one in matter and the one in time The first part is said to be one syllable Atom and ksana are the other There are three forms of limitation the one in name the one in matter and the one in time All conditioned factors are established by a threefold limitation According to the thing these are the limitation in name the limitation in matter and the limitation in time Question Answer The first part is said to be one syllable Atom and ksana are the other The smallestname is one syllable A name is extremely small with one syllable That is why one syllable is said to be the limitation in name The smallest matter is one atom When the one with true knowledge concerning the formations knows to differentiate the characteristic marks of matter then matter is known to be extremely subtle with one atom That is why one atom is said to be the limitation in matter The smallest time is one ksana Time is ex tremely small with one instant That is why a ksana is said to be the limitation in time Concerning the measure of a ksana some say that it is as a powerful man who looking around hurriedly observes the multitude of stars according to the going of time one star is one Asana All are in this way Moreover scme say that it is as a powerful man who during a long time snaps with the fingers sixtyfour ksanas pass Moreover some say that it is as a powerful man who cuts   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya thin silk thread of Kagi with a very sharp knife cutting one thread is one Asana All are in this way Moreover some say that the Worldhonoured One did not pronounce ksana As has been said The bhiksu should know that four good marksmen grasped their bows and all shot In this way it has been spoken of elaborately Atom in temporal meaning has already been spoken of In this way increase of matter shall now be spoken of Seven atoms settle an anu Seven anus settle an irondust It should be known that a waterdust a dust on a hare and a dust ona sheep are produced from seven Seven atoms settle one anu This is the most subtle matter The divine eye can see it and it is seen by the bodhisattva and by the sovereign of the world Seven anus form an irondust seven irondusts form a waterdust  seven waterdusts form a dust on a hare seven dusts on a hare form one dust on a sheep A dust on a cowhair and a sunbeamspeck and such as a nit a louse and a grain are increasing from small to great when proceeding All are produced from numbers of seven Seven dusts on a sheep settle one dust on a cowhair seven dusts on a cowhair settle one sunbeamspeck seven sunbeamspecks settle one nit seven nits settle one louse seven lice settle one grain Formations   In this way seven grains gradually increase and form one finger The measure of twentyfour fingers is called one forearm Seven grains form one finger and twentyfour fingers form one forearm  Four forearms form one bow five hundred are a kroa When one is separated a kroa from a village this is called an aranya In this way it should be known that these numbers exactly are measures of the body Four forearms form one bow separated five hundred bows from a village is called an aranya This is one kroga of Magadha In the north this is called half a krosa Question A ksana up to a kroga are already known What does it make in measures of the body Answer These numbers exactly are measures of the body It should be known that the measure of a forearm and of a kroSa previously spoken of exactly are measures of the body With humans forearms make the measure of the body Humans of Jambudvipa are three and a half forearms long or four forearms humans of Parvavideha are eight forearms long humans of Godaniya are sixteen forearms humans of Uttarakuru are thirtytwo forearms  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya By means of krosas previously spoken of the measure of the body of the gods is made  The body of the gods of the group of the Four Great Kings i is one fourth of a kroa with the thirtythree gods it is half a kroga the Be of Sakra is one krosa the body of the yamagods  j three fourth of a krosa the body of the tusitagods is one kroSa the body of the gods enjoying magical creations one kroga and one fourth of a kroga the body of the gods controlling enjoyments magically created by others is one kroga and a half These are the measures of the bodies of the gods of the realm of sexual passion the body of the brahmapurohitagods is one yojana the body of the gods of the great brahmas is one yojana and a half the body of the gods of limited radiance is two yojanas the body of the gods of unlimited radiance is four yojanas the body of the shining gods is eight yojanas the body of the gods of limited magnificence is sixteen yojanas the body of the gods of unlimited magnificence  is thirtytwo yojanas the body of the entirely magnificent gods is sixtyfour yojanas the body of the gods making thirst for merit is one hundred twentyfive yojanas the body of the gods having increase of merit is two hundred fifty yojanas the body of the gods having great fruit is five hundred yojanas the same is true for the body of the gods who do not conceptually identify the body of the not troubled gods is one thousand yojanas the body of the gods without ardour is two thousand yojanas the body of the clearly visible gods  These are said to be the measures of the bodies of Formations  the gods of the realm of form This is called limitation in matter uestion As the limitation in time has reviously been P said to be one ksana the other periods of time shall now be Pi spoken of Answer It is said that one hundred twenty ksanas are called a tatksana Sixty are called a lava Thirty are a muhirta One hundred twenty ksanas are called one tatksana sixty fatksanas are called one lava this is seven thousand two hundred ksanas thirty lavas are called one muhirta this is two hundred sixteen thousand ksanas It is said that thirty muhirtas are called day and night The realm of sexual passion is sometimes by day and night Higher it is calculated in kalpas Thirty muhurtas form a day and night this is six million four hundred eighty thousand ksanas The number of ksanas of day and night is already known the duration of life shall now be spoken of The realm of sexual passion is sometimes by day and night Higher it is calculated in kalpas The duration of life of beings of the realm of sexual passion exactly is calculated by means of the above mentioned day and night and makes the measure of the duration of life in  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the realm of sexual passion or it is calculated in kalpas The duration of life of humans in Jambudvipa either is unlimited or ten years of humans in Parvavideha it is two hundred fifty years of humans in Godaniya it is five hundred years of humans in Uttarakuru it is one thousand years Fifty years with humans js as a day and night with the gods of the group of the Four Great Kings Exactly according to this day thirty days form one month and twelve months form one year in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life of the gods of the group of the Four Great Kings is five hundred years this is nine million years with humans This is a day and night in the hell of waiting for life Exactly according to this day thirty days form one month and twelve months form one year in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life in the Hell of waiting for life is five hundred years One hundred years with humans is as a day and night with the thirtythree gods in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life with the thirtythree gods is one thousand years this is thirtysix million years with humans This is a day and night in the Great hell of the black string in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life in the Great hell of the black string is one thousand years Two hundred years with humans is as a day and night in the heaven of the yamagods in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life with the yamagods is two thousand years this is one hundred fortyfour million years with humans This is as a day and night in the Great hell of collision in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life in the Formations  Great hell of collision is two thousand years Four hundred years with humans is as a day and night with the tusitagods in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life with the tusitagods is four thousand years this is five hundred seventysix million years with humans This is as a day and night in the Rauravahell in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life in the Rauravahell is four thousand years Eight hundred years with humans is as a day and night with the gods enjoying magical creations in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life with the gods enjoying magical creations is eight thousand years this is twentythree billion four million years with humans This is as a day and night in the Mahdrauravahell in this way days months and years are calculated One thousand six hundred years with humans is as a day and night with the gods controlling enjoyments magically created by others in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life of the gods controlling enjoyments magically created by others is sixteen thousand years this is ninetytwo billion one hundred and six million years with humans This is as a day and night in the Great hell of burning in this way days months and years are calculated The duration of life in the Great hell of burning is sixteen thousand years The duration of life in the Great hell of all burning is half a kalpa The duration of life in the Great Avicihell is one kalpa The extreme long duration of life in the course animal birth also is one kalpa as Airavana  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The extreme long duration of life with ghosts is five hundred years Question The duration of life in the realm of sexual passion has already been spoken of How is it further in higher realms Answer Higher it is calculated in kalpas The duration of life of the gods of brahmas group  of the realm of form is half a kalpa the duration of life of the brahmapurohitagods is one kalpa the duration of life of the gods of the great brahmas is one kalpa and a half of the gods of limited radiance it is two kalpas of the gods of unlimited radiance it is four kalpas of the shining gods it is eight kalpas of the gods of limited magnificence it is sixteen kalpas of the gods of unlimited magnificence it is thirtytwo kalpas of the entirely magnificent gods it is sixtyfour kalpas of the gods making thirst for merit it is one hundred twentyfive kalpas of the gods having increase of merit it is two hundred fifty kalpas of the gods having great fruit it is five hundred kalpas the same applies to the gods who do not conceptually identify of the not troubled gods it is one thousand kalpas of the gods without ardour it is two thousand kalpas of the clearly visible gods it is four thousand kalpas of the clearvisioned gods it is eight thousand kalpas of the highest gods in form it is sixteen thousand kalpas In the realm of formlessness it is twenty thousand kalpas in the sphere of unlimited space forty thousand kalpas in the sphere of unlimited consciousness sixty thousand kalpas in the sphere of nothingness eighty thousand kalpas in the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification In all three realms there is intermediate death  only exFormations  ception made for Uttarakuru for the bodhisattva of the last body of the usitagods and for the gods who do not conceptually identify Question Why are these factors said to be formations Answer Many factors make one factor arise One can also make many arise The formations formed by conditions and the forming conditions should be known as the formations There is no factor that arises through its specific power one factor arises because of the power of many factors also many factors arise because of the power of one factor This is the way all conditioned factors are That is why it is said The formations formed by conditions and the forming conditions should be known as the formations Because they are the condition for formations and because they form formations formed by conditions are spoken of because of being formed by conditions and because of forming formations forming formations are spoken of Chapter Three Actions Composed by tle venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others That formations arise through the power of causes and conditions when proceeding has already been explained In the manifold births produced by these formations difference arises What is superior regarding this are only actions These actions shall now be spoken of Actions can ornament the worlds the courses and every residence That is why actions should be reflected on and being free from the world and liberation should be sought for Actions can ornament the worlds the courses and every residence In this way all five courses are ornamented through manifold actions arisen by manifold natures Because of action seed is made This has a sprout that arises Because of difference in action what arises is different just as when the seed is different the sprout is therefore different That is why actions should be reflected on and being  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya free from the world and liberation should be sought for Because actions are superior regarding rearising the one who wants to turn his back to transmigration should therefore observe well Question Who acts Answer  What is bodily verbal and mental accumulates action and abides in the forms of existence These actions make formations and these ornament manifold bodies Bodily action verbal action and mental action these three actions make manifold fruits arise Beings abide in existence at former time existence at death intermediate existence and existence at rearising  and accumulate actions Question How are the three actions established Is it because of the specific nature because of the basis or because of the arouser In case of the specific nature it should concern one form of action verbal action In case of the basis everything that depends on a body should also be one form of action bodily action In case of the arouser everything that is produced from the mind should also be one form of action mental action Answer It is so because of three things The specific nature concerns verbal action because speech exactly is action the basis concerns bodily action because action depends on the body because it is made by the body because it is combined with the body and because it is asActions  sociated with the body the arouser concerns mental action Although bodily action and verbal action are produced by mental action they do not receive their name together just as consciousness of the eye Question If it is as has been said then what do these actions make Answer These actions make formations and receive manifold bodies This is said to be the dominant fruit of all beings Outward enjoyment is called formation Such things as appearance and duration of life of beings is the fruit of their action Question Is it the manifold characteristic marks of the four elements is it the manifold characteristic marks of derivative form or is it the manifold characteristic marks of action The three forms Because they all have a cause of birth a cause of dependence an establishing cause a cause of support and an invigorating cause it is the manifold characteristic marks of the four elements because of the homogeneous cause it is the manifold characteristic marks of derivative form because of the cause of retribution it is the manifold characteristic marks of action Although the outward part is without cause of retribution it is so that when beings are doing active good conduct they acquire a good appearance and a good abode when they do misconduct they acquire a bad appearance and a bad abode Because actions are manifold also the inward and the outward part are manifold  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The characteristic marks of these actions shall now be spoken of concisely Bodily action should be known as twofold manifesting and unmanifesting The same applies to verbal action Mental action should be known as thinking  Unmanifesting is that this nature subsequently arises together with other forms of consciousness after bodily gesture has disappeared just as when defiled and neutral awarenesses are present when being wellordained being wellordained arises subsequently just as when good and neutral awarenesses are present with a person with bad moral precepts bad moral precepts arise subsequently  The same applies to verbal action Verbal action is twofold with the nature of being manifesting and the one of being unmanifesting as has been said previously Mental action should be known as thinking Mental action is with the specific nature of thinking Some want mental action to be with the nature of being unmanifesting This is not right because it is no matter and because of being threefold Being unmanifesting is also called being without greed is also called nonattachment is also called equanimity and is also called unmade Stating that it is no action because Actions  since there is not the name of what is made it is unmanifesting is not right Because being manifesting Even if what is good does not make what is bad and what is bad does not make what is good this still be called manifesting Just as abandoning the members of enlightenment is not because it is called abandoning abandoning the spiritual path because of abiding in other things abandoning is spoken of The same applies to this Moreover because of the cause that is made and because of the fruit that is made when seeing the cause the fruit is explained Just as the World honoured One said that something is matter because of configuration and type what is unmanifesting may be no matter but because what is manifesting is matter this is also called matter The same applies to this The five actions have already been spoken of The manifold differences between such actions shall now be spoken of  It should be known that what is manifesting is threefold good bad and neutral The same applies to mental action The rest is not said to be neutral Tt should be known that what is manifesting is threefold good bad and neutral What is bodily manifesting and what is verbal manifesting is threefold good bad and neutral Good is bodily and verbal movement of clean awarenesses such as giving and moral precepts bad is bodily and verbal movement of bad awarenesses such as taking life neutral is bodily and verbal move Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ment of neutral awarenesses The same applies to mental action Also mental action is threefold associated with good awarenesses it is good associated with bad awarenesses it is bad associated with neutral awarenesses it is neutral The rest is not said to be neutral The other two actions what i is bodily unmanifesting and what is verbal un manifesting is twofold good and bad they are not neutral Because neutral awarenesses  are weak and only strong awarenesses  can produce bodily and verbal action and they proceed together with other awarenesses to arise successively Just as grasping fragrant flowers with the hand although one lets them loose again resting fragrance arises successively It is not as when grasping such as wood or stone Question The five actions are already known Thinking is not with the nature of matter Answer  The nature of matter is defiled and undefi fled What is undefiled is in five stages What is obscured is bound to the one of form Matter All bodily action and verbal action is with the nature of matter because of depending on the four elements What is bodily manifesting is visible and is resisting what is verbal manifesting is invisible and is resisting Unmanifesting is both invisible and unresisting re Actions  Question Of how many forms is bodily and verbal action Answer Defiled and undefiled This matter is twofold defiled and undefiled Defiled is what is produced by defilement obscuredneutral and bad What is obscuredneutral is without retribution is dissociated from shamelessness and disregard and is what is produced as one fruit of defilement What is bad is with retribution is associated with shamelessness and disregard and is what is produced as two fruits of defilement What is undefiled is also twofold good and nonobscuredneutral What is good acquires the desired fruit This is also twofold  it is not arisen by retribution Strong awarenesses can produce bodily and verbal action Because awarenesses arisen by retribution are weak they do not produce anything That is why bodily and verbal ac tion are not with the nature of retribution If awarenesses arisen by retribution could produce bodily and verbal action this bodily and verbal action should also have to be this retribution but this is not so if it were awarenesses arisen by retribution they would not be called relating to deportment and craftsmanship That is why bodily and verbal action are no retribution Question In how many stages are they included Answer What is undefiled is in five stages The realm of sexual passion and the four trances This is a general explanation When good manifesting they only reach  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the first trance and no higher stages Question Why do what is good bodily and verbal manifesting reach the first trance and no higher stages Answer Because coarse awarenesses produce action that is bodily and verbal manifesting and these awarenesses are subtle because outwardly oriented awarenesses produce action that is manifesting and these awarenesses are oriented inwardly because initial thought and sustained thought produce action that is manifesting and these stages are without That which is good unmanifesting is with five stages the realm of sexual passion and the four trances In the trances there is what is unmanifesting restraint of trance and pure restraint Also what is nonobscuredneutral bodily manifesting is with five stages as has been said previously The difference is that what is manifesting of the realm of sexual passion is produced by awarenesses relating to deportment and the ones of craftsmanship and that what is manifesting of the realm of form is produced by awarenesses relating to deportment and is without awarenesses of craftsmanship Question That higher stages are without producing awarenesses has already been said How then is there what is manifesting Answer Because those awarenesses that produce through the power of the first trance are present there is production When stating that good ones should also be like this this is not right because when arising in a higher stage good awarenesses of lower stages are not present because of being weak Actions  What is obscured is bound to the one of form Obscuredneutral bodily and verbal action abide in the first trance of the realm of form not in higher stages because of being without producing awarenesses Since not arising in higher stages defiled awarenesses of lower Stages are present because of nonattachment They neither abide in defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion and in produced bodily and verbal action because defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion is absolutely bad That awarenesses to be abandoned through the path of vision do not produce bodily and verbal action shall be spoken of later in this chapter What is bad abides in the realm of sexual passion That which is bad among that which is defiled abides in the realm of sexual passion and not in the realm of form Because these are easily to be acquired with good awarenesses because of support of meditative attainment because of absence of shamelessness and disregard because of absence of unpleasant feeling What is bad feels the group of unpleasant feeling as retribution this is not in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness There is no action of the realm of form that receives the realm of sexual passion as retribution because the realms are different because causes and fruits interrupt the realms The specific nature seed and stages of bodily and of verbal action have already been spoken of The difference with restraint that is unmanifesting shall now be spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  Spoken of concisely there are three forms of moral precept that is unmanifesting the pure one the one through trance and moral precept of the code Spoken of concisely there are three forms of moral precept that is unmanifesting When moral precept that is unmanifesting is included in restraint spoken of concisely three forms should be known Question What are these Answer The pure one the one through trance and moral precept of the code This pure moral precept has one fruit with the path and proceeds together with the path the one of the seeker and the one of the adept Arisen through trance this moral precept of trance has one fruit with trance and proceeds together with trance right speech right action and right livelihood Right livelihood establishes bodily action and verbal action because there is no other body Bodily action and verbal action arise from absence of greed absence of hatred and understanding  What arises from absence of hatred and understanding is called right speech and right action what arises from absence of greed is called right livelihood Although the three roots of merit are in one awareness it is spoken of because of superiority as such formations as greed are as wind moves in timber and as the sound of syllables Moral precept of the code is siksa and sila proceed subsequently with the one who is ordained There also is restraint of abandoning This shall ot be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Sutra  that Actions  Question What of this bodily action and verbal action is no companion of awarenesses and what is a companion of awarenesses Answer  The one that is unmanifesting and abides in the realm of sexual passion The one that is manifesting depends on two forms of existence It should be known that it is not together with awarenesses The rest is said to be together with awarenesses The one that is unmanifesting of the realm of sexual passion is no companion of awarenesses after the act of entering into the order of monks also bad and neutral awarenesses proceed subsequently It also does not proceed subsequently to good bad and neutral awarenesses because of other characteristic marks moreover because of being covered with bad moral precepts because of depending on what is manifesting and because of being unfixed The one that is manifesting also is no companion of a warenesses in the realm of sexual passion and in the one of form because of depending on the body and because of not being one fruit with awarenesses  The rest is said to be together with awarenesses Restraint of trance and pure restraint are the rest These are a companion of awarenesses because they are one fruit with awarenesses and because of depending on awarenesses The establishing action has already been spoken of The accomplishment of moral precept shall now be spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya a  Pure restraint is accomplished with acquisition of the path the one that arises through trance with acquisition of trance the one of fully taking the moral precepts arises in the realm of sexual passion the pre the intermediate and the fundamental four trances With the one who goes to and the fruits of srotaapannaand of sakrdagaminship pure moral precept in one stage is accomplished with the one who goes to the fruit of andgaminship it either is accomplished in one stage or in six stages with the fruit of andgaminship it either is in three stages or up to six stages  with the arhaP it is in six stages with acquisition of trance With acquisition of trance restraint of trance is accomplished As it is with acquisition it is not when losing  Also this one is in six stages When getting ordained restraint of the code is accomplished This restraint only concerns humans of the realm of sexual passion because of taking no part in feeling  The accomplishment of moral precept has already been spoken of concisely The difference as to periods of time Actions  shall now be spoken of  When abiding in restraint of the code the one that is unmanifesting is to be known as permanently accomplished at the moment of proceeding and when ended the one of the past is not abandoned When abiding in restraint of the code the one that is unmanifesting is to be known as permanently accomplished at the moment of proceeding When restraint of the code is present moral precept that is unmanifesting is permanently accomplished Instant after instant what was not acquired yet is acquired And when ended the one of the past is not abandoned When abiding in restraint of the code what is unmanifesting is not abandoned when it has disappeared This is the accomplishment of the one of the past The fact of abandoning shall be spoken of later in this chapter  When there is the one that is manifesting one establishes it in the intermediate period in relation to what is manifesting at that very moment It should be known that when it has already ended and is not abandoned the one of the past is accomplished When there is the one that is manifesting one establishes it in the intermediate period in relation to what is manifesting at that very moment The intermediate period is the present At the very moment of seeking for the act of entering into the order of monks when abiding in what is bodily and verbal that which is bodily and verbal mani Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya festing is accomplished in the present Jt should be known that when it has already ended and is not abandoned the one of the past is accomplished At the very moment that what is manifesting has ended and is not abandoned the one that is manifesting of the past is accomplished It is not the one of the present because what is manifesting does not arise successively instant after instant  With acquisition of trance the one that is unmanifesting is accomplished when having disappeared and when future and the intermediate one when entering meditative attainment Also that which is manifesting is as has been said previously With acquisition of trance the one that is unmanifesting is accomplished when having disappeared and when future When trance is acquired restraint of trance of the past and of the future is accomplished With primary acquisition of trance transmigration without beginning has disappeared and the one of the past is now completely acquired And the intermediate one when entering meditative attainment To the one that is unmanifesting the same applies as to trance and to meditative attainment that are present because of arising subsequently to awarenesses Also that which is manifesting is as has been said previously Just as what is manifesting of the previous restraint of the code at the very moment of seeking for the act of entering into the order of monks the one of the present is accomplished and when already disappeared it is not abandoned at that very moment the one of the past Actions  is accomplished not the one of the present The same applies to what is manifesting for abiding in trance Question How is the one that is manifesting accomplished when arising in the realm of form Answer When the Worldhonoured One reached the realm of form the gods of the realm of form up to the highest gods in form paid homage to him turning in right direction At this very moment the one that is manifesting of the past is accomplished  It should be known that it is accomplished by all who have acquired the path when it had not arisen yet The intermediate path abides in awarenesses When ended and not abandoned it is the one of a previous period of time Jt should be known that it is accomplished by all who have acquired the path when it had not arisen yet All noble persons accomplish future pure restraint at all moments The intermediate path abides in awarenesses At the very moment the path is present pure restraint that is unmanifesting is accomplished When ended and not abandoned it is the one of a previous period of time That former period of time is the past When the one that is unmanifesting has already disappeared and is not abandoned the one of the past is accom plished  With bad action that is manifesting the one who has established moral precept  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya accomplished two As long as one is bound by these fetters It should be known that when these have already ended that has ended With bad action that is manifesting the one who has established moral precept accomplishes two When with the one who abides in restraint of the code in the one of trance and in the pure one that which is bad manifesting and unmanifesting that make proceeding increase is produced by means of bad fetters of extreme defilement this accomplishes that which is manifesting and that which is unmanifesting Because that which is bad is formed this is said to be not with nonattachment yet Question At how many moments are they accomplished Answer As long as one is bound by these fetters As long as one has not abandoned fetters yet one abides in nonrestraint Tt should be known that when these have already ended that has ended When these fetters have ended also what is manifesting and what is unmanifesting have ended  When abiding in nonrestraint that which is unmanifesting is accomplished in the intermediate period and one can experience the disliked fruit Or when having ended and not abandoned When abiding in nonrestraint that which is unmanifesting is accomplished in the intermediate period and one can experience the disliked fruit Abiding in nonrestraint is such as cutting meat Because what is Actions  bad unmanifesting arises instant after instant one always accomplishes that which is bad unmanifesting of the present instant after instant Or when having ended and not abandoned When what is unmanifesting has disappeared and is not aban doned then the one of the past is accomplished When abiding in what is manifesting during one ksana at exactly this moment the intermediate period is spoken of When having ended and not abandoned What is good is opposite to the above When abiding in what is manifesting during one ksana at exactly this moment the intermediate period is spoken of At the moment of accepting nonrestraint that which is manifesting of the present is accomplished when abiding in nonrestraint When having ended and not abandoned When what is manifesting has disappeared and is not lost the one of the past is accomplished not the one of the present because of not being successive What is good is opposite to the above As what has been said to be bad for abiding in restraint for abiding in nonrestraint it is said to be good a  With that which is manifesting of the one abiding in the intermediate position the one of the intermediate period is established When having ended and not abandoned Sometimes two Further also one Abiding in the intermediate position is neitherrestraintnornonrestraint When at the moment of experiencing that which is good awarenesses are disfavorable that which is good manifesting of the present is accomplished When at the moment of abiding in what is bad one is free from fetters of extreme defilement that which is bad manifesting of the present is accomplished When having ended and not abandoned When having disappeared and not abandoned that which is manifesting of the past is accomplished not the one of the present because of not arising successively Sometimes two When good serene awarenesses and bad fetters of extreme defilement are experienced this accomplishes that which is manifesting and that which is unmanifesting of the present Further also one That which is produced at the second ksana is only that which is unmanifesting of the present The same is true for the difference between present and past the difference between good and bad The two kinds of that which is manifesting either obscured or nonobscured both have not ended Such things as clean and unclean are all said to be for nonorigination The two kinds of that which is manifesting either obscured or nonobscured both have not ended With that which is obscuredneutral and that which is nonobscuredneutral manifesting the one of the past is not accomplished because of being produced from weak awareActions  nesses and because other powers are not strong At the moment of experiencing that which is manifesting of the present the one of the present is accomplished because of being accomplished at that ksana It is also said not to be so for that which is unmanifesting because that which is neutral is without both Such things as clean and unclean are all said to be for nonorigination That which is good bad obscuredneutral and nonobscuredneutral manifesting is all not accomplished in the future because when abiding in the future period of time there is no experiencing of that which is manifesting Question What are restraint and nonrestraint Answer Good and bad moral precept that flows and is accomplished successively is restraint and nonrestraint regarding all beings This restraint of the code is the act of entering into the order of monks Regarding all beings moral precept is never abandoned Either twelve kinds or twentyone kinds proceed subsequently Nonrestraint is abiding in nonrestraint regarding all beings bad moral precept is never abandoned Question What is abiding in nonrestraint Answer Twelve kinds abide in nonrestraint the socalled slaughterer of sheep raiser of chickens raiser of pigs or catcher of birds the fisher hunter thief executioner jailer and charmer of dragons the one who slaughters dogs and  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the game warden The one who slaughters sheep is the one who kills sheep Because of awarenesses of death when raising selling or killing  he is always called slaughterer of sheep The same applies to the one who raises chickens and to the one who raises pigs When the one who catches birds kills a bird it is for his own life The same applies to the fisher and to the hunter Thieves often do harmful things The executioner is the one who mainly kills people for his own life The jailer guards the prison for his own life The charmer of dragons controls happiness of the game of dragons and snakes for his own life The one who slaughters dogs is a candala The game warden is the head of the hunters of the royal house Although the slaughterer of sheep does not kill other beings he achieves nonrestraint regarding all beings If all beings appear before him as sheep malicious awarenesses are produced regarding all of them because in principle all beings constitute a sheep If in principle they would not constitute a sheep he also would have malicious awarenesses regarding them and therefore he achieves nonrestraint When abiding in awarenesses of loving kindness the conceptual identification of humanity is general It should be known that the same applies also to the other kinds of abiding in nonrestraint Whether king or alderman or judge when there are malicious awarenesses all are with the meaning of fall  Actions  ing in nonrestraint Question Which moments correspond to nonrestraint Answer acquisition of qd  Accepting restraint of the code is either lasting for life or for day and night Nonrestraint is lasting for life The two cannot be accepted cumulatively Accepting restraint of the code is either lasting for life or for day and night There are two forms of accepting restraint of the code the seven groups of the Buddhist order The seven groups of the Buddhist order are the bhiksu the bhiksuni the Siksamana the Sramanera the ramanerika the upasaka and the upasika day and night is that accepting the eight precepts of fasting has a twofold limitation in time day and night and lasting for life Question How further is nonrestraint Answer Nonrestraint is lasting for life Nonrestraint is lasting for life not for day and night Question Why does restraint acquire day and night and not nonrestraint Answer Because this one is without the nature of grasping There is no statement I accept nonrestraint for day and night because of being hateful In good restraint there is the nature of grasping because of happiness  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The two cannot be accepted cumulatively Restraint and nonrestraint cannot be accepted cumulatively When hoping for what is good or for what is bad during half a month one month or six months they are never abandoned The same applies to moral precept of day and night That there is a mistake is not right because there is not the nature of limitation The twofold limitation has already been spoken of previously Because of this reason nonrestraint is without accepting for day and night The reason of this has been spoken of already previously Question How is restraint of the code acquired Answer ad  Know that accepting moral precept of the code is through instruction by others According to minor middle and excessive awarenesses restraint in three classes is acquired Know that accepting moral precept of the code is through instruction by others Restraint of the code is acquired through instruction by others either the order or a person or the doctrine The order is the act of entering into the order of monks after the fourfold proposal to the community a person is the welcome the doctrine is Buddha and such as the five bhiksus Question How is restraint acquired Answer According to minor middle and excessive awarenesses restraint in three classes is acquired When minor awarenesses accept moral precept of the code lower moral precept is acquired because it is the fruit of minor awarenesses When with extreme effort that which is good is formed up to being free from desire of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness the seed of the three vehicles is sown The likeness of beings is successive and this still is a companion of the minor class When one is ordained with middle awarenesses middle restraint is acquired when with extreme effort that which is good is formed when moral precept is not abandoned nor misconduct is done this still is a companion of the middle class When one is ordaine with excessive awarenesses excessive restraint is acquired Up to the likeness of beings that is successive this still is a companion of the excessive ones Sometimes a young bhiksu acquires excessive restraint Although he further on is arhat he still accomplishes moral precept of minor awarenesses There is moral precept of the code from minor to middle and from middle to excessive first accepting restraint of the updsaka with minor awarenesses subsequently accepting restraint of the sramanera with middle awarenesses and eventually accepting restraint of the bhiksu   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya with excessive awarenesses This is the excessive one from the middle and the minor one and the minor and the middle one from the excessive one When abiding in restraint there is production of not all members and not all causes regarding all beings there is production of all members but not all causes regarding all beings there is production of all members  and all causes regarding all beings production of all causes but not all members regarding all beings does not exist These beings are the wriggling species The members a are noninjury up to undifferentiated talk causes are minor middle and excessive awarenesses Moreover it is said to be absence of greed absence of hatred and understanding There is production of not all members  and not all causes regarding all beings minor awarenesses that accept moral precept of the upasaka and minor awarenesses that accept moral precept of the sramaner pal There is production of all members but not all causes regarding all beings minor awarenesses that accept the three forms of moral precept or middle ones or excessive ones or two There is production of all members and all causes regarding all beings the three kinds of awarenesses that accept the three forms of moral precept That is why production of all causes but not all members regarding all beings does not exist When by means of primarily minor awarenesses moral precept of day and night is accepted subsequently with middle awarenesses moral precept of the updsaka is accepted and eventually with excessive awarenesses restraint of the Sramanera is accepted and one states that production of all causes but not all members regarding all beings  Actions  should be spoken of this meaning is not right because these have been said to be lasting for life Question With abiding in which awarenesses is restraint of the code acquired Answer Production of awarenesses of loving kindness regarding all beings When stating I accept regarding this and do not accept regarding that restraint is  hot acquired because of subsequent bad awarenesses Just as when stating I accept not to hunt animals because it is one part thisgood action does not achieve restraint Because moral precept of the code is general regarding everything that is possible and impossible for acquiring restraint If it were different from this restraint would have increase and decrease because what is possible can make what is impossible arise and what is impossible can make what is possible arise Which mistake is there in this way When not the moment of abandoning there should be abandoning of restraint of the code and abandoning should be achieved suddenly when abandoning there should be acquisition of restraint of the code without accepting because of the acquisition of what is acquired by what are beings regarding present aggregates j in the past or in the future That is why four sentences should be made There are aggregates elements and sense that acquire restraint of the code and no restraint of trance or the pure one production of former and later kinsmen and debt collection in the present There are aggregates elements and sense  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya that acquire restraint of trance and the pure one and no restraint of the code production of the fundamental paths of action in the past and in the future There are aggregates elements and sense that acquire restraint of the code and also restraint of trance and the pure one production of the fundamental paths of action in the present There are aggregats elements and sense that do not acquire restraint of the code restraint of trance or the pure one production of former and later kinsmen in the past and in the future Abandonment is not as achieving a moment of drought for growing such as grass because of being produced in relation to the growing of grass It is not right that the same said to be true for what is possible and what is impossible beings are with the same nature before and after growing such as grass later is not with that nature In this treatise parinirvana of the arhat is likewise spoken of because it later is not with that nature This meaning shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations  Question Restraint of the code has already been spoken of How is restraint of trance to be acquired Answer ad  With acquisition of good awarenesses in the realm of form restraint of trance is acquired When these are abandoned this one is also abandoned The pure one has six awarenesses With acquisition of good awarenesses in the realm of form restraint of trance is acquired When there is acActions  quisition of good awarenesses in the realm of form reStraint of trance is acquired because good awarenesses of the realm of form are permanently followed by moral precept Exception made for six awarenesses awarenesses of the group of three forms of consciousness of the first trance  awarenesses of wisdom through learning awarenesses that produce action and awarenesses of death because these are not concentrated and concentrated awarenesses that permanently are the companion of moral precept because awarenesses of the group of three forms of consciousness produce when oriented outwardly the same applies to awarenesses that produce action because awarenesses of wisdom through learning are produced with name as supporting object because awarenesses of the moment of dying are weak In the second trance third trance and fourth trance there are two forms of not concentrated awarenesses awarenesses of wisdom through learning and awarenesses of death Question Why is the realm of formlessness without moral precept Answer Because this one is without the nature of matter and moral precept is matter In it there is no matter because there is no nature of the four elements If it had the four elements there would have been moral precept In the realm of formlessness there are no four elements Moral precept is the antidote for bad moral precept and it is not the realm of formlessness that is the antidote for bad moral precept Bad moral precept is in the realm of sexual passion Because the realm of formlessness is with the four forms of remoteness the socalled remoteness in basis  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya remoteness in aspect remoteness in supporting object and remoteness in antidote Although all of the class of subsequent knowledge of the fundamental trances are not with the antidote that is abandoning they have the antidote that is support and the antidote that is removal because they are included in the fundamental trances The pretrance has the antidote that is abandoning When with knowledge of the law in relation to cessation and the one in relation to the path included in the fundamental trances there is no antidote that is detraction because of the pure supporting object Question How is it abandoned Answer When these are abandoned this one is also abandoned When awarenesses of the realm of form are lost also this restraint is lost because of depending on awarenesses Question How is pure restraint acquired Answer The pure one has six awarenesses Pure restraint is acquired simultaneously with awarenesses of six stages the pretrance up to the fourth trance because the six stages have the path of vision Because higher stages are without wide object it is no higher stage When arising free from beings depending on the pretrance the path of vision in one stage is developed and with the limit of higher realisation conventional knowledge of two stages is developed what is included in the pretrance and in the realm of sexual passion Up to arising free from beings depending on the fourth trance the path of vision of six stages is developed and with the Actions  limit of higher realisation conventional knowledge of seven stages is developed Question Why is the realm of formlessness without path of vision Answer Because there is no nature of patience and of knowledge of the law because there are no kugalaroots  because there is no moral precept because the realm of sexual passion is no supporting object Question What is the difference between restraint of trance and pure restraint Answer Restraint of trance is with impurity straint is with pureness Moreover it is said that restraint of trance is moral precept of the fundamental trances and that pure restraint is every pure moral precept Concerning this four sentences should be made Sometimes restraint of trance is not the pure one conventional moral precept of the fundamental trances Pure restraint is not the one of trance pure moral precept of the pretrance and of the intermediate trance Both the one of trance and pure restraint pure moral precept of the fundamental trances Neither the one of trance nor pure restraint conventional moral precept of the pretrance and of the intermediate trance The same applies to the four sentences about their acquisition pure re Question How is nonrestraint acquired Answer According to minor middle and excessive awarenesses bad moral precept in three classes arises Nonrestraint is acquired by activity and by agreement There are two reasons for acquisition of nonrestraint activity and agreement Activity is being born in a house of nonrestraint As long as no life was taken yet nonrestraint was not acquired yet When taking life nonrestraint is acquired Agreement is making this statement when being born in other houses I have to do this action for the own life This exactly is acquisition of nonrestraint Question Why is abiding in nonrestraint spoken of Is it because of completeness or of incompleteness Answer Some say that also incompleteness is called a biding in nonrestraint when being born in a house of nonrestraint Although ones nature is that one cannot speak taking life acquires the nature of bodily action and not of verbal action The Vaibhdsikas say that just as when restraint is incomplete it is not called abiding in restraint the same applies to nonrestraint but because the hope for what is bad is complete one is born in a house of nonrestraint Although ones nature is that one cannot speak one still acquires nonrestraint because the meaning of what is verbal is manifested by the body Question Does one when abiding in nonrestraint and accepting the factor of restraint of day and night at that very moment acquire restraint and is nonrestraint abanActions  doned and is this further when at daybreak the sun comes up abandoning restraint and again acquiring nonrestraint Answer Some say  that there is acquisition abandoning nonrestraint and acquiring restraint abandoning restraint and acquiring nonrestraint Some say that there is no acquisition When not taking life during the homogeneityforce nonrestraint is not acquired up to that the homogeneityforce has ended because of absence of activity and absence of agreement When nonrestraint is abandoned restraint is acquired and when restraint is abandoned nonrestraint is acquired this neither is nonrestraint  Question How is nonrestraint acquired Answer According to minor middle and excessive awarenesses bad moral precept in three classes arises When at first beings are killed with minor awarenesses and there is agreement absence of activity of inferior taking life is acquired and there is minor nonrestraint acquisition of what is included in nonrestraint regarding ali other beings When later there is taking life with middle and with exces sive awarenesses absence of activity of middle and excessive taking life is acquired Nonrestraint was acquired already previously The same applies to production of that which is excessive from that which is middle Regarding abiding in nonrestraint there is production of not all members and not all causes regarding all beings there is production of all members but not all causes regarding all beings there is production of not all members but all causes regarding all beings there is production of all causes and all members regarding all beings  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya There is production of not all members  and not all causes regarding all beings killing beings by minor fetters or by middle ones or by excessive ones and not doing other paths of action There is production of all members but not all causes regarding all beings killing beings by minor fetters up to frivolity not by middle ones or by excessive ones There is production of all causes but not all members regarding all beings killing beings by minor middle or excessive fetters and no other paths of action There is production of all causes and all members re garding all beings killing beings up to frivolity by minor middle and excessive fetters This speaks of incomplete nonrestraint and is not called abiding in nonrestraint This is saying that production of all members and all causes regarding all beings is unfixed Question At how many moments are the forms of restraint abandoned Answer  The code of discipline is to be abandoned at four moments with abandoning and at death when cutting away the roots of merit and with genesis of two distinctive marks The code of discipline is abandoned at four moments It should be known that the discipline that is the code is abandoned at four moments Question Which moments Actions  Answer With abandoning and at death when cutting away the roots of merit and with genesis of two distinctive marks When abandoning moral precept with disappearance of the homogeneityforce when cutting away the roots of merit and with genesis of two distinctive marks The one who keeps the precepts says At the moment the doctrine has gone down this is said to be moral precept the depository of rules of morality and karman that are all appeased The Abhidharmikas say that at the moment the doctrine has gone down restraint that had been accepted first is continued and is not abandoned restraint that had not been acquired yet is not acquired That is why it is said that everything is appeased Sometimes it is said that committing primary blameworthiness is called abandoning restraint This is not right When the one who abandons restraint committed a fundamental blameworthiness it is to be explained that when having returned to the secular life going forth should be achieved again because of already having abandoning restraint Buddha stated that being no bhiksu is because of not being the highest bhiksu This saying is not wrong The one who commits primary blameworthiness regarding restraint of the code is bhiksu but regarding pure restraint is no bhiksu  In restraint lasting for life there are four moments of abandoning restraint of fasting is abandoned at the moment the sun comes up Abiding in restraint and acting against restraint is negli gence in relation to moral precepts and is no abandoning of moral precept It should be known that these   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya persons abide in fully taking the moral precepts and are with negligence in relation to moral precepts When they regret this negligence in relation to moral precepts is abandoned and they exactly abide in fully taking the moral precepts  just as when a rich person has debts he is still called rich and is also called he who has debts after the debts have been paid back he is only called rich The same applies to this  It should be known that restraint of trance is abandoned at two moments when falling back with production of defilement and when arising in a higher or a lower stage Restraint of trance is abandoned at two moment Question Which moments Answer When falling back with production of defilement and when arising in a higher or a lower stage At the moment of falling back from trance this restraint is abandoned because of depending on trance And at the moment of arising in a higher one or arising in a lower one Pure restraint is said to be abandoned at three moments They should be known as falling back acquisition of a noble fruit and growing cf faculties Pure restraint is abandoned at three moments Question Which moments Answer They should be known as falling back acquisiActions  tion of a noble fruit and growing of faculties Falling back is losing superior qualities Acquisition of a fruit is acquisition of the fruit of srotaGpannaship up to of the fruit of arhatship Growing of faculties is the one given to faith who becomes the viewattainer the one conditionally liberated who becomes the steadfast one Question How is nonrestraint abandoned Answer  Nonrestraint is with four moments with the act of entering into the order of monks and at death with acquisition of trances and also with genesis of two distinctive marks Nonrestraint is abandoned at four moments at the moment of the act of entering into the order of monks at the moment of abandoning the homogeneityforce at the moment of acquisition of restraint of trance and at the moment of genesis of two distinctive marks Question If when abiding in nonrestraint taking life is abandoned is this called abandoning nonrestraint or not Answer It is called stopping the action When not accepting restraint it is not called abandoning because nonrestraint is not cured just as when not giving medicine and abandoning the cause of the disease the disease subsequently grows Question The moments for abandoning restraint and nonrestraint are already known Which are the moments for a Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya bandoning doing moral precepts and bad moral precepts by the one who is without both Answer Moral precepts and bad moral precepts of the one who is without both are abandoned at three moments rupture of the power stopping the engagement and abandoning the effort Rupture of the power is at the moment of wanting to do the things of moral precepts and bad moral precepts first making a limitation and stopping when transgressing the limitation just as when the power of a potters wheel is extreme it then stops Stopping the engagement is when uttering ones mind and reflecting on the words still not doing Abandoning the effort is appeasing bodily and verbal conduct When the one who is without both does active good conduct and misconduct that which is unmanifesting arises subsequently when the homogeneityforce has ended When making a vow not to bring reverencing to Buddha or never to eat first when praising and bringing homage with fragrant flowers and reverencing for many days when the homogeneityforce has ended that which is unmanifesting arises subsequently When making a vow not to do giving or never to eat even  Actions  one lump first then that which is unmanifesting arises subsequently when the homogeneityforce has ended Lasting for life I exactly do giving of few things to serve others then also in this case that which is unmanifesting arises subsequently when the homogeneityforce has ended When raising a pagoda or community houses for the samgha of the four directions or houses for the samgha or other houses or gardens and pools or bridges and boats in this way that which is unmanifesting is in all cases not abandoned because of three reasons either the engagement or the body or concrete things Also bad moral precepts is making a vow Day after day I constantly have to do things that are not conferring benefits regarding these enemies either one stroke or one bad word When this is lasting for life that which is bad unmanifesting arises subsequently Abandoning material activities has already been spoken of Immaterial ones shall now be spoken of The moments of abandoning good immaterial ones are cutting away falling back and arising in all stages Defiled ones only with nonattachment It should be known this is mental action The moments of abandoning good immaterial ones are cutting away falling back and arising in all stages Gooda impure immaterial factors are abandoned at three moments the moment of cutting away the roots of merit the moment of falling back and the moment of arising in all stages  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Defiled ones only with nonattachment Defiled immaterial factors are abandoned at the moment of nonattachment When the antidote for this class arises exactly this class is abandoned The specific nature and the accomplishment of actions have already been spoken of Such actions have been divided in manifold by the Worldhonoured One Now shall be explained  It should be known that when action is with an unpleasant fruit it is misconduct There further is mental misconduct covetousness malice and false view It should be known that when action is with an unpleasant fruit it is misconduct It should be known that when a disliked fruit of retribution arises with bodily and verbal action and with thinking it is misconduct Question Is only this misconduct Answer There further is mental misconduct Bad thinking is mental misconduct as has been seed previously There further is covetousness malice and false view What is contrary to this is active good conduct This is what the Most Superior One has said It is said that what is dominant regarding these is called the ten paths of action What is contrary to this is active good conduct This is what the Most Superior One has said Everything that is Actions  contrary to misconduct is active good conduct every bodily good action is bodily active good conduct every verbal good action is verbal active good conduct every mental good action noncovetousness absence of malice and right view is mental active good conduct Because obscured and nonobscuredneutral action are without retribution they neither are misconduct nor active good conduct When nonobscuredneutral craftsmanship acts as conduct it is said to be as has been explained The nonobscuredneutral and obscured one that are contrary to this are called noncraftsmanship Question Is all active good conduct and misconduct included in the paths of action Answer It is said that what is dominant regarding these is called the ten paths of action In this good conduct and misconduct dominant action that is superior is a path of action Dominance of active good conduct is said to be a good path of action dominance of misconduct is said to be a bad path of action When stating that it is unfixed this is not right because the fundamental paths of action are very dominant and suppress extremely because of extreme fear and because of accomplishment of things therefore that which is dominant is said to be a fundamental path of action Question What are these paths of action Answer Taking life up to false view This taking life shall now be spoken of When one conceptually identifies something to be a being and takes life having a mind of wanting to take life this is called taking life The same applies to taking what is not given and to improper sensitivity When one conceptually identifies something to be a being and takes life having a mind of wanting to take life Killing beings when wanting to kill other beings having produced the conceptual identification of being regarding fixed and unfixed beings is called manifesting and un manifesting or is further absolutely called unmanifesting This is taking life by bodily action It is not the case that this does not apply to the rest what is verbal of all selfdependent ones and the intention of wise recluses that kill when disliking because the specific nature of actions is different and because things are not accomplished If there were killing of beings with intention and without intention both should have to acquire the blameworthiness of killing That it is as touching fire and eating poison is not right because it is no comparison If grasping a knife with the hand and flinging a knife with the hand were to be with intention and without intention there should be touching fire without getting burnt If one could appease poison with medicine there should be no dying when drinking various poisons with intention and without intention This does not apply to taking life That is why it is no comparison It is further not right that regarding fire and poison the reason of not getting burnt and not dying is to be acquired Actions  but that in relation to taking life the reason of not killing is not to be acquired because of the acquisition of innocent awarenesses As for such as a knife appeasing and various medicine would have to be the reason for not getting burnt and for not dying the same would apply to innocent awarenesses as reason for not killing taking life with innocent awarenesses would be no taking life just as when grasping a knife or when not getting burnt when touching fire Question When one harms beings without intention is this then not with dying Answer It is with dying Although life is taken the blameworthiness of killing is not acquired because there are no wicked awarenesses When suppressing others the blameworthiness of killing is not acquired That this is no explanation is not right Because just as when someone else is not suppressed and not grasped evil and merit increase because of cutting away the roots of inerit and acquiring awarenesses of loving kindness of  having it oneself is called manifesting and unmanifesting or is absolutely called unmanifesting This is taking what is not given by bodily action Improper sensitivity is producing the conceptual identification of protectors in relation to such protectors as father and mother and behaving in a good or bad way in relation to those who are no protectors it is when improper and when at the wrong time Doing this even though it  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya should not be done is called manifesting and unmanifesting This is improper sensitivity by bodily action Speaking differently from the way one conceptually identifies double talk harsh words and frivolity  these are the verbal paths of action When such things as that which is seen or heard are overturned and when having the conceptual identification of producing covering when they are not overturned is called manifesting and unmanifesting or is absolutely called unmanifesting This is lying of verbal action Both bodily gesture and being silent are with the fact of the posadha also this is called lying When stating It is with the nature of bodily and of mental action this is not right because the nature of the actions is different because it would be verbal action attached to the body  It is to be compared with being attached to the body acting when letting the body go is bodily action It is to be compared with being with an eye  once later it is attached to the body and the growth acquires to be even It is to be compared with verbal acting of the moment of the act of entering into the order of monks bodily action is achieved It is to be compared with the moment of the act of entering into the order of monks either being silent or being without intention bodily action is achieved Double talk is the conceptual identification of wanting to break when broken or not broken or when already broken not letting reunite This is called manifesting and unmanifesting or is absolutely called unmanifesting This is double talk of verbal action Harsh words is with a disliking mind Either defiled or Actions  undefiled it is called manifesting and unmanifesting or it is absolutely called manifesting This is harsh words of verbal action Frivolity is words with bad awarenesses which are nonsensical at the wrong time and not corresponding to the doctrine as ignorance follows defilement as sound follows a syllable  Violence opposed to beings is called malice The conceptual identification of own in relation to things of someone else is covetousness False view is the view of worldly things Violence opposed to beings is called malice Having a wicked awareness of wanting to kill and wanting to beat regarding other beings is contrary to loving kindness and to compassion This is called malice The conceptual identification of own in relation to things of someone else is covetousness Loving the things of someone else and the conceptual identification of wanting to have them oneself is called covetousness This is all covetousness of the realm of sexual passion False view is the view of worldly things Making views of nonexistence regarding such as giving is called false view Question Which path of action is accomplished by whom Answer The paths of action of taking life harsh words and malice are all settled from hatred  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya They are produced with beings as substratum The paths of action of taking life harsh words and malice are all settled from hatred It should be known that taking life harsh words and malice are settled from hatred At the moment of accomplishment they have gether with hatred  to be to Question From which substratum do they arise Answer They are produced with beings as substratum These three paths of action should be known as produced from beings as substratum  Two bodily actions and covetousness are accomplished with greed They are all settled from greed They are produced from the base of enjoyment Two bodily actions and covetousness are accomplished with greed They are all settled from greed Taking what is not given improper sensitivity and covetousness these three paths of action should be known as accomplished with greed Question What are they further produced from Answer They are produced from the base of enjoyment These paths of action should be known as produced from the base of enjoyment The other verbal action there is is all settled with the three They are produced from name as substratum Actions  This is what the Wise One has said The other verbal action there is is all settled with the three Lying double talk and frivolity should be known as accomplished with greed hatred and noncognisance Question From which substratum are they further produced Answer They are produced from name as substratum This is what the Wise One has said These three verbal paths of action should be known as produced from name  False view is produced from the psychophysical complex It also is settled from noncognisance For all paths of action the three kinds are the preparation False view is produced from the psychophysical complex False view is produced from the psychophysical complex as substratum Question Whom is it accomplished by This false view should be known as accomplished from noncognisance Question Is the preparation of all paths of action accomplished as the fundamental ones or is there a difference Answer For all paths of action the three kinds are the preparation Greed hatred and noncognisance make the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya preparation for all ten bad paths of action Killing out of greed is killing because of such as skin flesh nerves and bones either for oneself or for ones friends Killing out of hatred is killing an enemy or a friend who has chosen the side of the enemy to let him have defame Killing out of noncognisance is stating that the reason of killing such as poisonous insects is blameless because they harm humans that the reason of killing such as all birds and wild animals is blameless because they are nutriment for humans In Persia it is said that just as when father and mother are old and with a bad disease one has to kill them the reason is blameless Taking what is not given out of greed is stealing things one needs for oneself or for someone else Taking what is not given out of hatred is stealing things of an enemy or a friend who has chosen the side of the enemy to let him have defame Taking what is not given out of delusion is as the brahmanas say All things that grow on earth have been given to the brdhmanas
