The gods of the ThirtyThree were sitting together in the Hall of Justice where they spoke very highly of youThey would like to see youI shall send a chariot harnessed with a thousand thoroughbreds for you great kingMount the heavenly chariot great king Do not waverKing Nimi consented in silenceThen knowing that the king had consented as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm Sakka vanished from King Nimi and reappeared among the ThirtyThree godsThen Sakka lord of gods addressed his charioteer MātaliCome dear Mātali harness the chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds Then go to King Nimi and sayGreat king this chariot has been sent for you by Sakka lord of godsMount the heavenly chariot great king Do not waverYes lord replied Mātali He did as Sakka asked and said to the kingGreat king this chariot has been sent for you by Sakka lord of godsMount the heavenly chariot great king Do not waverBut which way should we gothe way of those who experience the result of bad deeds or the way of those who experience the result of good deedsTake me both ways MātaliMātali brought King Nimi to the Hall of JusticeSakka saw King Nimi coming off in the distanceand said to himCome great kingWelcome great kingThe gods of the ThirtyThree who wanted to see you were sitting together in the Hall of Justice where they spoke very highly of youThe gods of the ThirtyThree would like to see youEnjoy divine glory among the godsEnough good sir Send me back to Mithila right awayThat way I shall justly treat brahmins and householders and people of town and countryAnd I shall observe the sabbath on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightThen Sakka lord of gods addressed his charioteer MātaliCome dear Mātali harness the chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds and send King Nimi back to Mithila right awayYes lord replied Mātali and did as Sakka askedAnd there King Nimi justly treated his people and observed the sabbathThen after many years many hundred years many thousand years had passed King Nimi addressed his barberMy dear barber when you see grey hairs growing on my head please tell meAnd all unfolded as beforeAnd having developed the four Brahmā meditations when his body broke up after death King Nimi was reborn in a good place a Brahmā realmBut King Nimi had a son named KaḷārajanakaHe didnt go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe broke that good practiceHe was their final mannanda you might thinkSurely King Makhādeva by whom that good practice was founded must have been someone else at that timeBut you should not see it like thisI myself was King Makhādeva at that timeI was the one who founded that good practicewhich was kept up by those who came afterBut that good practice doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the Brahmā realmBut now I have founded a good practice that does lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentAnd what is that good practiceIt is simply this noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionThis is the good practice I have now founded that leads to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentnanda I say to youYou all should keep up this good practice that I have founded Do not be my final menWhatever generation is current when such good practice is broken he is their final mannanda I say to youYou all should keep up this good practice that I have founded Do not be my final menThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesIncredible and AmazingSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen after the meal on return from almsround several senior mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among themIts incredible reverends its amazing the power and might of a Realized OneFor he is able to know the Buddhas of the past who have become completely extinguished cut off proliferation cut off the track finished off the cycle and transcended sufferingHe knows the caste they were born in and also their names clans conduct teaching wisdom meditation and freedomWhen they said this Venerable nanda saidThe Realized Ones are incredible reverends and they have incredible qualitiesTheyre amazing and they have amazing qualitiesBut this conversation among those mendicants was left unfinishedThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat went to the assembly hall sat down on the seat spread outand addressed the mendicantsMendicants what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinishedSo the mendicants told him what they had been talking about The Buddha saidWell then nanda say some more about the incredible and amazing qualities of the Realized OneSir I have heard and learned this in the presence of the BuddhaMindful and aware the being intent on awakening was reborn in the host of Joyful GodsThis I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaMindful and aware the being intent on awakening remained in the host of Joyful GodsThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaFor the whole of that life the being intent on awakening remained in the host of Joyful GodsThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaMindful and aware the being intent on awakening passed away from the host of Joyful Gods and was conceived in his mothers wombThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of Joyful Gods he is conceived in his mothers wombAnd thenin this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansan immeasurable magnificent light appears surpassing the glory of the godsEven in the boundless desolation of interstellar spaceso utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun so mighty and powerful makes no impressionan immeasurable magnificent light appears surpassing the glory of the godsAnd even the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light So it seems other sentient beings have been reborn hereAnd this galaxy shakes and rocks and trembles And an immeasurable magnificent light appears in the world surpassing the glory of the godsThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mothers belly four deities approach to guard the four directions so that no human or nonhuman or anyone at all shall harm the being intent on awakening or his motherThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mothers belly she becomes naturally ethical She refrains from killing living creatures stealing sexual misconduct lying and alcoholic drinks that cause negligenceThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mothers belly she no longer feels sexual desire for men and she cannot be violated by a man of lustful intentThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mothers belly she obtains the five kinds of sensual stimulation and amuses herself supplied and provided with themThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mothers belly no afflictions beset her Shes happy and free of bodily fatigue And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb complete with all his various parts not deficient in any facultySuppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworkedAnd it was strung with a thread of blue yellow red white or golden brownAnd someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and examine it This beryl gem is naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked And its strung with a thread of blue yellow red white or golden brownIn the same way when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mothers belly no afflictions beset her Shes happy and free of bodily fatigue And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb complete with all his various parts not deficient in any facultyThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaSeven days after the being intent on awakening is born his mother passes away and is reborn in the host of Joyful GodsThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaOther women carry the infant in the womb for nine or ten months before giving birthNot so the mother of the being intent on awakening She gives birth after exactly ten monthsThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaOther women give birth while sitting or lying downNot so the mother of the being intent on awakening She only gives birth standing upThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening emerges from his mothers womb gods receive him first then humansThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening emerges from his mothers womb before he reaches the ground four deities receive him and place him before his mother saying Rejoice O Queen An illustrious son is born to youThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening emerges from his mothers womb he emerges already clean unsoiled by waters mucus blood or any other kind of impurity pure and cleanSuppose a jeweltreasure was placed on a cloth from Kāsī The jewel would not soil the cloth nor would the cloth soil the jewelWhy is thatBecause of the cleanliness of them bothIn the same way when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mothers womb he emerges already clean unsoiled by waters mucus blood or any other kind of impurity pure and cleanThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening emerges from his mothers womb two streams of water appear in the sky one cool one warm for bathing the being intent on awakening and his motherThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaAs soon as hes born the being intent on awakening stands firm with his own feet on the groundFacing north he takes seven strides with a white parasol held above him surveys all quarters and makes this dramatic proclamation I am the foremost in the world I am the eldest in the world I am the first in the world This is my last rebirth Now there are no more future livesThis too I remember as an incredible quality of the BuddhaI have learned this in the presence of the BuddhaWhen the being intent on awakening emerges from his mothers womb thenin this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansan immeasurable magnificent light appears surpassing the glory of the godsEven in the boundless desolation of interstellar spaceso utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun so mighty and powerful makes no impressionan immeasurable magnificent light appears surpassing the glory of the godsAnd the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light So it seems other sentient beings have been reborn hereAnd this galaxy shakes and rocks and trembles And an immeasurable magnificent light appears in the world surpassing the glory of the godsThis too I remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the BuddhaWell then nanda you should also remember this as an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized OneIts that the Realized One knows feelings as they arise as they remain and as they go awayHe knows perceptions as they arise as they remain and as they go awayHe knows thoughts as they arise as they remain and as they go awayThis too you should remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized OneSir the Buddha knows feelings as they arise as they remain and as they go awayHe knows perceptions as they arise as they remain and as they go awayHe knows thoughts as they arise as they remain and as they go awayThis too I remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the BuddhaThats what nanda saidand the teacher approvedSatisfied those mendicants were happy with what Venerable nanda saidMiddle DiscoursesWith BakkulaSo I have heardAt one time Venerable Bakkula was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundThen the naked ascetic Kassapa who had been a friend of Bakkulas in the lay life approached him and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Venerable BakkulaReverend Bakkula how long has it been since you went forthIt has been eighty years reverendBut in these eighty years how many times have you had sexYou shouldnt ask me such a questionRather you should ask me thisBut in these eighty years how many times have sensual perceptions ever arisen in youIn these eighty years I dont recall that any sensual perception has ever arisen in meThis we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable BakkulaIn these eighty years I dont recall that any perception of ill will or cruelty has ever arisen in meThis too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable BakkulaIn these eighty years I dont recall that any thought of sensuality ill will or cruelty has ever arisen in meThis too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable BakkulaIn these eighty years I dont recall accepting a robe from a householder cutting a robe with a knife sewing a robe with a needle dying a robe sewing a robe during the robemaking ceremony looking for robe material for my companions in the spiritual life when they are making robes accepting an invitation having such a thoughtIf only someone would invite me sitting down inside a house eating inside a house getting caught up in the details of females appearance teaching a female even so much as a four line verse going to the nuns quarters teaching the nuns teaching the trainee nuns teaching the novice nuns giving the going forth giving the ordination giving dependence being looked after by a novice bathing in the sauna bathing with bath powder looking for a massage from my companions in the spiritual life being ill even for as long as it takes to pull a cows udder being presented with medicine even as much as a bit of yellow myrobalan leaning on a headrest preparing a cot This too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable BakkulaIn these eighty years I dont recall commencing the rainy season residence in the neighborhood of a villageThis too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable BakkulaReverend for seven days I ate the nations almsfood as a debtorThen on the eighth day I became enlightenedThis too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable BakkulaReverend Bakkula may I receive the going forth the ordination in this teaching and trainingAnd the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth the ordination in this teaching and trainingNot long after his ordination Venerable Kassapa living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfectedThen some time later Venerable Bakkula took a key and went from dwelling to dwelling sayingCome forth venerables come forth Today will be my final extinguishmentThis too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable BakkulaAnd Venerable Bakkula became fully extinguished while sitting right in the middle of the SaṅghaThis too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable BakkulaThere are these seven Factors of Awakening sisters which when developed and made much of a bhikkhu through the destruction of the pollutants without pollutants freed in mind freed through wisdom dwells having known having directly experienced and having attained Nibbāna himself in this very lifeThus I have heard this is the Discourse giving Nandakas Adviceat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīat Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas WoodThen Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī together with at least five hundred nunsapproached the Fortunate Oneand after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One she stood on one sideWhile standing on one side Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said this to the Fortunate OneThe Fortunate One should advise the nuns reverend Sirthe Fortunate One should instruct the nuns reverend Sirthe Fortunate One should give a Dhamma talk to the nuns reverend SirThen at that timeHerein Then at that timewhen the Fortunate One was requested by Mahāpajāpatī after sending the Community of nuns awayand gathering the Community of monkssaying Elder monks must instruct the nuns in turnshe gave this task to the CommunityIt was said regarding thisthe Elder monks were advising the nuns in turnsHerein In turns means in orderbut Venerable Nandaka did not wish to advise the nuns in his turnThen the Fortunate One addressed venerable nandaWhose turn is it today nanda to advise the nunsReverend Sir it is Nandakas turn to advise the nunsbut this venerable Nandaka does not wish to advise the nuns in his turnDoes not wish means when his own turn arrivedhaving gone to a faraway village or having begun his needlework and so onhe had him say This is surely an obstacle for himBut the Fortunate One gave this advice to the Elder Nandaka about taking turnsWhyFor when those nuns saw the Elder their mind became tranquil and clearTherefore they liked to accept his advice and liked to listen to his talk on DhammaTherefore the Fortunate One saidWhen Nandakas turn arrives he should give advicehe should give a Dhamma talk it means he should give advice in his turnBut if the Elder didnt take his turn why is thatIt seems that formerly those nuns had made up his harem when he had ruled over the Rose Apple IsleThe Elder knowing this through his knowledge of previous lives thoughtSitting in the midst of this Community of nunsand bringing forward similes and reasonsand being seen preaching the Dhammaif another monk who also had knowledge of previous lives looked at the reason for it he might think he could say Venerable Nandaka up to this day did not send off his concubinesthis venerable is resplendent when surrounded by his concubinesUnderstanding this matter the Elder did not take his turnBut understanding that it will be beneficial for the Elder to preach to those nuns it seemsthe Fortunate One then addressed the venerable NandakaIn order to understand when these nuns were previously in his harem there is this storyFormerly it seems in Bāraṇasī there were five hundred male slave and five hundred female slavesand as these thousand people did their work together they dwelt in one placeAt that time this Elder Nandaka was the senior male slave and Gotamī was the senior female slaveShe was the senior male slaves attendant and was wise and learnedThe thousand people who were making meritorious deeds acted togetherThen as the time for the Rains Retreat was approachingfive Independent Buddhas descended from mount Nandamūlaka to Isipatanawandered for alms in the city and after going back to Isipatanathought We will ask for manual labour in order to prepare the huts for spending the RainsHaving wrapped the robe they entered the city in the evening timeand stood at the gate of the treasurers houseThe chief female slave took a waterpot and while going to the reservoirsaw the Independent Buddhas entering the cityThe treasurer after hearing why they had comesaid You do not have our permission please goThen as they were leaving the citythe chief female slave took her waterpot and seeing them enteringput down the waterpot worshipped bent down lifted up her faceand asked Noble Ones having just entered the city why are you now leavingWe came to ask for manual labour to prepare the huts for spending the RainsDid you receive it venerable SirsWe did not receive it lay womanBut can these huts only be made by the powerfulVery well venerable Sirs we will build themtomorrow please accept our almsfood and after inviting themshe led them to the water took the waterpot placed it on the road going to the reservoirand as the other female slaves came and went she said Wait hereand when everyone had assembled she saidLadies will we always be doing slavework for anotheror do you wish to be free of this slaveryNoble Lady today itself we wish to be freeWhen these five Independent Buddhas didnt receive manual labourthey were invited by me for tomorrowThey replied Very welland informed their husbands when they returned from the forestThey also said Very well and assembled at the chief male slaves doorThen the chief female slave said to themTomorrow Dears you must give manual labour to the Independent Buddhasand she explained the advantages and even those who did not desire to do it at firstafter she had given them strong advice agreedOn the next day after giving food to the Independent Buddhasshe informed all the slavesThey entered the wilderness straight away assembled the timbergathered in hundreds made each of them a hut together with a walking meditation pathand placed suitable beds chairs and drinksand made the Independent Buddhas promise to spend the three monthsand prepared excellent almsfood for themFor those who were not able to take the opportunity to give on their daythe chief female slave took food from her own house and gave itAfter looking after them for three monthsthe chief female slave had each of the male slaves prepare clothand they made fivehundred coarse clothsThose thousand people having done good deeds togetherat the break up of the body were reborn in the world of the godsThose five hundred women from time to timewere reborn in the homes of the five hundred menand from time to time all were reborn in the home of the chief male slaveThen at one time the chief male slave having fallen from the world of the gods was reborn in a Princely familyThose five hundred goddesses after being reborn in very wealthy familiesruled over his home and then departedTransmigrating in this way at the time of our Fortunate Onethey were reborn in warrior families in the towns of Koliya and DevadahaAfter going forth the Elder Nandaka attained LiberationWhen the senior slaves daughter came of ageshe was established in the position of the Great King Suddhodanas Chief Queenand the rest of them went to the houses of the Princes sonsTheir husbands the five hundred Princes at the end of the string of quarrels about waterhaving heard the Teachers Dhamma teaching went forthand sent a message to those Princesses about their dissatisfactionThe Fortunate One led those who were dissatisfied to the Kuṇāla Lake established them in the fruit of StreamEntryand on the day of the Great Assembly established them in LiberationThe five hundred Princesses having renouncedwent forth in the presence of MahāpajāpatīSo much for venerable Nandaka and the nunsThis is how the story should be seenThen the Fortunate One addressed the venerable NandakaAdvise the nuns Nandaka instruct the nuns Nandakagive a Dhamma talk to the nuns brāhmaṇaVery well reverend Sir and venerable Nandaka having replied to the Fortunate Onedressed in the morning timeand picked up his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsAfter walking for alms in Sāvatthī and while returning from the almsround with his attendant after the mealhe approached the Kings monasteryThe Kings monastery means the monastery that was built by King Pasenadiin the southern part of the city of Sāvatthī in a position similar to the ThūpārāmaThose nuns saw the venerable Nandaka coming while still far awayand having seen him they prepared a seat and had water set up for washing the feetVenerable Nandaka sat down on the prepared seat and while sitting he washed his feetThose nuns worshipped venerable Nandakaand sat down on one sideWhile sitting on one side venerable Nandaka said this to those nunsSisters this will be a talk in which I put questionsherein when you understand you should say We understandwhen you dont understand you should say We dont understandBut if for you there is doubt or uncertainty

circumambulating venerable Nandakaapproached the Fortunate Oneand after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they stood on one sideWhile they were standing on one side the Fortunate One said this to the nunsDepart sisters it is timeThen those nuns after worshippingand circumambulating the Fortunate One departedThen not long after those nuns had departed the Fortunate One addressed the monkssaying Just as monks on the Uposatha day of the fifteenthfor most people there is no doubt or uncertaintyIs the moon deficient or is the moon fullfor then the moon is fulljust so monks those nunswere uplifted by the venerable Nandakas Dhamma preachingand their aspirations were fulfilledFor those five hundred nuns monksthe least nun is a StreamEntererA StreamEnterer the quality of the very least of all is a StreamEntererThe rest are OnceReturners NonReturners and those who Destroyed the PollutantsHow are their aspirations said to be fulfilledThrough the fulfilment of their intentionsTo the nun that this thought occurredWhen I am listening to the noble Nandakas teaching of Dhammaon that very seat I can realise StreamEntry she did realise StreamEntryTo her whom this thought occurred The fruit of OnceReturner the fruit of NonReturner and the fruit of the Destruction of the Pollutantsshe realised LiberationTherefore the Fortunate One said They were uplifted and their aspirations were fulfilledno longer subject to falling away sure and destined for Full AwakeningThe Fortunate One said thisand those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate OneIn the seventh story Amongst those who advise the nuns that is to say Nandakawhile this Elder monk was giving a talk on Dhammaaltogether five hundred nuns attained LiberationTherefore he became known as the foremost amongst those who advise the nunsThis is the exposition concerning the enquiry into his previous deedsAt the time of the Buddha Padumuttarahe was reborn in a good family house in Hasavatīand while listening to the Teachers teaching of the Dhammahe saw the Teacher set a certain monk aside as being foremost amongst those who advise the nunsdid a great deed and aspired for that position himselfHe did wholesome deeds for the rest of his life and being reborn amongst gods and humans onlywhen this Gotama Buddha arose after being conceived in a good family home in Sāvatthīwhen he was mature he heard the Teacher teach the Dhammagained faith and went forth in the presence of the Teacherdeveloped insight and attained Liberationand became one who had mastered knowledge of his former livesWithin the four assembliesit was said He was able to preach so as to capture everyones mindand he became known as Nandaka the Dhamma PreacherThe Realised One departed from the string of quarrels on the bank of the River Rohiṇīand discontent having arisen for the five hundred Sākiyan Princes who went forthhe took those monks and went to the Kuṇāla Lakeand understanding their spiritual anxiety because of the talk on the Kuṇāla Birth Storyand preaching a talk on the Four Truths he established them in the fruit of StreamEntryLater he preached the Discourse on the Great Assembly and made them attain the supreme fruit of LiberationThose Elders former wivessaying What do we have to do here nowhad but one thought and after approaching Mahāpajāpatī they requested the going forthIn the presence of that Elder nun all five hundred received the going forth and the higher ordinationIn his immediately past lifethey all had been the wives of the Elder Nandaka when he was a PrinceAt that time the Teacher said Monks must advise the nunsWhen the Elders turn arrivedknowing they were his wives in a previous existence he thoughtSitting in the midst of this Community of nunsand bringing forward similes and reasonsand being seen preaching the Dhammaif another monk who also had knowledge of previous lives looked at the reason for ithe might think he could say Venerable Nandaka up to this day did not send off his concubinesthis venerable is resplendent when surrounded by his concubinesTherefore when it came to his turn he sent another monkBut those five hundred nuns desired the Elders adviceFor this reason the Fortunate Onesaid to the Elder monk When your turn arrives without sending anotherhaving gone yourself advise the Community of nunsHe was unable to refuse the Teachers speechand when his turn arrived on the fourteenth he gave advice to the Community of nunsand with a Dhamma teaching elaborating on the six sense sphereshe established all the nuns in the fruit of StreamEntryThose nuns being uplifted by the Elders Dhamma teachingwent into the presence of the Teacher and informed him of their penetration of the DhammaThe Teacher thought With what Dhamma teachingwill these nuns attain the further Paths and Fruitsand reflecting further Listening again to Nandakas Dhamma teaching surelythese five hundred will attain LiberationHaving seen that on another day he sent them into the Elders presence to listen to the Dhammaand on that day they listened to Dhamma and attained LiberationOn that day the Fortunate One came into the presence of those nunshe understood they had attained the fruition state with that Dhamma teachingand he said Nandakas Dhamma teaching yesterday was like the moon on the fourteenth daytoday it is like the moon on the fifteenth dayand having given his approval to the Elder monk for that reason as the occasion had arisenhe placed this Elder monk in the foremost position amongst those who advise the nunsTranslationTranslationTo the one who points out the past said venerable Posālawho is perfect in everything I have come in need with a questionFor the one in whom perception of form has endedwho on

has come to rest Upasīva said the Fortunate Onethere is nothing by which they can speak of himwhen everything has been completely removedall the pathways for speech are also completely removedFrom the delightful city of the Kosalansone who wanted to have no possessions a brahmin perfect in the VedasIn the locality of Assaka and near to Mūḷakaclose to the bank of the Godhāvari he lived on gleanings and fruitIn the vicinity of the river there was a large villageand with the income that arose from that he offered a great sacrificeWhen that great sacrifice had been given he entered his hermitage againand when he had reentered it another brahmin came along he had sore feet and was thirsty with dirty teeth and dust on his head and after approaching the first brahmin he begged for five hundred coinsAfter seeing him Bāvari invited him to take a seatand he asked after his happiness and welfare and this is the word he spokeWhatever kind of gift I had all that has been given away by meplease excuse me brahmin I do not have the five hundredIf your honour will not give me what I am begging forthen within seven days may your head split into seven piecesHaving made a scene the dishonest man proclaimed this fearful thingAfter hearing this word of his Bāvari became miserableGoing without food he dried up and was affected by the dart of griefand when his heart was like that his mind did not delight in meditationHaving seen him terrified and miserable a Godapproached Bāvari and this is the word he spokeHe does not know the head  he is a dishonest man who wants wealthHe does not have knowledge about the head or headsplittingBut now your honour knows Please explain this to me when askedthe head and headsplitting may we hear that word of yoursI also do not know about this I do not have this knowledge hereThe head and headsplitting Indeed only VictorsThen who knows about the head and headsplittingon the face of the earth O God please explain this to meFrom out of the city of Kapilavatthu a world leader has renouncedhe is of king Okkākas line a Sakyans son a LightMakerHe is a Sambuddha brahmin in everything he is perfecthaving attained all deep knowledges and strengths endowed with Vision regarding all thingshe has come to the end of all actions in the end of all clinging he is freedHe is the Buddha in the world the Fortunate One the Visionary who teaches Teachingafter going there you can ask him about it he will explain it to youHaving heard the word Sambuddha Bāvari became elatedthen his grief became but little and he received great happinessBāvari uplifted and elatedenthusiastically asked that GodIn which village or again in which townin which country is the lord of the worldWhere having gone to can we revere the Sambuddha the Supreme Human BeingThe Victor is in the Kosalans city Sāvatthīhe has much wisdom excellent and great intelligencethat Sakyans son who is free from burden and pollutantthat Bull of a Man has understanding of headsplittingSo then the brahmin addressed his students who were perfect in the the VedasCome young men and I shall explain please listen to this word of mineHe whose manifestation in the world is always exceptionalhas now arisen in the world renowned as one called a SambuddhaHaving gone quickly to Sāvatthī you can see the Supreme Human BeingHaving seen him how will we know that he is the Buddha O brahminYou must tell us who do not know how we can know it is himThere has come down to us in the the Vedas the marks of a Great Manthey are explained as thirtytwo complete in regular orderFor whoever has on his limbs the marks of a Great Manthere can be just two destinies for a third cannot be foundIf he lives in a house when he has been victorious over this earthwithout a stick or a sword he will rule according to the TeachingBut if he goes forth from the house to the houseless lifehe becomes a CoverRemover a Sambuddha a Worthy One unexcelledAbout my birth family and marks lore students and other thingsabout the head and headsplitting you must ask in your mindIf he should be a Buddha one who sees without obstructionthe questions that are asked in your mind he will answer by way of speechAfter hearing Bāvaris words the sixteen brahmin studentsAjita Tissa Metteyya Puṇṇaka also MettagūDhotaka and Upasīva Nanda and also Hemakathe two Todeyya and Kappa and Jatukaṇṇī the one who is wiseBhadrāvudha and Udaya and also the brahmin PosālaMogharāja the intelligent one and the great seer Piṅgiyaeach one with his own groupmeditators delighting in meditationafter worshipping Bāvari and circumambulating himthey all wearing mattedhair and deerskinsFrom Mūḷaka to Patiṭṭhāna first then on to Mahissatito Ujjenī and Gonaddha to Vedisa and to the place called

shrineJust like a thirsty man to cool water or like a trader to great gainlike one scorched by the heat to shade quickly he climbed the mountainNow at that time the Fortunate One was in front of the community of monksteaching the Teaching to the monks roaring like a lion in a forestAjita saw the Sambuddha brilliant like the hundredrayed sunlike the moon which has reached fullness on the fifteenth day of the monthand after seeing on his limbs the characteristics in their fullnessstanding cheerfully on one side he asked a question in his mindSpeak and point out his birth speak of his family and marksspeak of his perfection in the Vedas how many does the brahmin schoolOne hundred and twenty years his age his family is Bāvarithree marks are on his limbs he is perfect in the three VedasIn the marks and the traditions with the glossaries and the ritualhe schools five hundred in his own teaching he is perfectYour investigation of Bāvaris marks O One Supreme among MenO cravingcutter make that clear so that we are not left doubtingHe can cover his face with his tongue there is hair between his eyebrowswhat is covered by a cloth is ensheathed know it is so young manNot hearing any question but having heard the questions answeredall the people were enthusiastic and raised their hands thinkingNow who was it a God or a Brahma or Inda the lord of Sujāwho asked those questions with the mind To whom did he make replyAbout the head and headsplitting Bāvari asks this questionplease explain that O Fortunate One please remove our doubts O seerKnow ignorance is called the head and understanding is the headsplitterjoined with confidence mindfulness concentration desire and energyThen with great enthusiasm being resolute the young manhaving put his deerskin on one shoulder fell placing his head at the Buddhas feetThe honourable brahmin Bāvari and his students dear Sirelated in heart and happy in mind worships your feet O Visionary OneMay the brahmin Bāvari together with his students be happyAnd may you also be happy May you live for a long time young manAll of the doubts that Bāvari or you or anyone else hashaving received leave ask whatever you long to know in the mindHaving received leave from the Sambuddha sitting with hands raised in reverenceAjita asked the Realised One the first question in that placeHaving heard of a hero who has no desire for sense pleasures said venerable JatukaṇṇīI came to ask that desireless one who is beyond the floodplease speak of the state of peace conascenteyeas it really is Fortunate One please tell me thisthe Fortunate One moves about having vanquished sense desiresas the splendid sun vanquishes the earth with its splendourTo me of little wisdom O One of Great Wisdomexplain the Teaching so that I may knowthe complete giving up of birth and old age hereRemove the greed for sense pleasures Jatukaṇṇī said the Fortunate Onelet there be nothing found in you that has been taken up or put downYou should erase that which is past and have nothing for the futureif you take up nothing in the present you will live peacefullyFor one altogether without greed for mind and body O brahminno pollutants are found

unsure of it and she exchanges it for something else she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionIf it is for a specific purpose but she does not perceive that it is and she exchanges it for something else she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionWhen she receives in return what had been relinquished it is to be used in accordance with the intention

Migāras grandson SāḷhaWhen the fetus got large she concealed her conditionAnd when the fetus was fully grown she disrobed and gave birthThe nuns said to the nun ThullanandāVenerable Sundarīnandā gave birth shortly after disrobingCould it be that she was pregnant while she was still a nunYes VenerablesBut Venerable when you knew that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion why didnt you either confront her yourself or tell a group of nunsHer disrepute is my disrepute her infamy is my infamy her notoriety is my notoriety her loss is my lossWhy would I tell others of my own disrepute infamy notoriety and lossThe nuns of few desires complained and criticized herHow could Venerable Thullanandā knowing that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion neither confront her herself nor tell a group of nunsThen those nuns told the monks what had happenedand the monks in turn told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that the nun Thullanandā acted like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized her How could the nun Thullanandā knowing that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion neither confront her herself nor tell a group of nunsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks the nuns should recite this training rule like thisIf a nun knows that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion but she neither confronts her herself nor tells a group of nuns and afterwardwhether that nun remains or has died or has been expelled or has convertedshe says Venerables

on offenses entailing expulsionThe training rule on above the kneesHomage to the Buddha the Perfected One the fully Awakened OneAt one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryMigāras grandson Sāḷha wanted to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nunsHe went to the nuns and saidVenerables I wish to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nunsPlease give me the nun in charge of building workAt that time four sisters had gone forth as nunsNandā Nandavatī Sundarīnandā and ThullanandāOf these the nun Sundarīnandā had gone forth when she was young and she was beautiful intelligent skilled and diligent and she possessed good judgment in regard to doing and arranging things wellAfter appointing Sundarīnandā to be in charge of building work the Sangha made her work with SāḷhaAs a consequence of this Sundarīnandā would often go to Sāḷhas house to ask for toolswhether an adz a hatchet an ax a spade or a chiselAnd Sāḷha would often go to the nuns dwelling place to find out about the progress of the building workAnd because they saw each other frequently they fell in loveBut because Sāḷha could not find any opportunity to be intimate with Sundarīnandā he invited the Sangha of nuns for a mealWhen preparing the seats in the dining hall he counted the number of nuns senior to Venerable Sundarīnandā and placed their seats to one side and he counted the number of nuns junior to her and placed their seat on the other sideHe then placed Sundarīnandās seat in a concealed spot in a corner In this way the senior nuns would think she was seated close to the junior ones and the junior nuns would think she was seated close to the senior onesSoon afterwards he informed the Sangha that the meal was readySundarīnandā thought Sāḷha hasnt prepared a meal for the Sangha as a service but because he wants to be intimate with meIf I go I will get into trouble She then told a nun who was her pupil Go and bring back almsfood for meIf anyone asks about me tell them Im sickYes Venerable she repliedSoon afterwards Sāḷha was standing outside the gateway of his house repeatedly inquiring after SundarīnandāVenerables wheres Venerable SundarīnandāThe nun who was Sundarīnandās pupil told him Shes sick Im bringing her almsfoodSāḷha thought I invited the Sangha of nuns because of Sundarīnandāand after telling the people there to serve the meal to the Sangha of nuns he left for the nuns dwelling placeJust then Sundarīnandā was standing outside the monastery gateway longing for SāḷhaWhen she saw him coming she entered the dwelling put on her upper robe so that it covered her head and lay down on her bedSāḷha approached her and said Venerable whats wrong with you Why are you lying downThats what happens when you desire someone who doesnt desire you in returnWhat do you mean I dont desire youI just couldnt find an opportunity to be intimate with youAnd both having lust he made physical contact with SundarīnandāJust then a nun who was weak from old age and had problems with her feet was lying down not far from SundarīnandāShe saw how Sāḷha made physical contact with Sundarīnandā while both of them had lustShe complained and criticized her How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her when they both had lustThat nun then told the nuns what had happenedThe nuns of few desires who had a sense of conscience and who were contented afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training complained and criticized herHow could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her when they both had lustThose nuns then told the monksAnd the monks of few desires who had a sense of conscience and who were contented afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training criticized her in the same wayAfter criticizing the nun Sundarīnandā in many ways they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that the nun Sundarīnandā acted like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized herIts not suitable monks its not proper for the nun Sundarīnandā its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow could Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her when they both had lustThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsAnd the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain in dispraise of great desires discontent socializing and laziness but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain of fewness of wishes contentment selfelimination ascetic practices serenity reduction in things and of being energetic After giving a teaching on what is right and proper he addressed the monksWell then monks I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasonsfor the wellbeing of the Sangha for the comfort of the Sangha for the restraint of bad nuns for the ease of good nuns for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives to give rise to confidence in those without it to increase the confidence of those who have it for the longevity of the true Teaching and for supporting the trainingAnd monks the nuns should recite this training rule like thisIf a lustful nun consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her to touching her to taking hold of her to
