He should be told Do not put it like thatFor if that were so then contemplation of the body etc would also have quadruple and quintuple jhāna But there is not even the first jhāna in the contemplation of feeling or in the other twoSo do not misrepresent the Blessed One by adherence to the letter The Enlightened Ones word is profound and should be taken as it is intended giving due weight to the teachersAnd the intention here is this The Blessed One it seems was asked to teach the Dhamma thus Venerable sir it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that having heard the Blessed Ones Dhamma I may dwell alone withdrawn diligent ardent and selfexerted  But the Blessed One had no confidence yet in that bhikkhu since although he had already heard the Dhamma he had nevertheless gone on living there instead of going to do the ascetics duties and the Blessed One expressed his lack of confidence thus So too some misguided men merely question me and when the Dhamma is expounded to them they still fancy that they need not follow me  However the bhikkhu had the potentiality for the attainment of Arahantship and so he advised him again saying Therefore bhikkhu you should train thus My mind shall be steadied quite steadied internally and arisen evil unprofitable things shall not obsess my mind and remainYou should train thus But what is stated in that advice is basic concentration consisting in mere unification of mind internally in the sense of in oneself After that he told him about its development by means of lovingkindness in order to show that he should not rest content with just that much but should intensify his basic concentration in this way As soon as your mind has become steadied quite steadied internally bhikkhu and arisen evil unprofitable things do not obsess your mind and remainYou should train thus bhikkhu  after which he said further As soon as this concentration has been thus developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practiced then you should develop this concentration with applied thought and sustained thought  and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity The meaning is this Bhikkhu when this basic concentration has been developed by you by means of lovingkindness then instead of resting content with just that much you should make this basic concentration reach quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other objects by further developing it in the way beginning With applied thought And having spoken thus pointing out that you should effect its further development by means of quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other objects this further development being preceded by the remaining divine abidings of compassion and the rest he further said As soon as this concentration has been thus developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practicedHaving thus shown how its further development by means of quadruple and quintuple jhāna is preceded by lovingkindness etc and having told him As soon as this concentration has been developed by you bhikkhu and frequently practiced then you should train thus I shall dwell contemplating the body as a body etc he concluded the discourse with Arahantship as its culmination thus As soon as this concentration has been developed by you bhikkhu completely developed then wherever you go you will go in comfort wherever you stand you will stand in comfort wherever you sit you will sit in comfort wherever you make your couch you will do so in comfort From that it must be understood that the three beginning with lovingkindness have only triplequadruple jhāna and that equanimity has only the single remaining jhānaAnd they are expounded in the same way in the Abhidhamma as wellThe Highest Limit of Each  And while they are twofold by way of the triplequadruple jhāna and the single remaining jhāna still they should be understood to be distinguishable in each caseby a different efficacy consisting in having beauty as the highest etc For they are so described in the Haliddavasana SuttaBut why are they described in this wayBecause each is the respective basic support for eachFor beings are unrepulsive to one who abides in loving kindnessBeing familiar with the unrepulsive aspect when he applies his mind to unrepulsive pure colours such as blueblack his mind enters into them without difficultySo lovingkindness is the basic support for the liberation by the beautiful  but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having beauty as the highestOne who abides in compassion has come to know thoroughly the danger in materiality since compassion is aroused in him when he sees the suffering of beings that has as its material sign beating with sticks and so onSo well knowing the danger in materiality when he removes whichever kasiṇa concept he was contemplating whether that of the earth kasiṇa or another and applies his mind to the space that remains  which is the escape from materiality then his mind enters into that space without difficultySo compassion is the basic support for the sphere of boundless space but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the base consisting of boundless space as the highestWhen he abides in gladness his mind becomes familiar with apprehending consciousness since gladness is aroused in him when he sees beings consciousness arisen in the form of rejoicing over some reason for joyThen when he surmounts the sphere of boundless space that he had already attained in due course and applies his mind to the consciousness that had as its object the sign of space his mind enters into it without difficulty So gladness is the basic support for the base consisting of boundless consciousness but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the sphere of boundless consciousness as the highestWhen he abides in equanimity his mind becomes skilled in appre hending what is nonexistent because his mind has been diverted from apprehension of the ultimate sense namely pleasure pain etc owing to having no further concern such as May beings be happy or May they be released from pain or May they not lose the success they have obtainedSo equanimity is the basic support for the base consisting of nothingness but not for what is beyond that That is why it is called having the base consisting of nothingness as the highestWhen he has understood thus that the special efficacy of each resides respectively in having beauty as the highest etc he should besides understand how they bring to perfection all the good states beginning with givingFor the Great Beings minds retain their balance by giving preference to beings welfare by dislike of beings suffering by desire for the various successes achieved by beings to last and by impartiality towards all beings And to all beings they give gifts which are a source a pleasure without discriminating thus It must be given to this one it must not be given to this oneAnd in order to avoid doing harm to beings they undertake the precepts of virtueThey practice renunciation for the purpose of perfecting their virtueThey cleanse their understanding for the purpose of nonconfusion about what is good and bad for beingsThey constantly arouse energy having beings welfare and happiness at heartWhen they have acquired heroic fortitude through supreme energy they become patient with beings many kinds of faultsThey do not deceive when promising We shall give you this we shall do this for youThey are unshakably resolute upon beings welfare and happinessThrough unshakable lovingkindness they place them first before themselvesThrough equanimity they expect no reward Having thus fulfilled the ten perfections these divine abidings then perfect all the good states classed as the ten powers the four kinds of fearlessness the six kinds of knowledge not shared by disciples and the eighteen states of the Enlightened One This is how they bring to perfection all the good states beginning with givingin the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationwhile the others have the respective purposes of warding off cruelty aversion  and greed or resentmentFor this is the escape from ill will friends that is to say the minddeliverance of lovingkindness For this is the escape from cruelty friends that is to say the minddeliverance of compassion For this is the escape from boredom friends that is to say the minddeliverance of gladness For this is the escape from greed friends that is to say the minddeliverance of equanimity for it is not possible to practice compassion and be cruel to breathing things simultaneouslyfor it is not possible to look on with equanimity and be inflamed with greed or be resentful simultaneouslyWhen his mind has become malleable and wieldy with respect to that he can then delimit two dwellingsand next on seeing or hearing or judging that beings whose welfare has been thus wished for are at the mercy of suffering they should be practiced as the promotion of the aspect of the removal of sufferingand compassion has the promotion of the aspect of the removal of suffering as its characteristicfor their scope is measureless beingsAll of them however occur with a measureless scopeand then on seeing the success of those whose welfare has been wished for and the removal of whose suffering has been wished for they should be practiced as being gladand gladness has the act of gladdening as its characteristicbut after that there is nothing to be done and so they should be practiced as the neutral aspect in other words the state of an onlookerand equanimity has the promotion of the aspect of neutrality as its characteristictherefore since their respective aims are the aspect of welfare etc their order should be understood to correspond with loving kindness stated first then compassion gladness and equanimitytheir order to their aim Immeasurablethen you should train thus The mind deliverance of lovingkindness will be developed by me frequently practiced made the vehicle made the foundation established consolidated and properly undertakenthen you should train thus The minddeliverance of compassion will be developed by me   etcaccording as it is said Bhikkhus the minddeliverance of lovingkindness has beauty as the highest I say The minddeliverance of compassion has the base consisting of boundless space as the highest I say The minddeliverance of gladness has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as the highest I say The mind deliverance of equanimity has the base consisting of nothingness as the highest I say Now his mind has become used to being diverted from apprehension of what is existent in the ultimate sense and his mind has become skilled in apprehending what is nonexistent in the ultimate sense  and so when he surmounts the base consisting of boundless consciousness attained in due course and applies his mind to the absence which is nonexistent as to individual essence of consciousness which is a reality in the ultimate sense then his mind enters into that without difficulty The ninth chaptercalled The Description of the Divine Abidingsin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peopleGreed is the near enemy of lovingkindness since it is able to corrupt owing to its similarity like an enemy masquerading as a friendMere unification of the mind the kind of concentrating that is undeveloped and just obtained by one in pursuit of developmentThat is called basic concentration however since it is the basic reason for the kinds of more distinguished concentration to be mentioned later in this connectionFor the first unification of the mind is recognized as momentary concentration here as it is in the first of the two successive descriptions Tireless energy was aroused in me  my mind was concentrated and unified followed by Quite secluded from sense desires  This mere unification of the mind is intended as momentary concentration as in the passage beginning I internally settled steadied unified and concentrated my mind Thus developed just as a fire started with wood and banked up with cowdung dust etc although it arrives at the state of a cowdung fire etc is nevertheless called after the original fire that was started with the wood so too it is the basic concentration that is spoken of here taking it as banked up with loving kindness and so onIn other objects means in such objects as the earth kasiṇaBecause it has no more concern  because it has no further act of being concerned by hoping for their pleasure etc thus May they be happyThe development of lovingkindness etc occurring as it does in the form of hope for beings pleasure etc makes them its object by directing the mind to apprehension of what is existent in the ultimate sense ie pleasure etc But development of equanimity instead of occurring like that makes beings its object by simply looking onBut does not the divine abiding of equanimity itself too make beings its object by directing the mind to apprehension of what is existent in the ultimate sense because of the words Beings are owners of their deeds Whose if not theirs is the choice by which they will become happy  Certainly that is so But that is in the prior stage of development of equanimity When it has reached its culmination it makes beings its object by simply looking on So its occurrence is specially occupied with what is nonexistent in the ultimate sense ie beings which are a conceptAnd so skill in apprehending the nonexistent should be understood as avoidance of bewilderment due to misrepresentation in apprehension of beings which avoidance of bewilderment has reached absorptionI beg the opportunity to confess all my trangressionsI beg the opportunity to confess all my trangressions both serious and slightVenerable Sir I beg the opportunity to confess my trangressions in your presencecant you see your trangressionsplease give me the

sir I shall be restrainedYes friend I seeFriend I beg the opportunity to confess my trangressions in your presenceBhikkhus a bhikkhu should examine things in such a way that while he is examining them his consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally nor stuck internally and by not clinging he does not become agitatedOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nalanda in Pavarikas Mango GroveThen Asibandhakaputta the headman approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideand said to him Venerable sir doesnt the Blessed One dwell compassionate towards all living beingsThen why is it venerable sir that the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma thoroughly to some yet not so thoroughly to othersWell then headman I will question you about thisAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think headman Suppose a farmer here had three fields one excellent one of middling quality and one inferior  rough salty with bad groundWhat do you think headman If that farmer wishes to sow seed where would he sow it first in the excellent field in the field of middling quality or in the field that was inferior the one that was rough salty with bad groundIf venerable sir that farmer wishes to sow seed he would sow it in the excellent fieldHaving sown seed there he would next sow seed in the field of middling qualityHaving sown seed there he might or might not sow seed in the field that was inferior the one that was rough salty with bad groundFor what reasonBecause at least it can be used as fodder for the cattleHeadman just like the field that is excellent are the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis to meI teach them the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing I reveal the holy life that is perfectly complete and pureFor what reasonBecause they dwell with me as their island with me as their shelter with me as their protector with me as their refugeThen headman just like the field of middling quality are the male and female lay followers to meTo them too I teach the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing I reveal the holy life that is perfectly complete and pureFor what reasonBecause they dwell with me as their island with me as their shelter with me as their protector with me as their refugeThen headman just like that field that is inferior  rough salty with bad ground  are the ascetics brahmins and wanderers of other sects to meYet to them too I teach the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing I reveal the holy life that is perfectly complete and pureFor what reasonBecause if they understand even a single sentence that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long timeSuppose headman a man had three waterpots one without cracks which does not let water seep through and escape one without cracks but which lets water seep through and escape and one with cracks which lets water seep through and escapeWhat do you think headman If that man wants to store water where would he store it first in the waterpot that is without cracks which does not let water seep through and escape or in the waterpot that is without cracks but which lets water seep through and escape or in the waterpot that has cracks which lets water seep through and escapeIf venerable sir that man wants to store water he would Store it in the waterpot that is without cracks which does not let water seep through and escape Having stored water there he would next store it in the waterpot that is without cracks but which lets water seep through and escape Having stored it there he might or might not store it in the waterpot that has cracks which lets water seep through and escapeFor what reasonBecause it can at least be used for washing dishesHeadman just like the waterpot that is without cracks which does not let water seep through and escape are the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis to meI teach them the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing I reveal the holy life that is perfectly complete and pueFor what reasonBecause they dwell with me as their island with me as their shelter with me as their protector with me as their refugeThen headman just like the waterpot that is without cracks but which lets water seep through and escape are the male and female lay followers to meTo them too I teach the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing I reveal the holy life that is perfectly complete and pureFor what reasonBecause they dwell with me as their island with me as their shelter with me as their protector with me as their refugeThen headman just like the waterpot that has cracks which lets water seep through and escape are the ascetics brahmins and wanderers of other sects to meYet to them too I teach the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing I reveal the holy life that is perfectly complete and pureFor what reasonBecause if they understand even a single sentence that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long timeWhen this was said Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One Magnificent venerable sir From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeYes headman the Tathggata dwells compassionate towards all living beingsThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Elder Moggallāna the GreatFor once upon a time the heretics met together and said to each other Brethren do you know the reason why the gifts and offerings to the monk Gotama have waxed greatNo we do not know but do you knowIndeed we do know it has all come about through one Moggallāna the GreatFor Moggallāna the Great goes to heaven and asks the deities what deeds of merit they performed and then he comes back to earth and says to men By doing this and that men receive such and such gloryThen he goes to Hell and asks also those who have been reborn in Hell what they did and comes back to earth and says to men By doing this and that men experience such and such sufferingMen listen to what he says and bring rich gifts and offerings Now if we succeed in killing him all these rich gifts and offerings will fall to usThat is a way indeed  exclaimed all the heretics So all the heretics with one accord formed the resolution We will kill him by hook or by crook Accordingly they roused their own supporters procured a thousand pieces of money and formed a plot to kill Moggallāna the Great Summoning some wandering thieves they gave them the thousand pieces of money and said to them Elder Moggallāna the Great lives at Black Rock Go there and kill himThe money attracted the thieves and they immediately agreed to do as they were asked Yes indeed said the thieves we will kill the Elder So they went and surrounded the Elders place of abodeThe Elder knowing that his place of abode was surrounded slipped out through the keyhole and escapedThe thieves not seeing the Elder that day came back on the following day and again surrounded the Elders place of abodeBut the Elder knew and so he broke through the circular peak of the house and soared away into the airThus did the thieves attempt both in the first month and in the second month to catch the Elder but without successBut when the third month came the Elder felt the compelling force of the evil deed he had himself committed in a previous state of existence and made no attempt to get awayAt last the thieves succeeded in catching the Elder When they had so done they tore him limb from limb and pounded his bones until they were as small as grains of riceThen thinking to themselves He is dead they tossed his bones behind a certain clump of bushes and went their wayThe Elder thought to himself I will pay my respects to the Teacher before I pass into Nibbāna Accordingly he swathed himself with meditation as with a cloth made himself rigid and soaring through the air he proceeded to the Teacher paid obeisance to the Teacher and said to him Reverend Sir I am about to pass into NibbānaYes Reverend SirTo Black Rock Reverend SirThat will I do Reverend Sir replied Moggallāna So first paying obeisance to the Teacher he rose into the air performed all manner of miracles just as did the Elder Sāriputta on the day when he passed into Nibbāna preached the Law paid obeisance to the Teacher and then went to Black Rock forest and passed into NibbānaImmediately the report spread all over the Land of the Roseapple Thieves have killed the ElderNow as those very thieves were drinking strong drink in a tavern one of them struck the other on the back and felled him to the groundImmediately the second thief reviled the first saying You scoundrel why did you strike me on the back and fell me to the groundWhy you vagabond of a thief you were the first to strike Moggallāna the GreatThe king caused the thieves to be brought into his presence and asked them Was it you that killed the Elder Yes your majesty The Naked Ascetics your majestyWhen he knew that they had been burned to a crisp he caused their bodies to be plowed with iron plows and thus caused them all to be ground to bitsThe monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth Elder Moggallāna the Great met a death which he did not deserve a Story of the Past The son who killed his parents The story goes that once upon a time in the distant past a certain youth of station performed with his own hand all of the household duties such as pounding rice and cooking and took care of his mother and father to bootOne day his mother and father said to him Son you are wearing yourself out by performing all of the work both in the house and in the forest We will fetch you home a certain young woman to be your wife The son replied Dear mother and father there is no necessity of your doing anything of the sort So long as you both shall live I will wait upon you with my own hand In spite of the fact that he refused to listen to their suggestion they repeated their request time and again and finally brought him home a young woman to be his wifeFor a few days only she waited upon his mother and father After those few days had passed she was unable even to bear the sight of them and said to her husband with a great show of indignation It is impossible for me to live any longer in the same house with your mother and father But he paid no attention to what she said So one day when he was out of the house she took bits of clay and bark and scum of ricegruel and scattered them here and there about the house When her husband returned and asked her what it meant she said This is what your blind old parents have done they go about littering up the entire house it is impossible for me to live in the same place with them any longer Thus did she speak again and againThe result was that finally even a being so distinguished as he a being who had fulfilled the Perfections broke with his mother and fatherNever mind said the husband I shall find some way of dealing with them properly So when he had given them food he said to them Dear mother and father in such and such a place  live kinsfolk of yours who desire you to visit them let us go thither And assisting them to enter a carriage he set out with them When he reached the depths of the forest he said to his father Dear father hold these reins the oxen know the track so well that they will go without guidance this is a place where thieves lie in wait for travelers I am going to descend from the carriage And giving the reins into the hands of his father he descended from the carriage and made his way into the forest As he did so he began to make a noise increasing the volume of the noise until it sounded as if a band of thieves were about to make an attackWhen his mother and father heard the noise they thought to themselves A band of thieves are about to attack us Therefore they said to their son Son we are old people save yourself and pay no attention to usBut even as his mother and father cried out thus the son yelling the thieves yell beat them and killed them and threw their bodies into the forest Having so done he returned home End of Story of the PastWhen the Teacher had related the foregoing story of Moggallānas misdeed in a previous state of existence he said Monks by reason of the fact that Moggallāna committed so monstrous a sin he suffered torment for numberless hundreds of thousands of years in Hell and thereafter because the fruit of his evil deed was not yet exhausted in a hundred successive existences he was beaten and pounded to pieces in like manner and so met deathTherefore the manner of death which Moggallāna suffered was in exact conformity with his own misdeed in a previous state of existence Likewise the five hundred heretics who with the five hundred thieves offended against my son who had committed no offense against them suffered precisely that form of death which they deservedFor he that offends against the offenseless incurs misfortune and loss through ten circumstances So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following StanzasSuch an one will right quickly come to one of ten statesOr severe sickness or loss of mindOr death of relatives or loss of treasuresUpon dissolution of the body such a simpleton will go to HellYou are about to pass into Nibbāna MoggallānaTo what region of the earth are you goingWell then Moggallāna preach the Law to me before you gofor hereafter I shall have no such disciple as you to look uponImmediately King Ajātasattu sent out spies to search for the thievesYou dont know whether I struck him or notThere was a babel of voices crying out Twas I struck him Twas I struck him Those spies heard what the thieves said captured all the thieves and made their report to the kingWho pray put you up to itThe king had the five hundred Naked Ascetics caught placed them together with the five hundred thieves waistdeep in pits which he had dug in the palacecourt caused their bodies to be covered over with bundles of straw and then caused the bundles of straw to be lightedAt that moment the Teacher approached and asked them Monks what are you saying as you sit here all gathered together  When they told him he said Monks if you regard only this present state of existence Moggallāna the Great did indeed meet death which he did not deserve But as a matter of fact the manner of death he met was in exact conformity with the deed he committed in a previous state of existence Thereupon the monks asked the Teacher But Reverend Sir what was the deed he committed in a previous state of existence  In reply the Teacher related his former deed in detail sayingWhosoever visits punishment upon those that deserve not punishment Whosoever offends against those that are without offenseHe will incur cruel suffering or infirmity or injury of the bodyOr misfortune proceeding from the king or a heavy accusationOr else the fire of lightning will consume his housesThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Kāla son of AnāthapiṇḍikaTradition has it that Kāla although the son of so distinguished a father a treasurer endowed with faith never showed any desire to visit the Teacher or to see him when he came to his fathers house or to hear the Law or to perform services for the OrderMoreover whenever his father said to him Dear son do not do this he paid no attention to what he saidNow his father thought to himself If this son of mine adopts such an attitude as this and acts accordingly the Avīci Hell will be his end But it would not look well for me if my son went to Hell before my very eyesNow there is no living being here in the world who may not be broken by gifts I will therefore break him with giftsYou will really give me this dear fatherThat will I dear sonAfter his father had repeated his promise three times Kāla took upon himself the obligations of Fastday and went to the monasteryBut caring not to listen to the Law he lay down to sleep in a pleasant place and returned home early in the morningThereupon his father said My son has performed the obligations of Fastday bring him riceporridge and other food straightway So saying his father caused food to be brought and given to himBut Kāla said Unless I receive the money I will not eat So saying he steadfastly refused whatever was brought to himHis father who could not endure forcing him to eat ordered that the money be presented to his sonThe son took the purse of money into his hands and ate the food that was brought to himOn the following day the treasurer sent him forth saying to him Dear son I will give you a thousand pieces of money if you will stand before the Teacher learn a single verse of the Law and then return to meThe Teacher therefore caused him to misunderstand the true meaning of the verseKāla failing to understand the verse said to himself I will master the following verse Therefore he remained and continued to listenThose who listen to the Law with a firm resolution to learn listen attentivelyI will master the following verse said Kāla So he remained and listened and was established in the Fruit of ConversionOn the following day he accompanied the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha to SāvatthiWhen the great treasurer saw him he said to himself Today the demeanor of my son pleases meThe great treasurer presented riceporridge to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and then presented the same to his sonKāla sat down in silence drank the porridge ate the hard food and then ate the boiled riceWhen the Teacher had finished his meal the great treasurer placed the purse containing a thousand pieces of money before his son and said Dear son you will remember that I persuaded you to take upon yourself the obligations of Fastday and to go to the monastery by promising to give you a thousand pieces of moneyWhen Kāla saw the thousand pieces of money presented to him in the very presence of the Teacher he was greatly embarrassed and said I care naught for the money Take the money dear son said the father But the son refused to touch itThen his father saluted the Teacher and said Reverend Sir the demeanor of my son today pleases me How is that great treasurer  Day before yesterday I sent him to the monastery saying to him I will give you a hundred pieces of moneyYesterday he refused to eat because I did not give him the money but today when I give him the money he refuses to touch itThe Teacher replied It is even so great treasurer Today in attaining the Fruit of Conversion your son has attained that which surpasses the attainment of a Universal Monarch the attainment of the World of the Gods the attainment of the World of Brahmā So saying he pronounced the following StanzaIn comparison with supremacy over all the worlds the Fruit of Conversion is of supreme excellenceSo he said to his son Dear son take upon yourself the obligations of Fastday go to the monastery listen to the Law and then return If you will do so I will give you a hundred pieces of moneyAccordingly Kāla went to the monastery and took his stand before the Teacher But no sooner had he mastered a single verse than he desired to run awayand to those who thus listen the Law gives the Fruit of Conversion and the remaining FruitsKāla listened to the Law with a firm resolution to learn but the Teacher as before caused him to misunderstand the true meaningAnd straightway the following thought occurred to the son I hope my father will not give me the money today in the presence of the Teacher I hope he will conceal the fact that it was for the sake of pieces of money that I took upon myself the obligations of Fastdayhere are your thousand pieces of moneyIn comparison with sovereignty over the earth in comparison with going to heavenNow who will expound this in detail Then they considered The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy lifeIf his consciousness does not follow after the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion is not tied and shackled by gratification in the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion is not fettered by the fetter of gratification in the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion then his mind is called not stuck internallyIf his consciousness does not follow after the rapture and pleasure born of concentrationthen his mind is called not stuck internallyIf his consciousness does not follow after the equanimitythen his mind is called not stuck internallyHaving apprehended the sign thus and defined all the other parts of the body by colour shape direction location and delimitation  he should then define repulsiveness in five ways that is by colour shape odour habitat and locationHere is the explanation of all the parts given in successive orderHead Hairs Firstly head hairs are black in their normal colour the colour of fresh ariṭṭhaka seedsAs to shape they are the shape of long round measuring rodsAs to location it is bounded on both sides by the roots of the ears in front by the forehead and behind by the nape of the neckHead hairs are not body hairs and body hairs are not head hairs being likewise not intermixed with the remaining thirtyone parts the head hairs are a separate part This is their delimitation by the dissimilarSuch is the definition of head hairs as to colour and so on Their definition as to repulsiveness in the five ways that is by colour etc is as followsHead hairs are repulsive in colourFor on seeing the colour of a head hair in a bowl of inviting rice gruel or cooked rice people are disgusted and say This has got hairs in it Take it awaySo they are repulsive in colourAlso when people are eating at night they are likewise disgusted by the mere sensation of a hairshaped akkabark or makaci bark fibreSo they are repulsive in shapeAnd the odour of head hairs unless dressed with a smearing of oil scented with flowers etc is most offensiveAnd it is still worse when they are put in the fireEven if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsiveJust as a babys excrement as to its colour is the colour of turmeric and as to its shape is the shape of a piece of turmeric rootBut just as pot herbs that grow on village sewage in a filthy place are disgusting to civilized people and unusable so also head hairs are disgusting since they grow on the sewage of pus blood urine dung bile phlegm and the like This is the repulsive aspect of the habitatAnd these head hairs grow on the heap of the other thirtyone parts as fungi do on a dunghillAnd owing to the filthy place they grow in they are quite as unappetizing as vegetables growing on a charnelground on a midden etc as lotuses or water lilies growing in drains and so on This is the repulsive aspect of their locationAnd as in the case of head hairs so also the repulsiveness of all the parts should be defined in the same five ways by colour shape odour habitat and locationAll however must be defined individually by colour shape direction location and delimitation as followsBody Hairs Herein firstly as to natural colour body hairs are not pure black like head hairs but blackish brownAs to shape they are the shape of palm roots with the tips bent downAs to direction they lie in the two directionsAs to location except for the locations where the head hairs are established and for the palms of the hands and soles of the feet they grow in most of the rest of the inner skin that envelops the bodyAs to delimitation they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots which are fixed by entering to the extent of a likhā into the inner skin that envelops the body above by space and all round by each other There are no two body hairs together This is the delimitation by the similarBut their delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairsNails  Nails is the name for the twenty nail platesThey are all white as to colourAs to shape they are the shape of fish scalesAs to direction the toenails are in the lower direction the fingernails are in the upper direction So they grow in the two directionsAs to location they are fixed on the tips of the backs of the fingers and toesAs to delimitation they are bounded in the two directions by the flesh of the ends of the fingers and toes and inside by the flesh of the backs of the fingers and toes and externally and at the end by space and all round by each other There are no two nails together Teeth There are thirtytwo tooth bones in one whose teeth are completeThey are white in colourAs to shape they are of various shapesLikewise in the upper rowAs to direction they lie in the upper directionAs to location they are fixed in the jawbonesAs to delimitation they are bounded by the surface of their own roots which are fixed in the jawbones they are bounded above by space and all round by each other There are no two teeth together Skin   The inner skin envelops the whole bodyOutside it is what is called the outer cuticle which is black brown or yellow in colour and when that from the whole of the body is compressed together it amounts to only as much as a jujubefruit kernelBut as to colour the skin itself is whiteAs to shape it is the shape of the bodyin briefThe meditator who is discerning the skin should first define the inner skin that covers the face working his knowledge over the face beginning with the upper lipNext the inner skin of the frontal boneNext he should define the inner skin of the head separating as it were the inner skins connection with the bone by inserting his knowledge in between the cranium bone and the inner skin of the head as he might his hand in between the bag and the bowl put in the bagNext the inner skin of the shouldersNext the inner skin of the right arm forwards and backwardsand then in the same way the inner skin of the left armNext after defining the inner skin of the back he should define the inner skin of the right leg forwards and backwardsNext the inner skin of the groin the paunch the bosom and the neck should be successively definedThen after defining the inner skin of the lower jaw next after that of the neck he should finish on arriving at the lower lipWhen he discerns it in the gross in this way it becomes evident to him more subtly tooAs to direction it lies in both directionsAs to location it covers the whole bodyAs to delimitation it is bounded below by its fixed surface and above by space Flesh There are nine hundred pieces

piece Sinews There are nine hundred sinewsAs to colour all the sinews are whiteAs to shape they have various shapesFor five of great sinews that bind the body together start out from the upper part of the neck and descend by the frontAnd of those that bind the right hand five descend by the front of the handAnd of those that bind the right foot five descend by the front and five by the backSo there are sixty great sinews called body supporters which descend from the neck and bind the body togetherBut there are others scattered over various parts of the bodyThere are others still finer the shape

with stitchesAs to direction they lie in both directionsAs to location they are to be found indiscriminately throughout the whole bodyBut in particular here the head bones rest on the neck bonesAs to delimitation they are bounded inside by the bone marrow above by the flesh at the ends and at the roots by each other Bone Marrow  This is the marrow inside the various bonesAs to colour it is whiteAs to shape that inside each large bone is the shape of a large cane shoot moistened and inserted into a bamboo tubeThat inside each small bone is the shape of a slender cane shoot moistened and inserted in a section of bamboo twigAs to direction it lies in both directionsAs to location it is set inside the bonesAs to delimitation it is delimited by the inner surface of the bones Kidney  This is two

locationAs to direction the concealed midriff lies in the upper directionthe other in both directionsAs to location the concealed midriff is to be found concealing the heart and kidney the unconcealed is to be found covering the flesh under the inner skin throughout the whole bodyAs to delimitation it is bounded below by the flesh above by the inner skin and all round by what appertains to midriff Spleen  This is the flesh of the bellys tongueAs to direction it lies in the upper directionAs to location it is to be found near the upper side of the belly to the left of the heart When it comes out

hands long and in a woman twentyeight handsAs to colour it is white the colour of lime mixed with sandAs to shape it is the shape of a beheaded snake coiled up and put in a trough of bloodAs to direction it lies in the two directionsAs to location it is fastened above at the gullet and below to the excrement passage  so it is to be found inside the body between the limits of the gullet and

dakasītalika rootsAs to shape it is the shape of those roots tooAs to direction it lies in the two directionsAs to location it is to be found inside the twentyone coils of the bowel like the strings to be found inside roperings for wiping the feet on sewing them together and it fastens the bowels coils together so that they do not slip down in those working with hoes axes etc as the marionettestrings do the marionettes wooden limbs at the time of the marionettes being pulled alongAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to entrails Gorge  This is what has been eaten drunk chewed and tasted and is present in the stomachAs to colour it is the colour of swallowed foodAs to shape it is the shape of rice loosely tied in a cloth strainerAs to direction it is in the upper directionAs to location it is in the stomachWhat is called the stomach is a part of the bowelmembrane which is like the swelling of air produced in the middle of a length of wet cloth when it is being twisted and wrung out from the two ends It is smooth outside Inside it is like a balloon of cloth soiled by wrapping up meat refuse or it can be said to be like the inside of the skin of a rotten jack fruit It is the place where worms dwell seething in tangles the thirtytwo families of worms such as round worms boilproducing worms palmsplinter worms needlemouthed worms tape worms thread worms and the rest When there is no food and drink etc present they leap up shrieking and pounce upon the hearts flesh and when food and drink etc are swallowed they wait with uplifted mouths and scramble to snatch the first two or three lumps swallowed It is these worms maternity home privy hospital and charnel groundJust as when it has rained heavily in a time of drought and what has been carried by the water into the cesspit at the gate of an outcaste villagethe various kinds of ordure such as urine excrement bits of hide and bones and sinews as well as spittle snot blood etcgets mixed up with the mud and water already collected there and after two or three days the families of worms appear and it ferments warmed by the energy of the suns heat frothing and bubbling on the top quite black in colour and so utterly stinking and loathsome that one can scarcely go near it or look at it much less smell or taste it so too the stomach is where the assortment of food drink etc falls after being pounded up by the tongue and stuck together with spittle and saliva losing at that moment its virtues of colour smell taste etc and taking on the appearance of weavers paste and dogs vomit then to get soused in the bile and phlegm and wind that have collected there where it ferments with the energy of the stomachfires heat seethes with the families of worms frothing and bubbling on the top till it turns into utterly stinking nauseating muckAs to delimitation it is bounded by the stomach lining and by what appertains to gorge Dung  This is excrementAs to colour it is mostly the colour of eaten foodAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it is in the lower directionAs to location it is to be found in the receptacle for digested food The receptacle for digested food is the lowest part at the end of the bowel between the navel and the root of the spine It measures eight fingerbreadths in height and resembles a bamboo tube Just as when rain water falls on a higher level it runs down to fill a lower level and stays there so too the receptacle for digested food is where any food drink etc that have fallen into the receptacle for undigested food have been continuously cooked and simmered by the stomachfire and have got as soft as though ground up on a stone run down to through the cavities of the bowels and it is pressed down there till it becomes impacted like brown clay pushed into a bamboo joint and there it staysAs to delimitation it is bounded by the receptacle for digested food and by what appertains to dung Brain  This is the lumps of marrow to be found inside the skullAs to colour it is white the colour of the flesh of a toadstoolAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to the upper directionAs to location it is to be found inside the skull like four lumps of dough put together to correspond with the skulls four sutured sectionsAs to delimitation it is bounded by the skulls inner surface and by what appertains to brain Bile  There are two kinds of bile local bile and free bileHerein as to colour the local bile is the colour of thick madhuka oilAs to shape both are the shape of their locationAs to direction the local bile belongs to the upper direction the other belongs to both directionsAs to location the free bile spreads like a drop of oil on water all over the body except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs body hairs teeth nails and the hard dry skin When it is disturbed the eyes become yellow and twitch and there is shivering and itching of the bodyThe local bile is situated near the flesh of the liver between the heart and the lungs It is to be found in the bile container  which is like a large kosātakī gourd pip When it is disturbed beings go crazy and become demented they throw off conscience and shame and do the undoable speak the unspeakable and think the unthinkableAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to bile Phlegm  The phlegm is inside the body and it measures a bowlfulAs to colour it is white the colour of the juice of nāgabalā leavesAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to the upper directionAs to location it is to be found on the stomachs surfaceJust as duckweed and green scum on the surface of water divide when a stick or a potsherd is dropped into the water and then spread together again so too at the time of eating and drinking etc when the food drink etc fall into the stomach the phlegm divides and then spreads together again And if it gets weak the stomach becomes utterly disgusting with a smell of ordure like a ripe boil or a rotten hens egg and then the belchings and the mouth reek with a stench like rotting ordure rising from the stomachso that the man has to be told Go away your breath smells But when it grows plentiful it holds the stench of ordure beneath the surface of the stomach acting like the wooden lid of a privyAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to phlegm Pus  Pus is produced by decaying bloodAs to colour it is the colour of bleached leavesAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location however there is no fixed location for pus where it could be found stored up Wherever blood stagnates and goes bad in some part of the body damaged by wounds with stumps and thorns by burns with fire etc or where boils carbuncles etc appear it can be found thereBlood There are two kinds of blood stored blood and mobile bloodHerein as to colour stored blood is the colour of cooked and thickened lac solutionAs to shape both are the shape of their locationsAs to direction the stored blood belongs to the upper directionAs to location except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs body hairs teeth nails and the hard dry skin the mobile blood permeates the whole of the clungto  body by following the network of veinsThe stored blood fills the lower part of the livers site to the extent of a bowlful and by its splashing little by little over the heart kidney and lungs it keeps the kidney heart liver and lungs moistFor it is when it fails to moisten the kidney heart etc that beings become thirstyAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to blood Sweat  This is the water element that trickles from the pores of the body hairs and so onAs to colour it is the colour of clear sesame oilAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location there is no fixed location for sweat where it could always be found like bloodBut if the body is heated by the heat of a fire by the suns heat by a change of temperature etc then it trickles from all the pore openings of the head hairs and body hairs as water does from a bunch of unevenly cut lilybud stems and lotus stalks pulled up from the water So its shape should also be understood to correspond to the poreopenings of the head hairs and body hairsFat  This is a thick unguentAs to colour it is the colour of sliced turmericAs to shape firstly in the body of a stout man it is the shape of turmericcoloured dukūla rags placed between the inner skin and the fleshIn the body of a lean man it is the shape of turmericcoloured dukūla rags placed in two or three thicknesses on the shank flesh thigh flesh back flesh near the spine and bellycovering fleshAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location it permeates the whole of a stout mans body it is to be found on a lean mans shank flesh and so on And though it was described as unguent above still it is neither used as oil on the head nor as oil for the nose etc because of its utter disgustingnessTears  These are the water element that trickles from the eyeAs to colour they are the colour of clear sesame oilAs to shape they are the shape of their locationAs to direction they belong to the upper directionAs to location they are to be found in the eye socketsBut they are not stored in the eye sockets all the while as the bile is in the bile containerBut when beings feel joy and laugh uproariously or feel grief and weep and lament or eat particular kinds of wrong food or when their eyes are affected by smoke dust dirt etcAnd the meditator who discerns tears should discern them only as they are to be found filling the eye socketsAs to delimitation they are bounded by what appertains to tears Grease  This is a melted unguentAs to colour it is the colour of coconut oilAlso it can be said to be the colour of oil sprinkled on gruelAs to shape it is a film the shape of a drop of unguent spread out over still water at the time of bathingAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location it is to be found mostly on the palms of the hands backs of the hands soles of the feet backs of the feet tip of the nose forehead and points of the shouldersAnd it is not always to be found in the melted state in these locationsSpittle  This is water element mixed with froth inside the mouthAs to colour it is white the colour of the frothAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAnd it is not always to be found stored thereIt is thin at the tip of the tongue and thick at the root of the tongue It is capable without getting used up of wetting unhusked rice or husked rice or anything else chewable that is put into the mouth like the water in a pit scooped out in a river sand bankSnot  This is impurity that trickles out from the brainAs to colour it is the colour of a young palmyra kernelAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to the upper directionAs to location it is to be found filling the nostril cavitiesAnd it is not always to be found stored there but rather just as though a man tied up curd in a lotus leaf which he then pricked with a thorn underneath and whey oozed out and dripped so too when beings weep or suffer a disturbance of elements produced by wrong food or temperature then the brain inside the head turns into stale phlegm and it oozes out and comes down by an opening in the palate and it fills the nostrils and stays there or trickles outAnd the meditator who discerns snot should discern it only as it is to be found filling the nostril cavitiesAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to snot Oil of the Joints  This is the slimy ordure inside the joints in the bodyAs to colour it is the colour of kaṇikāra gumAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to direction it belongs to both directionsAs to location it is to be found inside the hundred and eighty joints serving the function of lubricating the bones jointsIf it is weak when a man gets up or sits down moves forward or backward bends or stretches then his bones creak and he goes about making a noise like the snapping of fingersAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to oil of the joints Urine  This is the urine solutionAs to colour it is the colour of bean brineAs to shape it is the shape of water inside a water pot placed upside downAs to direction it belongs to the lower directionAs to location it is to be found inside the bladderFor the bladder sack is called the bladderJust as when a porous pot with no mouth is put into a cesspool then the solution from the cesspool gets into the porous pot with no mouth even though no way of entry is evident so too while the urinary secretion from the body enters the bladder its way of entry is not evident Its way of exit however is evidentAnd when the bladder is full of urine beings feel the need to make waterAs to delimitation it is delimited by the inside of the bladder and by what is similar to urine This is the delimitation by the similarBut its delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairs The Arising of Absorption  When the meditator has defined the parts beginning with the head hairs in this way by colour shape direction location and delimitation  and he gives his attention in the ways beginning with following the order not too quickly to their repulsiveness in the five aspects of colour shape smell habitat and location  then at last he surmounts the concept  Then just as when a man with good sight is observing a garland of flowers of thirty two colours knotted on a single string and all the flowers become evident to him simultaneously so too when the meditator observes this body thus There are in this body head hairs then all these things become evident to him as it were simultaneouslyHence it was said above in the explanation of skill in giving attention For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs his attention carries on till it arrives at the last part that is urine and stops there If he applies his attention externally as well when all the parts have become evident in this way then human beings animals etc as they go about are divested of their aspect of beings and appear as just assemblages of parts And when drink food etc is being swallowed by them it appears as though it were being put in among the assemblage of partsThen as he gives his attention to them again and again as Repulsive repulsive employing the process of successive leaving etc  eventually absorption arises in himHerein the appearance of the head hairs etc as to colour shape direction location and delimitation is the learning signAs he cultivates and develops that counterpart sign absorption arises in him but only of the first jhāna in the same way as described under foulness as a meditation subject And it arises singly in one to whom only one part has become evident or who has reached absorption in one part and makes no further effort about anotherBut several first jhānas according to the number of parts are produced in one to whom several parts have become evident or who has reached jhāna in one and also makes further effort about another As in the case of the Elder MallakaThe elder it seems took the Elder Abhaya the Dīgha reciter by the hand and after saying Friend Abhaya first learn this matter he went on The Elder Mallaka is an obtainer of thirtytwo jhānas in the thirtytwo partsIf he enters upon one by night and one by day he goes on entering upon them for over a fortnight but if he enters upon one each day he goes on entering upon them for over a monthAnd although this meditation is successful in this way with the first jhāna it is nevertheless called mindfulness occupied with the body because it is successful through the influence of the mindfulness of the colour shape and so onAnd the bhikkhu who is devoted to this mindfulness occupied with the body is a conqueror of boredom and delight and boredom does not conquer him he dwells transcending boredom as it arisesHe is a conqueror of fear and dread and fear and dread do not conquer him he dwells transcending fear and dread as they ariseHe is one who bears cold and heat  who endures  arisen bodily feelings that are  menacing to life So let a man if he is wise Untiringly devote his daysTo mindfulness of body which Rewards him in so many waysThis is the section dealing with mindfulness occupied with the body in the detailed treatiseAs to delimitation they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots which are fixed by entering to the amount of the tip of a rice grain into the inner skin that envelops the head They are bounded above by space and all round by each other There are no two hairs together This is their delimitation by the similarAs to direction they lie in the upper directiontheir location is the wet inner skin that envelops the skullas well as in shape odour habitat and locationso too even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsiveand its fangs are like jasmine buds and so even if both these are not directly repulsive in colour and shape still their odour is directly repulsiveand just as the bloated carcass of a black dog thrown on a rubbish heap as to its colour is the colour of a ripe palmyra fruit andas to its shape is the shape of a mandolinshaped drum left face downfor firstly in the lower row the four middle teeth are the shape of pumpkin seeds set in a row in a lump of claythat on each side of them has one root and one point and is the shape of a jasmine budeach one after that has two roots and two points and is the shape of a wagon propthen two each side with three roots and three pointsthen two each side fourrooted and fourpointedand its whiteness becomes evident when the outer cuticle is destroyed by contact with the flame of a fire or the impact of a blow and so onBut in detail the skin of the toes is the shape of silkworms cocoonsthe skin of the back of the foot is the shape of shoes with uppersthe skin of the calf is the shape of a palm leaf wrapping cooked ricethe skin of the thighs is the shape of a long

they are also called tendonsThey are all the shape of yam shootswhich are finer than the lastnamed They are the shape of strings and cordsone occipital bone nine sincipital bones So there are exactly three hundred bones As to colour they are all whiteThe bones of the back of the foot are the shape of a bunch of bruised yarnsare the shape of the ring fastening of a smiths hammerThe two hip bones when fastened togetherexternally they are the shape of a string of beadsand the complete ones are the shape of complete sabresall together they are like the outspread wings of a white cockThe heart bone is the shape of the bowl of a spoonAs to the fingers the bones of the base sections are the shape of small drumsthose of the middle sections are the shape of immature jackfruit seedsthose of the end sections are the shape of kataka seedsThe occipital bone is the shape of a lopsided coconut with a hole cut in the endthe neck bones on the spine bonesthe spine bones on the hip bonesthe hip bones

it is like the interior of a kosātakī As to shape it is seven fingers in size without attachments and the shape of a black calfs tongueAs to colour it is blue the colour of nigguṇḍi flowersAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to spleen And when the food drink etc fall into it they get divided into five parts the worms eat one part the stomachfire bums up another part another part becomes urine another part becomes excrement and one part is turned into nourishment and sustains the blood flesh and so oneven to hear about which takes away any appetite for food drink etc let alone to see it with the eye of understandingit can also be said that it is the colour of turned milk that has not yet become curdthe free bile is the colour of faded ākulī flowersbut in a dead body it is the colour of stale thickened gruelAs to shape it is the shape of its locationAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to pus mobile blood is the colour of clear lac solutionthe other belongs to both directionsAnd the meditator who discerns sweat should only give his attention to it as it is to be found filling the poreopenings of the head hairs and body hairsAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to sweat As to delimitation it is bounded below by the flesh above by the inner skin and all round by what appertains to fat then being originated by the joy grief wrong food or temperature they fill up the eye sockets or trickle outAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to grease but when these parts get hot with the heat of a fire the suns heat upset of temperature or upset of elements then it spreads here and there in those places like the film from the drop of unguent on the still water at the time of bathingAs to location it is to be found on the tongue after it has descended from the cheeks on both sidesor it can be called the shape of frothAs to direction it belongs to the upper directionbut when beings see particular kinds of food or remember them or put something hot or bitter or sharp or salty or sour into their mouths or when their hearts are faint or nausea arises on some account then spittle appears and runs down from the cheeks on both sides to settle on the tongueAs to delimitation it is bounded by what appertains to spittle But if a man has plenty of it his bones do not creak when he gets up sits down etc and even when he has walked a long distance his air element does not get upset and his limbs do not pain himand when he has walked only one or two leagues distance his air element gets upset and his limbs pain himtheir appearance as repulsive in all aspects is the counterpart signhe becomes an obtainer of the four jhānas based on the colour aspect of the head hairs etcand he comes to penetrate the six kinds of directknowledge He regards feeling as selfHe regards perception as selfHe regards formations as selfHe regards consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousnessand told the Blessed Oneall that had taken place after he had left addingThen venerable sir we went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and asked him about the meaningSuch is its meaningand so you should remember it  Then listen friends and attend closely to what I shall sayYes friend the bhikkhus repliedThe venerable Maha Kaccana said thisTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus I shall teach you an exposition of the sixfold baseListen and attend closely to what I shall say Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisThe six internal bases should be understood The six external bases should be understood The six classes of consciousness should be understood The six classes of contact should be understood The eighteen kinds of mental exploration should be understood The thirtysix positions of beings should be understood Therein by depending on this abandon that There are three foundations of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates cultivating which the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a group Among the teachers of training it is he that is called the incomparable leader of persons to be tamed This is the summary of the exposition of the sixfold baseThe six internal bases should be understood So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this saidThere are the eyebase the earbase the nosebase the tonguebase the bodybase and the mindbase So it was with reference to this that it was said The six internal bases should be understoodThe six external bases should be understood So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this saidThere are the

equanimity based on renunciation abandon and surmount the six kinds of joy based on renunciationIt is thus they are abandoned it is thus they are surmountedThere is bhikkhus equanimity that is diversified based on diversity and there is equanimity that is unified based on unity There is equanimity regarding forms sounds odours flavours and tangibles This bhikkhus is equanimity that is diversified based on diversityAnd what bhikkhus is equanimity that is unified based on unityThere is equanimity regarding the base of infinite space the base of infinite consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception This bhikkhus is equanimity that is unified based on unity It is thus this is abandoned it is thus this is surmountedIt is thus this is abandoned it is thus this is surmountedSo it was in reference to this that it was said Therein by depending on this abandon thatThere are three foundations of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates cultivating which the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a group  So it was said And with reference to what was this saidHere bhikkhus compassionate and seeking their welfare the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion This is for your welfare this is for your happinessHis disciples do not want to hear or give ear or exert their minds to understand they err and turn aside from the Teachers DispensationWith that the Tathagata is not satisfied and feels no satisfaction yet he dwells unmoved mindful and fully awareThis bhikkhus is called the first foundation of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates cultivating which the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a groupFurthermore bhikkhus compassionate and seeking their welfare the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion This is for your welfare this is for your happinessSome of his disciples will not hear or give ear or exert their minds to understand they err and turn aside from the Teachers Dispensation Some of his disciples will hear and give ear and exert their minds to understand they do not err and turn aside from the Teachers DispensationWith that the Tathagata is not satisfied and feels no satisfaction and he is not dissatisfied and feels no dissatisfactionThis bhikkhus is called the second foundation of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates cultivating which the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a groupFurthermore bhikkhus compassionate and seeking their welfare the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion This is for your welfare this is for your happinessHis disciples will hear and give ear and exert their minds to understand they do not err and turn aside from the Teachers DispensationWith that the Tathagata is satisfied and feels satisfaction yet he dwells unmoved mindful and fully awareThis bhikkhus is called the third foundation of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates cultivating which the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a groupSo it was with reference to this that it was said There are three foundations of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates cultivating which the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a groupAmong the teachers of training it is he that is called the incomparable leader of persons to be tamed  So it was saidAnd with reference to what was this saidGuided by the elephant tamer bhikkhus the elephant to be tamed goes in one direction  east west north or southGuided by the horse tamer bhikkhus the horse to be tamed goes in one direction  east west north or southGuided by the ox tamer bhikkhus the ox to be tamed goes in one direction  east west north or southBhikkhus guided by the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened the person to be tamed goes in eight directionsPossessed of material form he sees forms this is the first direction Not perceiving forms internally he sees forms externally this is the second direction He is resolved only upon the beautiful this is the third direction With the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite he enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space this is the fourth direction By completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite he enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness this is the fifth direction By completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing he enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness this is the sixth direction By completely surmounting the base of nothingness he enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception this is the seventh direction By completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception he enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feelirig this is the eighth directionBhikkhus guided by the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened the person to be tamed goes in these eight directionsSo it was with reference to this that it was said Among the teachers of training it is he that is called the incomparable leader of persons to be tamedThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsWhen by knowing the impermanence change fading away and cessation of soundsof odoursof flavoursof tangibles of mindobjects one sees as it actually is with proper wisdom that mindobjects both formerly and now are all impermanent suffering and subject to change joy arisesSuch grief as this is called grief based on the household lifeThese are the six kinds of grief based on the household lifethat is why it is called equanimity based on the household lifeOn hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongueOn touching a tangible with the bodyOn cognizing a mindobject with the mind equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered his limitations or conquered the results of action and who is blind to

equanimity arisesthat is why it is called equanimity based on renunciationThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling am ong the Bhaggas at Sumsumaragira in the deer park at Bhesakala GroveNow on that occasion the Venerable Mahamoggallana was sitting and dozing at Kallavalamuttagama among the MagadhansWith the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human the Blessed One saw the Venerable Mahamoggallana sitting and dozingThen just as a strong man might extend his drawnin arm or draw in his extended armthe Blessed One disappeared from the deer park at Bhesakala Grove and reappeared before the Venerable MahamoggallanaThe Blessed One sat down on the seat that was prepared for himAre you dozing Moggallana Are you dozing MoggallanaYes BhanteTherefore Moggallana you should not attend to or cultivate the object that you were attending to when you became drowsyBy such means it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandonedBy such means it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandonedBy such means it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandonedBut if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such away you should pull both ears and rub your limbs with your handsBy such means it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandonedBy such means it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandonedThus with a mind that is open and uncovered you should develop a mind imbued with luminosityBy such means it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandonedBut if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such away you should undertake the exercise of walking back and forth perceiving what is behind you and what is in front with your sense faculties drawn in and your mind collectedBy such means it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandonedBut if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way you should lie down on the right side in the lions posture with one foot overlapping the other mindful and clearly comprehending after noting in your mind the idea of risingWhen you awaken you should get up quickly thinking I will not be intent on the pleasure of rest the pleasure of sloth the pleasure of sleepIt is in this way Moggallana that you should train yourselfTherefore Moggallana you should train yourself thus We will not approach families for alms with a head swollen with prideIt is in this way Moggallana that you should train yourselfIt may be Moggallana that a bhikkhu approaches families with a head swollen with pride Now there are chores to be done in the familiesand for this reason when a bhikkhu turns up people may not pay attention to him In such a case the bhikkhu might think Who has turned this family against me It seems these people have now become indifferent toward meIn this way through lack of gain one feels humiliated when feeling humiliated one becomes restless when one is restless one loses ones restraint The mind of one without restraint is far from concentrationTherefore Moggallana you should train yourself thus We will not engage in contentious talkIt is in this way that you should train yourselfWhen there is contentious talk an excess of words can be expected When there is an excess of words one becomes restless when one is restless one loses ones restraint The mind of one without restraint is far from concentrationMoggallana I do not praise bonding with everyone whatsoeverI do not praise bonding with householders and monasticsWhen this was said the Venerable Mahamoggallana said to the Blessed One  Briefly Bhante how is a bhikkhu liberated in the extinction of craving best among devas and humans one who has reached the ultimate conclusion won ultimate security from bondage lived the ultimate spiritual life and gained the ultimate consummationHere Moggallana a bhikkhu has heard Nothing is worth holding to When a bhikkhu has heard Nothing is worth holding toHaving fully understood all things whatever feeling he feels whether pleasant painful or neither painful nor pleasant As he dwells contemplating impermanence fading away cessation  relinquishment in those feelings he does not cling to anything in the world Not clinging he is not agitated Being unagitated he personally attains nibbanaHe understands Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of beingBriefly Moggallana it is in this way that a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans one who has reached the ultimate conclusion won ultimate security from bondage lived the ultimate spiritual life and gained the ultimate consummationand saidBut if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such away you should ponder examine and mentally inspect the Dhamma as you have heard it and learned itBut if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such a way you should recite in detail the Dhamma as you have heard it and learned itBut if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such away you should get up from your seat rub your eyes with water survey all the quarters and look up at the constellations and starsBut if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in such away you should attend to the perception of light you should undertake the perception of day thus As by day so at night as at night so by daynor do I praise bonding with no one at allbut I do praise bonding with quiet and noiseless lodgings far from the flurry of people remote from human habitation and suitable for seclusionhe directly knows all things Having directly known all things he fully understands all thingshe dwells contemplating impermanence in those feelings contemplating fading away in those feelings contemplating cessation in those feelings contemplating relinquishment in those feelingsAnd what bhikkhus is equanimity that is diversified based on diversityHere bhikkhus by depending and relying on equanimity that is unified based on unity abandon and surmount equanimity that is diversified based on diversityBhikkhus by depending and relying on nonidentification abandon and surmount equanimity that is unified based on unityremaining free from both satisfaction and dissatisfaction he dwells in equanimity mindful and fully awareTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow on that occasion the venerable Samiddhi was living in a forest hutThen the wanderer Potaliputta while wandering and walking for exercise went to the venerable Samiddhi arid exchanged greetings with himAnd There is that attainment on entering which one does not feel anything at allDo not say so friend Potaliputta do not say so Do not misrepresent the Blessed OneThe Blessed One would not speak thus Bodily action is vain verbal action is vain only mental action is realBut friend there is that attainment on entering which one does not feel anything at allHow long is it since you went forth friend SamiddhiNot long friendThere now what shall we say to the elder bhikkhus when a young bhikkhu thinks the Teacher is to be defended thusFriend Samiddhi having done an intentional action by way of body speech or mind what does one feelHaving done an intentional action by way of body speech or mind one feels suffering friend PotaliputtaThen neither approving nor disapproving of the venerable Samiddhis words the wanderer Potaliputta rose from his seat and departedSoon after the wanderer Potaliputta had left the venerable Samiddhi went to the venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideAfter he had spoken the venerable Ananda told him Friend Samiddhi this conversation should be told to the Blessed OneCome let us approach the Blessed One and tell him thisAs the Blessed One explains to us so we shall bear it in mind Yes friend the venerable Samiddhi repliedThen the venerable Ananda and the venerable Samiddhi went together to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one sideThe venerable Ananda reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation between the venerable Samiddhi and the wanderer PotaliputtaWhen he had finished the Blessed One told the venerable Ananda Ananda I do not even recall ever having seen the wanderer Potaliputta so how could there have been this conversationThough the wanderer Potaliputtas question should have been analysed before being answered this misguided man answered it onesidedlyWhen this was said the venerable Udayin said to the Blessed One Venerable sir perhaps the venerable Samiddhi spoke thus referring to the principle Whatever is felt is sufferingThen the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda See Ananda how this misguided man Udayin interferesI knew Ananda that this misguided man Udayin would unduly interfere right nowFrom the start the wanderer Potaliputta had asked about the three kinds of feelingThis misguided man Samiddhi would have answered the wanderer Potaliputta rightly if when asked thus he would have explained Friend Potaliputta having done an intentional action by way of body speech or mind whose result is to be felt as pleasant one feels pleasure Having done an intentional action by way of body speech or mind whose result is to be felt as painful one feels painHaving done an intentional action by way of body speech or mind whose result is to be felt as neitherpainnorpleasure one feels neitherpainnorpleasureBut who are these foolish thoughtless wanderers of other sects that they could understand the Tathagatas great exposition of actionYou should listen Ananda to the Tathagata as he expounds the great exposition of actionThis is the time Blessed One this is the time Sublime One for the Blessed One to expound the great exposition of actionHaving heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember itThen listen Ananda and attend closely to what I shall sayYes venerable sir the venerable Ananda repliedThe Blessed One said thisWhat fourHere some person kills living beings takes what is not given misconducts himself in sensual pleasures speaks falsehood

down at one sideand said to the venerable Samiddhi Friend Samiddhi I heard and learned this from the recluse Gotamas own lips Bodily action is vain verbal action is vain only rental action is realit is not good to misrepresent the Blessed Onethree yearsand reported to the venerable Ananda his entire conversation with the wanderer PotaliputtaAnanda there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in the worldfor I saw a person here who killed living beingsand held wrong view and I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldfor I saw a person here who abstained from killing living beingsand held right view and I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldThus he obstinately adheres to what he himself has known seen and discovered insisting Only this is true anything else is wrongBhikkhus I will teach you a Dhamma exposition on the theme of burningListen to thatIt would be better bhikkhus for the eye faculty to be lacerated by a redhot iron pin burning blazing and glowing than for one to grasp the sign through the features in a form cognizable by the eyeFor if consciousness should stand tied to gratification in the sign or in the features and if one should die on that occasion it is possible that one will go to one of two destinations hell or the animal realmHaving seen this danger I speak thusIt would be better bhikkhus for the ear faculty to be lacerated by a sharp iron stake burning blazing and glowing than for one to grasp the sign through the features in a sound cognizable by the earFor if consciousness should stand tied to gratification in the sign or in the features and if one should die on that occasion it is possible that one will go to one of two destinations hell or the animal realmHaving seen this danger I speak thusIt would be better bhikkhus for the nose faculty to be lacerated by a sharp nail cutter burning blazing and glowing than for one to grasp the sign through the features in an odour cognizable by the noseFor if consciousness should stand tied to gratification in the sign or in the features and if one should die on that occasionHaving seen this danger I speak thusIt would be better bhikkhus for the tongue faculty to be lacerated by a sharp razor burning blazing and glowing than for one to grasp the sign through the features in a taste cognizable by the tongueFor if consciousness should stand tied to gratification in the sign or in the features and if one should die on that occasionHaving seen this danger I speak thusIt would be better bhikkhus for the body faculty to be lacerated by a sharp spear burning blazing and glowing than for one to grasp the sign through the features in a tactile object cognizable by the bodyFor if consciousness should stand tied to gratification in the sign or in the features and if one should die on that occasionHaving seen this danger I speak thusIt would be better bhikkhus to sleep Having seen this danger I speak thusLet me attend only to this So the eye is impermanent forms are impermanent eyeconsciousness is impermanent eyecontact is impermanent watever feeling arises with eyecontact as condition  whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant  that too is impermanentLeave off lacerating the ear faculty with a sharp iron stake burning blazing and glowingLet me attend only to this the ear is impermanent sounds are impermanent earconsciousness is impermanent earcontact is impermanent whatever feeling arises with earcontact as condition  that too is impermanentLeave off lacerating the nose faculty with a sharp nail cutter burning blazing and glowingLet me attend only to this So the nose is impermanent odours are impermanent noseconsciousness is impermanent nosecontact is impermanent whatever feeling arises with nosecontact as condition that too is impermanentLeave off lacerating the tongue faculty with a sharp razor burning blazing and glowingLet me attend only to this So the tongue is impermanent tastes are impermanent tongueconsciousness is impermanent tonguecontact is impermanent whatever feeling arises with tonguecontact as condition  that too is impermanentLeave off lacerating the body faculty with a sharp spear burning blazing and glowingLet me attend only to this So the body is impermanent tactile objects are impermanent bodyconsciousness is impermanent bodycontact is impermanent whatever feeling arises with bodycontact as condition  that too is impermanentLeave off sleepingLet me attend only to this So the mind is impermanent mental phenomena are impermanent mindconsciousness is impermanent mindcontact is impermanent whatever feeling arises with mindcontact as condition  that too is impermanentSeeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye forms eyeconsciousness eyecontact and whatever feeling

birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of beingThis bhikkhus is the Dhamma exposition on the theme of burningAnd what bhikkhus is the Dhamma exposition on the theme of burningit is possible that one will go to one of two destinations hell or the animal realmit is possible that one will go to one of two destinations hell or the animal realmit is possible that one will go to one of two destinations hell or the animal realmfor sleep I say is barren for the living fruitless for the living insensibility for the living than to think such thoughts as would induce one who has come under their control to bring about a schism in the SanghaIn regard to this bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple reflects thus Leave off lacerating the eye faculty with a redhot iron pin burning blazing and glowingfor I saw a person here who abstained from killing living beingsand held right view and I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a state of deprivationeven in hellBecause of that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a state of deprivationeven in hellTherein Ananda as to the person here who kills living beingsand holds wrong view and on thef dissolution of the body after death reappears in a happy destination even in the heavenly world either earlier he did a good action to be felt as pleasant or later he did a good action to be felt as pleasant or at the time of death he acquired and undertook right viewBecause of that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion the venerable Lomasakangiya was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodhas ParkStanding at one side Candana the young deity said to him Bhikkhu do you remember the summary and

the venerable Lomasakangiya set his resting place in order and taking his bowl and outer robe set out to wander by stages to SavatthiHe at length arrived at Savatthi and went to the Blessed One in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park After paying homage to him he sat down at one sideBhikkhu do you know that young deityNo venerable sirBhikkhu that young deity is named CandanaHe heeds the Dhamma gives

Blessed One said this That is what the Blessed One saidThe Venerable Lomasakangiya was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThen when the night was well advanced Candana a young deity of beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of Nigrodhas Park approached the venerable LomasakangiyaBhikkhus wanderers of other sects may ask you Friendsthere are these three thingsWhat threeGreed

Mahakotthita were dwelling at Baranasi in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThen in the evening the Venerable Mahakotthita emerged from seclusion approached the Venerable Sariputta exchanged greetings and said to him Friend Sariputta what are the things that a virtuous bhikkhu should carefully attend toFriend Kotthita a virtuous bhikkhu should carefully attend to the five aggregates subject to clinging

done However when these things are developed and cultivated they lead to a pleasant dwelling in this very life and to mindfulness and clear comprehensionWhat fiveLet not a person revive the past Or on the future build his hopesFor the past has been left behind And the future has not been reachedLet him know that and be sure of it Invincibly unshakeablyIt is he the Peaceful Sage has said Who has one fortunate attachmentwho thereupon vanished at onceand said It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentWho has one fortunate attachmenttold the Blessed One all that had occurredLet not a person revive the past THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Park of the Hot SpringsThen when it was near dawn the venerable Samiddhi went to the hot springs to bathe his limbsAfter bathing he came up out of the water and stood dressed in one robe drying his limbsThen when the night was well advanced a certain deity of beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of the Hot Springs approached the venerable SamiddhiStanding at one side the deity said to him  Bhikkhu do you remember the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentFriend I do not remember the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentBhikkhu I too do not remember the

Has One Fortunate AttachmentBhikkhu the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment is beneficial it belongs to the fundamentals of the holy lifeThat is what was said by the deity who thereupon vanished at onceThen when the night was over the venerable Samiddhi went to the Blessed One After paying homage to him he sat down at one sideThen bhikkhu listen and attend closely to what I shall say Yes venerable sir the venerable Samiddhi repliedThe Blessed One saidInstead with insight let him see Each presently arisen stateToday the effort must be made Tomorrow Death may come who knowsNo bargain with Mortality Can keep him and his hordes awayBut one who dwells thus ardently Relentlessly by day by night That is what the Blessed One said Having said this the Sublime One rose from his seat and went into his dwellingThen soon after the Blessed One had gone the bhikkhus considered Now friends the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaningThen they considered The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life He is capable of expounding the detailed meaningSuppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of thisThen the bhikkhus went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished they sat down to one sideThe venerable Maha Kaccana replied Friends it is as though a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood thought that heartwood should be sought for among the branches and leaves of a great tree standing possessed of heartwood after he had passed over the root and the trunk And so it is with you venerable sirs that you think that I should be asked about the meaning of this after you passed the Blessed One by when you were face to face with the TeacherFor knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he sees he is vision he is knowledge he is the Dhamma he is the holy one he is the sayer the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the TathagataThat was the time when you should have asked the Blessed One the meaning As he told you so you should have remembered itSurely friend Kaccana knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he sees he is visionthe TathagataThat was the time when we should have asked the Blessed One the meaning As he told us so we should have remembered itYet the venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life The venerable Maha Kaccana is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this summary given in brief by the Blessed One without expounding the detailed meaningLet the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it without finding it troublesomeThen listen friends and attend closely to what I shall say Yes friend the bhikkhus repliedThe venerable Maha Kaccana said thisLet not a person revive the pastI understand the detailed meaning of it to be as followsHow friends does one revive the pastThinking My eye was thus in the past and forms were thus ones consciousness becomes bound up with desire and lust for that Because ones consciousness is bound up with desire and lust one delights in that When one delights in that one revives the pastThinking My ear was thus in the past and sounds

Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning that isNow friends if you wish go to the Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this As the Blessed One explains it to you so you should remember itThen the bhikkhus having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Maha Kaccanas words rose from their seats and went to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to him they sat down at one side and told the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had leftMaha Kaccana is wise bhikkhus Maha Kaccana has great wisdomIf you had asked me the meaning of this I would have explained it to you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained itSuch is its meaningThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThen the wanderer Channa approached the Venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings with himWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side We do friendBut what is the danger that you have seen on account of which you prescribe the abandoning of lust hatred and delusionOne excited by lust friend overcome by lust with mind obsessed by it intends for his own affliction for the affliction of others and for the affliction of both and he experiences mental suffering and dejection But when lust is abandoned he does not intend for his own affliction for the affliction of others or for the affliction of both and he does not experience mental suffering and dejectionOne excited by lust overcome by lust with mind obsessed by it engages in misconduct by body speech and mind But when lust is abandoned one does not engage in misconduct by body speech and mindOne excited by lust overcome by lust with mind obsessed by it does not understand as it really is his own good the good of others and the good of both But when lust is abandoned one understands as it really is ones own good the good of others and the good of bothLust leads to blindness loss of vision and lack of knowledge it is obstructive to wisdom  aligned with distress and does not lead to nibbanaOne full of hate overcome by hatred One deluded overcome by delusion with mind obsessed by it intends for his own affliction for the affliction of others and for the affliction of both and he experiences mental suffering and dejection But when delusion is abandoned he does not intend for his own affliction for the affliction of others or for the affliction of both and he does not experience mental suffering and dejectionOne deluded overcome

the good of others and the good of bothDelusion leads to blindness loss of vision and lack of knowledge it is obstructive to wisdom aligned with distress and does not lead to nibbanaHaving seen these dangers in lustBut is there a path friend is there a way to the abandoning of lust hatred and delusion There is a path friend there is a way to the abandoning oflust hatred and delusionIt is just this noble eightfold path that is right view  right concentrationThis is the path the way to the abandoning of lust hatred and delusionExcellent friend is the path excellent the way to the abandoning of lust hatred and delusionIt is enough friend Ananda to be heedfuland said to the Venerable AnandaFriend Ananda do you prescribe the abandoning of lust hatred and delusionhatredand delusion we prescribe their abandoningBut what is the path what is the way to the abandoning oflust hatred and delusionwhat is it that you speak of as I am When you speak of this I am friend KhemakaDo you speak of form as I am or do you speak of I am apart from form Do you speak of feeling  of perception  of volitional formations  of consciousness as I am or do you speak of I am apart from consciousnesswhat is it that you speak of as I amOr alternatively those that yet seek to be as long as they do not reach any posture other than that in which they were bornwhile after that they are called those that areAt Savatthi Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to come to beWhat fourThe nutriment edible food gross or subtle second contact third mental volition fourth consciousnessThese are the four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that have already come to be and for the assistance of those about to come to beAnd how bhikkhus should the nutriment edible food be seenSuppose a couple husband and wife had taken limited provisions and were travelling through a desertThey have with them their only son dear and belovedThen in the middle of the desert their limited provisions would be used up and exhaustedThe husband and wife would think Our limited provisions have been used up and exhaustedwhile the rest of this desert remains to be crossedLet us kill our only son dear and beloved and prepare dried and spiced meat By eating our sons flesh we can cross the rest of this desert Let not all three of us perish Then bhikkhus the husband and wife would kill their only son dear and beloved prepare dried and roasted meat and by eating their sons flesh they would cross the rest of the desertWhile they are eating their sons flesh they would beat their breasts and cry Where are you our only son Where are you our only son What do you think bhikkhus Would they eat that food for amusement or for enjoyment or for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness No venerable sirWouldnt they eat that food only for the sake of crossing the desert Yes venerable sirIt is in such a way bhikkhus that I say the nutriment edible food should be seenSuppose there is a flayed cow If she stands exposed to a wallthe creatures dwelling in the wall would nibble at herIf she stands exposed to a tree the creatures dwelling in the tree would nibble at herIf she stands exposed to water the creatures dwelling in the water would nibble at herIf she stands exposed to the open air the creatures dwelling in the open air would nibble at herWhatever that flayed cow stands exposed to the creatures dwelling there would nibble at herIt is in such a way bhikkhus that I say the nutriment contact should be seenWhen the three kinds of feeling are fully understood I say there is nothing further that a noble disciple needs to doSuppose there is a charcoal pit deeper than a mans height filled with glowing coals without flame or smokeA man would come along wanting to live not wanting to die desiring happiness and averse to sufferingThen two strong men would grab him by both arms and drag him towards the charcoal pitThe mans volition would be to get far away his longing would be to get far away his wish would be to get far away from the charcoal pitFor what reasonBecause he knows I will fall into ths charcoal pit and on that account I will meet death or deadly sufferingIt is in such a way bhikkhus that I say the nutriment mental volition should be seenWhen the three kinds of craving are fully understood I say there is nothing further that a noble disciple needs to doSuppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and bring him before the king saying Sire this man is a bandit a criminal Impose on him whatever punishment you wishThe king says to them Go men in the morning strike this man with a hundred spearsIn the morning they strike him with a hundred spearsThen at noon the king asks Men hows that man Still alive sire Then go and at noon strike him with a hundred spearsAt noon they strike him with a hundred spearsThen in the evening the king asks Men hows that man Still alive sire Then go and in the evening strike him with a hundred spearsIn the evening they strike him with a hundred spearsWhat do you think bhikkhus Would that man being struck with three hundred spears experience pain and displeasure on that account Venerable sir even if he were struck with one spear he would experience pain and displeasure on that account not to speak of three hundred spearsIt is in such a way bhikkhus that I say the nutriment consciousness should be seenWhen the nutriment consciousness is fully understood nameandform is fully understood When nameandform is fully understood I say there is nothing further that a noble disciple needs to do while the rest of the desert remains to be crossedWhen the nutriment edible food is fully understood lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure is fully understoodWhen lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure is fully understood there is no fetter bound by which a noble disciple might come back again to this worldAnd how bhikkhus should the nutriment contact be seenWhen the nutriment contact is fully understood the three kinds of feeling are fully understoodAnd how bhikkhus should the nutriment mental volition be seenWhen the nutriment mental volition is fuIly understood the three kinds of craving are fully understoodAnd how bhikkhus should the nutriment consciousness be seenThe dart of sorrow wounds the heartThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus BhikkhusVenerable sir those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus when a bhikkhu is making a thorough investigation in what way should he thoroughly investigate for the utterly complete destruction of sufferingVenerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One take recourse in the Blessed OneIt would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember itThen listen and attend closely bhikkhus I will speakYes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisHere bhikkhus when he makes a thorough investigation a bhikkhu thoroughly investigates thus The many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world headed by aginganddeath what is the source of this suffering what is its origin from what is it born and producedWhen what exists does aginganddeath come to be When what does not exist does aginganddeath not come to be As he thoroughly investigates he understands thus The many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world headed by aginganddeath this suffering has birth as its source birth as its origin it is born and produced from birthWhen there is birth aginganddeath comes to be when there is no birth aginganddeath does not come to beHe understands aginganddeath its origin its cessation and the way leading on that is in conformity with its cessation He practises that way and conducts himself accordingly This is called a bhikkhu who is practising for the utterly complete destruction of suffering for the cessation of aginganddeathThen investigating further he thoroughly investigates thus What is the source of this birth what is its origin from what is it born and producedWhat is the source of this existence this clinging  this craving  this feeling  this contact  these six sense bases this nameandform this consciousness What is the source of these volitional formations what is their origin from what are they born and produced When what exists do volitional formations come to be When what does not exist do volitional formations not come to be As he thoroughly investigates he understands thus Volitional formations have ignorance as their source ignorance as their origin they are born and produced from ignorance When there is ignorance volitional formations come to be when there is no ignorance volitional formations do not come to beHe understands volitional formations their origin their cessation and the way leading on that is in conformity with their cessation He practises that way and conducts himself accordingly This is called a bhikkhu who is practising for the utterly complete destruction of suffering for the cessation of volitional formationsBhikkhus if a person immersed in ignorance generates a meritorious volitional formation consciousness fares on to the meritoriousBut when a bhikkhu has abandoned ignorance and aroused true knowledge then with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge he does not generate a meritorious volitional formation or a demeritorious volitional formation or an imperturbable volitional formationSince he does not generate or fashion volitional formations he does not cling to anything in the world Not clinging he is not agitated Not being agitated he personally attains NibbanaHe understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of beingIf he feels a pleasant feelingl he understands It is impermanent he understands It is not held to he understands It is not delighted inIf he feels a painful feeling he understands t is impermanent he understands It is not held to he understands It is not delighted inIf he feels a neitherpainfulnor pleasant feeling he understands It is impermanent he understands It is not held to he understands It is not delighted inIf he feels a pleasant feeling he feels it detachedWhen he feels a feeling terminating with the body he understands I feel a feeling terminating with the body When he feels a feeling terminating with life he understands I feel a feehg terminating with lifeHe understands With the breakup of the body following the exhaustion of life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right here mere bodily remains will be leftSuppose bhikkhus a man would remove a hot clay pot from a potters kiln and set it on smooth groundSo too when he feels a feeling terminating with the body  terminating with lifeHe understands With the breakup of the body following the exhaustion of life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right here mere bodily remains will be leftWhat do you think bhikkhus can a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed generate a meritorious volitional formation or a demeritorious volitional formation or an imperturbable volitional formationNO venerable sirWhen there are utterly no volitional formations with the cessation of volitional formations would consciousness be discemedNo venerable sirWhen there is utterly no consciousness with the cessation of consciousness would nameandform be discerned No venerable sirWhen there is utterly no nameandformno six sense bases  no contact no feeling no craving no existenceno birth with the cessation of birth would aginganddeath be discernedNo venerable sirGood good bhikkhus It is exactly so and not otherwisePlace faith in me about this bhikkhus resolve on this Be free from perplexity and doubt about thisJust this is the end of suffering if he generates a demeritorious volitional formation consciousness fares on to the demeritoriousif he generates an imperturbable volitional formation consciousness fares on to the imperturbableif he feels a painful feeling he feels it detachedif he feels a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he feels it detachedits heat would be dissipated right there and potsherds would be leftno clinging Then the brahmin JanussonI approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side andgive gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead with the thought Let our gift be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members Let our departed relatives and family members partake of our giftCan our gift Master Gotama actually be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members Can our departed relatives and family members actually partake of our giftOn a right occasion brahmin it can be of benefit not on a wrong occasionBut Master Gotama what is a right occasion and what is a wrong occasionHere brahmin someone destroys life takes what is not given engages in sexual misconduct speaks falsehood speaks divisively speaks harshly indulges in idle chatter he is full of longing has a mind of ill will and holds wrong viewWith the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in hellThis is a wrong occasion when the gift is not of benefit to one living thereSomeone else destroys life  and holds wrong viewWith the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the animal realmHe sustains himself and subsists there on the food of animalsThis too is a wrong occasion when the gift is not of benefit to one living thereStill another abstains from the destruction of life from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from false speech from divisive speech from harsh speech from idle chatter he is without longing of good will and holds right viewWith the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in companionship with human beingsHe sustains himself and subsists there on the food of human beingsThis too is a wrong occasion when the gift is not of benefit to one living thereStill another abstains from the destruction of life and holds right viewWith the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in companionship with the devasHe sustains himself and subsists there on the food of devasThis too is a wrong occasion when the gift is not of benefit to one living thereStill another destroys life  and holds wrong viewWith the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the sphere of afflicted spiritsHe sustains himself and subsists there on the food of afflicted spirits or else he sustains himself there on what his friends companions relatives or family members in this world offer to himThis is a right occasion when the gift is of benefit to one living thereBut Master Gotama who partakes of the gift if that deceased relative or family member has not been reborn in that placeOther departed relatives or family members who have been reborn in that place partake of the giftBut Master Gotama who partakes of the gift if neither that deceased relative or family member nor any others have been reborn in that placeOver this long stretch of time in samsara brahmin it is impossible and inconceivable for that place to be devoid of ones departed relatives and family membersFurther for the donor too it is not

uglyFor what reasonAn enemy does not delight in the beauty of an enemyWhen an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger though he may be well bathed well anointed with trimmed hair and beard dressed in white clothes still he is uglyThis is the first thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or womanFor what reasonAn enemy does not delight when an enemy sleeps wellWhen an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger though he m ay sleep on a couch spread with rugs blankets and covers with an excellent covering of antelope hide with a canopy and red bolsters at both ends stillhe sleeps badlyThis is the second thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or womanFor what reasonAn enemy does not delight in the success of an enemyWhen an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger if he gets what is harmful he thinks I have gotten what is beneficial and if he gets what is beneficial he thinks I have gotten what is harmfulWhen overcome by anger he gets these things that are diametrically opposed they lead to his harm and suffering for a long timeThis is the third thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or womanAgain an enemy wishes for an enemy May he not be wealthyFor what reasonAn enemy does not delight in the wealth of an enemyWhen an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger kings appropriate for the royal treasury any wealth he has acquired by energetic striving amassed by the strength of his arms earned by the sweat of his brow righteous wealth righteously gainedThis is the fourth thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or womanFor what reasonAn enemy does not delight in the fame of an enemyWhen an

his anger spreads outward people become angry on his accountthe deeds that produce torment remote from those that are righteousI will tell you about Listen to them as they areAn angry person slays his father an angry person slays his own motherhis mother the one by whom he was nurtured and who showed him this worldThose beings like oneself each hold their self most dearSome kill themselves with a sword some who are distraught swallow poisonDeeds that involve destroying growth and deeds that cause their own deathThus deaths snare hidden in the heart has taken the form of angerOne should cut it

gorgewhen doing such deeds they do not know that defeat is born of angerIn such a way one should train in the Dhamma do not yield to recalcitrancetamed having abandoned angerthe taintless ones attain nibbanaAt SavatthiBhikkhus when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all sensual lust it eliminates all lust for existence it eliminates all ignorance it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus in the autumn a ploughman ploughing with a great ploughshare cuts through all the rootlets as he ploughs so too when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all sensual lust  it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus a rushcutter would cut down a rush grab it by the top and shake it down and shake it out and thump it about so too when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all sensual lust it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut all the mangoes attached to the stalk follow along with it so too when the perception of impermanence is developed  it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus all the rafters of a house with a peaked roof lead to the roof peak slope towards the roof peak and converge upon the roof peak and the roof peak is declared to be their chief so too when the perception of impermanence is developed it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus among fragrant roots black orris is declared to be their chief so too when the perception of impermanence is developed it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus among fragrant heartwoods red sandalwood is declared to be their chief so too when the perception of impermanence is developed it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus among fragrant flowers jasmine is declared to be their chief so too when the perception of impermanence is developed it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus all petty princes are the vassals of a wheelturning monarch and the wheelturning monarch is declared to be their chief so too when the perception of impermanence is developed it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus the radiance of all the stars does not amount to a sixteenth part of the radiance of the moon and the radiance of the moon is declared to be their chief so too when the perception of impermanence is developed it uproots all conceit I amJust as bhikkhus in the autumn when the sky is clear and cloudless the sun ascending in the sky dispels all darkness from space as it shines and beams and radiates so too when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all sensual lust it eliminates all lust for existence it eliminates all ignorance it uproots all conceit I amAnd how bhikkhus is the perception of impermanence developed and cultivated so that it eliminates all sensual lust eliminates all lust for existence eliminates all ignorance and uproots all conceit I amSuch is form such its origin such its passing away such is feeling  such is perception such are volitional formations  such is consciousness such its origin such its passing away that is how the perception of impemanence is developed and cultivated so that it eliminates all sensual lust eliminates all lust for existence eliminates all ignorance and uproots all conceit I am Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans where there was a town of the Sakyans named DevadahaThen a number of westwardbound bhikkhus approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideand said to himVenerable sir we wish to go to the western province in order to take up residence thereHave you taken leave of Sgriputta bhikkhusNo venerable sirThen take leave of Sariputta bhikkhusSariputta is

those bhikkhus having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement rose from their seats and paid homage to the Blessed One Then keeping him on their right they approached the Venerable Sariputta They exchanged greetings with the Venerable Sariputtaand when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk they sat down to one sideand said to him Friend Sariputta we wish to go to the western province in order to take up residence thereFriends there are wise khattiyas wise brahmins wise householders and wise ascetics who question a bhikkhu when he has gone abroad for wise people friends are inquisitive What does your teacher say what does he teach I hope that you venerable ones have learned the teachings well grasped them well attended to them well reflected on them well and penetrated them well with wisdom so that when you answer you will state what has been said by the Blessed One and will not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact so that you will explain in accordance with the Dhamma and no reasonable consequence of your assertion would give ground for criticismWe would come from far away friend to learn the meaning of this statement from the Venerable SgriputtaIt would be good indeed if the Venerable Sariputta would clear up the meaning of this statementThen listen and attend closely friends I will speakYes friend those bhikkhus repliedThe Venerable Sariputta said this Being asked thus friends you should answer Our teacher friends teaches the removal of desire and lustWhen you have answered thus friends there may be wise

enters and dwells amidst unwholesome states could dwell happily in this very life without vexation despair and fever and if with the breakup of the body after death he could expect a good destination then the Blessed One would not praise the abandoning of unwholesome statesBut because one who enters and dwells amidst unwholesome states dwells in suffering in this very life with vexation despair

encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma in the assembly hall He was reciting the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentThen in the evening the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the assembly hallHe sat down on a seat made ready and asked the bhikkhus Bhikkhus who has been instructing urging rousing and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma in the assembly hall Who has been reciting the summary and exposition of One Who has One Fortunate AttachmentIt was the venerable Ananda venerable sirThen the Blessed One asked the venerable Ananda Ananda how were you instructing urging rousing and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma and reciting the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentI was doing so thus venerable sir Let not a person revive the past I was instructing urging rousing and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma thus and reciting the summary and exposition of One Who Has One

exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentListen and attend closely to what I shall say Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisLet not a person revive the past Or on the future build his hopesFor the past has been left behind And the future has not been reachedInstead with insight let him see Each presently arisen stateLet him know that and be sure of it Invincibly unshakeablyToday the effort must be made Tomorrow Death may come who knowsNo bargain with Mortality Can keep him and his hordes awayBut one who dwells thus ardently Relentlessly by day by night Thinking I had such material form in the past one finds delight in that Thinking I had such feeling in the pastI had such perception in the pastI had such formations in the pastI had such consciousness in the past one finds delight in that That is how one revives the pastThinking I had such material form in the past one does not find delight in that Thinking I had such feeling in the past had such perception in the past had such formations in the past had such consciousness in the past one does not find delight in that That is how one does not revive the pastAnd how bhikkhus does one build up hope upon the futureThinking I may have such material form in the future one finds delight in that Thinking I may have such feeling in the futureI may have such perception in the future may have such formations in the futureI may have such consciousness in the future one finds delight in that That is how one builds up hope upon the futureAnd how bhikkhus does one not build up hope upon the futureThinking I may have such material form in the future one does not find delight in that Thinking I may have such feeling in the futureI may have such perception in the future may have such formations in the future may have such consciousness in the future one does not find delight in that That is how one does not build up hope upon the futureAnd how bhikkhus is one vanquished in regard to presently arisen statesHere bhikkhus an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in fheir Dhamma who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards material form as self or self as possessed of material form or material form as in self or self as in material form He regards feeling as selfperception as selfformations as self consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness That is how one is vanquished in regard to presently arisen statesAnd how bhikkhus is one invincible in regard to presently arisen statesHere bhikkhus a welltaught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not regard material form as self or self as possessed of material form or material form as in self or self as in material form He does not regard feeling as selfperception as selfformations as selfconsciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness That is how one is invincible in regard to presently arisen statesLet not a person revive the pastSo it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhus I shall teach you the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus suppose there were two houses with doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw people going in and coming out and passing to and fro So too with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate I understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus These worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right views in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldOr these Worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right views in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared among human beingsBut these worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong views in

the world who do evil unwholesome actions indeed have all these many kinds of tortures inflicted on themOh that I might attain the human statethat a Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened might appear in the worldBhikkhus I tell you this not as something I heard from another recluse or brahmin I tell you this as something that I have actually known seen and discovered by myselfThat is what the Blessed One saidWhen the Sublime One had said that the Teacher said furtherBut when by the divine messengers Good people here in this life are warnedClinging they look upon with fear For it produces birth and deathThey dwell in bliss for they are safe And reach Nibbana here and nowThey are beyond all fear and hate They have escaped all sufferingthen he is satisfied with ithe understands thus This painful feeling born of earcontact has arisen in meThat is dependent not independentDependent on whatDependent on contactThen he sees that contact is impermanent that feeling is impermanent that perception is impermanent that formations are impermanent and that consciousness is impermanentAnd his mind having made an element its objective support enters into that new objective support and acquires confidence steadiness and resolutionNow if others attack that bhikkhu in ways that are unwished for undesired and disagreeable by contact with fists clods sticks or kniveshe understands thus This body is of such a nature that contact with fists clods sticks and knives assail itut this has been said by the Blessed One in his advice on the simile of the saw Bhikkhus even if bandits were to sever you savagely limb by limb with a twohandled sawhe who gave rise to a mind of hate towards them would not be carrying out my teachingSo tireless energy shall be aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness established my body shall be tranquil and untroubled my mind concentrated and unifiedAnd now let contact with fists clods sticks and knives assail this bodyfor this teaching of the Buddhas is being practised by meWhen that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in himthen he arouses a sense of urgency thus It is a loss for me it is no gain for me it is bad for me it is no good for methat when I thus recollect the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in meJust as when a daughterinlaw sees her fatherinlaw she arouses a sense of urgency to please him so too when that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in himBut if when he recollects the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha equanimity supported by the wholesome becomes established in him then he is satisfied with itthen he arouses a sense of urgency It is a loss for me it is no gain for me it is bad for me it is no good for methat when I thus recollect the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in meThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder AttadatthaFor when the Teacher was about to pass into Nibbāna he said to his disciples Monks four months hence I shall pass into Nibbāna Thereupon seven hundred monks who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion were deeply moved and never leaving the Teachers side whispered to each other Brethren what are we to doBut Elder Attadattha thought to himself The Teacher says that four months hence he is to pass into Nibbāna Now I have not yet freed myself from the power of the evil passions Therefore so long as the Teacher yet remains alive I will strive with all my might for the attainment of ArahatshipAccordingly Elder Attadattha went no more with the monksNow the monks said to him Brother why is it that you thus avoid our company and no more talk with us And conducting Elder Attadattha to the Teacher they laid the matter before him saying Reverend Sir this Elder does thus and soThe Teacher asked Elder Attadattha Why do you act thus The Elder replied Reverend Sir you have said that four months hence you are to pass into Nibbāna and I have determined that so long as you yet remain alive I will strive with all my might for the attainment of ArahatshipThe Teacher applauded him for his wise decision and said to the monks Monks whosoever sincerely loves me should be like Elder AttadatthaFor truly they honor me not who honor me with perfumes and garlands They only honor me who fulfill the higher and the lower Lawtherefore others also should follow the example of Elder Attadattha So saying he pronounced the following StanzaLet a man not neglect his own good for the good of another however importantA man should learn what is good for himself and apply himself thereto with diligenceThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the lay disciple Culla KālaFor on a certain day just as in the story of Mahā Kāla tunnel thieves were pursued by the owners of the stolen property Now early in the morning the lay disciple Culla Kāla who had spent the night at the monastery listening to the Law came out of the monastery and set out on the road to Sāvatthi The thieves threw down the stolen property in front of that lay disciple and continued their flightWhen the men pursuing the thieves saw the lay disciple they cried out There is the man who played thief last night acting as though he had been listening to the Law Catch him So saying they seized the lay disciple and beat himNow some courtezans on their way to the bathingplace on the river saw the lay disciple and said to his captors Sirs go your way this man did nothing of the sort So saying they obtained his releaseThereupon the lay disciple went to the monastery and told the monks what had happened saying Reverend Sirs I should have been killed by some men had not some courtezans saved my lifeThe monks repeated the story to the TathāgataThe Teacher listened to the story and said Monks the lay disciple Culla Kālas life was indeed saved both through the intercession of courtezans and because he was himself guiltlessFor living beings here in the world by reason of the evil deeds which they themselves commit of themselves suffer in hell and in the other states of sufferingBy self alone is evil done by self alone does one sufferBy self alone is evil left undone by self alone does one obtain SalvationSalvation and Perdition depend upon self no man can save anotherThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the mother of Elder Kumāra KassapaThe story goes that she was the daughter of a treasurer in the city of Rājagaha From the time she reached the age of reason she sought permission to become a nunbut although she asked her mother and father again and again she failed to obtain from them permission to enter the Order On reaching marriageable age she married went to live in her husbands household and amid the cares of the household life proved a devoted wifeNow in no long time she conceived a child in her wombBut she knew not that she was pregnant Winning the favor of her husband she asked to enter the Order and obtained his permission to do soSo not knowing that she was pregnant he conducted her with great pomp to the community of nuns and obtained for her admission to the Order at the hands of the nuns belonging to the faction of DevadattaAfter a time the nuns observed that she was pregnant Said they What does this mean She replied Noble sisters I know not what this may mean but this I know for certain that my chastity is unimpairedSo the nuns conducted her to Devadatta and said to him This nun retired from the world through faith We know not when she conceived this child What therefore shall we doDevadatta thought only Let not reproach be cast upon the nuns who receive instruction from me Therefore he said Expel her from the OrderWhen the young nun heard those words of Devadatta she said Noble sisters do not ruin me But I did not retire from the world at the instance of Devadatta Come conduct me to the Teacher at JetavanaAccordingly they took her with them went to Jetavana and laid the matter before the TeacherNow although the Teacher knew that she had conceived the child when she was living in the world yet for the purpose of disproving the false accusation he summoned King Pasenadi Kosala Mahā Anāthapiṇḍika Culla Anāthapiṇḍika Visākhā the female lay disciple and other great personages giving the following orders to the Elder Upāli Go clear this young woman of the charge against her in the midst of the Fourfold AssemblyThe Elder caused Visākhā to be summoned before the king and put the case in her handsVisākhā caused a curtain to be drawn about the young woman and within the curtain made an examination of her hands feet navel belly and extremities Then she computed the months and days and perceiving that the young woman had conceived the child when she was living in the world informed the Elder of that factThereupon the Elder proclaimed her innocence in the midst of the Fourfold AssemblyAfter a time she brought forth a son strong and mighty for whom she had prayed at the feet of the Buddha PadumuttaraNow one day as the king was passing near the community of nuns he heard the cry of a child What is that he asked Your majesty they replieda certain nun has given birth to a child that is the sound of his voice So the king took the boy to his own house and committed him to the care of his daughtersOn the day appointed for the naming of the child they gave him the name Kassapa But because he had been brought up in princely state all the people called him Prince Kassapa Kumāra KassapaOne day on the playground he struck some boys They cried out We have been struck by that MotherlessFatherless Kassapa immediately ran to the king and said to him Your majesty they say I have neither mother nor father tell me who my mother is The king pointed to his daughters and said There are your mothers But the boy replied I have not so many mothers as that by right I should have only one mother tell me who she isThe king thought to himself It is impossible to deceive this boy So he said to him Dear boy your mother is a nun and I brought you here from the nuns conventNo more than this was needed to arouse deep emotion in the heart of the boy He immediately said Dear friend obtain for me admission to the OrderVery well dear boy replied the king So with great pomp he conducted the boy to the Teacher and had him admitted to the OrderAfter he had made his full profession he became known as Elder Kumāra KassapaReceiving a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher he retired to the forest But although he strove and struggled with might and main he was unable to develop Specific Attainment So thinking to himself I will obtain a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher better suited to my needs he returned to the Teacher and took up his residence in Andha GroveNow a monk who in the time of the Buddha Kassapa had performed his meditations alone and had attained the Fruit of the Third Path and had been reborn in the World of Brahmā returned from the World of Brahmā and asked Kumāra Kassapa fifteen questions but sent him away with the words None other than the Teacher can resolve these questions Go to the Teacher and get their solutionKumāra Kassapa did so and at the end of the answers to the questions attained ArahatshipNow for twelve years following Kassapas retirement from the world tears streamed from the eyes of the nun his motherWith face wet with the tears she shed because of the suffering caused her by separation from her son she went on her rounds for alms One day she saw her son the Elder in the street Crying out My son my son she ran to meet him and falling at his feet rolled on the groundMilk streamed from her breasts and her robe was wet as she rose from the ground and took the Elder in her armsThe Elder thought to himself If she receives kindly words from me it will mean her undoingtherefore I will speak harshly to herSo he said to her What are you about Can you not away with human affectionThought the mother How like a brigand he talks And she said to him Dear son what say you But he only repeated again the same harsh words Thereupon she thought Ah because of him I have not been able to restrain my tears for twelve years But he has hardened his heart towards me why should I have anything to do with him any more And then and there uprooting affection for her son on that very day she attained ArahatshipSome time afterwards the monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth Devadatta all but destroyed Kumāra Kassapa endowed with the faculties requisite for Conversion and the nun his motherbut the Teacher became their refuge Oh how great is the compassion of the Buddhas for the worldAt that moment the Teacher approached and asked them Monks what subject are you discussing now as you sit here all gathered together When they told him he said Monks this is not the first time I have been their refuge and defense I was their refuge in a previous state of existence also So saying he related the Nigrodha Jātaka in detailFollow only the Banyan deer abide not with the BranchBetter death with the Banyan deer than life with the BranchThen said the Teacher identifying the characters in the Jātaka At that time the Branch deer was Devadatta and the herd of the Branch deer was the retinue of Devadatta the doe that reached her turn was the nun her fawn was Kumāra Kassapa and the Banyan deer the king of the deer who offered his life for the doe with young was I myself And praising the nun for uprooting affection for her son and for establishing herself as a refuge for herself he said Monks inasmuch as the goal of heaven or the goal of the Paths which one man has earned for himself cannot become the property of another therefore self is the refuge of self How can one man be the refuge of another So saying he pronounced the following StanzaFor by his own welltamed self A man gains for himself a refuge which is hard to gainFor self is the refuge of self Indeed how can one man be the refuge of anotherIt is he the Peaceful Sage has said Who has one fortunate attachmentHow bhikkhus does one revive the pastAnd how bhikkhus does one not revive the pastAt SavatthiBhikkhus form is impermanentThe cause and condition for the arising of form is also impermanentAs form has originated from what is impermanent how could it be permanentFeeling is impermanentPerception is impermanent Volitional formations are impermanentConsciousness is impermanentThe cause and condition for the arising of consciousness is also impermanentAs consciousness has originated from what is impermanent how could it be permanentSeeing thus He understands  there is no more for this state of being At SgvatthiThen a certain bhikkhu  Sitting to one side that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One Venerable sir is there any form that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and that will remain the same just like eternity itselfIs there venerable sir any feelingany perceptionany volitional formationsBhikkhu there is no form that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and that will remain the same just like eternity itselfThere is no feeling no perception no volitional formations no consciousness that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and that will remain the same just like eternity itselfThen the Blessed One took up a little lump of cowdung in his hand and said to that bhikkhu Bhikkhu there is not even this much individual existence that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and that will remain the same just like eternity itselfIf there was this much individual existence that was permanent stable eternal not subject to change this living of the holy life for the complete destruction of suffering could not be discernedIn the past bhikkhu I was a headanointed khattiya kingI had  palaces the chief of which was the palace named DhammaI had  halls with peaked roofs the chief of which was the hall named the Great ArrayI had  couches made of ivory of heartwood of gold and silver decked with long haired coverlets embroidered with flowers with choice spreads made of antelope hides with red awnings overhead and red cushions at both endsI had  bull elephants with golden ornaments and golden banners covered with nets of golden thread the chief of which was the royal bull elephant named UposathaI had  chariots with golden ornaments and golden banners covered with nets of golden thread the chief of which was the chariot named VejayantaI had  jewels the chief of which was the jewelgemI had  women the chief of whom was Queen SubhaddaI had  vassals of the khattiya caste the chief of whom was the commandergemI had  cows with tethers of fine jute and milk pails of bronzeI had  kotis of garments made of fine linen of fine silk of fine wool of fine cottonI had  plates on which my meals were served both in the morning and in the eveningOf those  cities bhikkhu there was only one city in which I resided at that time the capital KusavatiOf those  palaces there was only one palace in which I resided at that time the palace named DhammaOf those  halls with peaked roof there was only one hall with peaked roof in which I resided at that time the hall named the Great ArrayOf those  couches there was only one couch that I used at that time one made either of ivory or of heartwood or of gold or of silverOf those  elephants there was only one elephant that I rode at that time the royal bull elephant named UposathaOf those  steeds there was only one steed that I rode at thal time the royal steed named ValahakaOf those  chariots there was only one chariot that I rode in at that time the charioi named VejayantaOf those  women there was only one woman who waited on me at that time either a khattiya maiden or a velamika maidenOf those  plates there was only one plate from which I ate at most a measure of rice with a suitable curryThus bhikkhu all those formations have passed ceased changedSo impermanent are formations bhikkhuso unstableany consciousness that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and that will remain the same just like eternity itselfBut because there is not even this much individual existence that is permanent stable eternal not subject to change this living of the holy life for the complete destruction of suffering is discernedI had  cities the chief of which was the capital KusavatiI had  steeds with golden ornaments and golden banners covered with nets of golden thread the chief of which was the royal steed named ValghakaOf those  kotis of garments there was only one pair of garments that I wore at that time one made either of fine linen or of fine silk or of fine wool or of fine cottonIt is enough bhikkhu to feel revulsion towards all formations enough to become dispassionate towards them enough to be liberated from themso unreliableWho has one fortunate attachmentThat is what the Blessed One saidWho has one fortunate attachmentLet not a person revive the past Who has one fortunate attachmentThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Saketa at Kalakas ParkVenerable sir  those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma among this population with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after examined by the mind that I knowBhikkhusin this world with its devas Mara and Brahma among this population with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after examined by the mind that I have directly knownIt has been known by the Tathagata but the Tathagata did not become subservient to itBhikkhus if I were to say In this world with its devas  whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after examined by the mind that I both know and do not know that too would be just the sameSo having seen what can be seen the Tathagata does not misconceive the seen does not misconceive the unseen does not misconceive what can be seen does not misconceive one who sees Having heard what can be heard he does not misconceive the heard does not misconceive the unheard does not misconceive what can be heard does not misconceive one who hears Having sensed what can be sensed he does not misconceive the sensed does not misconceive the unsensed does not misconceive what can be sensed does not misconceive one who senses Having cognized what can be cognized he does not misconceive the cognized does not misconceive the uncognized does not misconceive what can be cognized does not misconceive one who cognizesThus bhikkhus being ever stable among things seen heardsensed and cognized the Tathagata is a stable oneheard or sensedclung toSince they have already seen this dartThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus BhikkhusBhikkhus if I were to say In this world with its devas  whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after examined by the mind that I do not know that would be a falsehood on my partBhikkhus if I were to say In this world with its devas whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after examined by the mind  that I neither know nor do not know that would be a fault on my partthe Tathagatas cling to nothingsaying I know I see it is just soto which people cling and adhereAmid those who are selfconstrained the Stable Onewould not posit as categorically true or false anything seenand considered truth by othersAnd I say there is no stable one more excellent or sublime than that stable oneOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion after their meal on returning from their alms round a number of bhikkhus had assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together engaging in various kinds of pointless talk that is talk about kings thieves and ministers of state talk about armiesperils and wars talk about food drink garments and bedstalk about garlands and scents talk about relatives vehiclesvillages towns cities and countries talk about women and talk about heroes street talk and talk by the well talk about the departed miscellaneous talk speculation about the world and the sea talk about becoming this or thatThen in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the assembly hall where he sat down on the prepared seatThe Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus Bhikkhus what discussion were you engaged in just now as you were sitting together here What was the conversation that was underwayHere Bhante after our meal on returning from our alms round we assembled in the assembly hall and were sitting together engaging in various kinds of pointless talk that istalk about kings thieves and ministers of state  talk about becoming this or thatBhikkhus it is not suitable for you clansmen who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith to engage in various kinds of pointless talk that is talk about kings thieves and ministers of state talk about becoming this or thatThere are bhikkhus these ten topics of discussionWhat tenTalk on fewness of desires on contentment on solitudeon not being bound up with others on arousing energy on virtuous behavior on concentration on wisdom on liberationon knowledge and vision of liberation These are the ten topics of discussionIf bhikkhus you engage in discussion on any of these ten topics your splendor might surpass even the splendor of the sun and moon as powerful and mighty as they are how much more then that of the wanderers of other sects Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park Bhikkhus the uninstructed worldling might experience revulsion towards this body composed of the four great elements he might become dispassionate towards it and be liberated from itFor what reason Because growth and decline is seen in this body composed of the four great elements it is seen being taken up and laid asideTherefore the uninstructed worldling might experience revulsion towards this body composed of the four great elements he might become dispassionate towards it and be liberated from itBut bhikkhus as to that which is called mind and mentality and consciousness the uninstructed worldling is unable to experience revulsion towards it unable to become dispassionate towards it and be liberated from itFor what reasonBecause for a long time this has been held to by him appropriated and grasped thus This is mine this I am this is my selfTherefore the uninstructed worldling is unable to experience revulsion towards it unable to become dispassionate towards it and be liberated from itIt would be better bhikkhus for the uninstructed worldling to take as self this body composed of the four great elements rather than the mindFor what reasonBecause this body composed of the four great elements is seen standing for one year for two years for three four five or ten years for twenty thirty forty or fifty years for a hundred years or even longerJust as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch lets that go and grabs another then lets that go and grabs still another so too that which is called mind and mentality and consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by nightTherein bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple attends closely and carefully to dependent origination itself thus When this exists that comes to be with the arising of this that arises When this does not exist that does not come to be with the cessation of this that ceases That is with ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be with volitional formations as condition consciousness Such is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingBut with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations with the cessation of volitional formations cessation of consciousness Such is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingSeeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousness Experiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is liberated When it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberatedHe understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being But that which is called mind and mentality and consciousness arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by nightThen in the evening the Venerable Bhtimija emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Sariputta He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Sariputtasome ascetics and brahmins proponents of kamma maintain that pleasure and pain are created both by oneself and by anotherNow friend Sariputta what does the Blessed One say about this What does he teach How should we answer if we are to state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact And how should we explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that no reasonable consequence of our assertion would give ground for criticismFriend the Blessed One has said that pleasure and pain are dependently arisenDependent on whatDependent on contactIf one were to speak thus one would be stating what has been said by the Blessed One and would not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact one would explain in accordance with the Dhamma and no reasonable consequence of ones assertion would give ground for criticismTherein friend

homage to him sat down to one sideand reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation between the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable BhumijaThe Blessed One said Good good Ananda Anyone answering rightly would answer just as Sariputta has doneI have said ananda that pleasure and pain are dependently arisenDependent on whatDependent on contactIf one were to speak thus one would be

dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow on that occasion the following pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named Yamaka As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathA number of bhikkhus heard that such a pernicious view had arisen in the bhikkhu YamakaThen they approached the Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with himIs it true friend Yamaka that such a pernicious view as this has arisen in you As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathExactly so friendsAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathFriend Yamaka do not speak thus Do not misrepresent the Blessed OneIt is not good to misrepresent the Blessed OneThe Blessed One would not speak thus A bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathYet although he was admonished by the bhikkhus in this way the Venerable Yamaka still obstinately grasped that pernicious view adhered to it and declared As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathSince those bhikkhus were unable to detach the Venerable Yamaka from that pernicious view they rose from their seats approached the Venerable Sariputta and told him all that had occurred addingThe Venerable Sariputta consented by silenceThen in the evening the Venerable Sariputta emerged from seclusion He approached the Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him after which he sat down to one side and said to himIs it true friend Yamaka that such a pernicious view as this has arisen in you As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathExactly so friendWhat do you think friend Yamaka is form permanent or impermanent Therefore Seeing thus  He understands  there is no more for this state of beingWhat do you think friend Yamaka do you regard form as the Tathagata No friend  Do you regard feelingperception  volitional formations  consciousness as the Tathagata No friendWhat do you think friend Yamaka do you regard the Tathagata as in form No friend Do you regard the Tathagata as apart from form No friend Do you regard the Tathagata as in feeling As apart from feeling As in perception As apart from perception As in volitional formations As apart from volitional formations As in consciousnessWhat do you think friend Yamaka do you regard form feeling perception volitional formations and consciousness taken together as the Tathagata No friendWhat do you think friend Yamaka do you regard the Tathagata as one who is without form without feeling without perception without volitional formations without consciousness NO friend But friend when the Tathagata is not apprehended by you as real and actual here in this very life is it fitting for you to declare As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after deathFormerly friend Sariputta when I was ignorant I did hold that pernicious view but now that I have heard this Dhamma teaching of the Venerable Sariputta I have abandoned that pernicious view and have made the breakthrough to the DhammaIf friend Yamaka they were to ask you Friend Yamaka when a bhikkhu is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed what happens to him with the breakup of the body after deathbeing asked thus what would you answerIf they were to ask me this friendI would answer thus Friends form is impermanentFeeling  PerceptionVolitional formationsConsciousness is impermanent what is impermanent is suffering what is suffering has ceased and passed awayBeing asked thus friend I would answer in such a wayGood good friend YamakaNow friend Yamaka I will make up a simile for you in order to convey this same meaning even more clearlySuppose friend Yamaka there was a householder or a householders son a rich man with much wealth and property protected by a bodyguardThen some man would appear who wanted to ruin him to harm him to endanger him to take his lifeIt would occur to that man This householder or householders son is a rich man with much wealth and property protected by a bodyguard It wont be easy to take his life by forceLet me get close to him and then take his lifeThen he would approach that householder or householders son and say to him I would serve you sirThen the householder or householders son would appoint him as a servantThe man would serve him rising up before him retiring after him doing whatever he wants agreeable in his conduct endearing in his speechThe householder or householders son would consider him a friend a bosom friend and he would place trust in himBut when the man becomes aware that the householder or householders son has placed trust in him then finding him alone he would take his life with a sharp knifeWhat do you think friend Yamaka when that man had approached that householder or householders son and said to him I would serve you sir wasnt he a murderer even thenAnd when the man was serving him rising up before him retiring after him doing whatever he wants agreeable in his conduct endearing in his speech wasnt he a murderer then tooAnd when the man came upon him while he was alone and took his life with a sharp knife wasnt he a murderer then tooYes friendSo too friend Yamaka the uninstructed worldling who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in formHe regards feeling as self  perception as self volitional formations as self  consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousnessHe does not understand as it really is impermanent form as impermanent formimpermanent feeling as impermanent feelingimpermanent perception as impermanent perceptionimpermanent volitional formations as impermanent volitional formationsimpermanent consciousness as impermanent consciousnessHe does not understand as it really is painful form as painful formpainful feeling as painful feeling painful perception as painful perception  painful volitional formations as painful volitional formations painful consciousness as painful consciousnessHe does not understand as it really is selfless form as selfless formselfless feeling as selfless feeling selfless perception as selfless perception selfless volitional formations as selfless volitional formations selfless consciousness as selfless consciousnessHe does not understand as it really is conditioned form as conditioned formconditioned feeling as conditioned feeling conditioned perception as conditioned perception conditioned volitional formations as conditioned volitional formations conditioned consciousness as conditioned consciousnessHe does not understand as it really is murderous form as murderous form murderous feeling as murderous feeling murderous perception as murderous perception murderous volitional formations as murderous volitional formationsHe becomes engaged with form clings to it and takes a stand upon it as my selfHe becomes engaged with feeling  with perception with volitional formations with consciousness clings to it and takes a stand upon it as my selfThese same five aggregates of clinging to which he becomes engaged and to which he clings lead to his harm and suffering for a long timeBut friend the instructed noble disciple who is a seer of the noble ones does not regard form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in formHe does not regard feeling as self perception as self volitional formations as self consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousnessHe understands as it really is impermanent form as impermanent formimpermanent consciousness as impermanent consciousnesspainful consciousness as painful consciousnessHe understands as it really is selfless form as selfless formselfless consciousness as selfless consciousnessHe understands as it really is conditioned form as conditioned formconditioned consciousness as conditioned consciousnessHe understands as it really is murderous form as murderous formmurderous consciousness as murderous consciousnessHe does not become engaged with form cling to it and take a stand upon it as my selfHe does not become engaged with feeling with perception with volitional formations with consciousness cling to it and take a stand upon it as my selfThese same five aggregates of clinging to which he does not become engaged and to which he does not cling lead to his welfare and happiness for a long timeSo it is friend Sariputta for those venerable ones who have such compassionate and benevolent brothers in the holy life to admonish and instruct themAnd now that I have heard this Dhamma teaching of the Venerable Sariputta my mind is liberated from the taints by nonclinging  This is what the Venerable Sariputta said Elated the Venerable Yamaka delighted in the Venerable Sariputtas statementafter which they sat down to one sideand said to himIt would be good if the Venerable Sariputta would approach the bhikkhu Yamaka out of compassion for him Impermanent friend No friendAS apart from consciousnesswhat is impermanent is suffering what is suffering has ceased and passed awaythough the other did not recognize him as my murdererthough the other did not recognize him as my murdererthough the other did not recognize him as my murderermurderous consciousness as murderous consciousnessHe understands as it really is painful form as painful formAt SsvatthiBhikkhus those ascetics and brahmins who recollect their manifold past abodes all recollect the five aggregates subject to clinging or a certain one among themWhen recollecting thus bhikkhus I had such form in the past it is just form that one recollectsWhen recollecting I had such a feeling in the past it is just feeling that one recollectsWhen recollecting I had such a perception in the past it is just perception that one recollects When recollecting I had such volitional formations in the past it is just volitional formations that one recollects When recollecting I had such consciousness in the past it is just consciousness that one recollectsAnd why bhikkhus do you call it formIt is deformed bhikkhus therefore it is called formDeformed by whatDeformed by cold deformed by heat deformed by hunger deformed by thirst deformed by contact with flies mosquitoes wind sun and serpentsIt is deformed bhikkhus therefore it is called formAnd why bhikkhus do you call it feelingIt feels bhikkhus therefore it is called feelingIt feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neitherpainnorpleasureIt feels bhikkhus therefore it is called feelingAnd why bhikkhus do you call it perceptionIt perceives bhikkhus therefore it is called perceptionAnd what does it perceiveIt perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives whiteIt perceives bhikkhus therefore it is called perceptionAnd why bhikkhus do you call them volitional formationsThey construct the conditioned bhikkhus therefore they are called volitional formationsAnd what is the conditioned that they constructThey construct conditioned form as form they construct conditioned feeling as feeling they construct conditioned perception as perception they construct conditioned volitional formations as volitional formations they construct conditioned consciousness as consciousnessThey construct the conditioned bhikkhus therefore they are called volitional formationsAnd why bhikkhus do you call it consciousnessIt cognizes bhikkhus therefore it is called consciousnessAnd what does it cognizeIt cognizes sour it cognizes bitter it cognizes pungent it cognizes sweet it cognizes sharp it cognizes mild it cognizes salty it cognizes blandIt cognizes bhikkhus therefore it is called consciousnessTherein bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple reflects thus I am now being devoured by formIn the past too I was devoured by form in the very same way that I am now being devoured by present formIf I were to seek delight in future form then in the future too I shall be devoured by form in the same way that I am now being devoured by present formHaving reflected thus he becomes indifferent towards past form he does not seek delight in future form and he is practising for revulsion towards present form for its fading away and cessationHe reflects thus I am now being devoured by feelingI am now being devoured by perceptionI am now being devoured by volitional formationsI am now being devoured by consciousnessIn the past too I was devoured by consciousness in the very same way that I am now being devoured by present consciousnessIf I were to seek delight in future consciousness then in the future too I shall be devoured by consciousness in the very same way that I am now being devoured by present consciousnessHaving reflected thus he becomes indifferent towards past consciousness he does not seek delight in future consciousness and he is practising for revulsion towards present consciousness for its fading away and cessationWhat do you think bhikkhus is form permanent or impermanentIs feeling perception  volitional formations consciousness permanent or impermanent Impermanent venerable sir Is what is impermanent sufferring or happiness Suffering venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self No venerable sirTherefore bhikkhus any kind of form whatsoever Any kind of feeling whatsoever  Any kind of perception whatsoever Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever  any kind of consciousness whatsoever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfThis is called bhikkhus a noble disciple who dismantles and does not build up who abandons and does not cling who scatters and does not amass who extinguishes and does not kindleHe dismantles form and does not build it up He dismantles feeling perception volitional formations consciousness and does not build it upAnd what is it that he abandons and does not cling toHe abandons form and does not cling to it He abandons feeling perception volitional formations  consciousness and does not cling to itAnd what is it that he scatters and does not amassHe scatters form and does not amass it He scatters feeling perception volitional formations  consciousness and does not amass itAnd what is it that he extinguishes and does not kindleHe extinguishes form and does not kindle it He extinguishes feeling perception volitional formations consciousness and does not kindle itSeeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousnessExperiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is liberatedWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberatedHe understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of beingThis is called bhikkhus a noble disciple who neither builds up nor dismantles but who abides having dismantled who neither abandons nor clings but who abides having abandoned who neither scatters nor amasses but who abides having scattered who neither extinguishes nor kindles but who abides having extinguishedHe neither builds up nor dismantles form but abides having dismantled it He neither builds up nor dismantles feeling perception volitional formations  consciousness but abides having dismantled itAnd what is it that he neither abandons nor clings to but abides having abandonedHe neither abandons nor clings to form but abides having abandoned it He neither abandons nor clings to feeling  perception  volitional formations consciousness but abides having abandoned itAnd what is it that he neither scatters nor amasses but abides having scatteredHe neither scatters nor amasses form but abides having scattered it He neither scatters nor amasses feeling volitional formations consciousness but abides having scattered itAnd what is it that he neither extinguishes nor kindles but e abides having extinguishedHe neither extinguishes nor kindles form but abides having extinguished it He neither extinguishes nor kindles feeling perception volitional formations consciousness but abides having extinguished itWhen bhikkhus a bhikkhu is thus liberated in mind the devas together with Indra Brahma and Pajapati pay homage to him from afarHomage to you o thoroughbred man Homage to you o highest among menWe ourselves do not directly know Dependent upon what you meditate What fiveAnd what does it feelAnd what is it that he dismantles and does not build upAnd what is it bhikkhus that he neither builds up nor dismantles but abides having dismantled Impermanent venerable sir Is what is impermanent sufferring or happiness Suffering venerable sir Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self No venerable sirOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkThen in the morning the Blessed One dressed and taking bowl and robe entered Kosambi for alms When he had walked for alms in Kosambi and had returned from the alms round after his meal he set his lodging in order himself took his bowl and robe and without informing his personal attendants without taking leave of the Bhikkhu Sangha he set out on tour alone without a companion Then not long after the Blessed One had departed a certain bhikkhu approached the Venerable Ananda and told him Friend Ananda the Blessed One has set his lodging in order himself taken his bowl and robe and without informing his personal attendants without taking leave of the Bhikkhu Sangha he has set out on tour alone without a companionFriend whenever the Blessed One sets out like that he wishes to dwell alone On such an occasion the Blessed One should not be followed by anyoneThen the Blessed One wandering by stages arrived at ParileyyakaThere at Parileyyaka the Blessed One dwelt at the foot of an auspicious sal treeThen the Venerable handa together with those bhikkhu approached the Blessed One at Parileyyaka at the foot of the auspicious sal tree Having approached they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one sideThe Blessed One there instructed exhorted inspired and gladdened those bhikkhus with a Dhamma talkNOW on that occasion a reflection arose in the mind of a certain bhikkhu thus How should one know how should one see for the immediate destruction of the taints to occurThe Blessed One having known with his own mind the reflection in that bhikkhus mind addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus this Dhamma has been taught by me discriminately The four establishments of mindfulness have been taught by me discriminately The four right strivings  The four bases for spiritual power The five spiritual faculties The five powers The seven factors of enlightenment The Noble Eightfold Path has been taught by me discriminatelyBhikkhus in regard to the Dhamma that has been thus taught by me discriminately a reflection arose in the mind of a certain bhikkhu thus How should one know how should one see for the immediate destruction of the taints to occurAnd how bhikkhus should one know how should one see for the immediate destruction of the taints to occurHere bhikkhus the uninstructed worldling who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards form as selfThat regarding bhikkhus is a formationWhen the uninstructed worldling is contacted by a feeling born of ignorancecontact craving arises thence that formation is bornThus bhikkhus that formation is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenWhen one knows and sees thus bhikkhus the immediate destruction of the taints occursHe may not regard form as self but he regards self as possessing formThat regarding is a formation When one knows and sees thus bhikkhus the immediate destruction of the taints occursHe may not regard form as self or self as possessing form but he regards form as in selfHe may not regard form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self but he regards self as in formThat regarding is a formationHe may not regard form as self  or self as in form but he regards feeling as self perception as self volitional formations as self consciousness as self self as in consciousnessThat regarding is a formationHe may not regard form as self   or self as in consciousness but he holds such a view as this That which is the self is the world having passed away that I shall be permanent stable eternal not subject to changeThat eternalist view is a formationWhen one knows and sees thus bhikkhus the immediate destruction of the taints occursHe may not regard form as self or hold such an eternalist viewThat annihilationist view is a formationHe may not regard form as self or hold such an annihilationist view but he is perplexed doubtful indecisive in regard to the true DhammaThat perplexity doubtfulness indecisiveness in regard to the true Dhamma is a formationThat formation  what is its source what is its origin from what is it born and producedWhen the uninstructed worldling is contacted by a feeling born of ignorancecontact craving arises thence that formation is bornWhen one knows and sees thus bhikkhus the immediate destruction of the taints occursWhen he had walked for alms in Kosambi and had returned from the alms round after his meal he set his lodging in order himself took his bowl and robe and without informing his personal attendants without taking leave of the Bhikkhu Sangha he set out on tour alone without a companionThen not long after the Blessed One had departed a certain bhikkhu approached the Venerable Ananda and told him Friend Ananda the Blessed One has set his lodging in order himself taken his bowl and robe and without informing his personal attendants without taking leave of the Bhikkhu Sangha he has set out on tour alone without a companionThen a number of bhikkhus approached the Venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings with himand said to the Venerable handa Friend Ananda it has been a long time since we heard a Dhamma talk in the presence of the Blessed One We should like to hear such a talk friend handaWhen they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk they sat down to one sideThat formation  what is its source what is its origin from what is it born and producedthat craving is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenthat feeling is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenthat contact is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenthat ignorance is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenThat regarding is a formationWhen one knows and sees thus bhikkhus the immediate destruction of the taints occursbut he holds such a view as this I might not be and it might not be for me I will not be and it will not be for methat ignorance is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenthat contact is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenthat feeling is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenthat craving is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenSo that formation bhikkhus is impermanent conditioned dependently arisenOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Ansthapinikas ParkNow on that occasion the bhikkhuni Khema while wandering on tour among the Kosalans had taken up residence in Toranavatthu between Savatthi and SaketaThen King Pasenadi of Kosala while travelling from Saketa to Savatthi took up residence for one night in Toranavatthu between Saketa and SavatthiThen King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed a man thus Go good man and find out whether there is any ascetic or brahmin in Toranavatthu whom I could visit todayYes sire the man replied but though he traversed the whole of Toranavatthu he did not see any ascetic or brahmin there whom King Pasenadi could visitThe man did see however the bhikkhuni Khema resident in ToranavatthuLet your majesty visit herThen King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the bhikkhuni Khema paid homage to her sat down to one sideand said to her How is it revered lady does the Tathagata exist after deathGreat king the Blessed One has not declared this The Tathagata exists after deathThen revered lady does the Tathagata not exist after deathGreat king the Blessed One has not declared this either The Tathagata does not exist after deathHow is it then revered lady does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after deathGreat king the Blessed One has not declared this The TathSgata both exists and does not exist after deathThen revered lady does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after deathGreat king the Blessed One has not declared this either The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathHow is this revered lady When asked How is it revered lady does the Tathagata exist after death  And when asked I Then revered lady does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death in each case you say Great king the Blessed One has not declared thisWhat now revered lady is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed OneWell then great king I will question you about this same matterAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think great king Do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician who can count the grains of sand in the river Ganges thus There are so many grains of sand or There are so many hundreds of grains of sand or There are so many thousands of grains of sand or There are so many hundreds of thousands of grains of sandNo revered ladyThen great king do you have an accountant or calculator or I mathematician who can count the water in the great ocean thus There are so many gallons of water or There are so many hundreds of gallons of water or There are so many thousands of gallons of water or There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of waterNo revered ladyFor what reasonBecause the great ocean is deep immeasurable hard to fathomSo too great king that form by which one describing the Tathagata might describe him has been abandoned by the Tathagata cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arisingThe Tathagata great king is liberated from reckoning in terms of form he is deep immeasurable hard to fathom like the great oceanThe Tathagata exists after death does not apply the Tathagata does not exist after death does not apply the Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death does not apply the Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death does not applyThat feeling by which one describing the Tathagata might describe him That perception by which one describing the Tathagata might describe him Those volitional formations by which one describing the Tathagata might describe him The Tathagata great king is liberated from reckoning in terms of consciousness he is deep immeasurable hard to fathom like the great oceanThe Tathagata exists after death does not apply the TathSgata does not exist after death does not apply the Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death does not apply the Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death does not applyThen King Pasenadi of Kosala having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhuni Khemas statement rose from his seat paid homage to her and departed keeping her on his rightThen on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One Having approached he paid homage to the Blessed One sat down to one sideand said to him How is it venerable sir does the Tathagata exist after death  Great king I have not declared this The Tathagata exists after death Great king I have not declared this either The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death How is this venerable sir When asked How is it venerable sir does the Tathagata exist after death And when asked Then venerable sir does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death in each case you say Great king I have not declared thisWhat now venerable sir is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One Well then great king I will question you about this same matterAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think great king Do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician The Tathagata great king is liberated from reckoning in terms of consciousness he is deep immeasurable hard to fathom like the great oceanThe Tathagata exists after death does not apply the Tathagata does not exist after death does not apply the Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death does not apply the Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death does not applyIt is wonderful venerable sir It is amazing venerable sirHow the meaning and the phrasing of both teacher and disciple coincide and agree with each other and do not diverge that is in regard to the chief matterThe revered lady explained this matter to me in exactly the same terms and phrases that the Blessed One usedIt is wonderful venerable sir It is amazing venerable sirHow the meaning and the phrasing of both teacher and disciple coincide and agree with each other and do not diverge that is in regard to the chief matterNow venerable sir we must goWe are busy and have much to doThen great king you may go at your own convenienceThen King Pasenadi of Kosala having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones statement rose from his seat paid homage to him and departed keeping him on his rightBut sire there is the bhikkhuni named Khema a disciple of the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened OneNow a good report concerning this revered lady has spread about thus She is wise competent intelligent learned a splendid speaker ingeniousso he approached King Pasenadi and said to himSire there is no ascetic or brahmin in Toranavatthu whom your majesty could visitThat consciousness by which one describing the Tathagata might describe him has been abandoned by the Tathagata cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arisingOn one occasion venerable sir I approached the bhikkhuni Khema and asked her about this matterOn one occasion the Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling at Savatthi in the Blind Mens Grove sick afflicted gravely illThen a number of bhikkhus approached the Venerable Anuruddha and said to himIt is friends because I dwell with a mind well established in the four establishments of mindfulness that the arisen bodily feelings do not persist obsessing my mindWhat fourHere friend I dwell contemplating the body in the body feelings in clearly comprehending mindful having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world It is friends because I dwell with a mind well established these four establishments of mindfulness that the arisen bodily painful feelings do not persist obsessing my mindIn what dwelling does the Venerable Anuruddha usually dwell so that the arisen bodily painful feelings do not persist obsessing his mindBhikkhus suppose there were a man with a life span of a hundred years who could live a hundred yearsSomeone would to him Come good man in the morning they will strike you with a hundred spears at noon they will strike you with a hundred spears in the evening they will strike you with a hundred spearsIt is fitting bhikkhus for a clansman intent on his good to accept the offerFor what reasonBecause this samsara is without discoverable beginning a first point cannot be discemed of blows by spears blows by swords blows by axesAnd even though this may be so bhikkhusI do not say that the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths is accompanied by suffering or displeasure Rather the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths is accompanied only by happiness and joyWhat fourThe noble truth of suffering  the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of sufferingTherefore bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand This is suffering  An exertion should be made to understand This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering And you good man being struck day after day by three hundred spears will have a life span of a hundred years will live a hundred years and then after a hundred years have passed you will make the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths to which you had not broken through earlierI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion Bāhiya of the Barkcloth was living in Suppāraka by the seashore He was worshipped revered honored venerated and given homagea recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sickThen when he was alone in seclusion this line of thinking appeared to his awareness Now of those who in this world are arahants or have entered the path of arahantship am I one Then a devatā who had once been a blood relative of Bāhiya of the Barkclothcompassionate desiring his welfare knowing with her own awareness the line of thinking that had arisen in his awarenesswent to him and on arrival said to him You Bāhiya are neither an arahant nor have you entered the path of arahantshipYou dont even have the practice whereby you would become an arahant or enter the path of arahantshipThen who in this world with its devas are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship Bāhiya there is a city in the northern country named SāvatthīThere the Blessed Onean arahant rightly selfawakenedis living nowHe truly is an arahant and teaches the Dhamma leading to arahantshipThen Bāhiya deeply chastened by the devatā left Suppāraka right then andNow on that occasion a large number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open airHe went to them and on arrival said Where venerable sirs is the Blessed Onethe arahant rightly selfawakenednow stayingWe want to see that Blessed Onethe arahant rightly selfawakenedThe Blessed One has gone into town for almsThen Bāhiya hurriedly leaving Jetas Grove and entering Sāvatthī saw the Blessed One going for alms in Sāvatthīserene  inspiring serene confidence calming his senses at peace his mind at peace having attained the utmost tranquility  poise tamed guarded his senses restrained a Great One Seeing him he approached the Blessed One and on reaching him threw himself down with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and said Teach me the Dhamma O Blessed One Teach me the Dhamma O OneWellGone that will be for my longterm welfare  blissWhen this was said the Blessed One said to him This is not the time Bāhiya We have entered the town for almsA second time Bāhiya said to the Blessed One But it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the Blessed Ones life or what dangers there may be for mineTeach me the Dhamma O Blessed One Teach me the Dhamma O OneWellGone that will be for my longterm welfare  blissA second time the Blessed One said to him This is not the time Bāhiya We have entered the town for almsA third time Bāhiya said to the Blessed One But it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the Blessed Ones life or what dangers there may be for mineTeach me the Dhamma O Blessed One Teach me the Dhamma O OneWellGone that will be for my longterm welfare  blissThen Bāhiya you should train yourself thus In reference to the seen there will be only the seen In reference to the heard only the heard In reference to the sensed only the sensed In reference to the cognized only the cognizedThat is how you should train yourselfWhen for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen only the heard in reference to the heard only the sensed in reference to the sensed only the cognized in reference to the cognized then Bāhiya there is no you in connection with that When there is no you in connection with that there is no you there When there is no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the twoThis just this is the end of stressThrough hearing this brief explanation of the Dhamma from the Blessed One the mind of Bāhiya of the Barkcloth right then and there was released from effluents through lack of clingingsustenanceHaving exhorted Bāhiya of the Barkcloth with this brief explanation of the Dhamma the Blessed One leftNow not long after the Blessed Ones departure Bāhiya was attacked  killed by a cow with a young calfThen the Blessed One having gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from his alms round with a large number of monks saw that Bāhiya had died On seeing him he said to the monks Take Bāhiyas body monks and placing it on a litter and carrying it away cremate it and build him a memorialYour companion in the holy life has diedResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monksplacing Bāhiyas body on a litter carrying it away cremating it and building him a memorialwent to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Bāhiyas body has been cremated lord and his memorial has been builtWhat is his destination What is his future state Monks Bāhiya of the Barkcloth was wise He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the DhammaBāhiya of the Barkcloth monks is totally unboundThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedWhere water earth fire  wind have no footingThere the stars dont shine the sun isnt visibleThere the moon doesnt appearThere darkness is not found And when a sage a brahman through sagacityhas realized this for himself then from form  formless from bliss  pain he is freedin the space of one night went all the way to where the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāras motherAnd on that occasion the Blessed One having emerged from his seclusion in the late afternoon was sitting outside the doorway of the porchThen King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideNow on that occasion seven coiledhair ascetics seven Jain ascetics seven clothless ascetics seven onecloth ascetics  seven wandererstheir nails armpithair  bodyhair grown long carrying containers on poles over their shoulderswalked past not far from the Blessed OneKing Pasenadi Kosala saw the seven coiledhair ascetics seven Jain ascetics seven clothless ascetics seven onecloth ascetics  seven wandererstheir nails armpithair  bodyhair grown long carrying containers on poles over their shoulderswalking past not far from the Blessed OneOn seeing them he got up from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder knelt down with his right knee on the ground paid homage to the seven coiledhair ascetics seven Jain ascetics seven clothless ascetics seven onecloth ascetics  seven wanderers with his hands palmtopalm in front his heart and announced his name three times I am the king venerable sirs Pasenadi Kosala I am the king venerable sirs Pasenadi Kosala I am the king venerable sirs Pasenadi KosalaThen not long after the seven coiledhair ascetics seven Jain ascetics seven clothless ascetics seven onecloth ascetics  seven wanderers had passed King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Of those in the world who are arahants or on the path to arahantship are these among them Great king as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures living confined with children using Kāsī fabrics  sandalwood wearing garlands scents  creams handling gold  silver its hard for you to know whether these are arahants or on the path to arahantshipIts through living together that a persons virtue may be knownand then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerningIts through adversity that a persons endurance may be knownIts through discussion that a persons discernment may be knownAmazing lord Astoundinghow well that was put by the Blessed One Great king as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures living confined with children using Kāsī fabrics  sandalwood wearing garlands scents  creams handling gold  silver its hard for you to know whether these are arahants or on the path to arahantshipIts through living together that a persons virtue may be knownIts through discussion that a persons discernment may be knownThese men lord are my spies my scouts returning after going out through the countrysideThey go out first and then I goNow when they have scrubbed off the dirt  mud are wellbathed  wellperfumed have trimmed their hair and beards and have put on white clothes they will go about endowed and provided with the five strings of sensualityThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedOne should not make an effort everywhere should not be anothers hirelingshould not live dependent on another should not go about as a trader in the Dhammaand then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerningIts through trading with a person that his purity may be knownand then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerningand then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerningand then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerningWhen resolved upon strivingI had gone to the Nerañjarā RiverNamucī approached mespeaking compassionate wordsYou are thin paleyoure

BuddhaWhen Māra had spoken in such a way the Blessed One said this to himKinsman of the heedless Evil Oneyou have come here with a purposeI do not have any need even for the slightest meritIt is fitting for Māra to speak to those who have need of meritsI have faith and energy tooand wisdom exists in meWhen I am so resolutewhy do you ask me to liveThis wind might dry up even the streams of the

cannot overcome that army of yoursI will destroy it with wisdomlike a fresh clay bowl with a stoneHaving gained mastery over my intentionand with mindfulness well establishedI will wander from realm to realmguiding many disciplesHeedful and resolutethose practitioners of my teachingFor seven years I followed the Blessed One trailing him step by stepbut I have not found an opening in the Enlightened One who is mindfulThere was a crow that circled around a stone that looked like a lump of fatPerhaps well find something tender hereperhaps there may be something tastyBut finding nothing tasty therethe crow departed from that placeSo much was he stricken with sorrow that his lute fell from his armpitThereupon that saddened spirit disappeared right on the spotas I was meditating very strenuously to attain security from bondageand my mindfulness and wisdom and concentration become more firmagainst your wishes will go to the state where one does not sorrowJust like the crow that attacked the stonewe leave Gotama disappointedsurely I had better do good by body speech and mindsurely I had better do good by body speech and mindsurely I had better do good by body speech and mindsurely I had better do good by body speech and mindIt has four corners and is built With four doors one set in each sideWalled up with iron all around And shut in with an iron roofWhen at long last he reaches the door then it is shutthat I might wait on that Blessed Onethat the Blessed One might teach me the Dhammaand that I might come to understand that Blessed Ones DhammaThough warned by the divine messengers Full many are the negligentThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the nun UttarāThe story goes that this nun continued her almspilgrimages until she was a hundred and twenty years old One day as she was returning from her almspilgrimage with food in her bowl she met a certain monk in the street She asked permission of him to give him the food in her bowl and he consented to accept it So she gave him all she had and then she had noneOn the second day and again on the third day she met the same monk in the same place gave him all the food she had and then had none left for herself Now on the fourth day as she was going her round she met the Teacher in a certain place which was much crowded She stepped back and as she did so the skirt of her robe slipped down and she trod on it Unable to keep her feet she tumbled and fell downThe Teacher came up to her and said Sister your body is worn out with old age at a time not far distant it will suffer dissolution So saying he pronounced the following StanzaThis body is worn out this nest of disease this fragile bodyThis mass of corruption dissolves for life ends in deathAnd people may sorrow long indeed Once gone down to the lower worldThey do not dwell in ignorance But practise well the noble DhammaAnd by not clinging they are freed In the destruction of birth and deathTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus BhikkhusVenerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisWhat threeHere a fool is one who thinks bad thoughts speaks bad words and does bad deedsIf a fool were not so how would the wise know him thus This person is a fool an untrue manBut because a fool is one who thinks bad thoughts speaks bad words and does bad deeds the wise know him thus This person is a fool an untrue manA fool feels pain and grief here and now in three waysIf a fool is seated in an assembly or along a street or in a square and people there are discussing certain pertinent and relevant mattersthen if the fool is one who kills living beings takes what is not given misconducts himself in sensual pleasures speaks falsehood and indulges in wine liquor and intoxicants which are the basis of negligence he thinks These people are discussing certain pertinent and relevant matters these things are found in me and I am seen engaging in those thingsAgain when a robber culprit is caught a fool sees kings having many kinds of torture inflicted on him having him flogged with whips beaten with canes beaten with clubs having his hands cut off his feet cut off his hands and feet cut off his ears cut off his nose cut off his ears and nose cut off having him subjected to the porridge pot to the polishedshell shave to the Rahus mouth to the fiery wreath to the flaming hand to the blades of grass to the bark dress to the antelope to the meat hooks to the coins to the lye pickling to the pivoting pin to the rolledup palliasse and having him splashed with boiling oil and having him thrown to be devoured by dogs and having him impaled alive on stakes and having his head cut off with a swordThen the fool thinks thus Because of such evil actions as those when a robber culprit is caught kings have many kinds of tortures inflicted on him they have him flogged with whipsThis is the second kind of pain and grief that a fool feels here and nowAgain when a fool is on his chair or on his bed or resting on the ground then the evil actions that he did in the past  his bodily verbal and mental misconduct  cover him overspread him and envelop himJust as the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening covers overspreads and envelops the earth so too when a fool is on his chair or on his bed or resting on the ground then the evil actions that he did in the past  his bodily verbal and mental misconduct  cover him overspread him and envelop himThen the fool thinks I have not done what is good I have not done what is wholesome I have not made myself a shelter from anguish I have done what is evil I have done what is cruel I have done what is wickedWhen I pass away I shall go to the destination of those who have not done what is goodwho have done what is wickedHe sorrows grieves and laments he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraughtThis is the third kind of pain and grief that a fool feels here and now A fool who has given himself over to misconduct of body speech and mind on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination even in hellWere it rightly speaking to be said of anything That is utterly unwished for utterly undesired utterly disagreeableWhen this was said a bhikkhu asked the Blessed One But venerable sir can a simile be givenIt can bhikkhu the Blessed One saidBhikkhus suppose men caught a robber culprit and presented him to the king saying Sire here is a robber culprit Order what punishment you will for himThen the king said Go and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spearsAnd they struck him in the morning with a hundred spearsThen at noon the king asked How is that man Sire he is still aliveThen the king said Go and strike that man at noon with a hundred spearsAnd they struck him at noon with a hundred spearsThen in the evening the king asked How is that man Sire he is still aliveThen the king said Go and strike that man in the evening with a hundred spearsAnd they struck him in the evening with a hundred spearsWhat do you think bhikkhus Would that man experience pain and grief because of being struck with the three hundred spearsVenerable sir that man would experience pain and grief because of being struck with even one spear let alone three hundredThen taking a small stone the size of his hand the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus What do you think bhikkhus Which is the greater this small stone that I have taken the size of my hand or Himalaya the king of mountainsVenerable sir the small stone that the Blessed One has taken the size of his hand does not count beside Himalaya the king of mountains it is not even a fraction there is no comparisonSo too bhikkhus the pain and grief that the man would experience because of being struck with the three hundred spears does not count beside the suffering of hell it is not even a fraction there is no comparisonNow the wardens of hell torture him with the fivefold transfixing They drive a redhot iron stake through one hand they drive a redhot iron stake through the other hand they drive a redhot iron stake through one foot they drive a redhot iron stake through the other foot they drive a redhot iron stake through his bellyThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its resultNext the wardens of hell throw him down and pare him with axesThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its resultNext the wardens of hell set him with his feet up and his head down and pare him with adzesThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its resultNext the wardens of hell harness him to a chariot and drive him back and forth across burning ground blazing and glowingThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its resultNext the wardens of hell make him climb up and down a great mound of burning coals blazing and glowingThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its resultNext the wardens of hell take him feet up and head down and plunge him into a redhot metal cauldron burning blazing and glowingHe is cooked there in a swirl of frothAnd as he is being cooked there in a swirl of froth he is swept now up now down and now acrossThere he feels painful racking piercing feelings Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its resultNext the wardens of hell throw him into the Great HellNow as to that Great Hell bhikkhusIts floor as well is made of iron And heated till it glows with fireThe range is a full hundred leagues Which it covers allpervasivelyBhikkhus I could tell you in many ways about hell So much so that it is hard to find a simile for the suffering in hellBhikkhus there are animals that feed on grassThey eat by cropping fresh or dried grass with their teethAnd what animals feed on grassElephants horses cattle donkeys goats and deer and any other such animalsA fool who formerly delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in the company of animals that feed on grassThere are animals that feed on dungThey smell dung from a distance and run to it thinking We can eat we can eatJust as brahmins run to the smell of a sacrifice thinking We can eat we can eat so too these animals that feed on dung smell dung from a distance and run to it thinking We can eat we can eatAnd what animals feed on dungFowls pigs dogs and jackals and any other such animalsA fool who formerly delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in the company of animals that feed on dungThere are animals that are born age and die in darknessAnd what animals are born age and die in darknessMoths maggots and earthworms and any other such animalsA fool who formerly delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in the company of animals that are born age and die in darknessThere are animals that are born age and die in waterAnd what animals are born age and die in waterFish turtles and crocodiles and any other such animalsA fool who formerly delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in the company of animals that are born age and die in waterThere are animals that are born age and die in filthAnd what animals are born age and die in filthThose animals that are born age and die in a rotten fish or in a rotten corpse or in rotten dough or in a cesspit or in a sewer A fool who formerly delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in the company of animals that are born age and die in filthBhikkhus I could tell you in many ways about the animal kingdom so much so that it is hard to find a simile for the suffering in the animal kingdomSuppose a man threw into the sea a yoke with one hole in itand the east wind carried it to the west and the west wind carried it to the east and the north wind carried it to the south and the south wind carried it to the northSuppose there were a blind turtle that came up once at the end of each centuryWhat do you think bhikkhus Would that blind turtle put his neck into that yoke with one hole in it  He might venerable sir sometime or other at the end of a long periodBhikkhus the blind turtle would take less time to put his neck into that yoke with a single hole in it than a fool once gone to perdition would take to regain the human state I sayWhy is thatBecause there is no practising of the Dhamma there no practising of what is righteous no doing of what is wholesome no performance of meritThere mutual devouring prevails and the slaughter of the weakIf sometime or other at the end of a long period that fool comes back to the human state it is into a low family that he is reborn  into a family of outcasts or hunters or bambooworkers or cartwrights or scavengers yet an unlucky throw such as that is negligibleThis is the complete perfection of the fools gradeWhat threeHere a wise man is one who thinks good thoughts speaks good words and does good deedsIf a wise man were not so how would the wise know him thus This person is a wise man a true manBut because a wise man is one who thinks good thoughts speaks good words and does good deeds the wise know him thus This person is a wise man a true manA wise man feels pleasure and joy here and now in three waysIf a wise man is seated in an assembly or along a street or in a square and people there are discussing certain pertinent and relevant mattersThis is the first kind of pleasure and joy that a wise man feels here and nowAgain when a robber culprit is caught a wise man sees kings having many kinds of torture inflicted on himThen the wise man thinks thus Because of such evil actions as those when a robber culprit is caught kings have many kinds of tortures inflicted on him Those things are not found in me and I am not seen engaging in those thingsThis is the second land of pleasure and joy that a wise man feels here and nowAgain when a wise man is on his chair or on his bed or resting on the ground then the good actions that he did in the past  his good bodily verbal and mental conduct  cover him overspread him and envelop him Just as the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening covers overspreads and envelops the earth so too when a wise man is on his chair or on his bed or resting on the ground then the good actions that he did in the past  his good bodily verbal and mental conduct cover him overspread him and envelop himThen the wise man thinks I have not done what is evil I have not done what is cruel I have not done what is wicked I have done what is good I have done what is wholesome I have made myself a shelter from anguishWhen I pass away I shall go to the destination of those who have not done what is evilwho have made themselves a shelter from anguishHe does not sorrow grieve and lament he does not weep beating his breast and become distraughtThis is the third kind of pleasure and joy that a wise man feels here and nowA wise man who has given himself over to good conduct of body speech and mind on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in a happy destination even in heavenIt can bhikkhu the Blessed One saidBhikkhus suppose that a Wheelturning Monarch possessed the seven treasures and the four kinds of success and because of that experienced pleasure and joyWhat are the seven treasuresHere when a headanointed noble king has bathed his head on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth and has ascended to the upper palace chamber for the Uposatha there appears to him the divine wheeltreasure with its thousand spokes its tire and its nave complete in every aspectOn seeing it the headanointed noble king thinks thus Now it has been heard by me that when a headanointed noble king has bathed his head on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth and has ascended to the upper palace chamber for the Uposatha and there appears to him the divine wheeltreasure with its thousand spokes its tire and its nave complete in every aspect then that king becomes a Wheelturning MonarchAm I then a Wheelturning MonarchThen the headanointed noble king rises from his seat and taking a water vessel in his left hand he sprinkles the wheeltreasure with his right hand saying Turn forward good wheeltreasure triumph good wheeltreasureThen the wheeltreasure turns forward rolling in the eastern directionNow in whatever region the wheeltreasure pauses there the Wheelturning Monarch takes up his abode with his fourconstituent armyAnd opposing kings in the eastern direction come to the Wheelturning Monarch and speak thus Come great kingwelcome great kingThe Wheelturning Monarch speaks thus You should not kill living beings you should not take what has not been given you should not misconduct yourselves in sensual pleasures you should not speak falsehood you should not drink intoxicants you should eat what you are accustomed to eatAnd the opposing kings in the eastern direction submit to the Wheelturning MonarchThen the wheeltreasure plunges into the eastern ocean and emerges again And then it turns forward rolling in the southern directionAnd the opposing kings in the southern direction submit to the Wheelturning Monarch Then the wheeltreasure plunges into the southern ocean and emerges again And then it turns forward rolling in the western direction And the opposing kings in the western direction submit to the Wheelturning Monarch Then the wheeltreasure plunges into the western ocean and emerges again And then it turns forward rolling in the northern directionNow when the wheeltreasure has triumphed over the earth to the oceans edge it returns to the royal capital and remains as if fixed on its axle at the gate of the Wheelturning Monarchs inner palace as an adornment to the gate of his inner palaceSuch is the wheeltreasure that appears to a Wheelturning MonarchAgain the elephanttreasure appears to the Wheelturning Monarch all white with sevenfold stance with supernormal power flying through the air the king of elephants named UposathaOn seeing him the Wheelturning Monarchs mind has confidence in him thus It would be wonderful to ride the elephant if he would undergo tamingThen the elephanttreasure undergoes taming just like a fine thoroughbred elephant well tamed for a long timeAnd it so happens that the Wheelturning Monarch when testing the elephanttreasure mounts him in the morning and after traversing the whole earth to the edge of the ocean he returns to the royal capital to take his morning mealSuch is the elephanttreasure that appears to a Wheelturning MonarchAgain the horsetreasure appears to the Wheelturning Monarch all white with ravenblack head with mane like muhja grass with supernormal power

tamingThen the horsetreasure undergoes taming just like a fine thoroughbred horse well tamed for a long timeAnd it so happens that the Wheelturning Monarch when testing the horsetreasure mounts him in the morning and after traversing the whole earth to the edge of the ocean he returns to the royal capital to take his morning mealSuch is the horsetreasure that appears to a Wheelturning MonarchAgain the jeweltreasure appears to the Wheelturning MonarchThe jewel is fine beryl of purest water eightfaceted and well cutNow the radiance of the jeweltreasure spreads around for a whole leagueAnd it so happens that when the Wheelturning Monarch is testing the jeweltreasure he draws up his fourconstituent army in array and mounting the jewel on top of his banner he sets forth in the darkness and gloom of the nightThen all the inhabitants of the villages nearby begin their work by its light thinking that it is daySuch is the jeweltreasure that appears to a Wheelturning MonarchAgain the womantreasure appears to the Wheelturning Monarchbeautiful comely and graceful possessing the supreme beauty of complexion neither too tall nor too short neither too slim nor too stout neither too dark nor too fair surpassing human beauty without reaching divine beautyThe touch of the womantreasure is such that it is like a tuft of kapok or a tuft of cottonwoolWhen it is cool her limbs are warm when it is warm her limbs are coolShe rises before the Wheelturning Monarch and retires after him She is eager to serve agreeable in conduct and sweet in speechSince she is never unfaithful to the Wheelturning Monarch even in thought how could she be so in bodySuch is the womantreasure that appears to a Wheelturning MonarchAgain the stewardtreasure appears to the Wheelturning MonarchThe divine eye born of past action is manifested in him whereby he sees hidden stores of treasure both with owners and ownerlessHe approaches the Wheelturning Monarch and says Sire you remain at easeI shall take care of your monetary affairsAnd it so happens that when the Wheelturning Monarch is testing the stewardtreasure he boards a boat and putting out into the river Ganges in midstream he tells the stewardtreasure I need gold and bullion steward Then sire let the boat be steered towards one bank Steward it is actually here that I need gold and bullionThen the stewardtreasure plunges both hands into the water and draws up a pot full of gold and bullion and he tells the Wheelturning Monarch Is this enough sireIs enough done This is enough stewardSuch is the stewardtreasure that appears to a Wheelturning MonarchAgain the counsellortreasure appears to the Wheelturning Monarch wise shrewd and sagacious capable of getting the Wheelturning Monarch to promote that which is worthy of being promoted to dismiss that which should be dismissed and to establish that which should be establishedHe approaches the Wheelturning Monarch and says Sire you remain at easeI shall governSuch is the counsellortreasure that appears to a Wheelturning MonarchThese are the seven treasures that a Wheelturning Monarch possessesWhat are the four kinds of successHere a Wheelturning Monarch is handsome comely and graceful possessing the supreme beauty of complexion and he surpasses other human beings in that respectThis is the first kind of success that a Wheelturning Monarch possessesAgain a Wheelturning Monarch lives long and endures long and he surpasses other human beings in that respectThis is the second kind of success that a Wheelturning Monarch possessesAgain a Wheelturning Monarch is free from illness and affliction possessing a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too warm and he surpasses other human beings in that respectThis is the third kind of success that a Wheelturning Monarch possessesAgain a Wheelturning Monarch is dear and agreeable to brahmins and householdersJust as a father is dear and agreeable to his children so too a Wheelturning Monarch is dear and agreeable to brahmins and householdersBrahmins and householders too are dear and agreeable to a Wheelturning MonarchJust as children are dear and agreeable to a father so too brahmins and householders are dear and agreeable to a Wheelturning MonarchOnce a Wheelturning Monarch was driving in a pleasure park with his fourconstituent armyThen brahmins and householders went to him and spoke thus Sire drive slowly that we may see you longerAnd so he told his charioteer Charioteer drive slowly that I may see the brahmins and householders longerThis is the fourth kind of success that a Wheelturning Monarch possessesThese are the four kinds of success that a Wheelturning Monarch possessesWhat do you think bhikkhus Would a Wheelturning Monarch experience pleasure and joy because of possessing these seven treasures and these four kinds of successVenerable sir a Wheelturning Monarch would experience pleasure and joy because of possessing even one treasure let alone seven treasures and four kinds of successThen taking a small stone the size of his hand the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus What do you think bhikkhus Which is the greater this small stone that I have taken the size of my hand or Himalaya the king of mountainsVenerable sir the small stone that the Blessed One has taken the size of his hand does not count beside Himalaya the king of mountains it is not even a fraction there is no comparisonSo too bhikkhus the pleasure and joy that a Wheelturning Monarch would experience because of possessing the seven treasures and the four kinds of success does not count beside the happiness of heaven it is not even a fraction there is no comparisonIf some time or other at the end of a long period the wise man comes back to the human state it is into a high family that he is reborn  into a family of welltodo nobles or welltodo brahmins or welltodo householders  one that is richof great wealth of great possessions with abundant gold and silver with abundant assets and means and with abundant money and grainHe is handsome comely and graceful possessing the supreme beauty of complexion He obtains food and drink clothes vehicles garlands scents and unguents bed lodging and lightHe conducts himself well in body speech and mindBhikkhus suppose a gambler at the very first lucky throw won a great fortune yet a lucky throw such as that is negligibleThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsBhikkhus there are these three characteristics of a fool signs of a fool attributes of a foolThis is the first kind of pain and grief that a fool feels here and nowit is of hell that rightly speaking this should be said so much so that it is hard to find a simile for the suffering in hellIt has four corners and is built With four doors one set in each sideWalled up with iron and all around And shut in with an iron roofone that is poor with little to eat and drink surviving with difficulty where he scarcely finds food and clothingand he is ugly unsightly and misshapen sickly blind cripplehanded lame or paralysed he gets no food drink clothes vehicles garlands scents and unguents bed lodging and lightBound together by bones and sinewsplastered with skin and fleshwith snot and salivawith sweat and fatFurther from its nine openings impurity flows constantlyThen its hollow head is filled with the brainLed on by ignorance the fool conceives it as beautifulAnd when it is lying dead bloated and discoloredDogs then devour itas do jackals wolves and wormsHaving heard the Word of the Buddha a bhikkhu possessing wisdom hereinternally and externally one should expunge desire for the bodyThat bhikkhu possessing wisdom here who has expunged desire and lustThis twofooted body impure and foulsmelling is cherishedOne who because of such a body would think to exalt himselfor who would disparage otherswhat is this due to but lack of visionWhen one is walking or standingsitting or lying downwhen one bends and stretchesthis is the motion of the bodycovered by the epidermis the body is not seen as it really isas filled with intestines filled with the stomachwith the liver and bladderthe heart lungs kidneys and spleenwith blood and oil of the jointswith bile and greasesnot from the nostrils and from the mouth one sometimes vomitsbile and vomits

unconcerned with ithe misconducts himself in body speech arid mind and having done thaton the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellit is a far more unlucky throw when a fool who misconducts himself in body speech and mind on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellBhikkhus there are these three characteristics of a wise man signs of a wise man attributes of a wise manthen if the wise man is one who abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech from wine liquor and intoxicants which are the basis of negligence he thinks These people are discussing certain pertinent and relevant matters those things are not found in me and I am not seen engaging in themWere it rightly speaking to be said of anything That is utterly wished for utterly desired utterly agreeable it is of heaven that rightly speaking this should be saidso much so that it is hard to find a simile for the happiness of heavenWhen this was said a bhikkhu asked the Blessed One But venerable sir can a simile be givenThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to three religiousThe story goes that in a certain household at Sāvatthi there was an only son who was the darling and delight of his mother and fatherOne day some monks were invited to take a meal at the house and when they had finished they recited the words of thanksgiving As the youth listened to the words of the Law he was seized with a desire to become a monk and straightway asked leave of his mother and fatherThey refused to permit him to do soThereupon the following thought occurred to him When my mother and father are not looking I will leave the house and become a monkNow whenever the father left the house he committed the son to the care of his mother saying Pray keep him safe and soundand whenever the mother left the house she committed the son to the care of the fatherOne day after the father had left the house the mother said to herself I will indeed keep my son safe and sound So she braced one foot against one of the doorposts and the other foot against the other doorpost and sitting thus on the ground began to spin her threadThe youth thought to himself I will outwit her and escape So he said to his mother Dear mother just remove your foot a little I wish to attend to natures needs She drew back her foot and he went out He went to the monastery as fast as he could and approaching the monks said Receive me into the Order Reverend Sirs The monks complied with his request and admitted him to the OrderWhen his father returned to the house he asked the mother Where is my sonHusband he was here but a moment agoWhere can my son be thought the father looking about Seeing him nowhere he came to the conclusion He must have gone to the monastery So the father went to the monastery and seeing his son garbed in the robes of a monk wept and lamented and said Dear son why do you destroy me But after a moment he thought to himself Now that my son has become a monk why should I live the life of a layman any longer So of his own accord he also asked the monks to receive him into the Order and then and there retired from the world and became a monkThe mother of the youth thought to herself Why are my son and my husband tarrying so long Looking all about she suddenly thought Undoubtedly they have gone to the monastery and become monks So she went to the monastery and seeing both her son and her husband wearing the robes of monks thought to herself Since both my son and my husband have become monks what further use have I for the houselife And of her own accord she went to the community of nuns and retired from the worldBut even after mother and father and son had retired from the world and adopted the religious life they were unable to remain apart whether in the monastery or in the convent of the nuns they would sit down by themselves and spend the day chatting togetherThe monks and nuns were repelled by their conductand one day the monks told the Teacher what was going onThe Teacher sent for them and asked them Is the report true that you are doing this and that They replied in the affirmative Then said the Teacher Why do you do soThis is not the proper way for monks and nuns to conduct themselvesBut Reverend Sir it is impossible for us to live apartFrom the time of retirement from the world such conduct is highly improperit is painful both to be deprived of the sight of those who are dear and to be obliged to look upon that which is not dearor this reason whether persons or material things be involved one should take no account either of what is dear or of what is not dear So saying the Teacher pronounced the following StanzaHe who abandons himself to the distractions of this world He who fails to apply himself to his religious dutiesHe who abandons the real purpose of life he who grasps at what is dear to him Such a man will come to envy him who applies himself to his religious dutiesIt is painful both to be deprived of the sight of those who are dear and to be obliged to look upon those who are not dearNever abide in the company of those who are dear or of those who are not dearTherefore hold nothing dear for the loss of what is dear is an evilFetters exist not for those to whom naught is either dear or not dearand the Wheelturning Monarch follows it with his fourconstituent armycommand great kingadvise great kingAnd the opposing kings in the northern direction submit to the Wheelturning MonarchFrom her body the scent of sandalwood comes forth and from her mouth the scent of lotusesenough offeredenough is doneenough offeredand having done so on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldit is a far more lucky throw when a wise man who conducts himself well in body speech and mind on the dissolution of the body after death reappears in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldThis is the complete perfection of the wise mans gradeand have his head cut off with a sword Those things are found in me and I am seen engaging in those thingsBut friend do you remember the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree ParkThen Mahanama the Sakyan approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideand said to himIn what way Bhante is one a lay followerWhen Mahanama one has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sahgha in that way one is a lay followerIn what way Bhante is a lay follower virtuousWhen Mahanama a lay follower abstains from the destruction of life from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from false speech and from liquor wine and intoxicants the basis for heedlessness in that way a lay follower is virtuousIn what way Bhante is a lay follower practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others When Mahanama a lay follower is himself accomplished in faith but does not encourage others to accomplish faith when he is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior but does not encourage others to accomplish virtuous behavior when he is himself accomplished in generosity but does not encourage others to accomplish generosity when he himself wants to see bhikkhus but does not encourage others to see bhikkhus when he himself wants to hear the good Dhamma but does not encourage others to hear the good Dhamma when he himself retains in mind the teachings he has heard but does not encourage others to retain the teachings in mind when he himself examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind but does not encourage others to examine their meaning when he himself has understood the meaning and the Dhamma and practices in accordance with the Dhamma but does not encourage others to do soIn what way Bhante is a lay follower practicing for his own welfare and for the welfare of others When Mahanama a lay follower is himself accomplished in faith and also encourages others to accomplish faith when he is himself accomplished in virtuous behavior and also encourages others to accomplish virtuous behavior when he is himself accomplished in generosity and also encourages others to accomplish generosity when he himself wants to see bhikkhus and also encourages others to see bhikkhus when he himself wants to hear the good Dhamma and also encourages others to hear the good Dhamma when he himself retains in mind the teachings he has heard and also encourages others to retain the teachings in mind when he himself examines the meaning of the teachings that have been retained in mind and also encourages others to examine their meaning whenhe himself understands the meaning and the Dhamma and then practices in accordance with the Dhamma and also encourages others to practice in accordance with the Dhammait is in this way Mahanama that a lay follower is practicing for his own welfare but not for the welfare of othersit is in this way Mahanama that a lay follower is practicing for his own welfare and also for the welfare of othersThen the householder Anathapindika accompanied by five hundred lay followers approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one sideThe Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Sariputta You should know Sariputta that any whiterobed householder whose actions are restrained by five training rules and who gains at will without trouble or difficulty

whose faith in the Fortunate One is deeply rooted and well establishedgo to the world of the devas or are born here in a good familytold the Blessed One all that had occurred and saidIt would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the summary and exposition of One Who Has One Fortunate AttachmentLet not a person revive the past Or on the future build his hopesFor the past has been left behind And the future has not been reachedLet him know that and be sure of it Invincibly unshakeablyIt is he the Peaceful Sage has said Who has one fortunate attachmentNow who will expound this in detailand they told him what had taken place adding Let the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it to usI will tell of the going forthhow the One with Vision went forthThis home life is confinementa basis for dustHaving gone forth he avoided evil deeds with his bodyThe Buddha went to Rājagahathe city Giribbaja of the MagadhansWhile standing in his palace Bimbisāra caught sight of himWith downcast eyes mindfulit seems he is not from a low familyLet the kings messengers run out Find out where the bhikkhu will goWalking on alms without skipping houseshis sense doors guardedHaving walked on alms roundthe muni departed from the cityHaving seen that he had entered his dwelling the messengers then approachedGreat king this bhikkhu lives on the eastern side of PaṇḍavaHaving gone along the ground for vehiclesthe khattiya descended from his vehiclehaving approached on foothe arrived and enteredHaving sat down the king greeted him and then made polite conversation while shining at the head of an army accompanied by a troop of bull elephantsI am by clan an dicca by birth I am a SakyanHaving seen the danger in sensual pleasureshaving seen renunciation as securitySirs look at him handsome stately pureThe messengers sent by the king followed closely behind himthinkingHaving heard the messengers reportthe khattiya set out in a fine vehicleYou are young a lad a youth in the prime of lifeThere is O king a country straight aheadon the slope of the Himalayashow while investigating he approved of the going forththe going forth is like an open spacehaving seen this he went forthHaving abandoned verbal misconducthe purified his livelihoodAdorned with the excellent markshe walked for alms in the cityHaving seen him endowed with the markshe uttered this statementendowed with good conducthe looks a mere yokes length aheadWhere will the bhikkhu go Where is his dwelling placewell restrained clearly comprehending ever mindful he quickly filled up his bowlHe ascended Mount PaṇḍavaHis dwelling place must be herebut one messenger returned and informed the kingHe sits in a mountain cavern like a tiger a bull or a lionHurriedly he departed in the direction of Paṇḍava

in wealth and energyruled by one native to the KosalansI have gone forth from that family O king not longing for sensual pleasuresI will go for the purpose of strivingit is here that my mind delightsFriends when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning that isWho has one fortunate attachmentLet not a person revive the pastWho has one fortunate attachmentI understand the detailed meaning of this summary to be thusand so you should remember itTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Kosambi in Ghositas ParkNow on that occasion the bhikkhus at Kosambi had taken to quarrelling and brawling and were deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal daggersIt would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would go to those bhikkhus out of compassionThe Blessed One consented in silenceThen the Blessed One went to those bhikkhus and said to them Enough bhikkhus let there be no quarrelling brawling wrangling or disputeWhen this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One Wait venerable sirLet the Blessed One the Lord of the Dhamma live at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding here and now We are the ones who will be responsible for this quarrelling brawling wrangling and disputeFor a second timeFor a third time that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One Wait venerable sir We are the ones who will be responsible for this quarrelling brawling wrangling and disputeThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe entered Kosambi for almsWhen many voices shout at once None considers himself a foolThey have forgotten thoughtful speech They talk obsessed by words aloneUncurbed their mouths they bawl at will None knows what leads him so to actHe abused me he struck me He defeated me he robbed me For in this world hatred is never Allayed by further acts of hateIt is allayed by nonhatred That is the fixed and ageless lawThose others do not recognise That here we should restrain ourselvesBut those wise ones who realise this At once end all their enmityBreakers of bones and murderers Those who steal cattle horses wealthIf one can find a worthy friendBut if one finds no worthy friendBetter it is to walk alone There is no companionship with foolsWalk alone and do no evilThen having uttered these stanzas while standing the Blessed One went to the village of BalakalonakaraOn that occasion the venerable Bhagu was living at the village of BalakalonakaraWhen the venerable Bhagu saw the Blessed One coming in the distanceThe Blessed One sat down on the seatThe venerable Bhagu paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one sideI am keeping well Blessed One I am comfortable and I am not having any trouble getting almsfoodThen the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged the venerable Bhagu with talk on the Dhamma after which he rose from his seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo ParkNow on that occasion the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila were living at the Eastern Bamboo ParkThere are three clansmen here seeking their own goodDo not disturb themThe venerable Anuruddha heard the park keeper speaking to the Blessed OneIt is our Teacher the Blessed One who has comeThen the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila and said Come out venerable sirs come out Our Teacher the Blessed One has comeThen all three went to meet the Blessed One One took his bowl and outer robe one prepared a seat and one set out water for washing the feetThe Blessed One sat down on the seat made readyThen those three venerable ones paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one sideand the Blessed One said to them I hope you are all keeping well Anuruddha I hope you are comfortable I hope you are not having any trouble getting almsfoodWe are keeping well Blessed One we are comfortable and we are not having any trouble getting almsfoodI hope Anuruddha that you are all living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyesSurely venerable sir we are living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyesBut Anuruddha how do you live thusVenerable sir as to that I think thus It is a gain for me it is a great gain for me that I am living with such companions in the holy lifeI maintain bodily acts of lovingkindness towards these venerable ones both openly and privately I maintain verbal acts of lovingkindness towards them both openly and privately I maintain mental acts of lovingkindness towards them both openly and privatelyI consider Why should I not set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to doThen I set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to doWe are different in body venerable sir but one in mindThe venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila each spoke likewise addingGood good AnuruddhaI hope that you all abide diligent ardent and resoluteSurely venerable sir we abide diligent ardent and resoluteBut Anuruddha how do you abide thusVenerable sir as to that whichever of us returns first from the village with almsfood prepares the seats sets out the water for drinking and for washing and puts the refuse bucket in its placeWhichever of us returns last eats any food left over if he wishes otherwise he throws it away where there is no greenery or drops it into water where there is no life He puts away the seats and the water for drinking and for washing He puts away the refuse bucket after washing it and he sweeps out the refectoryWhoever notices that the pots of water for drinking washing or the latrine are low or empty takes care of themIf they are too heavy for him he calls someone else by a signal of the hand and they move it by joining hands but because of this we do not break out into speechBut every five days we sit together all night discussing the DhammaThat is how we abide diligent ardent and resoluteGood good AnuruddhaBut while you abide thus diligent ardent and resolute have you attained any superhuman states a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable abidingVenerable sir as we abide here diligent ardent and resolute we perceive both light and a vision of formsYou should discover the cause for that AnuruddhaBefore my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I too perceived both light and a vision of formsI thought What is the cause and condition why the light and the vision of forms have disappearedThen I considered thus Doubt arose in me and because of the doubt my concentration fell awayI shall so act that doubt will not arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligent ardent and resolute I perceived both light and a vision of formsI thought What is the cause and condition why the light and the vision of forms have disappearedThen I considered thus Inattention arose in me and because of inattention my concentration fell awayI shall so act that neither doubt nor inattention will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligentI considered thus Sloth and torpor arose in me and because of sloth and torpor my concentration fell awayI shall so act that neither doubt nor inattention nor sloth and torpor will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligent considered thus Fear arose in me and because of fear my concentration fell awaySuppose a man set out on a journey and murderers leaped out on both sides of him then fear would arise in him because of that So too fear arose in meI considered thus I shall so act that neither doubt nor inattention nor sloth and torpor nor fear will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligentI considered thus Elation arose in me and because of elation my concentration fell awaySuppose a man seeking one entrance to a hidden treasure came all at once upon five entrances to a hidden treasure then elation would arise in him because of that So too elation arose in meI considered thus I shall so act that neither doubt nor inattentionnor fear nor elation will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligentI considered thus Inertia arose in me and because of inertia my concentration fell awayI shall so act that neither doubt nor inattentionnor elation nor inertia will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligentI considered thus Excess of energy arose in me and because of excess of energy my concentration fell awaySuppose a man were to grip a quail tightly with both hands it would die then and there So too an excess of energy arose in meI considered thus I shall so act that neither doubt nor inattentionnor inertia nor excess of energy will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligentI considered thus Deficiency of energy arose in me and because of deficiency of energy my concentration fell awaySuppose a man were to grip a quail loosely it would fly out of his hands So too a deficiency of energy arose in meI considered thus I shall so act that neither doubt nor inattentionnor excess of energy nor deficiency of energy will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligentI considered thus Longing arose in me and because of that longing my concentration fell awayI shall so act that neither doubt nor inattentionnor deficiency of energy nor longing will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligentI considered thus Perception of diversity arose in me and because of perception of diversity my concentration fell awayI shall so act that neither doubt nor inattentionnor longing nor perception of diversity will arise in me againAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligentI shall so act that neither doubt nor inattentionnor perception of diversity nor excessive meditation upon forms will arise in me againWhen Anuruddha I understood that doubt is an imperfection of the mind and had abandoned doubt an imperfection of the mind when I understood that inattention is an imperfection of the mind and had abandoned inattention abandoned sloth and torporabandoned fearabandoned elation abandoned inertiaabandoned excess of energyabandoned deficiency of energyabandoned longingabandoned perception of diversityabandoned excessive meditation upon forms an imperfection of the mindLet me now develop Concentration in three waysThereupon Anuruddha I developed concentration with applied thought and sustained thought I developed concentration without applied thought but with sustained thought only I developed concentration without applied thought and without sustained thought I developed concentration with rapture I developed concentration without rapture I developed concentration accompanied by enjoyment I developed concentration accompanied by equanimityThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Anuruddha was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsBhikkhus suppose a gambler at the very first unlucky throw loses his child and his wife and all his property and furthermore goes into bondage himselfThe venerable Maha Kaccana expounded the meaning to us with these terms statements and phrasesadding Then venerable sir we went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and asked him about the meaningThen a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he stood at one sideand said Venerable sir the bhikkhus here at Kosambi have taken to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal daggersFor a third time the Blessed One said Enough bhikkhus let there be no quarrelling brawling wrangling or disputeWhen he had wandered for alms in Kosambi and had returned from his almsround after his meal he set his resting place in order took his bowl and outer robe and while still standing uttered these stanzasThough the Sangha is being split None thinks himself to be at faultBy what track can you trace that trackless Buddha of limitless rangeBy what track can you trace that trackless Buddha of

companionThen as a king leaves his conquered realmWalk like a tusker in the woods aloneAt ease like a tusker in the woodshe prepared a seat and set out water for washing the feetmade ready and washed his feetand the Blessed One said to him I hope you are keeping well bhikkhu I hope you are comfortable I hope you are not having any trouble getting almsfoodThe park keeper saw the Blessed One coming in the distanceand told him Do not enter this park recluseand told him Friend park keeper do not keep the Blessed One outand washed his feetThat is how venerable sir we are living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyesSoon afterwards the light and the vision of forms disappear but we have not discovered the cause

exhaustedNext the wardens of hell throw him into the great hellNow bhikkhus as to that great hellIt has four corners and four doors and is divided into separate compartmentsit is surrounded by iron ramparts and shut in with an iron roofIts floor as well is made of iron and heated till it glows with fireThe range is a full hundred yojanas which it ever covers pervasivelyOnce bhikkhus in the past King Yama thought Those in the world who do evil deeds are punished with such diverse torturesOh that I might attain the human state That a Tathagata Arahant Perfectly Enlightened One might arise in the world That I might attend upon that Blessed OneThat the Blessed One might teach me the Dhamma and that I might come to understand his DhammaBhikkhus I am not repeating something that I heard from another ascetic or brahmin but rather I am speaking about a matter that I have actually known seen and understood myselfHaving overcome all enmity and perilthey have transcended all sufferingthose happy ones have attained security they have reached nibbana in this very lifeare liberated by nonclinging in the extinction of birth and deathwho having seen the peril in clinging as the origin of birth and deathnever become heedless in regard to the noble DhammaBut those good people here whowhen warned by the divine messengerssorrow for a long time having fared on to a lower realmThough warned by the divine messengers those people who remain heedlessthen I thought I have abandoned those imperfections of the mindWhen Anuruddha I had developed concentration with applied thought and sustained thoughtwhen I had developed concentration accompanied by equanimitythe knowledge and vision arose in me My deliverance is unshakeablethis is my last birth now there is no renewal of beingI considered thus Excessive meditation upon forms arose in me and because of excessive meditation upon forms my concentration fell awayWhen Anuruddha I understood that doubt is an imperfection of the mind I abandoned doubt an imperfection of the mind When I understood that inattentionsloth and torpor fear elation inertia excess of energydeficiency of energylongingperception of diversityexcessive meditation upon forms is an imperfection of the mind I abandoned excessive meditation upon forms an imperfection of the mindAs Anuruddha I was abiding diligent ardent and resolute I perceived light but I did not see forms I saw forms but I did not perceive light even for a whole night or a whole day or a whole day and nightI thought What is the cause and condition for this As Anuruddha I was abiding diligent ardent and resolute I perceived limited light and saw limited forms I perceived immeasurable light and saw immeasurable forms even for a whole night or a whole day or a whole day and nightI thought What is the cause and condition for this Then I considered thus On the occasion when concentration is limited my vision is limitedand with limited vision I perceive limited light and limited formsBut on the occasion when concentration is immeasurable my vision is immeasurable and with immeasurable vision I perceive immeasurable light and see immeasurable formseven for a whole night or a whole day or a whole day and nightThen I considered thus On the occasion when I do not attend to the sign of forms but attend to the sign of light I then perceive light but do not see formsOn the occasion when I do not attend to the sign of light but attend to the sign of forms I then see forms but do not perceive light even for a whole night or a whole day or a whole day and nightTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen the carpenter Pancakanga addressed a certain man thus Come good man go to the venerable Anuruddha pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and say Venerable sir the carpenter Pancakanga pays homage with his head at the venerable Anuruddhas feet and says Venerable sir let the venerable Anuruddha with three others consent to accept tomorrows meal from the carpenter Pancakanga and let the venerable Anuruddha arrive punctually as the carpenter Pancakanga is very busy and has much work to do for the kingYes sir that man replied and he went to the venerable Anuruddha After paying homage to the venerable Anuruddha he sat down at one sideThe venerable Anuruddha consented in silenceThen when the night had ended it being morning the venerable Anuruddha dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went to the carpenter Pancakangas house and sat down on a seat made readyThen with his own hands the carpenter Pancakanga served and satisfied the venerable Anuruddha with the various kinds of good foodThen when the venerable Anuruddha had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from his bowl the carpenter Pancakanga took a low seat sat down at one sideVenerable sir the immeasurable deliverance of mind and the exalted deliverance of mind are these states different in meaning and different in name or are they one in meaning and different only in nameExplain it as you see it householderAfterwards it will be cleared up for youVenerable sir I think thus the immeasurable deliverance of mind and the exalted deliverance of mind  these states are one in meaning and different only in nameHouseholder the immeasurable deliverance of mind and the exalted deliverance of mind  these states are different in meaning and different in nameAnd it should be understood as follows how these states are different in meaning and different in nameWhat householder is the immeasurable deliverance of mindHere a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willHe abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassionHe abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with appreciative joyHe abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with equanimityabundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willThis is called the immeasurable deliverance of mindAnd what householder is the exalted deliverance of mindHere a bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of the root of one tree pervading it as exaltedHere a bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of one village pervading it as exaltedIt is in this way householder that it can be understood how these states are different in meaning and different in nameThere are householder these four kinds of reappearance in a future state of beingHere someone abides resolved upon and pervading limited radianceHere someone abides resolved upon and pervading immeasurable radianceHere someone abides resolved upon and pervading defiled radianceHere someone abides resolved upon and pervading pure radianceThese are the four kinds of reappearance in a future state of beingThere is an occasion householder when those deities assemble in one place When they have assembled in one place a difference in their colour can be discerned but no difference in their radianceJust as if a man were to bring several oillamps into a houseThere is an occasion householder when those deities disperse from there When they have dispersed a difference in their colours can be discerned and also a difference in their radianceJust as if the man were to remove those several oillamps from that houseIt does not occur to those deities This life of ours is permanent everlasting and eternal yet wherever those deities settle down there they find delightJust as when flies are being carried along on a carryingpole or on a basket it does not occur to them This life of ours is permanent everlasting or eternal yet wherever those flies settle down there they find delight so too it does not occur to those deitiesyet wherever they settle down there they find delightWhen this was said the venerable Abhiya Kaccana said to the venerable Anuruddha Good venerable Anuruddhayet I have something further to askBy reason of the factor responsible for rebirth friend Kaccana some are deities of Limited Radiance some deities of Immeasurable RadianceVenerable Anuruddha what is the cause and reason why among those deities that have reappeared in a single order of gods some are deities of Limited Radiance some deities of Immeasurable RadianceAs to that friend Kaccana I shall ask you a question in returnAnswer it as you chooseWhat do you think friend Kaccana When one bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of the root of one tree pervading it as exalted and another bhikkhu abides resolved upon the area the size of the roots of two or three trees pervading it as exalted  which of these types of mental development is more exalted The second venerable sirWhat do you think friend Kaccana When one bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of the roots of two or three trees pervading it as exalted and another bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of one village pervading it as exalted The second venerable sirThis is the cause and reason friend Kaccana why among those deities that have reappeared in a single order of gods some are deities of Limited Radiance some deities of Immeasurable RadianceGood venerable AnuruddhaBy reason of the factor responsible for rebirth friend Kaccana some are deities of Defiled Radiance some deities of Pure RadianceVenerable Anuruddha what is the cause and reason why among those deities that have reappeared in a single order of gods some are deities of Defiled Radiance some deities of Pure RadianceAs to that friend Kaccana I shall give a simileSuppose an oillamp is burning with impure oil and an impure wick because of the impurity of its oil and its wick it burns dimlyHis bodily inertia has not fully subsided his sloth and torpor have not been fully eliminated his restlessness and remorse have not been fully removed because of this he meditates as it were dimlySuppose an oillamp is burning with pure oil and a pure wick because of the purity of its oil and its wick it does not burn dimlySo too here a bhikkhu abides resolved upon and pervading an area with a pure radianceHis bodily inertia has fully subsided his sloth and torpor have been fully eliminated his restlessness and remorse have been fully removedOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of the gods of Pure RadianceThis is the cause and reason friend Kaccana why among those deities that have reappeared in the same order of gods some are deities of Defiled Radiance some deities of Pure RadianceWhen this was said the venerable Abhiya Kaccana said to the venerable Anuruddha Good venerable AnuruddhaThe venerable Anuruddha does not say Thus have I heard or It should be thus Rather the venerable Anuruddha says These gods are thus and those gods are suchIt occurs to me venerable sir that the venerable Anuruddha certainly has associated with those deities and talked with them and held conversations with themCertainly friend Kaccana your words are offensive and discourteous but still I will answer you Over a long time I have associated with those deities and talked with them and held conversations with themWhen this was said the venerable Abhiya Kaccana said to the carpenter Pancakanga It is a gain for you householder it is a great gain for you that you have abandoned your state of doubt and have had the opportunity to hear this discourse on the Dhammaand delivered his messageand said to the venerable AnuruddhaHere venerable sir elder bhikkhus have come to me and said Householder develop the immeasurable deliverance of mindand some elders have said Householder develop the exalted deliverance of mindthis is called the exalted deliverance of mindHere a bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of the roots of two or three trees pervading it as exaltedthis too is called the exalted deliverance of mindan area the size of

development is more exaltedyet I have something further to askAre all those radiant ones deities of Defiled Radiance or are some of them deities of Pure Radiancefor some wise men here understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simileSo too here a bhikkhu abides resolved upon and pervading an area with a defiled radianceOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of the gods of Defiled Radiancebecause of this he meditates as it were brightlyTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen when it was morning the venerable Bhumija dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went to the house of Prince Jayasena and sat down on a seat made readyWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideWhat does the venerable Bhumijas teacher say here what does he declareI have not heard and learned that from the Blessed Ones own lips princeBut it is possible that the Blessed One might say this If one makes an aspiration and one leads the holy life unwisely one is unable to procure any fruit if one makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life unwisely one is still unable to procure any fruit if one both makes an aspiration and makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life unwisely one is still unable to procure any fruit if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life unwisely one is still unable to procure any fruitHowever if one makes an aspiration and one leads the holy life wisely one is able to

wisely one is still able to procure fruit if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life wisely one is still able to procure fruitI have not heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips princeIf Master Bhumijas teacher speaks thus if he declares thus then it certainly seems that the venerable Bhumijas teacher stands ahead of all the ordinary recluses and brahminsThen Prince Jayasena served the venerable Bhumija from his own dish of milk riceThen when the venerable Bhumija had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Blessed One After paying homage to him he sat down at one sideI said what has been said by the Blessed One and did not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact I hope I explained in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from my assertionSurely Bhumija when you were asked such a question and answered thus you said what has been said by me and did not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact You explained in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from your assertionWhy is thatBecause that wrong path is not a proper method for procuring fruitSuppose a man needing oil seeking oil wandering in search of oil were to heap up

reference to Prince Jayasena he would have spontaneously acquired confidence in you and being confident would have shown his confidence to youVenerable sir how could these four similes have occurred to me with reference to Prince Jayasena as they occur to the Blessed One since they are spontaneous and have never been heard beforeThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Bhumija was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThen Prince Jayasena went to the venerable Bhumija and exchanged greetings with himand said to the venerable Bhumija Master Bhumija there are some recluses and brahmins who make such assertions and hold such views as this If one makes an aspiration and one leads the holy life one is unable to procure any fruit if one makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life one is still unable to procure any fruit if one both makes an aspiration and makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life one is still unable to procure any fruit if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life one is still unable to procure any fruitbut it is possible that the Blessed One would answer as I have statedand told the Blessed One what had occurred addingOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nadika in the brick hallThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus Bhikkhus Venerable sir those bhikkhus repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus mindfulness of death when developed and cultivated is of great fruit and benefit culminating in the deathless having the deathless as its consummation When this was said one bhikkhu said to the Blessed OneBhante I develop mindfulness of deathBut how  bhikkhu do you develop mindfulness of deathHere Bhante I think thus May I live just a night and a day so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish muchIt is in this way that I develop mindfulness of deathAnother bhikkhu said to the Blessed One I too Bhante develop mindfulness of deathBut how  bhikkhu do you develop mindfulness of deathHere Bhante I think May I live just a day so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of deathStill another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One I too Bhante develop mindfulness of deathBut how  bhikkhu do you develop mindfulness of deathHere Bhante I think May I live just the length of time it takes to eat a single alms meal so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of deathStill another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One I too Bhante develop mindfulness of deathBut how bhikkhu do you develop mindfulness of death Here Bhante I think May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls of food so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of deathStill another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One I tooBhante develop mindfulness of deathBut how  bhikkhu do you develop mindfulness of deathHere Bhante I think May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful of food so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of deathStill another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One I too Bhante develop mindfulness of deathHere Bhante I think May I live just the length of time it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much It is in this way that I develop mindfulness of deathWhen this was said the Blessed One said to those bhikkhus Bhikkhus the bhikkhu who develops mindfulness of death thus May I live just a night and a day so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much and the one who develops mindfulness of death thus May I live just a day so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much and the one who develops mindfulness of death thus May I live just the length of time it takes to eat a single alms meal so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much and the one who develops mindfulness of death thus May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls of food so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much these are called bhikkhus who dwell heedlessly They develop mindfulness of death sluggishly for the destruction of the taintsBut the bhikkhu who develops mindfulness of death thus May I live just the length of time it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful of food so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much and the one who develops mindfulness of death thus May I live just the length of time it takes to breathe out after breathing inor to breathe in after breathing out so that I may attend to the Blessed Ones teaching I could then accomplish much these are called bhikkhus who dwell heedfully They develop mindfulness of death keenly for the destruction of the taintsTherefore bhikkhus you should train yourselves thus We will dwell heedfully We will develop mindfulness of death keenly for the destruction of the taintsThus should you train yourselvesBut do youbhikkhus develop mindfulness of deathBut how bhikkhu do you develop mindfulness of deathOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Nadika in the brick hallThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhusBhikkhus mindfulness of death when developed and cultivated is of great fruit and benefit culminating in the deathless having the deathless as its consummationAnd how is this soHere bhikkhus when day has receded and night has approached a bhikkhu reflects thus I could die on account of many causes A snake might bite me or a scorpion or centipede might sting me and I might die that would be an obstacle for meI might stumble and fall down or my food might disagree with me or my bile might become agitated or my phlegm might become agitated or sharp winds in me might become agitated and I might die that would be an obstacle for meThis bhikkhu should reflect thus Do I have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight Ifupon review  the bhikkhu knows I have bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight then he should put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualitiesJust as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire effortzeal enthusiasm  indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to extinguish the fire on his clothes or head so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire effort zealenthusiasm  indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualitiesBut if upon review the bhikkhu knows thus I do not have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandonedwhich might become an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight then he should dwell in that same rapture and joy training day and night in wholesome qualitiesBut when night has receded and day has approached a bhikkhu reflects thus I could die on account of many causes A snake might bite me This bhikkhu should reflect thus Do I have any bad unwholesome qualities that have not been abandoned which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die this day Ifupon review the bhikkhu knows I have bad unwholesome qualities that I have not yet abandoned which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die this day then he should put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm  indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualitiesJust as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire effort zeal enthusiasm indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to extinguish the fire on his clothes or head so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire effortzeal enthusiasm indefatigability mindfulness and clear comprehension to abandon those bad unwholesome qualitiesBut if upon review the bhikkhu knows I do not have any bad unwholesome qualities that I have not yet abandoned which might become an obstacle for me if I were to die this day then he should dwell in that same rapture and joy training day and night in wholesome qualitiesIt is bhikkhus when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated in this way that it is of great fruit and benefitculminating in the deathless having the deathless as its consummationor sharp winds might become agitated in me and I might die that would be an obstacle for meNow at that time the group of six monks went in a vehicle and there was a bull in the middle yoked with cows and there was a cow in the middle yoked with bullsPeople  spread it about saying As at the festival of the Ganges and MahīThey told this matter to the LordHe said Monks you should not go in a vehicleWhoever should go there is an offence of wrongdoingNow at that time a certain monk going through the Kosala country to Sāvatthī in order to see the Lord became ill on the wayThen that monk stepping aside from the road sat down at the root of a certain treePeople seeing that monk spoke thus Where honoured sir will the master go I will go to Sāvatthī sirs in order to see the LordCome honoured sir we will go alongI am not able to sirs I am illCome honoured sir get into a vehicleNo sirs a vehicle is objected to by the Lord and being scrupulous he did not get into a vehicleThen that monk having arrived at Sāvatthī told this matter to the monksThe monks told this matter to the LordHe said I allow monks a vehicle to one who is illThen it occurred to these monks Now should yoked with cows or yoked with bullsThey told this matter to the LordHe said I allow you monks a handcart yoked with a bullNow at that time a certain monk became extremely uncomfortable owing to the jolting of a vehicleThey told this matter to the LordHe said I allow monks a palanquin a sedanchairAt one time the awakened one the Lord was staying at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture PeakNow at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha ruled with supreme authority over eighty thousand villagesNow at that time at Campā a merchants son called Soṇa Koḷivisa was delicately nurturedThen King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having had those eighty thousand village overseers convened sent a messenger to Soṇa Koḷivisa on some business saying Let Soṇa come I want Soṇa to comeThen Soṇa Koḷivisas parents spoke thus to Soṇa Koḷivisa The king dear Soṇa wants to see your feetDo not you dear Soṇa stretch out your feet towards the kingThen Soṇa Koḷivisa approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having approached having greeted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha he sat down crosslegged in front of the kingSo King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha saw the down that was growing on the soles of Soṇa Koḷivisas feetThen King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having instructed those eighty thousand village overseers in matters concerning this world dismissed them saying You good sirs are now instructed by me in matters concerning this world go along pay homage to this Lord and our Lord will instruct you in transcendental mattersNow at that time the venerable Sāgata was the Lords attendantThen those eighty thousand village overseers approached the venerable Sāgata having approached they spoke thus to the venerable Sāgata Honoured sir these eighty thousand village overseers are approaching here to see the Lord It were good honoured sir if we might have a chance to see the LordWell then do you venerable ones remain here for a moment until I have let the Lord knowThen the venerable Sāgata having stepped down from the moonstone in front of the eighty thousand watching village overseers having stepped up in front of the Lord spoke thus to the Lord Lord these eighty thousand village overseers are approaching here to see the Lord Lord does the Lord think it is now the right time for this Well then do you Sāgata make a seat ready in the shade of the dwellingplaceVery well Lord and the venerable Sāgata having answered the Lord in assent having taken a chair having stepped down from in front of the Lord having stepped up on the moonstone in front of the eighty thousand watching village overseers made ready a seat in the shade of the dwellingplaceThen the Lord having issued from the dwellingplace sat down on the seat made ready in the shade of the dwellingplaceThen those eighty thousand village overseers approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord they sat down at a respectful distanceThen those eighty thousand village overseers paid respect only to the venerable Sāgata not likewise to the LordThen the Lord knowing by reasoning of mind the minds of those eighty thousand village overseers addressed the venerable Sāgata saying Well then do you Sāgata abundantly show a state of furthermen a wonder of psychic powerVery well Lord and the venerable Sagata having answered the Lord in assent having risen above the ground paced up and down in the air in the atmosphere and he stood and he sat down and he lay down and he smoked and he blazed and then he vanishedThen the venerable Sagata having shown in the air in the atmosphere various states of furthermen and wonders of psychic power having inclined his head towards the Lords feet spoke thus to the Lord Lord the Lord is my teacher I am a discipleThen those eighty thousand village overseers saying Indeed it is marvellousThen the Lord knowing by reasoning of mind the minds of those eighty thousand village overseers talked a progressive talk that is to say talk on giving talk on moral habit talk on heaven he explained the peril the vanity the depravity of pleasures of the senses the advantage in renouncing When the Lord knew that their minds were ready malleable devoid of the hindrances uplifted pleased then he explained to them that teaching on dhamma which the awakened ones have themselves discovered ill uprising stopping the wayAnd as a clean cloth without black specks will easily take dye even so as those eighty thousand village overseers were on that very seat dhammavision dustless stainless arose that whatever is of the nature to uprise all that is of the nature to stopThese having seen dhamma attained dhamma known dhamma plunged into dhamma having crossed over doubt having put away uncertainty having attained without anothers help to full confidence in the teachers instruction spoke thus to the Lord Excellent Lord it is excellent LordJust as Lord one should set upright what has been upset or should uncover what is covered or should point out the way to one who is astray or should bring a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms even so is dhamma explained in many a figure by the LordWe Lord are those going to the Lord for refugeMay the Lord receive us as layfollowers gone for refuge on this day for as long as life lastsand down came to have grown on the soles of his feetsit down crosslegged in front of the kingand as you are sitting down the king will see your feetThen they sent Soṇa Koḷivisa away in a palanquinThen those eighty thousand village overseers approached Mount Vulture PeakLord the Lord is my teacher I am a discipleto dhamma and to the Order of monksindeed it is wonderfulthat even a disciple can be of such great psychic power of such great might What must the teacher be  paid respect only to the Lord not likewise to the venerable SagataThen it occurred to Soṇa Koḷivisa In so far as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord it is not easy for those who live in a house to lead the Brahmafaring that is wholly complete wholly pure and polished like a conchshell What now if I having cut off hair and beard having donned yellow robes should go forth from home into homelessness Then those eighty thousand village overseers delighted with the Lords speech having given thanks for it having risen from the seat having greeted the Lord departed keeping their right sides towards himThen Soṇa Koḷivisa soon after those eighty thousand village overseers had departed approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distanceAs he was sitting down at a respectful distance Soṇa Koḷivisa spoke thus to the Lord In so far as I Lord understand dhamma taught by the Lord it is not easy for those who live in a house to lead the Brahmafaring that is wholly complete wholly pure and polished like a conchshellI want Lord having cut off hair and beard having donned yellow robes to go forth from home into homelessnessLord may the Lord let me go forthAnd soon after he was ordained the venerable Soṇa stayed in the Cool GroveBecause of his great output of energy in pacing up and down his feet brokeyet my mind is not freed from the cankers with no graspingand moreover there are my familys possessions It might be possible to enjoy the possessions and to do goodSuppose that I having returned to the low life should enjoy the possessions and should do good Then the Lord knowing by mind the venerable Soṇas reasoning of mind as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm so did he vanishing from Mount Vulture Peak appear in the Cool GroveThen the Lord touring the lodgings together with several monks approached the venerable Soṇas place for pacing up and down inThe Lord saw that the venerable Soṇas place for pacing up and down in was stained with blood and seeing  he addressed the monks saying Now why monks is this place for pacing up and down in stained with blood as though there has been slaughter of cattle Lord because of the venerable Soṇas great energy in pacing up and down his feet brokeThen the Lord approached the venerable Soṇas dwellingplace and having approached he sat down on an appointed seatAnd the venerable Soṇa having greeted the Lord sat down at a respectful distanceThe Lord spoke thus to the venerable Soṇa as he was sitting at a respectful distance Soṇa as you were meditating in private did not a reasoning arise in your mind like this Those who are the Lords disciples dwell putting forth energy I am one of theseYes LordWhat do you think about this Soṇa Were you clever at the lutes stringed music when formerly you were a householder Yes LordWhat do you think about this Soṇa When the strings of your lute were too taut was your lute at that time tuneful and fit for playing No indeed LordWhat do you think about this Soṇa When the strings of your lute were too slack was your lute at that time tuneful and fit for playing No indeed LordWhat do you think about this Soṇa When the strings of your lute were neither too taut nor too slack but were keyed to an even pitch was your lute at that time tuneful and fit for playing Yes LordEven so Soṇa does too much output of energy conduce to restlessness does too feeble energy conduce to slothfulnessTherefore do you Soṇa determine upon evenness in energy and pierce the evenness of the faculties and reflect upon itYes Lord the venerable Soṇa answered the Lord in assentThen the Lord having exhorted the venerable Soṇa with this exhortation as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm so did he vanishing from in front of the venerable Soṇa in the Cool Grove appear on Mount Vulture PeakAfter that the venerable Soṇa determined upon evenness in energy and he pierced the evenness of the faculties and reflected upon itThen the venerable Soṇa dwelling alone aloof earnest ardent selfresolute having soon realised here and now by his own superknowledge that supreme goal of the Brahmafaring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness abided in itAnd so the venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected onesWhen the venerable Soṇa had attained perfection it occurred to him Suppose I were to declare profound knowledge in the Lords presenceThen the venerable Soṇa approached the Lord having approached having greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distanceAs he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable Soṇa spoke thus to the Lord Lord that monk who is one perfected who has destroyed the cankers lived the life done what was to be done shed the burden won his own goal destroyed utterly the fetter of becoming and is wholly freed by profound knowledge he comes to be intent upon six matters he comes to be intent upon renunciation he comes to be intent upon aloofness he comes to be intent upon nonharming he comes to be intent upon the destruction of grasping he comes to be intent upon the destruction of craving he comes to be intent upon nonconfusionPerhaps Lord one of the venerable ones here might think Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon renunciation depending upon mere faith alone But this Lord is not to be regarded thusLord the monk who has destroyed the cankers has lived the life done what was to be done not seeing aught in himself to be done or to be added to what has been done being passionless comes to be intent on renunciation because of the destruction of passion being without hatred comes to be intent on renunciation because of the destruction of hatred being without confusion comes to be intent on renunciation because of the destruction of confusionPerhaps Lord one of the venerable ones here might think Could it be that this venerable one of the destruction of passion being without hatred  being without confusion comes to be intent on aloofness because of the destruction of confusionBeing passionless he comes to be intent on the destruction of grasping because of the destruction of passion being without hatred he comes to be intent on the destruction of grasping because of the destruction of hatred being without confusion he comes to be intent on the destruction of grasping because of the destruction of confusionThus Lord even if shapes cognisable by the eye come very strongly into the field of vision of a monk whose mind is wholly freed they do not obsess his mindIf sounds cognisable by the ear  if scents cognisable by the nose  if tastes cognisable by the tongue  if touches cognisable by the body  if mental objects cognisable by the mind come very strongly into the field of thought of a monk whose mind is wholly freed they do not obsess his mind for his mind comes to be undefiled firm won to composure and he notes its passing henceIt is as if Lord there were a rocky mountain slope without a cleft without a hollow of one mass and as if wild wind and rain should come very strongly from the eastern quarterit would neither tremble nor quake nor shake violently and as if wild wind and rain should come very strongly from the western quarter  from the northern quarter  from the southern quarterit would neither tremble nor quake nor shake violentlyEven so Lord if shapes cognisable by the eye come very strongly into the field of vision of a monk whose mind is wholly freed  if mental objects cognisable by the mind come very strongly into the field of thought of a monk whose mind is wholly freed they do not obsess his mind for his mind comes to be undefiled firm won to composure and he notes its passing henceIf one is intent upon renunciation and minds aloofnessIf one is intent upon nonharming and destruction of graspingIf one is intent upon destruction of craving and minds nonconfusionHaving seen sensations rise his mind is wholly freedFor that monk whose mind is calmed and wholly freedThere is nothing to add to what has been done there is naught to be doneAs a rock of one mass by wind is never movedSo shapes tastes sounds scents touches and allPleasant and unpleasant mental objects stir not a man like thisHis mind is firm well freed and he notes its passing henceSo Soṇa Koḷivisa received the going forth in the Lords presence he received ordinationthe place for pacing up and down in became stained with blood as though there had been slaughter of cattle Then as the venerable Soṇa was meditating in private a reasoning arose in his mind thus Those who are the Lords disciples dwell putting forth energy I am one of theseand this place for pacing up and down in is stained with his blood as though there had been slaughter of cattleSuppose that I having returned to the low life should enjoy the possessions and should do good yet my mind is not freed from the cankers with no graspingand moreover there are my familys possessions It might be possible to enjoy the possessions and to do goodand he understood Destroyed is birth lived is the Brahmafaring done is what was to be done there is no more of being such and suchbeing passionless he comes to be intent on nonconfusion because of the destruction of passion being without hatred he comes to be intent on nonconfusion because of the destruction of hatred being without confusion he comes to be intent on nonconfusion because of the destruction of confusionbeing passionless he comes to be intent on the destruction of craving because of the destruction of passion being without hatred he comes to be intent on the destruction of craving because of the destruction of hatred being without confusion he comes to be intent on the destruction of craving because of the destruction of confusionfor his mind comes to be undefiled firm won to composure and he notes its passing henceLord the monk who has destroyed the cankers  or to be added to what has been done being passionless comes to be intent on nonharming because of the destruction of passion being without hatred  being without confusion comes to be intent on nonharming because of the destruction of confusionPerhaps Lord one of the venerable ones here might think Could it be that this venerable one is intent on nonharming is backsliding from the essence to the contagion of habit and customBut this Lord is not to be regarded thusThe King of Magadha Soṇa and eightythousand chieftainsSāgata showed much that was

to the Elder SoṇaThen the Lord addressed the monks saying Thus monks do young men of family declare profound knowledge The goal is spoken of but the self is not obtrudedBut then it seems to me that there are some foolish men here who declare profound knowledge for fun these afterwards come to disasterThen the Lord addressed the venerable Soṇa saying You Soṇa have been delicately nurturedI allow for you Soṇa sandals with one liningBut I Lord gave up eighty cartloads of gold when I went forth from home into homelessness and a herd of seven elephantsBecause of this there will be speakers against me saying Soṇa Koḷivisa gave up eighty cartloads of gold when he went forth from home into homelessness and a herd of seven elephantsIf the Lord will allow them to the Order of monks I too will make use of them but if the Lord will not allow them to the Order of monks neither will I make use of themMonks doubly lined sandals should not be wornWhoever should wear  there is an offence of

rising from his seat having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder having inclined his head to the Lords feet spoke thusLord my preceptor the venerable Kaccāna the Great salutes the Lords feet with his head and speaks thus The southern region of Avantī Lord I allow monks in all border districts ordination by a group with as fifth an expert on disciplineFor this purpose these are the border districts the little town called Kajaṅgala is in the eastern direction beyond it is Mahāsālā further than that are border districts on this side are the middle  The river called Sallavatī is in the southeastern direction further than that are border districts on this side are the middle  The little town called Setakaṇṇika is in the southern direction further than that are border districts on this side are the middle  The brahmin village called Thūna is in the western direction further than that are border districts on this side are the middle  The mountain slope called Usīraddhaja is in the northern direction further than that are border districts on this side are the middle I allow monks in such border districts as these ordination by a group with as fifth an expert on disciplineIn the southern region of Avantī monks the surfacesoil is dark hard trampled by the hooves of cattleI allow monks in all border districts sandals with many liningsIn the southern region of Avantī monks people attach importance to bathing to purification by waterI allow monks in all border districts constant bathingIn the southern region of Avantī monks hides coverings sheephide goathide deerhideAs monks in the middle districts eragu moragu majjhāra jantu  so monks in the southern region of Avantī hides coverings sheephide goathide deerhideI allow monks in all border districts hides coverings sheephide goathide deerhideAnd moreover monks people give robematerial for monks who have gone outside the boundaries saying We are giving this robematerial for so and soI allow you monks to consent  That reckoning is not necessary until it reaches the handand then speak thus Lord the southern region of Avantī is short of monks At the end of three years  with difficulty with trouble having had convened for me from here and there an Order of monks consisting of ten I received ordination Perhaps the Lord would allow ordination by a smaller group in the southern region of AvantīWhen these have come back announce Your reverences robematerial was given for you by the people so and so But these being scrupulous do not consent to it thinking Let there not be an offence involving forfeiture for us Perhaps the Lord would explain the procedure in regard to robematerial and that you are endowed with lovely speech distinct without hoarseness so as to make the meaning clearThen the Lord having understood this matter at that time uttered this utteranceThen the Lord on this occasion in this connection having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying Monks the southern region of Avantī is short of monks perhaps the Lord would explain the procedure in regard to robematerialOne who wants to develop the recollection of peace mentioned next to mindfulness of breathing should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of Nibbāna in other words the stilling of all suffering as follows Bhikkhus in so far as there are dhammas whether formed or unformed fading away is pronounced the best of them that is to say the disillusionment of vanity the elimination of thirst the abolition of reliance the termination of the round the destruction of craving fading away cessation Nibbāna Herein in so far as means as many asDhammas means individual essencesWhether formed or unformed whether made by conditions going together coming together or not so madeFading away is pronounced the best of them of these formed and unformed dhammas fading away is pronounced the best is called the foremost the highestHerein fading away is not mere absence of greed but rather it is that unformed dhamma which while given the names disillusionment of vanity etc in the clause that is to say the disillusionment of vanity  Nibbāna is treated basically as fading awayBut it is called abolition of reliance because on coming to its reliance on the five cords of sense desire is abolishedIt is called termination of the round because on coming to it the round of the three planes of existence is terminatedIt is called destruction of craving because on coming to it craving is entirely destroyed fades away and ceasesIt is called Nibbāna because it has gone away from  has escaped from  is dissociated from craving which has acquired in common usage the name fastening because by ensuring successive becoming craving serves as a joining together a binding together a lacing together of the four kinds of generation five destinies seven stations of consciousness and nine abodes of beingsThis is how peace in other words Nibbāna should be recollected according to its special qualities beginning with disillusionment of vanityBut it should also be recollected according to the other special qualities of peace stated by the Blessed One in the suttas beginning with Bhikkhus I shall teach you the unformed  the truth  the other shore  the hardtosee  the undecaying  the lasting  the undiversified  the deathless  the auspicious  the safe  the marvellous  the intact  the unafflicted  the purity  the island  the shelter  As he recollects peace in its special qualities of disillusionment of vanity etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed or obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by peace So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described under the recollection of the Enlightened One etc the jhāna factors arise in a single momentBut owing to the profundity of the special qualities of peace or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of various kinds the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that jhāna itself is known as recollection of peace too because it arises by means of the special qualities of peaceAnd as in the case of the six recollections this also comes to success only in a noble disciple Still though this is so it can nevertheless also be brought to mind by an ordinary person who values peaceFor even by hearsay the mind has confidence in peaceA bhikkhu who is devoted to this recollection of peace sleeps in bliss and wakes in bliss his faculties are peaceful his mind is peaceful he has conscience and shame he is confident he is resolved to attain the superior state he is respected and honoured by his fellows in the life of purityAnd even if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinySo that is why a man of wit Untiringly devotes his daysTo mind the noble peace which can Reward him in so many waysThis is the section dealing with the recollection of peace in the detailed explanationcomposed for the purpose of gladdening good people in the Path of Purificationin the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationcalled The Description of Recollections as Meditation SubjectsIt is called disillusionment of vanity because on coming to it all kinds of vanity  such as the vanity of conceit and vanity of manhood are disillusioned undone done away withAnd it is called elimination of thirst because on coming to it all thirst for sense desires is eliminated and quenchedThe eighth chapterIn such passages as Dhammas that are concepts even a non entity is thus called a dhamma since it is borne and affirmed by knowledge That kind of dhamma is excluded by his saying Dhammas means individual essencesThe act of becoming  which constitutes existing ness in the ultimate sense is essence  it is with essence  thus it is an individual essence  the meaning is that it is possible in the true sense in the ultimate senseFor these are called dhammas  because they bear their own individual essences  and they are called individual essences in the sense already explainedMade is generatedNot so made is not made by any conditions at allThat dhamma possessing individual essence and having the characteristic of being not formed is to be treated basically as fading away since it is there that the dhamma of defilement fades awayThe words such as refer to vanity of birth and so on Vanity of manhood is vanity about being of the male sexHerein vanity of conceit  is conceit that occurs as conceiving I am superior  When they are being abandoned by the noble path which occurs by making Nibbāna its object it is said that they are abandoned by reaching that Nibbāna which is why he said Because on coming to it and so onThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the ministers of justiceFor on a certain day the monks made their rounds for alms in a settlement at the north gate of Sāvatthi and returning from their pilgrimage to the monastery passed through the center of the cityAt that moment a cloud came up and the rain began to fallEntering a hall of justice opposite they saw lords of justice taking bribes and depriving lawful owners of their property Seeing this they thought Ah these men are unrighteous Until now we supposed they rendered righteous judgments When the rain was over they went to the monastery saluted the Teacher and sitting respectfully on one side informed him of the incidentSaid the Teacher Monks they that yield to evil desires and decide a cause by violence are not properly called justices they only that penetrate within a wrong and without violence render judgment according to the wrong committed are properly called justices So saying he pronounced the following StanzasNot therefore is a man called a justice because he decides a cause arbitrarilyNay rather is it he that inquires into both right and wrong he that is wiseHe that leads others without violence justly and righteouslyHe that is protected of the Law he that is intelligent he alone is properly called a justiceVenerable sir I hope that when I was asked such a questionWhatever recluses and brahmins have wrong view wrong intention wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration if they make an aspiration and they lead the holy life they are unable to procure any fruit if they make no aspiration and they lead the holy life they are still unable to procure any fruit if they both make an aspiration and make no aspiration and they lead the holy life they are still unable to procure any fruit if they neither make an aspiration nor make no aspiration and they lead the holy life they are still unable to procure any fruitand answered thusTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow on that occasion the novice Aciravata was living in a forest hutThen Prince Jayasena while wandering and walking for exercise went to the novice Aciravata and exchanged greetings with himThat is so prince that is soA bhikkhu who abides here diligent ardent and resolute can achieve unification of mindIt would be good if Master Aggivessana would teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and mastered itI cannot teach you the Dhamma prince as I have heard it and mastered itFor if I were to teach you the Dhamma as I have heard it and mastered it you would not understand the meaning of my words and that would be wearying and troublesome for meLet Master Aggivessana teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and mastered itPerhaps I can understand the meaning of his wordsI shall teach you the Dhamma prince as I have heard it and mastered itIf you can understand the meaning of my words that will be good But if you cannot understand the meaning then leave it at that and do not question me about it furtherLet Master Aggivessana teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and mastered itIf I can understand the meaning of his words that will be good If I cannot understand the meaning then I will leave it at that and I will not question him about it furtherThen the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had heard it and mastered itAfter he had spoken Prince Jayasena remarked It is impossible Master Aggivessana it cannot happen that a bhikkhu who abides diligent ardent and resolute can achieve unification of mindThen having declared to the novice Aciravata that this was impossible and could not happen Prince Jayasena rose from his seat and departedSoon after Prince Jayasena had left the novice Aciravata went to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with Prince JayasenaWhen he had finished the Blessed One said to him  Aggivessana how is it possiblethat Prince Jayasena living in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying sensual pleasures being devoured by thoughts of sensual pleasures being consumed by the fever of sensual pleasures bent on the search for sensual pleasures could know see or realise that which must be known through renunciation seen through renunciation attained through renunciation realised through renunciation That is impossibleSuppose Aggivessana there were two tamable elephants horses or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined and two tamable elephants horses or oxen that were untamed and undisciplinedWhat do you think Aggivessana Would the two tamable elephants horses or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined being tamed acquire the behaviour of the tamed would they arrive at the grade of the tamed Yes venerable sir But would the two tamable elephants horses or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined being untamed acquire the behaviour of the tamed would they arrive at the grade of the tamed like the two tamable elephants horses or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined No venerable sir So too Aggivessana it is impossible that Prince Jayasena living in the midst of sensual pleasurescould know see or realise that which must be known through renunciation seen through renunciation attained through renunciation realised through renunciationSuppose Aggivessana there were a high mountain not far from a village or townand two friends would leave the village or town and approach the mountain hand in hand Having reached it one friend would remain below at the foot of the mountain while the other would climb to the topThen the friend who remained below at the foot of the mountain would say to the friend who stood on the top Well friend what do you see standing on top of the mountainAnd the other replied Standing on top of the mountain friend I see lovely parks lovely groves lovely meadows and lovely pondsThen the first friend would say It is impossible friend it cannot happen that while Standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks lovely groves lovely meadows and lovely pondsThen the other friend would come down to the foot of the mountain take his friend by the arm and make him climb to the top of the mountain After giving him a few moments to catch his breath he would ask Well friend standing on top of the mountain what do you seeAnd his friend would reply Standing on top of the mountain friend I see lovely parks lovely groves lovely meadows and lovely pondsThen the other would say Friend just a little earlier we heard you say It is impossible friend it cannot happen that while standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parkslovely pondsBut just now we heard you say Standing on top of the mountain friend I see lovely parkslovely pondsThen the first friend would reply Because I was obstructed by this high mountain friend I did not see what was there to be seenSo too Aggivessana Prince Jayasena is obstructed hindered blocked and enveloped by a still greater mass than this the mass of ignoranceThus it is impossible that Prince Jayasena living in the midst of sensual pleasurescould know see or realise that which must be known through renunciation seen through renunciation attained through renunciation realised through renunciationAggivessana if these two similes had occurred to you with reference to Prince Jayasena he would have spontaneously acquired confidence in you and being confident would have shown his confidence to youVenerable sir how could these two similes have occurred to me with reference to Prince Jayasena as they occur to the Blessed One since they are spontaneous and have never been heard beforeSuppose Aggivessana a headanointed noble king addresses his elephant woodsman thus Good elephant woodsman mount the kings elephant enter the elephant wood and when you see a forest elephant bind him by the neck to the kings elephantHaving replied Yes sire the elephant woodsman mounts the kings elephant enters the elephant wood and when he sees a forest elephant binds him by the neck to the kings elephantThe kings elephant leads him out into the openIt is in this way that a forest elephant comes out into the openThen the elephant woodsman informs the headanointed noble king Sire the forest elephant has come out into the openThe king addresses his elephant tamer thus Come good elephant tamer tame the forest elephant Subdue his forest habits subdue his forest memories and intentions subdue his distress fatigue and fever over leaving the forest Get him to take delight in the town inculcate in him habits congenial to human beingsHaving replied Yes sire the elephant tamer plants a large post in the earth and binds the forest elephant to it by the neck in order to subdue his forest habitsand to inculcate in him habits congenial to human beingsThen the elephant tamer addresses the elephant with words that are gentle pleasing to the ear and loveable as go to the heart are courteous desired by many and agreeable to manyWhen the forest elephant is addressed by such words he listens gives ear and exerts his mind to understand The elephant tamer next rewards him with grassfodder and waterWhen the forest elephant accepts the grassfodder and water from him the elephant tamer knows Now the kings elephant will liveThen the elephant tamer trains him further thus Take up put downWhen the kings elephant obeys his tamers orders to take up and put down and carries out his instructions the elephant tamer trains him further thus Go forward go backWhen the kings elephant obeys his tamers orders to go forward and go back and carries out his instructions the elephant tamer trains him further thus Get up sit downWhen the kings elephant obeys his tamers orders to get up and sit down and carries out his instructions the elephant tamer trains him further in the task called imperturbability He ties a giant plank to his trunk a man with a lance in his hand sits on his neck men with lances in their hands surround him on all sides and the elephant tamer himself stands in front of him holding a long lance poleWhen the elephant is being trained in the task of imperturbability he does not move his forelegs or his hindlegs he does not move his forequarters or his hindquarters he does not move his head ears tusks tail or trunkThe kings elephant is able to endure blows from spears blows from swords blows from arrows blows from other beings and the thundering sounds of drums kettledrums trumpets and tomtoms Being rid of all faults and defects purged of flaws he is worthy of the king in the kings service considered one of the factors of a kingSo too Aggivessana a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightenedIt is in this way that a noble disciple comes out into the openThen the Tathagata disciplines him further Come bhikkhu be virtuous restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha be perfect in conduct and resort and seeing fear in the slightest fault train by

then the Tathagata disciplines him further Come bhikkhu be devoted to wakefulness During the day while walking back and forth and sitting purify your mind of obstructive states In the first watch of the night while walking back and forth and sitting purify your mind of obstructive states In the middle watch of the night you should lie down on the right side in the lions pose with one foot

collection of the eight ariyapuggalas compact through their equality as regards view and moralityTo this extent Suppabuddha announces the three refugegoings vizMay the Lord accept me as a layfollower such that Beginning with today whilst furnished with lifes breath I be one gone as refuge And this ones refugegoing had already been accomplished through attainment of the ariyan path even though he speaks thus disclosing such to be his intentionWhilst furnished with lifes breath  pāṇupetaṃ pāṇehi upetaṃ  may the Lord accept me asmeaning may he know me asone abiding by the rules one who is a layfollower on account of close association with the Three jewels who be gone as refuge by way of the three refugegoings one having no other teacher so long as I be furnished  as life continues for meBeginning with today  making today the starting point  Aijadagge is also a reading wherein the syllable da provides a euphonic link between the words meaning beginning with today  making today the starting point When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand said to the novice AciravataMaster Aggivessana I have heard that a bhikkhu who abides here diligent ardent and resolute can achieve unification of mindThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Ghosita monastery near Kosambi and it was with reference to the loss by death of the five hundred women led by Sāmāvatī and of Māgandiyā and her five hundred kinswomen From beginning to end the story is as followsOnce upon a time King Allakappa ruled over the kingdom of Allakappa and King Veṭhadīpaka ruled over the kingdom of Veṭhadīpaka They had been intimate friends since their boyhooddays and had received their education in the house of the same teacher On the death of their fathers they raised the royal parasol and became rulers of kingdoms each of which was ten leagues in extentAs they met from time to time and stood and sat and lay down to sleep together and watched the multitudes being born into the world and dying again they came to the conclusion When a man goes to the world beyond he can take nothing with him  he must leave everything behind him when he goes thither even his own body does not follow him of what use to us is the life of the householder Let us retire from the worldAccordingly they resigned their kingdoms to son and wife retired from the world adopted the life of ascetics and took up their residence in the Himālaya countryAlthough we have renounced our kingdoms and retired from the world we shall encounter no difficulty in gaining a living but if we reside together in the same place our life will be quite unlike the life of ascetics therefore let us live apart You live on this mountain I will live on that Every fortnight on fastday we will meet togetherEvery fortnight on fastday we will meet togetherThen this thought occurred to them Under this arrangement  neither of us will be in regular communication with the other but in order that each of us may know whether the other is living or not you light a fire on your mountain and I will light a fire on mineAnd this they didAfter a time the ascetic Veṭhadīpaka died and was reborn as a prince of deities of mighty powerA fortnight later Allakappa saw no fire on the mountain and knew that his comrade was deadAs soon as ever Veṭhadīpaka was reborn he surveyed his own heavenly glory considered the deeds of his former existence reviewed the austerities he had performed from the day when he retired from the world and said to himself I will go see my comrade Accordingly he laid aside his form as a deity disguised himself as a wayfarer went to Allakappa paid obeisance to him and stood respectfully on one sideAllakappa said to him Whence have you comeI am a wayfarer Reverend Sir I have come a long distanceBut Reverend Sir does your honor reside entirely alone in this place Is there no one else hereI have a single comradeWhere is heHe resides on that mountain but as he failed to light a fire on fastday I know he must be deadIs that so Reverend SirThat is so brotherI am he Reverend SirWhere were you rebornReverend Sir I was reborn in the World of the Gods as a prince of deities of mighty power I have returned to see your honorDoes your honorable self reside in this place undisturbed or are you subject to some annoyanceYes brother I am bothered to death by the elephantsReverend Sir what do the elephants do to trouble youThey drop dung on the ground I have swept clean and they stamp with their feet and kick up the dust What with removing the dung and smoothing the ground I am all worn outWell would you like to keep them awayYes brotherWell then I will provide you with means whereby you can keep them awayThereafter the ascetic lived in peace driving the elephants away by uttering the proper spell and striking the proper stringAccordingly Veṭhadīpaka gave Allakappa a lute to charm elephants with and likewise taught him spells for charming elephants Now as he presented the lute to him he showed him three strings and taught him three spells Strike this string said he and utter this spell and the elephants will turn and run away without so much as daring even to look at you strike this string and utter this spell and they will turn and run away eyeing you at every step strike this string and utter this spell and the leader of the herd will come up and offer you his back Now do as you like With these words he departedAt this time Parantapa was king of KosambiOne day he was sitting out in the open air basking himself in the rays of the newly risen sun and beside him sat his queen great with childThe queen was wearing the kings cloak a crimson blanket worth a hundred thousand pieces of money and as she sat there conversing with the king she removed from the kings finger the royal signet worth a hundred thousand pieces of money and slipped it on her ownJust at that moment a monster bird with a bill as big as an elephants trunk came soaring through the air Seeing the queen and mistaking her for a piece of meat he spread his wings and swooped downWhen the king heard the bird swoop down he sprang to his feet and entered the royal palaceBut the queen because she was great with child and because she was of a timid nature was unable to make hasteThe bird pounced upon her caught her up in the cage of his talons and soared away with her into the airThese birds are said to possess the strength of five elephantsthey are therefore able to convey their victims through the air settle wherever they wish and devour their fleshAs the queen was being carried away by the bird terrified though she was with the fear of death she preserved her presence of mind and thought to herself Animals stand in great fear of the human voice Therefore if I cry out this bird will drop me the instant he hears the sound of my voiceBut in that case I should accomplish only my own destruction and that of my unborn child If however I wait until he settles somewhere and begins to eat then I can make a noise and frighten him awayThrough her own wisdom therefore she kept patience and enduredNow there stood at that time in the Himālaya country a banyantree which although of brief growth had attained great size  and was like a pavilion in formand to this tree that bird was accustomed to convey the carcasses of wild animals and eat them To this very tree therefore the bird conveyed the queen lodged her in a fork of the tree and watched the path leading to the treeAt that moment the queen thinking to herself Now is the time to frighten him away raised both her hands clapped them together and shouted and frightened the bird awayAt sunset the pains of travail came upon herand at the same time from all the four quarters of heaven arose a great stormhe delicate queen half dead with suffering with no one beside her to say to her Fear not lady slept not at all throughout the nights the night grew bright the clouds scattered the dawn came and her child was born at one and the same momentBecause the child was born at the time of a storm at the time when she was upon a mountain and at the time when the sun rose she named her son UdenaNot far from that tree was the place of residence of the ascetic AllakappaNow on rainy days it was the custom of the ascetic not to go into the forest for fruits and berries for fear of the cold Instead he used to go to the foot of the tree and gather up the bones from which the birds had picked the flesh then he would pound the bones make broth of them and drink the brothOn that very day therefore he went there to get bones As he was picking up bones at the foot of the tree he heard the voice of a child in the branches above Looking up he saw the queen Who are you said he I am a womanHow did you get thereA monster bird brought me here Come down said heYour honor I am afraid to come down on account of difference of casteOf what caste are youOf the Warrior casteI am also of the Warrior casteWell then give me the password of the Warrior casteHe did so Well then climb up and set down my boyFinding a way to climb the tree on one side he climbed up and took the boy in his armsobeying the queens behest not to touch her with his hand he set the boy downthen the queen herself came downThe ascetic conducted the queen along the path to his hermitage and cared for her tenderly without in any way violating his vow of chastityHe brought honey free from flies and gave it to her he brought rice grown in his own field and prepared broth and gave it to her Thus did he minister to her needsAfter a time she thought to herself For my part I know neither the way to come nor the way to go nor can I repose absolute confidence even in this ascetic Now if he were to leave us and go elsewhere we should both perish right here I must by some means seduce him to violate his vow of chastity so that he will not abandon usAccordingly she displayed herself before him with under and upper garments in disarray and thus seduced him to violate his vow of chastitythenceforth the two lived togetherOne day as the ascetic was observing a conjunction of a constellation with one of the lunar mansions he saw the occultation of Parantapas star  My lady said he Parantapa king of Kosambi is deadNoble sir why do you speak thusWhy do you bear illwill against himI bear him no illwill my lady I say this because I have just seen the occultation of his star She burst into tearsWhy do you weep he asked hen she told him that Parantapa was her own husband The ascetic replied Weep not my lady whoever is born is certain to dieI know that noble sir Then why do you weepI weep noble sir because it pains me to think To my son belongs the sovereignty by right of succession had he been there he would have raised the white parasolow he has become one of the common herdNever mind my lady be not disturbed If you desire that he shall receive the sovereignty I will devise some means by which he shall receive itAccordingly the ascetic gave the boy the lute to charm elephants with and likewise taught him the spells for charming elephantsNow at that time many thousands of elephants came and sat at the foot of the banyantreeSo the ascetic said to the boy Climb the tree before the elephants come and when they come utter this spell and strike this string and they will all turn and run away without even so much as daring to look at you then descend and come to meThe boy did as he was told and then went and told the asceticOn the second day the ascetic said to him Today utter this spell and strike this string if you please and they will turn and run away eyeing you at every stepOn that day also the boy did as he was told and then went and told the asceticThen the ascetic addressed the mother saying My lady give your son his message and he will go hence and become kingSo she addressed her son saying You must say I am the son of King Parantapa of Kosambi a monster bird carried me off Then you must utter the names of the commanderinchief and the other generals If they still refuse to believe you you must show them this blanket which was your fathers cloak and this signetring which he wore on his finger With these words she dismissed himThe boy said to the ascetic Now what shall I doThe ascetic replied Seat yourself on the lowest branch of the tree utter this spell and strike this string and the leader of the elephants will approach and offer you his back Seat yourself on his back go to your kingdom and take the sovereigntyThe boy did reverence to his parents and following the instructions of the ascetic seated himself on the back of the elephant and whispered in his ear I am the son of King Parantapa of Kosambi Get me and give me the sovereignty which I have inherited from my fatherWhen the elephant heard that he trumpeted Let many thousands of elephants assembleand many thousands of elephants assembledAgain a second time he trumpeted Let the old weak elephants retire and the old weak elephants retiredThe third time he trumpeted Let those that are very young retire and they also retiredSo the boy went forth surrounded by many thousands of warriorelephants and reaching a village on the frontier proclaimed I am the son of the kinglet those who desire worldly prosperity come with meLevying forces as he proceeded he invested the city and sent the following message to the citizens Give me battle or the kingdomThe citizens answered We will give neitherOur queen was carried off by a monster bird when she was great with child and we know not whether she is alive or deadSo long as we hear no news of herwe will give neither battle nor the kingdomAt that time we are told the kingdom was handed down from father to sonThereupon the boy said I am her son So saying he uttered the names of the commanderinchief and the other generals and when they still refused to believe him showed the blanket and the ringThey recognized the blanket and the ring opened the gates and sprinkled him kingOnce upon a time there was a famine in the kingdom of Ajita and a man named Kotūhalaka unable to get a living took his young son Kāpi and his wife Kāḷi and thinking I will go to Kosambi and get a living there set out with provisions for the journeyThere are also those who say that he left his home because the people were dying of intestinal diseaseAs they proceeded on their journey their provisions gave out and finally they were so overcome with hunger that they were not able to carry the boyhereupon the husband said to his wife Wife if we live we shall have another son Let us cast this child away and continue our journey aloneThere is a proverb A mothers heart is tender and so it was with this womanShe replied I could never cast away a living childWell what shall we doCarry him by turnsWhen the mothers turn came she would lift the child like a wreath of flowers clasp him to her breast or carry him on her hip finally giving him back to his fatherWhen the father took the child no matter where he held him he suffered more intense pain than ever from hungerAgain and again he said to his wife Wife if we live we shall have another son Let us cast this child awayBut this the mother steadfastly refused to doFinally the child became so tired from being passed back and forth that he fell asleep in the arms of his fatherWhen the father observed that he was asleep allowing the mother to precede him he went and laid the child on a couch of leaves under a bush immediately resuming his journeyThe mother turned looked back and not seeing the child asked Husband where is my sonI laid him down under a certain bushHusband do not kill me Without my son I cannot live Bring my son back to me nd she smote upon her breast and weptSo the husband retraced his steps recovered the child and brought him back to herIn consequence of having cast away his child on this one occasion Kotūhalaka was himself cast away seven times in a later existenceLet no one regard an evil deed lightly saying It is only a small matterContinuing their journey they came to the house of a certain herdsmanOn that day as it happened one of the herdsmans cows had calved and the herdsman was about to hold the customary festival in honor of the eventNow a certain Private Buddha was accustomed to take his meals in the house of the hersdmanThe herdsman after providing the Private Buddha with food celebrated the cowfestivalwith an abundant supply of riceporridgeWhen the herdsman saw the visitors he asked them Whence have you come They told him the whole story whereupon the tenderhearted youth took pity on them and saw to it that they were given riceporridge with a plentiful supply of gheeThe wife said to the husband Husband if only you can live I can live For a long time you have not had sufficient food Now eat to your hearts content So saying she set the ghee and curds before him eating only a little of the ghee herselfThe husband ate heartily but so intense was the hunger from which he had suffered during the preceding seven or eight days that he was unable to satisfy itWhen the herdsman had seen to it that they were provided with riceporridge he began himself to eatNow under the herdsmans stool lay a bitch he had raised and as the herdsman sat there eating he fed her with morsels of riceporridge Kotūhalaka watched him feed her and thought to himself Fortunate indeed is that bitch to get such food to eatKotūhalaka was unable to digest the riceporridge he had eaten died during the night and received a new existence in the womb of that very bitchHis wife performed the funeral ceremonies over his body and remaining in that very house worked for hire Receiving a pintpot of rice she cooked it and placed it in the bowl of the Private Buddha saying May these grains of rice bring a reward to your servant And she thought to herself It would be well for me to remain right here The Private Buddha comes here regularly and whether there be alms or not I shall have the privilege of paying obeisance to him each day and of ministering to him By so doing I shall obtain peace of mind and earn much meritAnd she remained right there working for hireAfter six or seven months the bitch gave birth to a single pupThe herdsman reserved the milk of one cow for the pupand in no long time he grew to be a fine big dogWhen the Private Buddha ate his meal he invariably gave him a portion of his riceand because of this the dog became deeply attached to the Private BuddhaNow the herdsman was accustomed to go regularly twice each day to wait upon the Private Buddha and the dog always went with himOn the way was a lair of wild beasts and the herdsman used to frighten the wild beasts away by striking bushes and ground with a stick and calling out three times Su suOne day he said to the Private Buddha Reverend Sir in case at any time I should be unable to come I will send this dog for you Therefore if I send him please understand that I wish you to comeA few days later the herdsman found it inconvenient to go in person He therefore sent the dog in his place saying Boy go bring his reverence backAt the mere word of the herdsman the dog started off Where he had seen his master stop and strike bushes and ground the dog also stopped and barked three times and when he was sure that his barking had frightened away the wild beasts he went on Early in the morning having attended to natures needs he entered the hut of leaves and grass went to the place where the Private Buddha sat barked three times by way of announcing his arrival and then lay down at one sideBy this the Private Buddha knew that it was time for him to go and therefore started outThe dog ran before him barking constantlyFrom time to time the Private Buddha tested the dog by taking the wrong path but every time he did so the dog by standing across the path and barking intimated to him to take the other pathOne day the Private Buddha took the wrong path and when the dog tried to stop him without turning back he pushed away the dog with his foot and went onThe dog perceiving that he did not intend to turn back took the hem of his undergarment in his teeth and dragged him along until he brought him to the right path Such was the strength of the affection of the dog for the Private BuddhaLater on the Private Buddhas robe wore outWhen the herdsman provided him with materials for a new set of robeshe Private Buddha said to him Brother it is difficult for a person all alone to make a robe I will go to a convenient place and have it made for meMake it right here Reverend SirNo brother I cannotWell then Reverend Sir do not take up your residence far from hereThe dog stood listening to every word they said The Private Buddha said Wait a moment brother Thereupon leaving the herdsman behind he flew up into the air and departed in the direction of GandhamādanaWhen the dog saw him flying through the air he began to bark and howl and he kept this up until the Private Buddha gradually faded from view whereupon his heart brokeTherefore said the Exalted One to a monk The ways of men are past finding out but the ways of the beasts are easy to discover So when the dog died he was reborn because of his straightforwardness and lack of deceit in the World of the Thirtythree with a retinue of a thousand celestial nymphs and there he enjoyed glory and bliss unspeakableWhen he but whispered his voice carried a distance of sixteen leagues when he spoke in an ordinary tone he could be heard all over the city of the gods a city ten thousand leagues in extentDo you ask Of what was this the consequenceIt was because he barked and howled for love of the Private BuddhaRemaining in the World of the Thirtythree for no long time he passed from that state of existenceDeities pass from the World of the Gods through four causes exhaustion of life exhaustion of merit exhaustion of food and angerHe that has earned much merit is reborn in the World of the Gods remains there during the term allotted to him and is then reborn higher and higherThus he passes through exhaustion of lifeHe that has earned little merit soon exhausts that merit just as three or four pintpots of rice tossed into a royal storehouse disappear and he therefore soon diesThus he passes through exhaustion of meritStill a third while enjoying the pleasures of sense fails through confusion of memory to partake of food and the strength of his body being thereby impaired diesThus he passes through exhaustion of foodA fourth jealous of the glory of another becomes angry and diesThus he passes through angerGhosaka while enjoying the pleasures of sense became forgetful passed through exhaustion of food from the World of the Thirtythree and was conceived in the womb of a courtezan of KosambiOn the day when the courtezan gave birth to the child she asked her slavewoman What is it A son my lady Very well put this boy into an old winnowing basket and cast him away on the dustheap Thus she caused him to be cast awayCourtezans will bestow care on a daughter but not on a sonfor it is through a daughter that their line of business is maintainedCrows and dogs surrounded the child and huddled about himbut in consequence of his barking and howling for love of the Private Buddha not one dared to approach himAt that moment a man came out and saw the crows and dogs all huddled together What does this mean thought he to himself going nearer When he saw the boy he immediately took a fancy to him and saying to himself I have gained a son he picked the boy up and took him home with himNow the treasurer of Kosambi happened at that time to go to the royal palace Seeing the housepriest returning from the royal residence he asked him Teacher have you observed a conjunction of a constellation with one of the lunar mansions todayYes great treasurer What else have we to doWhat will happen to the countryOnly this a boy has been born in this city today who will one day become the principal treasurerAs the treasurers wife was at that time great with childhe immediately sent a messenger to his house saying Go find out whether or not she has given birth to a childHe received the answer that she had not yet given birth to a child Therefore as soon as he had seen the king he went home quickly summoned a slavewoman named Kāḷī gave her a thousand pieces of money and said Go scour this city find the boy that was born today and bring him hither to meWhile she was scouring the city she came to the house where the child was and asked the mistress of the house When was this boy born Today Give him to me said she first offering a penny and gradually increasing the amount until finally by offering a thousand pieces of money she obtained him Then she took him with her and presented him to the treasurerThe treasurer gave him a home in his house thinking to himself If a daughter is born to me I will marry her to this boy and make him treasurerbut if a son is born to me I will kill himAfter a few days his wife gave birth to a sonThereupon the treasurer thought to himself If only this foundling did not exist my own son would obtain the post of treasurer I had best kill him immediately So he said to Kāḷī Carry this child to the cattlepen and when it is time for the cattle to come out lay him across the doorway and the cattle will trample him to death Observe whether or not they trample him to death and then come back and tell meShe carried the child to the cattlepen and as soon as the door was opened laid him across the doorwayNow at other times the leader of the herd the bull came out last of all but on this particular day he came out first inclosed the boy with his four feet and stood stock stillSeveral hundred cows came out on either side of the bull rubbing against his flanks as they passedThe herdsman thought to himself Hitherto this bull has always gone out last of all but today he went out first and stood stock still in the doorway of the pen What can this mean Going near he saw the boy lying under the bull Immediately taking a fancy to him he said to himself I have gained a son and picking him up he carried him homeKāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened Said the treasurer Go to the herdsman give him these thousand pieces of money and bring the child back to me againSo she brought the child back again and gave him to the treasurer Then he said to her Good Kāḷī five hundred carts start from this city at dawn on a trading expedition Take this child and lay him in the track of the wheels Either the oxen will trample him under their feet or the wheels will crush him to death Observe what happens to him and then return to meShe took the child and laid him down in the track of the wheelsThe leader of the caravan came firstbut when his oxen reached the place where the child lay they threw off the yoke but when his oxen reached the place where the child lay they threw off the yoke Again and again the leader replaced the yoke and tried to drive the oxen forwards but as often as he did so they threw off the yoke and refused to moveHe was still struggling with them when the sun roseWhy have the oxen acted thus thought he He looked at the road and saw the boy Oh what a grievous wrong I have done thought he His heart was filled with joy at the thought I have gained a son and picking up the boy he carried him offKāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened Said the treasurer Go to the caravanleader give him a thousand pieces of money and bring the child back to me againWhen she had so done he said to her Now carry him to the burningground and lay him in the bushes There he will either be eaten by dogs or attacked by demons and he will die As soon as you know whether or not he is dead return to meShe took the child laid him in the bushes and stood at one sideBut neither dog nor crow nor demon dared to approach himPray if he had neither mother nor father nor brother nor other kinsman to protect him what was it that did protect himAll that protected him was his howling for love of the Private Buddha in his former existence as a dogA certain shegoat made her way into the bushes eating leaves and grass and seeing the boy knelt down and gave him suck The goatherd called He he but she did not come outThereupon he said to himself I will beat her with my stick and bring her out So saying he made his way into the bushes And there he saw the shegoat on her knees giving suck to the boy He immediately took a fancy to the boy and saying to himself I have gained a son picked him up and carried him offāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened Said the treasurer Go to the goatherd give him a thousand pieces of money and bring the child back to me againKāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened Said the treasurer Go to the goatherd give him a thousand pieces of money and bring the child back to me again When she had so done he said to her Good Kāḷī take this child with you climb the mountain that is known as Robbers Cliff and throw him down the precipice He will strike against the sides of the ravine and be dashed to pieces when he reaches the bottom As soon as you know whether or not he is dead return to meShe carried the child to Robbers Cliff and standing at the top of the mountain threw him downNow there grew along the mountain near that abyss a dense bamboo thicket and the top of the mountain was covered with a thick growth of guñjā shrubAs the boy fell he dropped into this bamboo thicket as into a coverlet of goats hairNow that very day the leader of the reedmakers had received a gift of bamboo and accompanied by his son he had gone to chop that thicket downThat sounds like the voice of a boy thought he Climbing up on one side he saw the boy His heart was filled with joy at the thought I have gained a son and picking up the boy he carried him offAs he began his work the bamboo shook and the boy cried outKāḷī went back to the treasurer and in answer to his question told him what had happened Said the treasurer Go to the reedmaker give him a thousand pieces of money and bring the child back to me againShe did so But in spite of the treasurers attempts on his life the child lived and thrived and grew to manhood Ghosaka was his nameHe was like a thorn in the eye of the treasurer who could not look him straight in the faceThinking of a way to kill him the treasurer went to a friend of his who was a potter and asked him When are you going to fire your bakehouse Tomorrow Well then take these thousand pieces of money and do a job for meWhat is it masterI have a single baseborn son I will send him to you Take him into an inner room chop him to pieces with a sharp axe throw him into a chatty and bake him in the bakehouse Here are a thousand pieces of money to seal the bargain as it wereBut in addition I will reward you suitably laterVery well said the potter consenting to the bargainOn the following day the treasurer summoned Ghosaka and sent him to the potter saying Yesterday I left an order with the potter to do a certain piece of work for me Go say to him Finish the job my father gave you yesterday Very well said Ghosaka and set outAs Ghosaka was on his way to the potters the treasurers other son who was playing marbles with some boys saw him And calling to him he asked Where are you going I am carrying a message to the potter for father Let me go thereThese boys have won a big stake from me You win it back and give it to meI am afraid of fatherDo not fear brother I will carry that messageI have lost a big stake You play until I return again and win the stake back for meSo Ghosaka consented to let his fosterbrother go in his place saying Well then go to the potter and say to him Finish the job my father gave you yesterday Thus it happened that the treasurers own son carried the message to the potterThe potter killed him according to the letter of the directions he had received from the treasurer and threw his body into the bakehouseGhosaka played marbles all day and went home in the evening You have returned home son queried the treasurer Ghosaka then told him the reason why he had himself returned home and let his younger brother go to the potterWoe is me cried the treasurer with a loud voice He looked as though the blood had been drawn from his veins He rushed to the potter wringing his hands and wailing Oh potter do not kill me do not kill meThe potter saw him approaching in this wise and said to him Master make no noise the job is doneThus was the treasurer overwhelmed with sorrow as with a mountain Thus did he suffer great griefeven as do all who offend against those that are without offenseTherefore said the Exalted OneWhosoever visits punishment on those that deserve not punishment Whosoever offends against those that are without offenseSuch an one will right quickly come to one of ten stateshe will incur cruel suffering or infirmity or injury of the bodyOr severe sickness or loss of mindOr misfortune proceeding from the king or a heavy accusationOr death of relatives or loss of treasuresOr else the fire of lightning will consume his housesUpon dissolution of the body such a fool will go to HellNow under these circumstances the treasurer was unable to look Ghosaka straight in the faceHow can I manage to kill him thought he Finally he thought of a way I will send him to the superintendent of my hundred villages and order him to kill him said he to himself Accordingly he wrote the following letter to the superintendent This is my baseborn son Kill him and throw him into the cesspool Let this be done and I shall know how to reward my uncle properly Dear Ghosaka there is a superintendent over our hundred villages Take this letter and give it to him So saying he fastened the letter to the hem of his garmentNow Ghosaka did not know how to read and writefor ever since he was a boy the treasurer had striven although without success to kill him Why therefore should he have taught him to read and writeAs Ghosaka set out with his own deathwarrant fastened to the hem of his garment he said to his father Father I have no provisions for the journeyYou have no need of provisions for the journey On the way in such and such a village lives a friend of mine who is a treasurer Obtain your breakfast at his house and then continue your journeyVery well said Ghosaka and bowing to his father set out on his journey When he arrived at the village he inquired where the treasurers house was went there and saw the treasurers wifeWhence have you come she inquired From the city he repliedWhose son are youI am the son of your friend the treasurer my ladyThen you are GhosakaYes my ladyShe fell in love with him at first sightNow the treasurer had a daughter about fifteen or sixteen years of age and she was exceedingly beautiful and fair to look upon In order to keep her safe and sound her parents lodged her on the topmost floor of a sevenstoried palace in an apartment of royal splendor giving her a single slavegirl to run errandsAt that moment the treasurers daughter sent this slavegirl to a shopThe treasurers wife seeing her asked Where are you going On an errand for your daughter my lady Just come here a moment Never mind the errand Spread a seat for my son bathe his feet anoint them with oil and then spread a couch for him After you have done this you may do your errandThe slavegirl did as she was toldWhen she returned the treasurers daughter scolded her for her long absenceThe slavegirl replied Be not angry with me The treasurers son Ghosaka has arrived and I had to do this and that for him besides going on an errand for you before I returnedWhen the treasurers daughter heard the name treasurers son Ghosaka love suffused her body cleaving her skin and penetrating the marrow of her bonesFor she had been his wife in his former existence as Kotūhalaka and had given a pintpot of rice to the Private Buddha And through his supernatural power she had been reborn in the household of the treasurerNo wonder her old passion for him returned and overwhelmed herTherefore said the Exalted OneThrough previous association or present advantageThat love springs up like a lily in the waterThe treasurers daughter said to the slavegirl Girl where is heHe is lying asleep on the couchHas he anything in his handThere is a letter fastened to his garmentWhat can be in this letter she thought So while Ghosaka was asleep and her mother and father were otherwise engaged she came down without attracting their attention detached the letter from his garment took it with her went into her room closed the door opened the window and through her knowledge of writing read the letter Oh she exclaimed the simpleton is going about with his own deathwarrant fastened to his garment  Had I not seen it he would surely have been killed So she tore up this letter and wrote another in the name of the treasurer as follows This is my son Ghosaka Procure presents for him from my hundred villages Prepare a festival in honor of his marriage with the daughter of this districttreasurer Build him a twostoried house in the center of the village wherein he resides Surround his house with a wall and with a guard of men and so provide him with ample protection Then send me a message saying I have done thus and so and I shall know how to reward my uncle properly Having written the letter she folded it up and fastened it to the hem of his garmentAfter sleeping all day Ghosaka arose ate his meal and went on his wayEarly on the morning of the following day he arrived at that village and saw the superintendent performing his village dutiesWhen the superintendent saw him he asked him What is it dear GhosakaMy father has sent you a letterWhat is it about dear Ghosaka Bring it to me He took the letter and read it and then said with an exclamation of delight See men how my master loves me He has sent me a message saying My father has sent you a letter What is it about dear Ghosaka Bring it to me He took the letter and read it and then said with an exclamation of delight See men how my master loves me He has sent me a message saying Prepare a festival in honor of my oldest sonBring wood and other building materials immediately Having thus given orders to the householders he caused a house of the kind described in the letter to be erected in the center of the village had presents brought from the hundred villages conducted the daughter of the districttreasurer thither celebrated the marriage festival and then sent word to the treasurer saying I have done thus and soWhen the treasurer received the message he said What I would do that I do not what I would not do that I doDisappointment over the failure of his latest plan together with sorrow over the death of his own son set him on fire within and produced diarrheaThe treasurers daughter gave orders saying Should anyone come here from the treasurer tell me before you tell the treasurers sonThe treasurer said to himself At any rate I will not make this rascally son of mine heir to my property With this thought in mind he said to a certain official Uncle I wish to see my son Send a servant and summon my sonVery well replied the official and giving a certain man the letter sent him awayWhen the treasurers daughter heard that the servant had arrived and was standing at the door she sent for him and asked him What is it my manThe treasurer is sick and wishes to see his son and has therefore sent for him my ladyMy man is he strong or weakHe is still strong my lady and able to take nourishmentWithout letting the treasurers son know she ordered that the man should be given lodging and expenses and said to him You may go when I send you Remain here for the presentAgain the treasurer addressed the official Uncle did you not send a messenger to my sonI did master but the man who went has not yet returnedWell then try again and send anotherSo the official sent another manand the treasurers daughter treated him just as she had the firstThe treasurers condition grew worse one chamberpot went in and another came outAgain the treasurer asked the official Uncle did you not send a messenger to my sonI did master but the man who went has not yet returnedWell then try again and send anotherSo the official sent another manWhen the third messenger arrived the treasurers daughter asked him the newsThe treasurer is a very sick man my lady He refuses to eat and is confined to his bed One chamberpot comes out and another goes inNow it is time to go thought the treasurers daughter So she said to the treasurers son I learn that your father is sick Wife what say you It may be only a slight ailment husbandWhat is to be done nowLet us take presents from his hundred villages and go see himVery well said he Having caused presents to be brought he started out conveying the presents in a cartThen she said to him Your father is very weak If we take all these presents we shall be delayed on the way send them back Having sent all the presents back to their own house she said to the treasurers son Husband please stand at your fathers feet I will stand beside his pillowAnd as they entered the house she gave orders to her own men Stand on guard both in the front of the house and in the rearAnd when they had entered the treasurers son took his stand at his fathers feet and his wife beside his pillowAt that moment the treasurer was lying on his back and the official was rubbing his feetThe latter said to him Master your son has arrivedWhere is heHere he is standing at your feetWhen the treasurer saw his son he sent for the receiver of his revenues and asked him How much wealth is there in my houseMaster of money alone there are four hundred millions as for objects for employment and enjoyment such as villages and fields and men and animals and wagons and carriages such and such is the total It was the treasurers intention to say All of this wealth I do not give to my son Ghosaka But instead of this he said I do giveWhen the treasurers daughter heard this she thought to herself However if this man should speak again he might say something very different Accordingly pretending to be overcome with grief she disheveled her hair burst into tears and said Dear father do you really mean this In spite of these words of yours which we hear we are indeed unfortunate So saying she fell on him struck the middle of his breast with the crown of her head and in order that he might not be able to speak again rubbed the middle of his breast with the crown of her head displaying at the same time signs of profound griefAt that very moment the treasurer diedThey went and informed King Udena of his deathThe king had the funeral ceremonies performed over his body and asked Has he any son or daughterYour majesty he has a son named Ghosaka and your majesty he bestowed all his property on him before he diedSome time afterwards the king sent for the treasurers sonNow that day it rainedand there were pools of water here and there in the palace courtThe treasurers son set out to see the kingThe king opened his window and watched him as he approached noticing that as he crossed the palace court he leaped over the pools of water that stood in the court When he reached the palace and paid obeisance to the king and stood before him the king asked him Your name is Ghosaka Yes your majesty The king comforted him saying Do not grieve at the thought that your father is dead I will give you alone your fathers post as treasurer Then he dismissed him saying Now dear Ghosaka you may goand stood and watched him as he left the palaceNow whereas Ghosaka leaped over the water in approaching the palace he walked through it on his returnThe king sent orders for  him to return from where he was and asked him Dear Ghosaka is it a fact that whereas in coming to me you leaped over the water on your return you walk through itIt is even so your majesty Then I was a boy and was fond of play but now I have been promised a post of honor by your majestyTherefore I must now lay aside my former ways and deport myself with modesty and dignityOn hearing this the king thought to himself There is a wise man I will give him the post immediately Accordingly he gave him the wealth formerly possessed by his father and the post of treasurer together with all the hundred villagesThen Ghosaka mounted his chariot and drove sunwise round the cityEvery place he looked at quaked and trembledThe treasurers daughter sat talking with the slavewoman Kāḷī Mother Kāḷī said she it was through me that your son obtained all this worldly gloryHow is that my ladyWhy this youth came to our house with his own deathwarrant fastened to the hem of his garment I tore up that letter and wrote another ordering the celebration of a festival in honor of my marriage to him In this way did I protect him all that timeMy lady this is all you know about it But as a matter of fact from the time your husband was a little boy the treasurer constantly sought to kill him and though his attempts were unsuccessful a large sum of money was spent solely for the purpose of accomplishing his deathKāḷī the treasurer was indeed guilty of abominable crimesHaving performed his ceremonial circuit of the city Ghosaka entered his house Now when his wife saw him she thought to herself It was through me that he obtained all this worldly glory and laughedThe treasurers son asked her Why do you laughFor a certain reasonTell me the reasonShe refused to do soHe drew his sword and said If you do not tell me I will cut you in twainThen she said I laughed to think that it was through me that you obtained all this worldly gloryIf what I possess was handed over to me by my father where do you come inSo she told him the whole story saying When your father sent you forth bearing your own deathwarrant I did this and that and protected youWhat you say is not true replied Ghosaka refusing to believe her I will ask Mother Kāḷī So he asked the slavewoman Kāḷī is what she says trueYes my lord From the time you were a little boy your father sought constantly to kill you and though his attempts were unsuccessful a large sum of money was spent for the purpose of accomplishing your death On seven occasions you had a narrow escape from death Now coming from the village of which he was headman you have obtained the post of treasurer together with all the hundred villagesWhen Ghosaka heard this he thought to himself How great was my presumption But since I have escaped from so terrible a death I must no longer live the life of Heedlessness Henceforth therefore I will live the life of Heedfulness Accordingly he established alms for the blind and the poorand employing his friend the householder as steward of his alms he dispensed a thousand pieces of money dailyNow at this time there lived in the city of Bhaddavatī a treasurer named Bhaddavatiya and he was a friend of the treasurer Ghosaka although Ghosaka had never seen himGhosaka heard from traders who came from the city of Bhaddavatī of the wealth and age of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya and desiring to be friends with him sent him a presentLikewise the treasurer Bhaddavatiya heard from traders who came from the city of Kosambi of the wealth and age of the treasurer Ghosaka and desiring to be friends with him sent him a presentThus although neither had seen the other they dwelt as friendsAfter a time intestinal disease broke out in the house of the treasurer BhaddavatiyaWhen this disease breaks out the first to die are flies afterwards in regular order insects mice domestic fowls swine cattle slaves both female and male and last of all the members of the householdOnly those that break down the wall and flee save their lives Now at that time the treasurer Bhaddavatiya and his wife and daughter fled in this manner and intending to seek the treasurer Ghosaka set out on the road to KosambiWhile they were still on their way their provisions for the journey gave out and their bodies became exhausted from exposure to wind and sun and from hunger and thirst Reaching Kosambi with difficulty they bathed in a pool of water in a pleasant place and then entered a certain resthouse at the gate of the cityThen the treasurer said to his wife Wife those who travel in this  way are not courteous even to a mother who has borne a child Now I have a friend who they say dispenses a thousand pieces of money daily in alms to the blind the poor and other unfortunate personsWe will send our daughter there have her bring us food remain right here for a day or two and refresh our bodies and then we will go and see my friendVery well husband she repliedand they took up their residence right there in the resthouseOn the following day when mealtime was announced and the blind the poor and other unfortunate persons went to obtain food the mother and father sent forth their daughter saying Daughter go bring us foodSo the daughter of a wealthy house pride overcome with misfortune hid her shame took a bowl and went with poor folk to procure food How many portions will you have she was asked Three she repliedSo they gave her three portionshe carried the food back to her parents and the three sat down to eat togetherThe mother and daughter said to the treasurer Master misfortune comes even to prominent families Eat without regarding us and do not worryAfter a good deal of urging they prevailed upon him to eatBut after he had eaten he was unable to digest his food and when the sun rose he diedThe mother and daughter wept and wailed and lamentedOn the following day the young girl went the second time to procure food How many portions will you have Two She carried the food back to her mother and after a good deal of urging prevailed upon her to eatThe mother yielded to her pleading and consented to eat but died on that very dayThe young girl left alone to herself wept and wailed and lamented over the misfortune that had come upon her On the following day suffering the pangs of hunger keenly she went weeping in the company of beggars to procure food How many portions will you have daughter One was her replyA householder named Mitta remembering that she had received food for three days said to her Perish vile woman Today at last you have come to know the capacity of your bellyThis daughter of a respectable family modest and timid felt as though she had received a swordthrust in her bosom or as though salt water had been sprinkled on a sore She immediately replied What do you mean sirDay before yesterday you took three portions yesterday two today you take but oneToday then you know the capacity of your bellySir do not think that I took these for myselfWhy then did you take themSir day before yesterday we were three yesterday we were two today I am left aloneShe then told him the whole story from the beginning As he listened to her story he was unable to control his tears but was overcome by the power of the grief that arose within him Finally he said to her My dear girl if this is the case do not worry Hitherto you have been the daughter of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya but from this day forth you shall be my very own daughter And he kissed her on the head conducted her to his own house and adopted her as his own oldest daughterOne day she heard loud and piercing screams in the refectory whereupon she said to her fosterfather Father why do you not keep these people quiet when you dispense almsIt is impossible to do it dear daughterIt is impossible to do it dear daughterHow would you do it dear daughterFather put a fence around the refectory and hang two gates through which the people may pass in and out allowing only sufficient space for one person to pass through at a time Then direct the people to pass in through one gate and out through the other If you do this they will receive their alms peaceably and quietlyWhen the householder had heard her plan he remarked A happy device dear daughter and did as she suggestedNow up to that time her name had been Sāmābut through her construction of a fence she received the name SāmāvatīFrom that time on there was no more tumult in the refectoryNow the treasurer Ghosaka had long been accustomed to hear this noise in the refectory and rather liked to hear it for it always made him think That is the noise in my refectoryNow the treasurer Ghosaka had long been accustomed to hear this noise in the refectory and rather liked to hear it for it always made him think That is the noise in my refectory But after hearing no noise at all for two or three days he asked the householder Mitta who came one day to wait upon him Are alms being given to the blind the poor and other unfortunate personsYes sirHow then does it happen that for two or three days past I have not heard a soundI have arranged matters so that the people now receive alms without making any noiseWhy didnt you do so beforeI didnt know how sirHow did you happen to find a way just nowHow did you happen to find a way just nowHave you a daughter whom I have never seenThen the householder told him the whole story of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya beginning with the outbreak of the plague and ending with his adoption of the young girl as his own oldest daughterThen said the treasurer to him If this is the case why did you not tell me My friends daughter is my own daughter So he sent for her and asked her Dear girl are you the daughter of the treasurerYes sir I amWell then do not worry you are my own daughter Then he kissed her on the head gave her five hundred women for her retinue and adopted her as his own oldest daughterOne day a festival was proclaimed in this cityNow at this festival daughters of respectable families who do not ordinarily go out go on foot with their own retinue and bathe in the riverAccordingly on that day Sāmāvatī also accompanied by her five hundred women went right through the palace court to bathe in the riverKing Udena stood at his window and saw her Whose are those nautchgirls he inquiredNobodys nautchgirls your majestyThen whose daughters are theyYour majesty that is the daughter of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya and her name is SāmāvatīNow the king fell in love with the girl the moment he saw her and immediately sent word to the treasurer Ghosaka Send me the maiden they say is your daughterI will not send her your majestyDo not act thus Do as I ask and send herYour majesty we householders do not give young girls for fear people will say they are abused and maltreatedAngered by the treasurers reply the king caused the treasurers house to be sealed and the treasurer and his wife to be seized and turned out of doorsWhen Sāmāvatī returned after her bath and found no way of entering the house she asked What does this mean dear fatherDear daughter the king sent for youand when we refused to give you to him he caused the house to be sealed and caused us to be turned out of doorsDear father you made a great mistake When one who is a king commands you should not say We do not give You should rather say If you will take our daughter with her retinue we will give her to youVery well dear daughter If that is your desire I will do as you say Accordingly Ghosaka sent a message to that effect to the kingand the king accepted his offer saying Very well Then the king conducted Sāmāvatī with her retinue to the royal palace conferred the ceremonial sprinkling on her and elevated her to the dignity of chief consortThe other women became her ladiesinwaitingYet another of Udenas queenconsorts was Vāsuladattādaughter of Caṇḍa Pajjotaking of UjjeniOne day as Caṇḍa Pajjota was returning from his pleasuregarden he surveyed his own splendor and asked Is there any other soever possessed of splendor like mine Splendor such as it is King Udena of Kosambi possesses exceeding great splendor Very well let us take him captiveIt is impossible to capture himBy employing some means or other let us capture him all the sameIt is impossible your majestyWhyHe understands the art of charming elephants By reciting spells and playing his elephantcharming lute he either drives elephants away or captures them at his pleasureNo one possesses so many ridingelephants as heI suppose it is impossible for me to capture himIf you are bent on doing it have a wooden elephant made and turned loose near himLet him hear of a good mount be it elephant or horse and he will go a long way for itWhen he is close by you can capture himA stratagem indeed exclaimed the king So the king had a mechanical elephant made of wood wrapped about with strips of cloth and deftly painted and turned it loose on the bank of a certain lake near the country of his enemyWithin the belly of the elephant sixty men walked back and forth every now and then they loaded their shovels with elephant dung and dumped it outA certain woodman saw the elephant and thinking to himself Just the thing for our king went and told the king Your majesty I saw a noble elephant pure white even as the peak of Kelasa just the sort of elephant your majesty would likeUdena mounted his elephant and set out taking the woodman along as a guide and accompanied by his retinueHis approach was observed by spies who went and informed Caṇḍa PajjotaThe latter straightway dispatched armies on both flanks of his enemy allowing the space between them to remain openUdena unaware of his enemys approach continued to pursue the elephantfor the forest elephant clings to the elephant woodThe king unable to overtake the elephant mounted his horsethe wooden elephant made as if it failed to hear the charm and continued its flight He udena recited his spell and played his lute but all to no purposeand the king was quite aloneThen Caṇḍa Pajjotas men who were posted on both flanks captured Udena and turned him over to their kingUdenas army perceiving that their leader had fallen into the hands of the enemy built a stockade just outside of Ujjeni and remained thereCaṇḍa Pajjota having thus captured Udena alive clapped him into prison behind closed doors and kept wassail for three daysOn the third day Udena asked his keepers Friends wheres your king Carousing for says he Ive landed my enemy What does your king mean by acting like a woman He has captured a royal adversary and surely ought either to release him or to kill him He has brought humiliation upon us and is carousing indeedThe keepers went and reported the incident to the kingThe king came and asked Is it true that you said thus and thusYes your majestyVery well I will release you They say you have such and such a charm will you give it to meCertainly I will give it to you but when you receive itwill you pay me homageI pay you homage Ill not pay you homageThen Ill not give it to youIn that case I will have you executedDo so you are lord of my body not of my mindWhen the king heard Udenas defiant answer he thought to himself How in the world can I get the charm I have it Ill have my daughter learn it from him and then Ill learn it from her It would never do to let anyone else learn a charm like thisSo he said to Udena Will you divulge the charm to another if the other will pay you homageYes your majestyWell then we have in our house a hunchbacked woman She will sit behind a curtain you remain outside and have her repeat the charmBe she hunchback or cripple I will teach her the charm provided she will pay me homageThen the king went to his daughter Vāsuladattā and said Dear daughter there is a certain leper who knows a priceless charmYou sit behind a curtain and he will remain outside and repeat it to you You get it from him for it would never do to let anyone else learn itand then I will get it from youAfter this sort for fear of their making love did Caṇḍa Pajjota feign that his daughter was a hunchback and Udena a leperSo Vāsuladattā seated herself behind a curtain and Udena remained outside and caused her to repeat the charmOne day Udena repeated the words of the charm over and over again to Vāsuladattā but the latter was unable to reproduce it correctly Thereupon Udena cried out Dunce of a hunchback your lips are too thick and your cheeks too pudgy Ive a mind to beat your face in Say it this wayVāsuladattā replied in anger Villain of a leper what do you mean by those words Do you call such as I hunchbackUdena lifted the fringe of the curtain and asked Who are you Said the maiden I am Vāsuladattā daughter of the king When your father spoke to me he described you as a hunchbackWhen he spoke to me he made you out a leperBoth said He must have said it for fear of our making loveThen and there within the curtain they made love and from that time on there was no learning charms or getting lessonsThe king regularly asked his daughter Daughter are you learning your lessonsYes fatherNow one day Udena said to Vāsuladattā My dear a husband can do that which neither father nor mother nor brothers nor sisters can do If you will save my life I will give you a retinue of five hundred women and make you my chief consortIf you will carry out your promise without fail I will save your lifeMy dear I will do so without failVery well husbandSo she went to her father saluted him and stood respectfully on one sideHer father asked her Daughter is your task completedNot quite completed fatherWhat do you require daughterWe must have at our disposal a door and a mount fatherWhy this requestFather this is what my teacher says In order to work the charm a certain medicinal herb is necessary and this must be obtained at night at a time indicated by the starsTherefore whenever we are obliged to go out whether it be early or late we must have a door and a mount at our disposal Very well said the king giving his consentThey secured permission to use a certain door at any time they pleasedNow the king was possessed of the five conveyancesa female elephant named Bhaddavatī which could travel fifty leagues a day a slave named Kāka who could travel sixty leagues a day two mares Celakaṇṭhī and Muñjakesī which could travel a hundred leagues a day and an elephant named Nālāgiri which could travel a hundred and twenty leagues a dayStill another maiden who gained the dignity of chief consort of the king was MāgandiyāShe we are told was the daughter of the Brahman Māgandiya who lived in the Kuru countryher mother also bore the name Māgandiyāand her fathers younger brother likewise bore the name MāgandiyaNow her father was unable to find a husband who was worthy of her and although scions of all the great families in the country asked for her hand her father sent them all away reviling them and saying You are not worthy of my daughterNow one day as the Teacher surveyed the world at early dawn he perceived that the Brahman Māgandiya and his wife possessed the dispositions requisite for the attainment of the Fruit of the Third Path Therefore taking his own bowl and robe he went to a place just outside of a certain markettown where the Brahman was tending the sacred fireFor you ought to have a wife and she ought to have a husband I will give her to you Wait right here until I come backThe Brahman surveyed the person of the Tathāgata beholding in him the perfection of physical beauty and thought to himself There is no other man in the whole world comparable to this man I will give my daughter to this man to cherish and support Accordingly he said to the Teacher Monk I have a single daughter and all this time I have not seen a man worthy of her But you are suitable for her and she is suitable for youThe Teacher said not a word but remained silentThe Brahman went home quickly and said to his wife Wife wife I saw a man who is worthy of our daughter Hurry hurry Dress her in her beautiful garments So the Brahman had his daughter dressed in her beautiful garments and taking daughter and wife with him went to the TeacherThe whole city was agitatedAll this time said the people this man has said of every suitor He is not suitable for my daughter and has refused to give her to anyone But it is reported that he has said Today I saw a man who is suitable for my daughter What manner of man can he be Let us go see him So a great throng of people went out of the city with himNow when the Brahman set out with his daughter the Teacher instead of remaining in the place mentioned by the Brahman moved away from that place and took his stand in another place leaving a footprintWhen the Buddhas establish a footprint it appears only in a trodden place and not elsewhereand only those for whom it is established can see itLet elephants or other wild animals tread upon a footprint of the Buddhas to render it invisible or let a violent storm pour forth rain upon it or let the roaring winds beat upon it yet not one of them can obliterate itNow the Brahmans wife said to the Brahman Where is this manThe Brahman replied I said to him Remain in this place Where can he possibly have gone He looked all about and seeing his footprint said Here is his footprintNow the Brahmans wife was familiar with the three Vedas including the verses relating to signs So she repeated the verses relating to signs considering carefully the signs borne by the footprint before her Finally she said Brahman this is no footprint of one who follows the Five Lusts So saying she pronounced the following StanzaThis is the sort of footprint made by one who has rolled back the Veil of PassionOf one infatuate the footprint will be shufflingThat of a wicked man violently pressed downThe footprint of a lustful man will be squattyThen said the Brahman to her Wife you are always seeing crocodiles in the watervessel and thieves hiding in the house Be stillBrahman you may say what you like but this is no footprint of one who follows the Five LustsJust then the Brahman looked around and saw the Teacher There is the man said he Thereupon the Brahman went to him and said Monk I give you my daughter to cherish and supportThe Teacher instead of saying I have need of your daughter or I have no need of your daughter said to him Brahman I have something to say to you Say it monk replied the Brahman Thereupon the Teacher told him how Māra had pursued him from the time of the Great Retirement to the time of the Session under the Goatherds Banyantree and how when Māra seated himself under the Goatherds Banyantree overcome with sorrow at the thought Now this man has escaped from my power Māras daughters came to assuage their fathers sorrow and endeavored to seduce him by appearing before him in the forms of women both young and old At that time said the TeacherHaving seen Craving Pining and LustI had no desire for the pleasures of loveWhat is this body filled with urine and dungI should not be willing to touch it even with my footAt the conclusion of the Stanza the Brahman and his wife were established in the Fruit of the Third PathAs for Māgandiyā she said to herself If this man has no need of me it is perfectly proper for him to say so but he declares me to be full of urine and dung Very well By virtue of the fact that I possess birth lineage social position wealth and the charm of youth I shall obtain a husband who is my equal and then I shall know what ought to be done to the monk Gotama And then and there she conceived hatred towards the TeacherDid the Teacher know or did he not know that she had conceived hatred towards himHe knewIf he knew why did he pronounce the StanzaFor the sake of the other twoFor the Buddhas take no account of hatred directed against them but preach the Law solely for the sake of those who are worthy to attain the Paths and the FruitsHer mother and father took her and committed her to the charge of her uncle Culla Māgandiya and then retired from the world and attained ArahatshipCulla Māgandiya thought to himselfMy daughter is not suited to be the wife of a low person but is suited to be the consort of a kingAccordingly he adorned her with all the adornments took her with him to Kosambi and presented her to King Udena saying This jewel of a woman is worthy to become a consort of your majestyWhen the king saw her he fell deeply in love with her conferred the ceremonial sprinkling upon her provided her with a retinue of five hundred ladiesinwaiting and raised her to the dignity of chief consortThus the king had three chief consorts with a retinue of fifteen hundred nautchgirlsNow at this time there were living in Kosambi three treasurers Ghosaka Kukkuṭa and PāvāriyaAs the beginning of the rainy season drew near these men saw five hundred ascetics who had returned from the Himālaya country going the round of the city for alms As the beginning of the rainy season drew near these men saw five hundred ascetics who had returned from the Himālaya country going the round of the city for alms With joyful hearts they provided them with seats offered them food and obtaining from them a promise to reside with them they provided them with lodging in their own homes during the four months of the rains Then having obtained from them a promise to return and spend the following rainy season with them they let them goFrom that time forth after the ascetics had resided for eight months in the Himālaya country they kept residence during the four months of the rains with the three treasurersOn a later occasion as the ascetics were on their way back from the Himālaya country they saw a certain great banyantree in a forest retreat and went and sat down at the foot of itThe deity who resides in this tree cannot be mundane There must be a devaking of great power here How good it would be if he would give this band of ascetics water to drinkImmediately the treespirit gave them water to drinkThen the ascetic thought of water to bathe in and the spirit gave that alsoThen he thought of food and the spirit gave that alsoThen this thought occurred to the ascetic This devaking gives us every single thing we think of I wish we might see himImmediately the spirit burst the trunk of the tree and showed himselfThereupon they asked him Devaking you possess great power What did you do to get itDo not ask me Reverend SirsDevaking please tell usBut the spirit was exceedingly modest for the reason that the work of merit he had performed was a very small one and therefore he did not wish to tellHowever after a good deal of urging he said Well then listen and told the followingThe treespirit it appears was once a poor man who sought and obtained work for hire from Anāthapiṇḍika and through him made a livingNow one fastday Anāthapiṇḍika asked on his return from the monastery Has anyone told this laborer that today is fastdayHe has not been told masterWell then cook him his supperSo they cooked him a measure of riceNow the laborer had worked all day in the forest and when he returned in the evening he said I am hungry But when the rice had been prepared and given to him all of a sudden he refused to eat On other days he thought to himself there is a great uproar in this house Give me rice give me sauce give me curry but today all have lain down without making a sound and they have prepared food for me alone What can this mean So he asked them Have the rest eatenThey have not eatenWhyIn this house people eat no supper on fastdays all keep the fastThe great treasurer requires all to fast even infants at the breast first causing them to rinse their mouths and to eat the four sweet foodsA lamp of scented oil is lighted and all both young and old retire to recite the Thirtytwo Constituents of the BodyBut we did not think it worth while to tell you it was fastdayand therefore rice was cooked for you alone Eat itIf it is proper for me to begin the fast now I should like to do soWell then ask himBut we did not think it worth while to tell you it was fastdaynd he replied as follows If he begins the fast now and rinses his mouth and takes upon himself the fastday precepts he will earn half the merit of keeping fastdayWhen the laborer heard the answer he began the fastNow the laborer had worked all day long and was hungry and the result was that the humors of his body became disorderedHe bound a girth about his body and holding the end of the girth in his hand he rolled over and overWhen the treasurer learned of this he took the four sweet foods and with torches borne before him went to the laborer and asked Friend what is the matterMaster the humors of my body are out of orderWell then get up and eat this medicinal foodYou eat it masterI am not sick You eat itMaster as for keeping the fast I was not able to keep it all but let me not be deprived of halfWith these words the laborer refused to eat Do not act thus friend said the treasurer But the laborer steadfastly refused to eat and when the sun rose he died even as a garland of flowers withers and was reborn in that banyantreeTherefore the treespirit explained the matter as follows The treasurer was devoted to the Buddha devoted to the Law devoted to the Order and it was through him and in consequence of the merit I earned by keeping half of fastday that I obtained this powerWhen the five hundred ascetics heard the name Buddha they arose and stretched out their hands in an attitude of reverent supplication to the spirit and said Say Buddha  Three times they caused the spirit to confess his faith by repeating the formula I say Buddha  Then they breathed forth the solemn utterance This is an utterance difficult to obtain in this world and said in conclusion Spirit you have permitted us to hear a sound we have not heard for many hundred thousand cycles of timeThen the pupils addressed their teacher as follows Well then let us go to the TeacherFriends we have three treasurers who are generous benefactors of ours Tomorrow we will receive food in their residence tell them also what we have heard and go Give your consent friendsThereupon they gave their consentOn the following day the treasurers caused riceporridge to be prepared and seats to be provided And knowing that the ascetics would arrive on that day they went forth and met them escorted them to their residence provided them with seats and gave them foodWhen the ascetics had finished their meal they said Great treasurers we are going awayReverend Sirs did we not obtain from you a promise to reside with us during the four months of the rains Where are you going nowThe Buddha has appeared in the world the Law has appeared the Order has appeared We are therefore going to see the TeacherBut is it proper for you only to go to the TeacherIt is not forbidden to others also friendsWell then Reverend Sirs you wait and we also will go as soon as we have made preparationsIf you wait to make preparations we shall be delayed Therefore we will go on ahead and you may follow after So they went on ahead and seeing the Supremely Enlightened One praised him paid obeisance to him and sat down respectfully on one sidehen the Teacher preached the Law to them in orderly sequencehen the Teacher preached the Law to them in orderly sequence and at the conclusion of his discourse all of them attained Arahatship together with the Supernatural Faculties Thereupon they asked to be received into the Order Come monks said the Teacher As soon as he spoke the word they became fullfledged monks possessed of bowls and robes created by magicThose three treasurers procured the requisites for alms consisting of garments coverlets ghee honey molasses and so forth and conveying five hundred cartloads apiece proceeded to Sāvatthi On reaching Sāvatthi they paid obeisance to the Teacher listened to a discourse on the Law and at the conclusion of the discourse were established in the Fruit of Conversion For a fortnight they resided with the Teacher bestowing alms and then invited the Teacher to come to Kosambi As the Teacher gave his promise he said The Tathāgatas delight in solitude Said the treasurers Reverend Sir as soon as we notify you by sending you a message it will be proper for you to come With these words they returned to Kosambi The treasurer Ghosaka erected Ghosita monastery the treasurer Kukkuṭa erected Kukkuṭa monastery and the treasurer Pāvāriya erected Pāvāriya monastery When the treasurers had erected these three monasteries they sent word to the Teacher to come and visit themThe Teacher receiving their message went therewhereupon they came forth to meet him escorted him to the monasteries and waited upon him by turnsThe Teacher resided one day in each monasteryand always went to receive alms at the door of the house of the particular treasurer in whose monastery he residedNow these three treasurers had a servitor named Sumana and he was a gardenerHe said to the treasurers I have been a servitor of yours for a long time and I should like to entertain the Teacher Let me have the Teacher all to myself for just one dayWell then said they entertain him tomorrowVery well masters he replied invited the Teacher and made ready the usual honorsNow at that time King Udena was in the habit of giving Queen Sāmāvatī eight pieces of money every day to buy flowers withA female slave of the queen named Khujjuttarā went regularly every day to the gardener Sumana and procured the flowersWhen she came on that particular day the gardener said to her I have invited the Teacher to be my guest and shall use my flowers today to honor the Teacher You just wait join with me in attendance on the Buddha and listen to the Law Then you may take with you the flowers that remainVery well said she consenting to remainSumana waited upon the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and took his bowl that he might pronounce the words of thanksgiving The Teacher began to pronounce the words of thanksgivingKhujjuttarā listened to the discourse on the Law and became established in the Fruit of ConversionOn previous days she had been in the habit of appropriating to her own use four pieces of money and of buying flowers with the other four but on that day spending all eight to buy flowers with she returned with themSāmāvatī said to her My good woman did the king give us twice as much money today to buy flowers withNo my ladyThen why so many flowersOn previous days I kept four pieces of money for myself and brought you only so many flowers as I could buy for four pieces of moneyWhy didnt you take the money todayBecause I heard the Supremely Enlightened discourse on the Law and acquired understanding of the LawThe queen did not revile her and say You wretched slave give me back the pieces of money you have stolen during all this time You wretched slave give me back the pieces of money you have stolen during all this time Instead she said to her My good woman you have drunk the Deathless Give me thereof to drink also Well then replied Khujjuttarā order that a bath be prepared for meSo the queen had her bathed with sixteen bowls of scented water and presented her with garments of fine cloth One of these garments she caused her to put on as an undergarment the other she caused to be thrown over her shoulder then she had a seat prepared for her Khujjuttarā thereupon sat down took in her hand a painted fan and addressing the five hundred women preached the Law to them just as the Teacher had preached itThen all of them paid obeisance to Khujjuttarā and said Friend from this day forth do no sinful deed but  be to us as a mother and a teacher Go to the Teacher and listen to every discourse he preaches and then come back and repeat it to usAnd this she did so faithfully that later on she came to know the Tipiṭaka by heartIndeed the Teacher assigned her preeminence saying Preeminent among my female lay disciples who are learned in the Scriptures and able to expound the Law is KhujjuttarāNow those five hundred women said to her Woman we should like to see the Teacher Show him to us that we may honor him with perfumes garlands and so forthMy lady it is a serious matter to live in a kings house You have obtained access to it but it is impossible for you to leave itWoman do not destroy us Let us see the TeacherWell then make holes in the walls of your rooms large enough to look through Then bring perfumes and garlands and when the Teacher goes to the door of the house of the three treasurers stand in your several places and look out and stretch forth your hands and pay obeisance to him and honor himThey followed her directions and when the Teacher went and returned they looked out and paid obeisance to him and honored himNow one day Māgandiyā came forth from her own mansion and walked along until she came to the place where those women lived Seeing a hole in a room she asked What is this The women not knowing of the hatred she had conceived towards the Teacher said The Teacher has come to this city and we stand here and look at the Teacher and honor him So the hermit Gotama has come to this city thought Māgandiyā Now I shall know what ought to be done to him These women also are his supporters I shall know what ought to be done to them also So she said to the king Great king Sāmāvatī and her followers are disloyal to you and in but a few days will take your lifeThe king replied They will do nothing of the sort and refused to believe the chargeEven when the charge was repeated he still refused to believeWhen she made the charge the third time and he still refused to believe she said to him If you do not believe me great king go to the place where they reside and judge for yourselfThe king went there and seeing the holes in the walls of the rooms asked What does this mean When the matter was explained to him he did not get angry said not a word but had the holes filled up and windows made with openings above in all the roomsUnable to injure the women Māgandiyā thought to herself At any rate I will do to the monk Gotama what ought to be doneSo she bribed the citizens and said to them When the monk Gotama comes into the city and walks about instigate slaves to revile him and abuse him and drive him out of the citySo heretics who did not believe in the Three Jewels followed the Teacher about when he entered the city and shouted at him You are a thief a simpleton a fool a camel an ox an ass a denizen of hell a beast you have no hope of salvation a state of punishment is all that you can look forward to Thus they reviled and abused him with the Ten Terms of AbuseVenerable nanda heard this and said to the Teacher Reverend Sir these citizens are reviling and abusing us Let us go elsewhereWhere shall we go nandaTo some other city Reverend SirIf men revile us there where shall we go then nandaTo yet another city Reverend SirIf men revile us there where shall we go thenTo still another city Reverend Sirnanda one should not speak thusWhere a difficulty arises right there should it be settled Only under those circumstances is it permissible to go elsewhereBut who are reviling you nandaReverend Sir everyone is reviling us slaves and allnanda I am like an elephant that has entered the fray Even as it is the duty of an elephant that has entered the fray to withstand the arrows which come from the four quarters precisely so it is my duty to endure with patience the words spoken by many wicked men So saying he preached the Law with reference to himself by pronouncing the following three Stanzas in the Nāga VaggEven as an elephant engaged in the fray withstands arrows shot from the bowSo also must I bear abuse for the multitude is wickedIt is a tamed elephant they lead to battle it is a tamed elephant the king mountsIt is the tamed that is best among men he that endures abuse patientlyOf surpassing excellence are mules which are tamed and wellbred Sindh horsesAnd great elephants of the jungle but better yet is the man who has tamed himselfThis discourse benefited the assembled multitudeWhen the Teacher had thus preached the Law he said nanda be not disturbed These men will revile you for only seven days and on the eighth day they will become silent A difficulty encountered by the Buddhas lasts no longer than seven daysWhen Māgandiyā had failed in her attempt to drive the Teacher out of the city by abusing him she thought to herself Pray what can I do now Then the thought occurred to her These women are his supporters I will destroy them Accordingly one day while King Udena was drinking strong drink and she was waiting upon him she sent the following message to her uncle Let my uncle come with eight dead cocks and eight live cocks Having arrived let him stand at the top of the stairs and announce his arrival When he hears the word Enter let him not enter but send in first the eight live cocks and afterwards the othersAnd she gave a bribe to the page saying Be sure to carry out my ordersMāgandiya came and announced himself to the king When however he heard the word Enter he said I will not enter the kings drinkingplaceMāgandiyā then sent her page saying Boy go to my uncleHe went took the eight live cocks which Māgandiyā gave him carried them to the king and said Your majesty the housepriest has sent you a presentA most excellent and dainty morsel said the kingNow who will cook them Māgandiyā said Great king the five hundred women led by Sāmāvatī have nothing to do Send the cocks to them Let them cook them and carry them to youAccordingly the king sent them saying to the page Go give these cocks to these women Tell them not to intrust them to the hands of anyone else but to kill them and cook them themselvesVery well your majesty replied the page and went and delivered the message But the women refused to do the kings bidding saying We do not take the life of any living creature The page returned and so informed the kingMāgandiyā said You see great king Now you shall find out whether or not they really take the life of living creatures Your majesty send word to them  Cook them and send them to the monk Gotama So the king sent this message to themBut the page while pretending to carry the live cocks to the women in reality went and gave those cocks to the housepriest and carried the eight dead cocks to the women saying Cook these cocks and send them to the TeacherThis to be sure is our duty said the women in reply and going to meet him they received the cocksWhen the page returned to the king and the latter asked him What was the result boy he gave the king the following report The moment I said to them Cook these cocks and send them to the hermit Gotama they came to meet me and accepted themSee great king said Māgandiyā they will not do it for the like of you But you would not believe me when I said to you Their inclination is towards another But even when the king heard this he tolerated their conduct and remained silentMāgandiyā thought to herself What shall I do nowNow at this time the king was accustomed to divide his time equally among his three consorts Sāmāvatī Vāsuladattā and Māgandiyā spending seven days by turns in the apartment of eachMāgandiyā knowing that he would go on the morrow or on the day after to the apartment of Sāmāvatī sent word to her uncle Send me a snake first washing its fangs with a poisonous drugHe did as she told him to and sent her a snakeNow wherever the king went he was accustomed to take with him his lute for charming elephants and in the shell of this lute was a holeMāgandiyā inserted the snake in the hole and stopped the hole with a bunch of flowersfor two or three days the snake remained within the luteOn the day when the king was to go to Sāmāvatīs apartment Māgandiyā asked him To whose apartment will you go today your majesty To Sāmāvatīs apartment Said Māgandiyā Your majesty today I had a bad dreamyou must not go thereI am going all the sameThree times she tried to dissuade him from going and failed Finally she said In that case I will go too In spite of the kings protests she went with him saying Your majesty I do not know what will happen to youThe king wearing garments flowers perfumes and ornaments given him by Sāmāvatī and her followers ate heartily and then placed his lute by his pillow and lay down on the bedMāgandiyā pretending to be merely walking back and forth removed the bunch of flowers from the opening in the lutewhereupon the snake which had been without food for two or three days glided from the opening hissed raised his hood and coiled himself up on the top of the bedWhen Māgandiyā saw the snake she screamed with a loud voice Oh your majesty there is a snake And she straightway abused the king saying This stupid unlucky king will not listen to anything I say to him As for these shameless scoundrels what do they not receive from the king You will live happily just as soon as the king is dead but so long as he lives you will have a hard time Your majesty when I cried out to you Today I had a bad dream you must not go to Sāmāvatīs apartment you would not listen to what I saidWhen the king saw the snake he was terrified with the fear of death the fire of anger was kindled within him and he said So this is the sort of thing they are capable of doing What criminals they are Yet I would not believe Māgandiyā when she told me of their evil nature First they made holes in the walls of their own rooms and sat there again when I sent the cocks to them they sent them back today they have let a snake loose in my bedSāmāvatī delivered the following admonition to her five hundred women Friends we have no other refuge Cherish precisely the same feelings towards the king and the queen as you do towards yourselves Be not angry with anyoneThe king took his hornbow which required a thousand men to string twanged the bowstring fitted a poisoned arrow to the string and placing Sāmāvatī in front and all the other women in single file behind her shot an arrow at Sāmāvatīs breastBut through the supernatural power of her love the arrow turned back and returning by the same path it had come penetrated as it were the kings heartThe king thought to himself The arrow I shot is capable of piercing even a rock and there was nothing in the air to make it turn back But it turned and came back by the same path it went Indeed this senseless lifeless arrow knows her goodness but I who am a human being know it not And throwing the bow away and stretching forth his hands in an attitude of reverent supplication he knelt before Sāmāvatīs feet and pronounced the following StanzaProtect me Sāmāvatī and be a refuge to meI am utterly confused and bewildered all four quarters are confused in my mindSāmāvatī hearing his words instead of saying Very well your majesty seek refuge in me said Great king in whom I have sought refuge in him do you also seek refuge Having thus spoken Sāmāvatī disciple of the Supremely Enlightened saidSeek refuge in that Buddha and do you be a refuge to meHe is the Buddha great king he is the Buddha IncomparableDo not seek refuge in me He in whom I have sought refugeThe king said Now I am the more afraid and pronounced the following StanzaNow I am the more confused all four quarters are confused in my mindProtect me Sāmāvatī and be a refuge to meBut she refused him precisely as before Finally he said Well then I seek refuge in you and in the Teacher and I grant you a boon I accept the boon great king she repliedBut she refused him precisely as before Finally he said Well then I seek refuge in you and in the Teacher and I grant you a boon I accept the boon great king she repliedSāmāvatī replied Great king I have no need of gold and silver but grant me this boon Arrange matters so that the Teacher may come here regularly with his five hundred monks so that I may hear the LawSo the king paid obeisance to the Teacher and said Reverend Sir come here regularly with your five hundred monks Sāmāvatī and her attendants say they wish to hear the LawThe Teacher replied Great king the Buddhas may not always go to one place many desire their presenceWell then direct one monk to comeThe Teacher directed nanda to goSo nanda went every day to the royal palace with five hundred monksand those women every day provided the Elder with food and listened to the LawOne day after they had listened to the Elders discourse on the Law their hearts were filled with joy and they rendered honor to the Elder by presenting him with five hundred yellow robes such as are worn over the shoulderseach worth five hundred pieces of moneyWhen the king saw that they had not a single garment left he asked them Where are your yellow robesWe gave them to the Reverend ElderDid he take them allYes he took them allThe king approached the Elder paid obeisance to him questioned him about the gift of the robes by the women and learning that the women had given the robes and that the Elder had received them asked Reverend Sir there were a great many robes were there not What will you do with so manyI shall keep as many as we require for ourselves and send the rest to those whose robes are worn out great kingWhat will they do with their own wornout robesThey will give them to those whose robes are in a still worse state of repairWhat will they do with their own wornout robesThey will make bedspreads of themWhat will they do with the old bedspreadsThey will make carpets of themWhat will they do with the old carpetsThey will make foottowels of themWhat will they do with the old foottowelsThey will cut them into small pieces mix them with mortar and use them to plaster walls withReverend Sir although all these are given to your reverences nothing is lostQuite so great kingThe king was so pleased that he caused five hundred more robes to be brought and placed at the Elders feetWe are told that robes worth five hundred pieces of money were presented to the Elder and laid at his feet in lots of a thousand and that he received this number a hundred thousand times that robes worth a thousand pieces of money were presented to the Elder and laid at his feet in lots of a thousand and that he received this number a thousand times that robes worth a hundred thousand pieces of money were presented to the Elder and laid at his feet in lots of a thousand and that he received this number a hundred timesIt is impossible to enumerate the number of robes he received by ones and twos and threes and fours and fives and tensWe are told that upon the death of the Teacher the Elder traveled all over the Land of the Roseapple presenting to the monks in all of the monasteries bowls and robes of his ownMāgandiyā thought to herself Whatever I do turns out otherwise than I expectWhat shall I do now Finally she decided on a plan On her way to the garden to amuse herself she sent the following message to her uncle Go to Sāmāvatīs palace open the linenclosets and the oilclosets soak pieces of cloth in the jars of oil and wrap these cloths about the pillars Then assemble all the women within the house close the door bar it from without set fire to the house with torches and then descend and go your wayMāgandiya went up into the palace opened the closets soaked garments in the oiljarsand was just beginning to wrap them about the pillars when the women led by Sāmāvatī came up to him and said Why are you doing this uncleMy ladies the king desires these pillars to be strengthened and has therefore given orders that they be wrapped in cloths soaked in oil It is hard to understand why certain things should be done in a kings house and certain other things should not be done I beg of you my ladies not to remain here with me As soon as they had departed and entered their rooms at his suggestion he closed the doors barred them from without set fire to first one cloth and then another and descendedSāmāvatī delivered the following admonition to her followers It would not be an easy matter even with the knowledge of a Buddha to determine exactly the number of times our bodies have thus been burned with fire as we have passed from birth to rebirth in the round of existences which has no conceivable beginning Therefore be heedfulAs the fire consumed the house the women applied themselves to meditation on the element of pain with the result that some of them attained the Fruit of the Second Path while others attained the Fruit of the Third PathTherefore it is said Now a large number of monks returning from their almspilgrimage after breakfast drew near to where the Exalted One was and having drawn near paid obeisance to the Exalted One and sat down reverently on one side And as they sat there on one side those monks said this to the Exalted One Here Reverend Sir while King Udena was in his pleasuregarden the quarters of his women were consumed with fire and five hundred women led by Sāmāvatī lost their livesReverend Sir what will be the end what will be the future state of these female lay disciplesMonks some of these female lay disciples obtained the Fruit of Conversion others obtained the Fruit of the Second Path others obtained the Fruit of the Third Path Monks none of those female lay disciples failed to receive the fruit of their past deedsAnd the Exalted One clearly understanding the matter breathed forth at that time the following Solemn UtteranceBound with the bond of delusion the world appears to be goodThe simpleton fettered by the conditions of being enshrouded by darknessThinks it eternal But to him who really sees there is naughtSo saying he preached the Law saying Monks as living beings pass through the round of existences they are not always heedful and sometimes they commit sinTherefore as they pass through the round of existences they experience both pleasure and painWhen the king heard the cry Sāmāvatīs house is on fire he went there quickly but the house was burned before he could reach itHaving extinguished the flames he sat down surrounded by his retinue of courtiers overwhelmed with profound grief and recalled to his mind the virtues of Sāmāvatī Who could have done this deed thought he Coming to the conclusion that Māgandiyā was the author of the crime he thought to himself If I frighten her by my questions she will not tell me Therefore I will employ craft and question her gently Accordingly he said to his ministers Well until this moment no matter what I was engaged in or occupied with I was apprehensive and suspicious Sāmāvatī was ever seeking occasion to slay me But now my mind will rest in peace and I shall be able to lie down to sleep in security Who was it that did this deed your majestySomeone who really loved me must have done itNow Māgandiyā happened to be standing near and when she heard the king say this she said None other than I could have done this I alone did it I sent word to my uncle and ordered him to do itExcept you there is not a living being who really loves me I am delighted I grant you a boon Send for all of your relativesSo Māgandiyā sent the following message to her relatives The king is pleased with me and has granted me a boon Come immediatelyThe king rendered high honor to all those who cameinsomuch that even persons who were in no way related to Māgandiyā hearing about it gave bribes and came and said We are relatives of MāgandiyāWhen the king had them all in his hands he caused pits to be dug waistdeep in the palacecourt set them therein filled up the pits with earth spread straw on top and set the straw on fireWhen the skin had been burned to a crisp he caused the bodies to be plowed with an iron plow and to be broken up into pieces and fragmentsAs for Māgandiyā he had pieces of solid flesh ripped from various parts of her body with a sharp knife and setting a vessel of oil on the brazier he had them fried like cakes and made her eat themIn the Hall of Truth the monks began to discuss matters saying It is not right that a female lay disciple endowed with such faith should suffer such a deathThe Teacher came in and asked them Monks what is it you are sitting here now talking about When they told him he said Monks if you regard this existence alone it is indeed highly improper and unjust that the five hundred women led by Sāmāvatī should suffer such a deathWhat they received however was in every way proper considering the sin they committed in a previous existence Reverend Sir what was the sin they committed in a previous existence Pray tell us Responding to their request the Teacher related the followingOnce upon a time when Brahmadatta reigned in Benāres there were eight Private Buddhas who regularly took their meals in the royal palaceand there were five hundred women who waited upon themSeven of these Private Buddhas retired to the Himālaya and the Private Buddha who remained sat down on the bank of the river where there was a tangle of grass and entered into mystic meditationNow one day after the Private Buddhas had departed the king took those women and went to sport in the waterWhen those women who had sported there in the water all day came out they were stung with cold Desiring to warm themselves they said to each other Seek out some place where we can build a fire As they walked back and forth they saw the tangle of grass and thinking it was no more than a heap of grass they gathered round it and set it on fireWhen the grass burned down and they saw the Private Buddha they cried out We are lost we are lost The kings Private Buddha is burning up If the king finds it out he will kill everyone of us Let us burn him well while we are about it So all those women brought firewood from all directions and piled it on the Private BuddhaThen they poured oil on it and saying to themselves Now he will burn they departedNow in the beginning their act was a thoughtless one and they were not bound thereby But afterwards they committed a deliberate sin and were bound to suffer the consequences thereofWhile the Private Buddha was absorbed in mystic meditation they might have brought a hundred thousand cartloads of firewood and poured oil thereon and they could not even have caused him to feel the heato on the seventh day the Private Buddha arose and went where he pleasedBecause they committed this sin those women were boiled for many hundreds of thousands of years in Hell and because the fruit of that same evil deed was not yet exhausted their houses were burned and they were burned in their houses in a hundred successive states of existence in this very mannerThis is the sin they committed in a previous state of existenceWhen the Teacher had related this story the monks asked him But Reverend Sir how did Khujjuttarā come to be a hunchback How did she become so wise How did she obtain the Fruit of Conversion How did she become an errandgirlMonks while that same king was ruling in Benāres there was a Private Buddha who was slightly hunchbackedNow a certain servingwoman throwing a blanket over her shoulder and taking a golden vessel in her hand bent over so that she looked like a hunchback and saying This is the way our Private Buddha walks imitated his manner of walkingIt was in consequence of this that she came to be a hunchbackBut on the first day she provided those Private Buddhas with seats in the royal palace took their bowls filled them with riceporridge and presented them to themThe Private Buddhas took the bowls of porridge but they were so hot that they were obliged to shift them from one hand to the otherThat woman seeing what they were doing presented to them eight ivory bracelets of her own saying Use these bracelets as stands for your bowlsWhen they had so done they looked at her whereupon she said Reverend Sirs we have no use for these braceletsAccept them as a present from us before you goThe Private Buddhas took them with them to Nandamūla mountaincaveand those bracelets are preserved there unimpaired to this dayAs the result of this act of hers she now knows the Tipiṭaka by heart and possesses profound wisdomLikewise it was through waiting upon the Private Buddhas that she obtained the Fruit of ConversionThese were her deeds in the interval between two BuddhasIn the dispensation of Kassapa the Supremely Enlightened a certain treasurers daughter of Benāres took her mirror one day as the shades of evening drew on and sat down to adorn herselfNow a certain intimate friend of hers a nun freed from the Depravities came to see herFor nuns freed from the Depravities like to visit the households of their supporters at eventideBut at that moment the treasurers daughter happened to have no errandgirl with her So she said to the nun I greet you Reverend Lady Just take that basket of ornaments and give it to meThe nun thought to herself If I do not take this basket and give it to her she will take a dislike to me and will be reborn in Hellbut if I do give it to her she will be reborn as the errandgirl of anotherHowever it is better to be the errandgirl of another than to suffer torment in HellSo out of pity for her she took the basket and gave it to herAgain one day in the Hall of Truth the monks started a discussion Sāmāvatī and her five hundred women were burned with fire in their house as for Māgandiyā and her kinswomen a fire of straw was built over their bodies and their bodies were torn asunder with iron plows and Māgandiyā was boiled in boiling oil Which of these are alive and which are deadThe Teacher came in and asked Monks what are you sitting here now talking about When they told him he said to them Monks they that are heedless though they live a hundred years yet are they deadThey that are heedful be they dead or alive yet are they aliveMāgandiyā while she yet lived was dead already Sāmāvatī and her followers though they be dead yet are they aliveFor monks the heedful never die So saying he pronounced the following StanzasHeedfulness is the Way to the Deathless heedlessness is the way to deathThe heedful never die but they that are heedless are as it were dead alreadyKnowing this clearly they that are advanced in heedfulnessDelight in heedfulness and rejoice in the state of the ElectThey that devote themselves to meditation they that are persevering they that put forth resolute effortThey the wise attain Nibbāna the highest blisshe shaves off his hair and beard puts on the yellow robe and goes forth from the home life into homelessnessfor gods and humans cling to the five cords of sensual pleasureuntil they had erected a great pyreIn consequence of this act she became the errandgirl of anotherJust as Aggivessana the elephant tamer plants a large post in the earth and binds the forest elephant to it by the neck in order to subdue his forest habitsand to inculcate in him habits congenial to human beings so these four foundations of mindfulness are the bindings for the mind of the noble disciple in order to subdue his habits based on the household life to subdue his memories and intentions based on the household life to subdue his distress fatigue and fever based on the household life and in order that he may attain the true way and realise Nibbanaabide contemplating feelings as feelings but do not think thoughts connected with feelings abide contemplating mind as mind but do not think thoughts connected with the mind abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects but do not think thoughts connected with mindobjectsHe understandsThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Brahman Little OneRobe Culla EkasāṭakaFor in the dispensation of the Buddha Vipassī lived a Brahman named Mahā Ekasāṭaka and he it was who was reborn in the present dispensation in Sāvatthi as OneRobe Culla EkasāṭakaFor Culla Ekasāṭaka possessed but a single undergarment and his wife possessed but a single undergarment and both of them together possessed but a single upper garmentThe result was that whenever either the Brahman or his wife went out of doors the other had to stay at homeWife announcement is made that there will be preaching at the monastery Will you go to hear the Law by day or by nightFor we have not enough upper garments between us to permit both of us to go togetherThe Brahmans wife replied Husband I will go in the daytime So saying she put on the upper garment and wentThe Brahman spent the day at home At night he went to the monastery seated himself in front of the Teacher and listened to the LawLaw As he listened to the Law the five sorts of joy arose within him suffusing his bodyHe greatly desired to do honor to the Teacher but the following thought restrained him If I give this garment to the Teacher there will be no upper garment left for my wife or meA thousand selfish thoughts arose within him then a single believing thought arose within himThen thought of self arose within him and overmastered the believing thoughtEven so did the mighty thought of self seize as it were and bind and thrust out the believing thoughtI will give it No I will not give it said the Brahman to himself As he thus reflected the first watch passed and the second watch arrivedEven then he was not able to bring himself to give the garment to the TeacherThen the last watch came Finally the Brahman thought to himself While I have been fighting with thoughts of faith and thoughts of self two watches have elapsed If these powerful thoughts of self increase they will not permit me to lift up my head from the Four States of Suffering I will therefore give my giftThus the Brahman finally overmastered a thousand thoughts of self and followed the lead of a thought of faith Taking his garment he laid it at the Teachers feet and thrice cried out with a loud voice I have conquered I have conqueredKing Pasenadi Kosala happened to be listening to the Law When he heard that cry he said Ask him what he has conqueredThe kings men asked the Brahman the question and the Brahman explained the matter to themWhen the king heard the explanation he said It was a hard thing to do what the Brahman did I will do him a kindness So he caused a pair of garments to be presented to himThe Brahman presented these garments also to the TathāgataThen the king doubled his gift presenting the Brahman first with two pairs of garments then with four then with eight finally with sixteenThe Brahman presented all these garments also to the TathāgataThen the king directed thirtytwo pairs of garments to be presented to the BrahmanBut to avoid having it said The Brahman has kept not a single pair for himself but has given away every pair he received he said to the Brahman Keep one pair for yourself and give another pair to your wife So saying he caused the Brahman to keep two pairs and gave the remaining thirty pairs to the Tathāgata aloneEven had the Brahman given away what he possessed a hundred times the king would have met his gifts with equal giftsThe king gave orders to his men It was indeed a hard thing to do what the Brahman did Fetch my two blankets into the presencechamberThey did soThe king presented him with the two blankets valued at a thousand pieces of moneyBut the Brahman said to himself I am not worthy to cover my body with these blankets These are suitable only for the Religion of the Buddha Accordingly he made a canopy of one of the blankets and hung it up in the Perfumed Chamber over the Teachers bed likewise he made a canopy of the other blanket and hung it up in his own house over the spot where the monk who resorted to his house for alms took his mealsAt eventide the king went to visit the Teacher Recognizing the blanket he asked him Reverend Sir who was it that honored you with the gift of this blanket Ekasāṭaka Thought the king to himself Even as I believe and rejoice in my belief even so does this Brahman believe and rejoice in his belief Accordingly he presented to him four elephants four horses four thousand pieces of money four women four female slaves and four most excellent villages Thus therefore did the king cause the Brahman to be given the Gift of FoursThe monks started a discussion in the Hall of Truth Oh how wonderful was the deed of Culla Ekasāṭaka No sooner done than he received all manner of presents of four As soon as he did a good deed straightway the fruit thereof was given to himThe Teacher approached and asked the monks Monks what are you sitting here now talking about When they told him he said Monks had Ekasāṭaka been able to bring himself to give me his gift in the first watch he would have received the Gift of Sixteenshad he been able to do so in the middle watch he would have received the Gift of Eightsbecause it was not until late in the last watch that he gave me his gift he received only the Gift of FoursHe who does good works should not put away the impulse to good that arises within him but should act on the instantA meritorious deed tardily done brings its reward but tardy is the reward it brings Therefore a man should perform a good work the instant the impulse to good arises within him So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following StanzaLet a man make haste to do good let him restrain his heart from evilFor if a man is slow in doing good his mind delights in evilThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder SeyyasakaFor Elder Seyyasaka was Elder Lāḷudāyis fellowmonk Becoming discontented with the continence required by the Religious Life he told his companion who put him up to violating the first Saṅghadisesa RuleThereafter as often as he fell into that sin of discontent he broke that same RuleThe Teacher heard about his doings sent for him and asked him Is the report true that you do thus and so Yes Reverend Sir Fond man said the Teacher why have you sinned so grievously in a manner so unbecoming to your state In such fashion did the Teacher reprove him Having so done he enjoined upon him the observance of the Precepts Then he said to him Such a course of action inevitably leads to suffering both in this world and in the world to come So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following StanzaShould a man commit sin he should not repeat his sin again and againHe should not seek after evil suffering is the outcome of evilThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the goddess LājāThe story begins at RājagahaFor while Venerable Kassapa the Great was in residence at Pipphali Cave he entered into a state of trance remaining therein for seven days Arising from trance on the seventh day he surveyed with Supernatural Vision the places where he was wont to go his rounds for alms As he looked abroad he beheld a certain woman the keeper of a field of ricepaddy parching heads of rice which she had gathered Thereupon he considered within himself Is she endowed with faith or is she not endowed with faith Straightway becoming aware that she was endowed with faith he reflected Will she be able to render me assistance Straightway he became aware of the following This noble young woman is wise and resourceful she will render me assistance and as the result of so doing will receive a rich reward So he put on his robe took bowl in hand and went and stood near the ricefieldWhen this noble young woman saw the Elder her heart believed and her body was suffused with the five sorts of joy Wait a moment Reverend Sir said she Taking some of the parched rice she went quickly to him poured the rice into the Elders bowl and then saluting him with the Five Rests she made an Earnest Wish saying Reverend Sir may I be a partaker of the Truth you have seenSo be it replied the Elder pronouncing the words of thanksgivingThen that noble young woman saluted the Elder and set out to return reflecting upon the alms she had given to the ElderNow in a certain hole by the road skirting the field of growing rice lurked a poisonous snakeHe was not able to bite the Elders leg for it was covered with his yellow robeBut as that noble young woman reached that spot on her return reflecting upon the alms she had given to the Elderthe snake wriggled out of his hole bit her and then and there caused her to fall prostrate on the groundDying with believing heart she was reborn in the World of the Thirtythree Like a sleeper awakened she awoke in a celestial mansion of gold thirty leagues in extent her stature was threequarters of a leagueDying with believing heart she was reborn in the World of the Thirtythree Like a sleeper awakened she awoke in a celestial mansion of gold thirty leagues in extent her stature was threequarters of a league Standing at the portal of the mansion she surveyed her glory and considered within herself Through what work of merit did I attain this glory Straightway she became aware of the following This my glory is the result of my gift of parched rice to Elder Kassapa the GreatThen she thought to herself Since I have received this splendor and glory as the result of a trifling work of merit I ought not henceforth to be heedless I will therefore perform the major and minor duties for the Elder and so make my salvation sure Accordingly early in the morning she took a golden broom and a golden receptacle for sweepings went to the Elders cell swept it clean and set out water for drinkingWhen the Elder saw what had been done he concluded Some probationer or novice must have rendered me this serviceOn the second day the goddess did the same thing again and the Elder again came to the same conclusionut on the third day the Elder heard the sound of her sweeping and looking in through the keyhole saw the radiant image of her body And straightway he asked Who is it that is sweepingIt is I Reverend Sir your female disciple the goddess LājāI have no female disciple by that nameReverend Sir when I was a young woman tending a ricefield I gave you parched rice as I returned on my way a snake bit me and I died with believing heart and was reborn in the World of the Thirtythree Since it was through you that I received this glory I said to myself I will perform the major and minor duties for you and so make my salvation sure Therefore came I hither Reverend SirWas it you that swept this place for me yesterday and on the preceding days setting out water for drinkingYes Reverend SirPray depart hence goddess Never mind about the duties you have rendered but henceforth come no more hitherReverend Sir do not destroy me Permit me to perform the major and minor services for you and so make my salvation sureGoddess depart hence lest in the future when expounders of the Law take the variegated fan and sit down they have reason to say Report has it that a goddess comes and performs the major and minor duties for Elder Kassapa the Great setting out water for him to drink Henceforth therefore come no more hither but turn your steps elsewhereReverend Sir do not destroy me begged the goddess again and againThe Elder thought to himself This goddess pays no attention to my command Therefore he said to her You do not know your place So saying he snapped his fingers in contemptThe goddess not daring to remain where she was flew up into the air and extending her clasped hands in an attitude of reverence cried out Reverend Sir do not nullify the attainment I have attained Let me make my salvation sure Thereupon the goddess wept and wailed and lamented standing poised in the airAs the Teacher sat in his Perfumed Chamber at Jetavana  he heard the sound of her lamentation Therefore he sent forth a luminous image of himself and sitting down face to face as it were with the goddess he opened his lips and said Goddess it was indeed the duty of my son Kassapa the Great to restrain himself But they who desire to perform works of merit conclude This one thing alone is needful and recognize the doing of works of merit as their sole dutyIndeed both in this world and the world to come it is the doing of good works alone that brings happiness Then he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following StanzaIf a man do works of merit he should do them again and againHe should long to do works of merit happy is the outcome of works of meritThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to AnāthapiṇḍikaFor Anāthapiṇḍika who spent fiftyfour crores of treasure in the Religion of the Buddha on Jetavana monastery alone proceeded in state three times a day to wait upon the Teacher during the Teachers residence at Jetavana Whenever he set out to go thither he thought The probationers and novices will look at my hands and ask the question What has he brought with him as offerings  and therefore never went emptyhandedWhen he went thither early in the morning he carried riceporridge with him after breakfast he carried ghee fresh butter and the other medicamentsin the evening he carried with him perfumes garlands unguents and garmentsalthough he was unable to give choice food such as he had beforeBut in spite of this he just gave alms to the Congregation of Monks as beforeNow those who lived by trade had borrowed from him eighteen crores of treasure Moreover eighteen crores of treasure belonging to his family secretly buried at the bank of the river had been swept into the great ocean at the time when the river burst its banks The result was that he was gradually being reduced to a state of povertyOne day the Teacher asked him Are alms provided for us in the house of our householder Anāthapiṇḍika replied Yes Reverend Sir but the food is naught but birdfeed and sour gruelThen said the Teacher to him Householder do not allow yourself to think It is naught but coarse food that I give to the Teacherand be not disturbed thereat If the intention be pure it is impossible to give the Buddhas and others food that is really coarse You have given food to the Eight Holy Personages I however in the time of Velāma stirred up all India by setting rich offerings agoing  but yet I failed to win a single man to betake himself to the Three Refuges It is a hard thing to find those on whom it is proper to bestow offeringsTherefore be not disturbed at the thought My offerings are coarse food  So saying the Teacher recited in full the Velāma SuttaWhen the Teacher and the Teachers disciples entered the house of Anāthapiṇḍika the goddess who dwelt over the gate unable to remain by reason of the intensity of their goodness thought to herself I will detach the householder from his allegiance that they may no more enter this house Now although the goddess had longed to address the householder she could say not a word to him in the heyday of his wealth and power At this time however she thought to herself The householder is now a poor man and will therefore be disposed to give heed to my words Accordingly she went by night entered the treasurers chamber of state and stood poised in the airWhen the treasurer saw her he said Who is thatIt is I great treasurer the goddess that resides over your fourth gate I am come to give you admonitionWell then say what you have to sayGreat treasurer without considering the future you have dissipated your great wealth in the religion of the monk Gotama Now although you have reduced yourself to poverty you still continue to give of your wealth If you continue this course in a few days you will not have enough left to provide you with clothing and food Of what use to you is the monk Gotama Abandon your lavish giving devote your attention to business and make a fortuneIs this the advice you came to give meYes treasurerThen begone Though a hundred thousand like you should try you would not be able to move me from my course You have said to me what you had no right to say what business have you to dwell in my house Leave my house instantlyThe goddess unable to withstand the words of a Noble Disciple who had attained the Fruit of Conversion left his house taking her children with her But after the goddess had left his house she was unable to find lodging elsewhere Then she thought to herself I will ask the treasurer to pardon me and to allow me to resume my residence in his house Accordingly she approached the tutelary deity of the city told him of her offense and said to him Come now conduct me to the treasurer persuade him to pardon me and persuade him to allow me to resume my residence in his houseBut the tutelary deity of the city replied You said something you had no business to say it will be impossible for me to go with you to the treasurers residence Thus did the tutelary deity of the city refuse her requestThen she went to the Four Great Kings but they likewise refused her request Then she approached Sakka king of gods told him her story and entreated him yet more earnestly Said she Sire I am  unable to find a place wherein to lodge myself but wander about without protection children in hand Obtain for me the privilege of returning to my former residenceSakka replied But neither will it be possible for me to speak to the treasurer in your behalf However I will tell you a wayVery good sire tell me what it isGo assume the dress of the treasurers steward note on a leaf from the hand of the treasurer a list of the wealth he once possessed put forth your supernatural power and recover the eighteen crores of wealth borrowed by those who live by trade and fill therewith the treasurers empty storeroom  Besides this wealth there are eighteen crores of wealth which were swept into the great ocean Yet again there are eighteen crores of wealth without an owner to be found in such and such a place Gather all this together and therewith fill his empty storeroom Having thus atoned for your offense ask him to grant you pardonVery well said the goddess And straightway she did all just as Sakka king of gods told her to Having so done she went and stood poised in the air illuminating with supernatural radiance the treasurers chamber of state Who is that asked the treasurer It is I replied the goddess the blind stupid goddess that once dwelt over your fourth gate Pardon me the words I once spoke to you in my blind stupidityIn obedience to the command of Sakka king of gods I have recovered the fiftyfour crores of wealth and filled your empty storeroom therewith thus have I atoned for my offense I have no place wherein to lodge myself and therefore am I greatly weariedAnāthapiṇḍika thought to himself This goddess says to me I have made atonement for my offense and confesses her fault I will conduct her to the Supremely Enlightened Accordingly he conducted her to the Teacher saying to her Tell the Teacher all you have doneThe goddess fell upon her face before the feet of the Teacher and said Reverend Sir because of my folly I did not recognize your eminent merit and uttered evil words pardon me for having uttered them Thus did the goddess ask pardon both of the Teacher and of the great treasurerThen the Teacher admonished both the treasurer and the fairy with reference to the ripening of deeds both good and evil saying Here in this present life great treasurer even an evildoer sees happiness so long as his evil deed has not yet ripenedBut so soon as his evil deed has ripened then he sees only evilLikewise a good man sees evil things so long as his good deeds have not yet ripenedbut so soon as his good deeds have ripened then he sees only happiness So saying he joined the connection and preaching the Law pronounced the following Stanzasven an evildoer sees happiness so long as his evil deed has not yet ripenedBut so soon as his evil deed has ripened then the evildoer sees evil thingsEven a good man sees evil so long as his good deeds have not yet ripenedBut so soon as his good deeds have ripened then the good man sees happinessThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Visākhās companionsThe story goes that five hundred young men of respectable families living at Sāvatthi intrusted their wives to the care of the eminent female lay disciple Visākhā confident that under such auspices they would live the life of HeedfulnessFrom that time forth whether they went to the pleasure garden or to the monastery they went always with VisākhāNow on a certain occasion proclamation was made of a drinking festival to last seven days Accordingly those women prepared strong drink for their husbands and their husbands took part in the festival carousing for a period of seven daysOn the eighth day the drum went forth to announce the resumption of work and they returned to their workThose women thought to themselves We have not been permitted to drink strong drink in the presence of our husbands Yet plenty of strong drink remains Let us therefore drink it but let us take care that our husbands shall know nothing about it Accordingly they went to Visākhā and said to her Noble lady we desire to visit the pleasure garden Very well dear friends perform your various duties first then you may go out They went with Visākhā causing strong drink to be removed surreptitiously drank it in the garden and roamed about in a state of intoxicationVisākhā thought to herself These women have committed a gross impropriety Now the heretics also will find ground of reproach and will say The female lay disciples of the monk Gotama go about drinking strong drink  So she said to those women Dear friends you have committed a gross impropriety and have brought disgrace upon me also Your husbands also will be enraged at you Now what will you doNoble lady we shall pretend to be sickVery well you will acquire notoriety by your own doingsThe women went home and pretended to be sickNow their husbands inquired Where is Soandso Where is Soandso Sick They undoubtedly drank the strong drink that remained concluded their husbands Therefore they beat them and brought distress and unhappiness upon themAt a subsequent drinking festival those same women desired to drink strong drink in the same manner as before So they went to Visākhā and said to her Noble lady conduct us to the pleasure garden But Visākhā refused to do so saying The last time I did so you brought disgrace upon me Go by yourselves I will not conduct you thither The women decided We will not act so this time So they went to Visākhā again and said to her Noble lady we desire to do honor to the Buddha conduct us to the monasteryWhat you propose to do now is quite proper go make preparationsSo taking perfumes and garlands in caskets carrying in their hands jugs filled with strong drink wearing great cloaks they approached Visākhā and accompanied her to the monastery Then they went off by themselves and drank strong drink out of their jugs And throwing away their jugs they seated themselves in the Hall of Truth in the presence of the TeacherSaid Visākhā to the Teacher Reverend Sir preach the Law to these womenBut those same women were so drunk that their bodies swayed back and forth and suddenly they took it into their heads to dance and singNow a certain deity belonging to the host of Māra thought to herself I will possess the bodies of these women and cause them to commit gross improprieties in the presence of the monk Gotama And straightway she took possession of their bodiesThereupon some of them clapped their hands before the Teacher and laughed while others began to danceThe Teacher considered within himself What does this mean Immediately perceiving the cause he said to himself I shall not now permit the deities of the host of Māra to descendFor during all the time I was fulfilling the Perfections it was certainly not for the purpose of allowing the deities of the host of Māra to descend that I fulfilled themAccordingly that he might frighten those women the Teacher sent forth a darkblue ray from the hair of his eyebrow Straightway there was black darknessThose women were terrified with the fear of deathSo intense was their fear that the strong drink within their bellies dried upThen the Teacher vanished from the couch on which he sat stood on the top of Mount Sineru and sent forth a ray of light from the hair between his eyebrows At that moment it was as though a thousand moons had risenThen he addressed those women saying When you approach and come into my presence you must not approach in heedlessnessFor in consequence of your heedlessness a deity of the host of Māra got possession of you and at a time when you should not have laughed or behaved lightly he caused you to laugh and to misbehave You should henceforth make every effort to quench the fire of lust and of the other evil passions So saying he pronounced the following StanzaWhy laughter why exultation For the world is ever aflameWill ye not seek a light ye that are shrouded in darknessThe Teacher knowing that the women were established in faith that cannot be shaken descended from the summit of Mount Sineru and seated himself in the Seat of the BuddhaWomen of such quality as these women seating themselves before a Buddha like you were unable to control their movements but springing to their feet clapped their hands and began to laugh and sing and danceThereupon Visākhā said to him Verily strong drink is an evil thingThe Teacher replied Yes Visākhā strong drink is indeed an evil thingfor because of it numberless living beings have come to distress and unhappiness But Reverend Sir at what time did this episode have its beginning In response to this question the Teacher desiring to relate in detail the circumstances that led to this episode told a Story of the Past relating the Kumbha Jātaka Jātaka  v This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to five hundred monks who obtained InsightIt appears that five hundred monks obtained a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher retired to the forest and devoted themselves to meditation But although they strove and struggled with might and main they were unable to develop Specific Attainment Thereupon they thought to themselves We will obtain a Subject of Meditation better suited to our needs With this thought in mind they set out to return to the Teacher On the way they saw a mirage Concentrating their attention on the mirage they developed Specific AttainmentThe moment they entered the precincts of the monastery it began to rainStanding here and there on the terraces they watched the bubbles formed by the force of the downpour rising and bursting Thereupon the following thought occurred to them Even as a bubble so also does this personality of ours rise and burst Immediately they concentrated their attention on this thoughtThe Teacher sitting in the Perfumed Chamber sent forth a luminous image of himself and as it were looking into the faces of those monks spoke with them pronouncing the following StanzaAs a bubble as a mirage so should one view the worldIf a man so look upon the world the King of Death sees him notAt the conclusion of the lesson those monks even in the place wherein they stood attained ArahatshipThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to thirty monksFor one day thirty monks residing in foreign parts came to visit the TeacherElder nanda saw those monks just as he was approaching the Teacher to wait upon him So he thought to himself I will wait until the Teacher has exchanged friendly greetings with these monks and then I will wait upon the TeacherAccordingly he waited at the gate When the Teacher had exchanged friendly greetings with them he preached the Law to them in a pleasing mannerAfter listening to the Law all those monks attained Arahatship Thereupon they soared aloft and departed through the airWhen they tarried Elder nanda approached the Teacher and said Reverend Sir thirty monks came here Where are theyGone nandaBy what path did they go Reverend SirThrough the air nandaBut Reverend Sir have they already rid themselves of the DepravitiesYes nanda After hearing me preach the Law they attained ArahatshipNow at that moment some swans came flying through the airSaid the Teacher nanda he who has fully developed the Four Grades of Magical Power flies through the air like a swan So saying he pronounced the following StanzaSwans follow the track of the sun they that possess magical power go through the airThe resolute are conducted out of this world having conquered Māra and his trainThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence among the Sākiyas with reference to the cessation of a quarrel among kinsmenThe story goes that the Sākiyas and the Koliyas caused the waters of the river Rohiṇī to be confined by a single dam between the city of Kapilavatthu and the city of Koliya and cultivated the fields on both sides of the riverNow in the month Jeṭṭhamūla the crops began to droop whereupon the laborers employed by the residents of both cities assembledSaid the residents of the city of Koliya If this water is diverted to both sides of the river there will not be enough both for you and for us too But our crops will ripen with a single watering Therefore let us have the waterThe Sākiyas replied After you have filled your storehouses we shall not have the heart to take ruddy gold and emeralds and black pennies and baskets and sacks in our hands go from house to house seeking favors at your hands Our crops also will ripen with a single watering Therefore let us have this waterWe will not give it to youNeither will we give it to you Talk waxed bitter until finally one arose and struck another a blow The other returned the blow and a general fight ensued the combatants making matters worse by aspersions on the origin of the two royal familiesSaid the laborers employed by the Koliyas You who live in the city of Kapilavatthu take your children and go where you belong Are we likely to suffer harm from the elephants and horses and shields and weapons of those who like dogs and jackals have cohabited with heir own sistersThe laborers employed by the Sākiyas replied You lepers take your children and go where you belong Are we likely to suffer harm from the elephants and horses and shields and weapons of destitute outcasts who have lived in jujubetrees like animalsBoth parties of laborers went and reported the quarrel to the ministers who had charge of the work and the ministers reported the matter to the royal householdsThereupon the Sākiyas came forth armed for battle and cried out We will show what strength and power belong to those who have cohabited with their sistersLikewise the Koliyas came forth armed for battle and cried out We will show what strength and power belong to those who dwell in jujubetreesAs the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn and beheld his kinsmen he thought to himself If I refrain from going to them these men will destroy each other It is clearly my duty to go to them Accordingly he flew through the air quite alone to the spot where his kinsmen were gathered together and seated himself crosslegged in the air over the middle of the river RohiṇīWhen the Teachers kinsmen saw the Teacher they threw away their weapons and did reverence to himSaid the Teacher to his kinsmen What is all this quarrel about great kingWe do not know Reverend SirWho then would be likely to knowThe commanderinchief of the army would be likely to know The commanderinchief of the army said The viceroy would be likely to know Thus the Teacher put the question first to one and then to another asking the slavelaborers last of all The slavelaborers replied The quarrel is about water Reverend SirThen the Teacher asked the king How much is water worth great kingVery little Reverend SirHow much are Khattiyas worth great kingKhattiyas are beyond price Reverend SirIt is not fitting that because of a little water you should destroy Khattiyas who are beyond priceThey were silentThen the Teacher addressed them and said Great kings why do you act in this manner Were I not here present today you would set flowing a river of blood You have acted in a most unbecoming manner You live in enmity indulging in the five kinds of hatred I live free from hatredYou live afflicted with the sickness of the evil passions I live free from diseaseYou live in eager pursuit of the five kinds of sensual pleasure I live free from the eager pursuit of aught So saying he pronounced the following StanzasOh happily let us live free from hatred among those who hateAmong men who hate let us live free from hatredOh happily let us live free from disease among those who are afflicted with diseaseAmong men who are afflicted with disease let us live free from diseaseOh happily let us live free from longing among those who are possessed with longingAmong those who are possessed with longing let us live free from longingBirth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana and it was with reference to the announcement made by the Chief Disciples of Sañjayas refusal to go to the Teacher From first to last the story is as followsFour Incalculables and a hundred thousand cycles of time in the past our Teacher was born as a Brahman prince in the city of Amaravatī and his name was Sumedha After acquiring proficiency in all the arts he renounced wealth amounting to countless millions which he inherited on the death of his mother and father retired from the world adopted the life of an anchorite took up his residence in the Himālaya country and there won for himself by Ecstatic Meditation the Supernatural Powers Now it came to pass on a certain day that  Dīpaṅkara Master of the Ten Forces set out from Sudassana monastery to go to the city Ramma and the populace came forth to clear the way As Sumedha came flying through the air on that day he observed that a road was being clearedTherefore selecting for himself a portion of the road which had not yet been cleared when the Teacher approached he made of himself a bridge for him spread his mantle of antelope skin in the mud laid himself thereon and said Let not the Teacher with his company of disciples tread upon the mud Let him rather tread upon me so let him proceed upon his journeyWhen the Teacher beheld Sumedha he said Yonder prince is a nascent Buddha four Incalculables and a hundred thousand cycles of time hence he will become a Buddha named GotamaThus did the Teacher Dīpaṅkara prophesy regarding the Brahman prince Sumedha After Dīpaṅkara came the following Buddhas Koṇḍañña Maṅgala Sumana Revata Sobhita Anomadassī Paduma Nārada Padumuttara Sumedha Sujāta Piyadassī Atthadassī Dhammadassī Siddhattha Tissa Phussa Vipassī Sikhī Vessabhū Kakusandha Koṇāgamana and Kassapa One after another these twentyfour Buddhas arose in the world and enlightened the world and from each of them the Brahman prince Sumedha received the prophecy that he should one day become a Buddha Now after Sumedha had fulfilled the Ten Perfections and the Ten Minor Perfections and the Ten Major Perfections making in all Thirty Perfections he was reborn as Vessantara and in his existence as Vessantara he bestowed mighty alms which caused the earth to quake and in that existence also he renounced both son and wife When the term of life allotted to him was come to an end he was reborn in the Heaven of the Tusita gods and when he had remained in this state of existence during the term of life allotted to him the deities of the Ten Thousand Worlds assembled together and thus addressed himThe time is come mighty hero descend into the womb of your motherRescue the worlds of men and gods discover the Region of the DeathlessThereupon he made the Five Great Observations and passing from that state of existence received a new existence in the royal household of the SākiyasIn this royal household he was brought up amid great splendor and in the course of time attained auspicious youth He spent his youth in three mansions appropriate to the three seasons of the year enjoying splendor and majesty of sovereignty comparable  to the splendor of the World of the Gods In the course of time it came to pass that as he proceeded on three successive days to the garden to amuse himself he beheld the Three Heavenly Messengers namely a man worn out by old age a man afflicted with disease and a dead man On each of the three days he returned to his palace overcome with emotion On the fourth day he beheld a man who had retired from the world and adopted the life of a monk It were well for me to retire from the world and adopt the life of a monk said he conceiving a desire for the religious life and with this thought in mind he proceeded to the garden and spent the entire day sitting on the bank of the royal pool While he sat there the god Vissakamma approached him disguised as a barber and dressed him in rich apparel and adorned him with all manner of adornments There also he received the message that a son had been born to him Prince Rāhula and realizing the strength of affection for a son he reflected I must straightway break this bond lest it become too strong for me In the evening as he entered the city Kisā Gotamī daughter of his fathers sister pronounced the following StanzaHappy indeed is that mother happy indeed is that fatherHappy indeed is that wife whose husband is such a one as heThe monks were offended and said The Teacher shows favoritism in bestowing this distinction In bestowing the place of Chief Disciples he ought to give the preference to those who were the first to retire from the world namely the Band of Five If he disregard their claims he ought to give the preference to the Elder Yasa and his Fiftyfour Companions If he disregard their claims he ought to give the preference to the Thirty Youths If he disregard their claims he ought to give the preference to the Three Brothers UruvelāKassapa NadīKassapa and GayāKassapa In rejecting the prior claims of all these monks and giving the place of Chief Disciples to those who retired from the world last of all the Teacher shows favoritismThe Teacher asked them Monks what is the subject you are discussing When they told him he said Monks I show no favoritism in bestowing this distinction On the contrary I bestow on these monks and on all others that for which each has made his Earnest WishFor AññaKoṇḍañña gave the first fruits of a certain crop nine times but in so doing did not make an Earnest Wish for the place of Chief Disciple On the contrary in bestowing his gift he made the Earnest Wish that he might be the first to win the foremost estate of all namely ArahatshipWhen was that Reverend SirListen monksYes Reverend Sir Thereupon the Exalted One related the followingMonks ninetyone cycles of time in the past the Exalted Vipassī appeared in the worldAt that time two brothers Mahā Kāḷa and Culla Kāḷa both of them householders caused a great field to be planted with riceOne day Culla Kāḷa went to the ricefield hulled a kernel of rice and ate it and found it unusually sweetShortly afterwards he desired to make a gift of unripe rice to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha So he went to his older brother and said to him Brother let us have unripe rice hulled and cooked in a manner suitable for the Buddhas and let us bestow the same in almsWhat say you brother No one has ever yet had unripe rice hulled and given in alms nor is anyone likely to do such a thing in the future dont spoil the cropThe younger brother repeated his suggestion several times Finally the older brother said Very well divide the field into two parts Do not touch my portion but do whatever you like in your own portion of the fieldVery well said Culla Kāḷa So he divided the field into two parts hired a large number of men for manual labor caused grains of unripe rice to be hulled had it cooked in rich milk adding ghee honey and sugar and presented the rice thus prepared to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha saying at the conclusion of the meal Reverend Sir by virtue of this my gift of firstfruits may I be the first to win the foremost estate of all namely ArahatshipSo be it said the Teacher returning thanksWhen he went back to the field and looked at it again he saw that the entire field was filled with heads of growing rice bound together as it were in sheaves At this sight he experienced the five kinds of joy Thought he I am indeed fortunate When the rice was in the ear he gave firstfruits of rice in the ear In association with the residents of the village he bestowed the firstfruits of the crop When the rice was reaped he gave the firstfruits of the reaping when it was in the sheaf the firstfruits of the sheaves when it was in the shock the firstfruits of the shocks when it was in the rick the firstfruits of the ricks when it was threshed the firstfruits of the threshingfloor when it was ground the firstfruits of the flour when it was measured the firstfruits of the measuring when it was put away in the storehouse the firstfruits of the storeThus he bestowed the firstfruits of a single crop nine timesWhatever he took away was made up and he had a bumper harvestGoodness keeps him who keeps itTherefore said the Exalted OneRighteousness truly keeps him who keeps righteousnessrighteous living brings happinessHerein is the advantage of living righteouslythat he who walks righteously will never go to a state of sufferingThus in the dispensation of the Supremely Enlightened Vipassī did AññaKoṇḍañña bestow the gift of first fruits nine times making the Earnest Wish to be the first to attain the foremost of all estatesLikewise in the dispensation of the Buddha Padumuttara a hundred thousand cycles of time in the past in the city Hasavatī he gave mighty gifts and falling at the feet of that Exalted Buddha made the Earnest Wish to be the first to attain the foremost of all estates namely Arahatship Thus I bestowed on him only that for which he made his Earnest WishI show no favoritism in bestowing distinctionReverend Sir what work of merit did the fiftyfive noble youths led by Yasa perform They too made an Earnest Wish for Arahatship at the feet of a certain Buddha and did many works of merit Subsequently but before the present Buddha had appeared in the world they became friends banded themselves together for the performance of works of merit and devoted themselves to the care of the corpses of paupersOne day seeing the dead body of a pregnant woman they carried the body to the cemetery for the purpose of burning itTo Yasa and four of his companions was assigned the duty of burning the corpse the rest returned and entered the villageAs the youth Yasa burned the body piercing it with stakes and turning it over and over he grasped the thought of the Impurity of the Body This thought he communicated to his four companions also saying Behold brethren this body Here and there the skin has burst open it resembles nothing so much as the skin of a mottled cow It is impure stinking repulsiveStraightway his four companions also grasped the thought of the Impurity of the BodyIn their turn these five companions went to the village and informed the rest of their friendsAs for Yasa he went home and informed his mother and father and wifeand they all developed the thought of ImpurityThis is the work of merit these youths performed in a previous state of existenceAnd because of this very work of merit consciousness of the Impurity of the Body arose within Yasas mind in the womens apartments And thus because they had acquired the faculties requisite thereto all of them developed Specific Attainmentherefore these youths also obtained precisely that for which they made their Earnest WishI show no favoritism in bestowing distinctionBut Reverend Sir what work of merit did the thirty noble youths perform They also made an Earnest Wish for Arahatship at the feet of previous Buddhas and performed works of merit Subsequently but before the present Buddha appeared in the world they were reborn as thirty evildoers but hearing the admonition addressed to Tuṇḍila they kept the Five Precepts for sixty thousand yearsThus these men also obtained only that for which they made their Earnest WishI show no favoritism in bestowing distinctionBut Reverend Sir what work of merit was performed by the three brothers Kassapa UruvelāKassapa NadīKassapa and GayāKassapaThey also performed works of merit making an Earnest Wish to attain ArahatshipNinetytwo cycles of time in the past two Buddhas appeared in the world at the same time Tissa and PhussaPhussas father was King MahindaWhen Phussa attained Enlightenment the kings youngest son became his Chief Disciple and the son of the housepriest became his Second DiscipleTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the venerable Bakkula was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen Acela Kassapa a former companion of

admissionHe knew directly Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingAnd the venerable Kassapa became one of the arahantsThen on a later occasion the venerable Bakkula took a key and went from cell to cell saying Come forth venerable sirs come forth venerable sirsToday I shall attain final NibbanaThat the venerable Bakkula took a key and went from cell to cell saying Come forth venerable sirs come forth venerable sirs Today I shall attain final Nibbana  this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the venerable BakkulaThe king went to the Teacher and said My oldest son is the Buddha my youngest son is Chief Disciple and the son of my housepriest is Second Disciple And looking upon the three he said My very own is the Buddha my very own is the Law my very own is the Order And thrice he breathed forth the Solemn Utterance Praise be unto Him that is Highly Exalted AllWorthy Supremely Enlightened Then he prostrated himself before the feet of the Teacher and said Reverend Sir now at the end of a life lasting ninety thousand years it is time as it were for me to sit down and close my eyes in slumber So long as I live go not to the door of others houses but receive the Four Requisites from me alone Having thus obtained the Teachers consentthe king thereafter ministered to him regularlyNow the king had three other sons besides the eldest of whom had a retinue of five hundred soldiers the middlemost three and the youngest twoNow the king had three other sons besides the eldest of whom had a retinue of five hundred soldiers the middlemost three and the youngest two Succeeding in restoring order on the frontier they returned to their fatherTheir father embraced them kissed their heads and said to them Dear sons I grant you whatever you desireVery well your majesty said they accepting his offer When after a few days their father again said Dear sons I grant you whatever you desire they replied Your majesty we desire naught else but only this that henceforth we may entertain our brother grant us this boonI will not grant you this boon dear sonsIf you are unwilling to grant us this privilege permanently then grant it to us for seven yearsThat will I not dear sonsWell then grant us the privilege for six years or five or four or three or two years or for one yearThat will I not dear sonsor for seven monthsor six or five or four or threeor two months or for one month Well then your majesty make it one month for each of us grant us this privilege for three months in allVery well dear sons then entertain your brother for three monthsNow all three brothers had a single treasurer and a single steward the latter of whom had a retinue of twelve nahutas of servingmenThe three brothers summoned the treasurer and the steward and said to them During the coming three months we shall take upon ourselves the Ten Precepts put on yellow robes and reside with the Teacher In our absence it will be your duty to administer the alms every day you are to provide all the food both hard and soft for ninety thousand monks and a thousand soldiersFrom henceforth we shall have nothing at all to sayThe treasurer and the steward joined forces and performed the duty of almsgiving by turns taking provisions from the storehouses of the three brothers and bestowing them in alms But when the children of the servingmen cried for riceporridge and other kinds of foodthe treasurer and the steward would give them what they cried for even before the Congregation of Monks arrivedThe result was that the Congregation of Monks received only what was left over at the end of a meal and not a fresh supply of food at allFinally the treasurer and the steward became so greedy that they would take food and pretending that they were going to give it to the children eat it themselvesThe mere sight of the pleasing food they were unable to resistThey and their associates numbered eightyfour thousand menBecause they ate food which it was their duty to give to the Congregation of Monks when they died and their bodies were dissolved they were reborn in the World of GhostsWhen the three brothers and their thousand men died they were reborn in the World of the Gods and spent ninetytwo cycles of time in passing from one celestial world to anotherThus did those three brothers perform works of merit at that time making the Earnest Wish to attain ArahatshipWhat they received was only that for which they made their Earnest WishI show no favoritism in giving what I giveNow at that time their steward was Bimbisāra their treasurer was the lay disciple Visākha and the three royal princes were the three ascetics of the matted locksTheir servingmen reborn at that time among the ghosts after passing from one state of existence to another both good and evil were reborn in this present worldcycle in the World of the Ghosts for the space of four BuddhaintervalsIn this present worldcycle they approached first of all the Exalted Kakusandha whose term of life was forty thousand years and asked him Tell us when we shall obtain something to eatHe replied You will receive nothing to eat in my time but after me the great earth will be elevated a league and the Buddha Koṇāgamana will appear you had best ask himThey waited all that time and when the Buddha Koṇāgamana appeared asked himHe replied You will receive nothing to eat in my time but after me the great earth will be elevated a league and the Buddha Kassapa will appear you had best ask himThey waited all that time and when the Buddha Kassapa appeared asked himHe replied You will receive nothing to eat in my time but after me the great earth will be elevated a league and the Buddha Gotama will appear At that time your kinsman Bimbisāra will be king he will give alms to the Teacher and will make over to you the merit acquired by that act at that time you will receive something to eatThe length of the period intervening between two Buddhas was to them as the morrowWhen the Tathāgata appeared in the world and King Bimbisāra gave alms on the first day and they failed to receive the fruit thereof they waited until it was night and then made a fearful noise and showed themselves to the kingWhen the king went to Veḷuvana on the following day he related the incident to the TathāgataSaid the Teacher Great king ninetytwo cycles of time in the past in the dispensation of the Buddha Phussa these ghosts were kinsmen of yours They ate food which it was their duty to give to the Congregation of Monks and because of this were reborn in the World of Ghosts Passing through the round of existences they asked the Buddhas Kakusandha Koṇāgamana and Kassapa when they should obtain food and the Buddhas told them this and that All this time they desired greatly to receive your alms and the reason why they acted as they did last night was that when you gave alms they failed to receive the fruit thereofBut Reverend Sir in case I were to give alms now would they receive the fruit thereofYes great kingOn the following day the king invited the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha bestowed abundant offerings and said Reverend Sir henceforth may celestial food and drink be the portion of these ghosts And when he had thus transferred to the ghosts the merit of his offering they received celestial food and drinkOn the following day the ghosts made their appearance nakedSaid the king to the Buddha Today Reverend Sir these ghosts made their appearance naked and asked him what he should doSaid the Teacher Great king you did not give them clothesSo on the following day the king presented robes to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha saying Henceforth may they possess celestial raimentAnd when he had thus made over to them the merit of his offering instantly they became possessed of celestial raimentwhereupon they put off their ghostly forms and took on the forms of celestial beingsWhen the Teacher returned thanks he said Without the walls they stand reciting the extramural formulaAt the conclusion of his words of thanksgiving eightyfour thousand living beings obtained Comprehension of the LawThus did the Teacher expound the Law relating the story of the three brothers of the matted locksBut Reverend Sir what work of merit did the Chief Disciples perform They made their Earnest Wish to attain the station of Chief DisciplesFor an Incalculable of cycles of time and a hundred thousand cycles of time additional in the past Sāriputta was reborn in the family of a Brahman of great wealth and his name was Prince SaradaMoggallāna was reborn in the family of a householder of great wealth and his name was Householder SirivaḍḍhaThe two youths were friends from the time when they played in the dirt togetherPrince Sarada came into a large familyinheritance on the death of his father One day when he was alone by himself he thought I have certain knowledge of the life of this world only I know nothing of the life of the world beyondAll they that are born are certain to die I ought to retire from the world enter some Order and seek the Way of ReleaseTherefore he approached his friend and said Friend Sirivaḍḍha it is my intention to retire from the world and seek the Way of Release Can you or can you not retire from the world with meFriend I cannot retire from the world you alone retire from the worldPrince Sarada thought to himself No one ever yet went to the world beyond with companions or kinsmen or friends What one does he must do by himselfAccordingly he threw open the doors of his treasurehouse and bestowed abundant alms on paupers and travelers and beggarsHaving so done he retired to the foot of a certain mountain and adopted the life of an anchorite First one then two then three then many others followed his example in adopting the monastic lifeFinally there were seventyfour thousand ascetics with matted locks Sarada acquired the Five Supernatural Faculties and the Eight Higher Attainments and taught those ascetics of the matted locks the processes necessary to the practice of Ecstatic MeditationAll of them acquired the Five Supernatural Faculties and the Eight Higher AttainmentsAt this time the Buddha Anomadassī appeared in the worldHis city was Candavatī His father was Yasavanta of the Warrior caste and his mother was Lady Yasodharā His Botree was the ajjunatree Nisabha and Anoma were his Chief Disciples Varuṇa was his supporter and Sundarā and Sumanā were his principal female lay disciplesHis term of life was a hundred thousand years his stature was fiftyeight cubits and the radiance from his body flashed twelve leagues He had a retinue of a hundred thousand monksOne day at dawn arising from a Trance of Great Compassion he surveyed the world and beheld the ascetic Sarada Thereupon he became aware of the following Today through my approaching the ascetic Sarada there will be mighty preaching of the Law Sarada will make his Wish for the place of Chief Disciple and his friend Householder Sirivaḍḍha will make his Wish for the place of Second Disciple At the conclusion of the discourse the seventyfour thousand ascetics with matted locks who compose his retinue will attain Arahatship Therefore it behooves me to go there Accordingly taking his own bowl and robe saying not a word to anyone else proceeding in solitude like a lion he commanded Let Sarada know that I am the Buddha And while the ascetic Saradas pupils were absent seeking various kinds of fruits he descended from the sky and alighted on the earth before Saradas very eyesWhen the ascetic Sarada beheld the supernatural power of the Buddha and the perfection of form of the Buddha he pondered in his mind the memorial verses relating to the characteristics of a great man And he said to himself One endowed with these marks if he lives the houselife is a King a Universal Monarch Living the life of retirement he is one who has rolled back the veil of passion an Omniscient BuddhaThis man is without doubt a Buddha Therefore he advanced to meet him paid obeisance to him with the Five Rests prepared a seat and offered it to himThe Exalted One seated himself in the seat prepared for himand the ascetic Sarada selecting a seat appropriate to himself sat down respectfully on one sideAt that moment the seventyfour thousand ascetics of the matted locks who had been absent gathering various kinds of sweet and juicy fruits returned to their teacher Seeing the Buddha seated and their own teacher seated near him they saidTeacher we used to go about this world thinking to ourselves There is no one greater than you But as for this man we are certain that he is greater than youFriends what say you Do you mean to compare a grain of mustard seed to Mount Sineru sixtyeight thousand leagues high Little sons do not compare me to an Omniscient BuddhaThen those ascetics thought to themselves Were this an insignificant man our teacher would not use such a comparison as this How great indeed must this man be And forthwith they fell before his feet and prostrated themselves before himThen their teacher said to them Friends we have here no offering suitable to present to the Buddhas and the Teacher has come here at a time when we usually go the rounds for alms let us give him gifts according to our ability Fetch hither all manner of fruits that are choicest And having thus caused them to fetch fruits he washed his hands and himself placed the fruits in the bowl of the TathāgataThe moment the Teacher touched the fruits which were brought the deities imparted a celestial flavor to themThe ascetic Sarada also himself filtered water and presented it to the TeacherAfter the meal was over while the Teacher still remained seated Sarada summoned all of his pupils and sitting down discoursed pleasantly with the TeacherThought the Teacher to himself Let the two Chief Disciples approach together with the Congregation of MonksStraightway those two ascetics with their retinue of a hundred thousand Arahats approached paid obeisance to the Teacher and sat down respectfully on one sideThen the ascetic Sarada addressed his pupils as follows Friends the seat wherein sit the Buddhas is low and there is no seat for the hundred thousand monks Today you should render high honor to the Buddha Fetch from the foot of the mountain flowers possessing bright colors and sweet perfumesThere is a saying Time occupied in talk is wasted inconceivable is the range of magical power possessed by one endowed with supernatural power and so it was in this case In but an instant those ascetics brought back flowers possessing bright colors and sweet perfumes and arranged a cushion of flowers a league long for the BuddhasThen they arranged a cushion of flowers three gavutas long for the two Chief Disciples The cushions for the rest of the monks were half a league long or less those for the novices were an usabha longThis was made possible by the power of magicIt is not permissible to ask the question How could seats of such great size be arranged in this hermitageWhen the seats had thus been made ready the ascetic Sarada took his stand before the Tathāgata and raising his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation said Reverend Sir ascend this bed of flowers to my everlasting welfare and salvationTherefore it is saidHe gathered together various flowers and perfumesPrepared a bed of flowers and spoke these wordsHere mighty hero have I prepared a seat suitable for youSit down on this bed of flowers and render my heart tranquilFor seven nights and days the Buddha sat upon my bed of flowersRendering my heart tranquil gladdening the world of men and the Worlds of the GodsWhile the Teacher sat thus the two Chief Disciples with the rest of the monks sat each in the seat which had been prepared for himThe ascetic Sarada taking a great flowerparasol held it over the head of the TathāgataSaid the Teacher May this honor rendered to me by the ascetics of the matted locks yield rich fruitAnd straightway he entered into a state of trance attaining the Attainment of Cessation Observing that the Teacher had attained the Attainment of Cessation the two Chief Disciples likewise entered into a state of trance and attained the Attainment of CessationFor seven days the Teacher sat there enjoying the bliss of the Attainment of Cessation When it was time to seek food Saradas pupils went into the forest and ate wild fruits and other varieties of fruits The rest of the time they stood holding out their hands in an attitude of reverent salutation before the Buddhashe ascetic Sarada however went not to seek food but for seven days continuously held the flowerparasol over the Buddha experiencing thereby intense joy and pleasureWhen the Teacher arose from trance he said to his Chief Disciple the Elder Nisabha who sat on his right hand Nisabha return thanks to the ascetics who have honored us with flowers and seatsThereupon the Elder like a mighty warrior who has just received high distinction at the hands of a Universal Monarch his heart filled with joy manifesting the Perfection of Knowledge capable of attainment by a disciple began the address of thanksgiving for the flowers and seatsAt the end of the discourse the Buddha addressed the Second Disciple as follows Do you also preach the Law to the monksThereupon the Elder Anoma pondering the Tipiṭaka the Word of the Buddhas preached the LawBut although the two Chief Disciples preached the Law not a single monk present attained Comprehension of the Lawwith the result that at the conclusion of his discourse all seventyfour thousand ascetics of the matted locks attained Arahatship with the sole exception of the ascetic Sarada Then the Teacher stretched forth his hand and said to them Come monksInstantly their hair and beard disappeared and the Eight Requisites were attached to their personsDo you ask Why did not the ascetic Sarada attain ArahatshipIt was because his mind was distractedWe are told that when he seated himself in the seat of the Second Disciple of the Buddhas nd the Chief Disciple manifesting the Perfection of Knowledge of a disciple preached the Law at the very moment when he began to listen to the preaching of the Law by the Chief Disciple the following thought arose in his mind Oh that at some time in the future in the dispensation of a Buddha who shall arise hereafter I might receive the burden which this disciple has receivedBecause of this thought we are told he was unable to attain the Path and the FruitSarada however paid obeisance to the Tathāgata and standing face to face with him said Reverend Sir what is the title in your Religion borne by the monk who sits in the seat next to youHe it is that follows me in setting in motion the Wheel of the Law which I have set in motion he it is that has reached the pinnacle of the Perfection of Knowledge capable of attainment by a disciple he it is that has grasped the Sixteen Forms of Knowledge he it is that is therefore called in my Religion Chief DiscipleReverend Sir here for seven days have I stood holding the flowerparasol over you thereby rendering honor to you As the fruit of this work of merit I do not wish for a second existence as Sakka or Brahmā But at some time in the future may I become the Chief Disciple of a certain Buddha even as is this present Elder NisabhaWhen Sarada had made this Earnest Wish the Teacher considered within himself Will the Wish of this man be fulfilled Therefore he sent forth his perception into the future and surveying the ages of the future he passed before his mind a period of incalculable length and a hundred thousand cycles of time in addition whereupon he saw that his Wish would be fulfilledSo when the Teacher saw that his Wish would be fulfilled he said to the ascetic Sarada This Earnest Wish of yours will not be in vain For at the end of a period of incalculable length and a hundred thousand cycles of time in addition Gotama Buddha will appear in the world His mother will be Lady Mahā Māyā his father will be King Suddhodana his son will be Rāhula his servitor will be nanda and his Second Disciple will be Moggallāna And you will be his Chief Disciple the Captain of the Faith and your name will be SāriputtaWhen the Teacher had thus predicted the future of the ascetic he preached the Law and then surrounded by his company of monks flew up into the air and departedThe ascetic Sarada sought out the pupils and elders and sent the following message to his friend Householder Sirivaḍḍha Reverend Sirs say to my friend Your friend the ascetic Sarada fell down before the feet of the Buddha Anomadassī and made his Earnest Wish for the place of Chief Disciple under the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama who shall hereafter arise in the world Do you make your Earnest Wish for the place of Second Disciple And when he had thus spoken he preceded the Elders by a different route and went and stood at the door of Sirivaḍḍhas residenceWhen Sirivaḍḍha saw him he said At last after a long absence my noble friend has returned And straightway he seated his friend in a seat and having seated himself in a lower seat asked him But Reverend Sir have you no pupils and attendantsYes my friend the Buddha Anomadassī came to our hermitage and we did him honor to the extent of our power The Teacher preached the Law to all and at the conclusion of his discourse all the members of our community excepting me attained Arahatship and entered the OrderWhen I saw the Chief Disciple of the Teacher the Elder Nisabha I made my Earnest Wish for the place of Chief Disciple under the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama who shall hereafter arise in the world Do you also make your Earnest Wish for the place of Second Disciple under his dispensationBut Reverend Sir I am not on terms of familiar acquaintance with the BuddhasI will assume the burden of talking with the Buddhas you prepare a Great ResolveWhen Sirivaḍḍha heard his words he adorned a space eight karīsas in extent before the door of his residence with the respect due to a king sprinkled sand  scattered flowers of five kinds including lāja flowers caused a pavilion to be erected with a thatch of blue lotuses caused the Seat of the Buddha to be made ready and seats for the monks also to be prepared And having caused abundant offerings and gifts to be prepared he directed the ascetic Sarada to invite the BuddhasSo the ascetic Sarada took the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and went with them to Saradas residenceSarada advanced to meet them took the bowl from the hand of the Tathāgata conducted them into the pavilion seated the Congregation of Monks on the seats prepared for them offered them Water of Donation and provided them with the choicest food At the conclusion of the meal having clothed the Congregation of Monks with robes of great price he said to the Teacher Reverend Sir it was for the purpose of gaining no mean place that this entertainment was undertaken Show your gracious compassion by remaining here in this manner for a period of seven daysThe Teacher condescended to remainFor seven days Sirivaḍḍha bestowed abundant offerings in this manner At the end of his almsgiving he paid obeisance to the Teacher and standing before him with hands clasped in an attitude of reverent salutation said Reverend Sir my friend the ascetic Sarada made his Earnest Wish to become Chief Disciple of a certain Teacher May I also become the Second Disciple of that same TeacherThe Teacher looked into the future and beholding the fulfillment of his Earnest Wish made the following prophecy At the end of a period of incalculable length and a hundred thousand cycles of time in addition you will become the Second Disciple of Gotama BuddhaHearing this prophecy of the Buddhas Sirivaḍḍha was filled with joy and satisfactionhe Teacher returned thanks for the offering of food and then surrounded by the company of monks returned to the monasteryThis monks was the Earnest Wish made by my sons at that timeThey have received precisely that for which they made their Earnest WishWhen I give I give without respect of personsWhen the Teacher had thus spoken the two Chief Disciples paid obeisance to the Exalted One and said Reverend Sir when we were yet householders we went to see the festivities of Mountaintop and then told the entire story of the events which had recently taken place to their attainment of the Fruit of Conversion at the hands of the Elder Assaji Then they said Reverend Sir we went to our teacher desiring to lead him to your feet and pointed out to him the shallowness of his own views and dwelt upon the advantages of his coming hereBut he said to us For me to try to live the life of a pupil now would be as absurd as for a chatty to go to the well I shall not be able to live the life of a pupil We replied Teacher  the populace will now take perfumes garlands and so forth in their hands and will go to do honor to the Teacher alone What do you intend to do Said he Which are the more numerous in this world the stupid or the wiseWe replied Teacher the stupid are many the wise are few Well then said he let the wise men go to the wise monk Gotama and let the stupid come to stupid me As for you go where you like With these words Reverend Sir did he refuse to come hitherWhen the Teacher heard this he said Monks by reason of the false views which he holds Sañjaya has mistaken falsehood for truth and truth for falsehoodBut you by reason of your own wisdom have rightly discerned that which is true in its truth and that which is false in its falsity and you have done wisely to reject that which is false and accept that which is true So saying he pronounced the following StanzasThey who think to find the truth in falsehood they who discern but falsehood in the truthThey never attain the goal of truth but abide in the pastureground of errorThey who have rightly discerned the true in its truth and the false in its falsityThey attain the goal of truth and abide in the pastureground of right thinkingThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Banyan Grove with reference to the Khattiya maiden RohiṇīThe story goes that once upon a time Venerable Anuruddha went with his retinue of five hundred monks to KapilavatthuWhen the Elders kinsfolk heard that he had arrived all except the Elders sister a maiden named Rohiṇī went to the monastery where the Elder was in residence and paid their respects to himThe Elder asked his kinsfolk Where is RohiṇīAt home Reverend SirWhy did she not come hereReverend Sir she is suffering from an eruption of the skin and on this account was ashamed to comeThe Elder caused her to be summoned saying Summon her immediately Rohiṇī fastened a covering of cloth about her face and went to the Elder When she came into his presence the Elder asked her Rohiṇī why did you not come here beforeReverend Sir I am suffering from an eruption of the skin and on this account I was ashamed to comeBut ought you not to perform works of meritWhat can I do Reverend SirCause an assemblyhall to be erectedWhat funds have I to use for this purposeHave you not a set of jewelsYes Reverend Sir I haveHow much did it costIt must have cost ten thousand pieces of moneyWell then spend this in building an assemblyhallWho will build it for me Reverend SirThe Elder looked at her kinsfolk who stood near and said This shall be your dutyBut Reverend Sir what will you doI shall stay right heretherefore bring her the building materialsVery well Reverend Sir said they and brought themThe Elder superintended the arrangements for the erection of the assemblyhall Said he to Rohiṇī Cause an assemblyhall two stories in height to be erected and as soon as the planks are put in place above you take your stand below sweep constantly prepare seats and keep the watervessels filled with waterVery well Reverend Sir replied Rohiṇī So she spent her set of jewels in the erection of an assemblyhall two stories in height As soon as the planks were put in place above she took her stand below sweptand performed the other duties and monks sat therein constantlyEven as she swept the assemblyhall the eruption subsidedWhen the assemblyhall was completed she invited the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha and when the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha had taken their seats filling the assemblyhall she offered them choice food both hard and softWhen the Teacher finished his meal he asked Whose is this offeringYour sister Rohiṇīs Reverend SirBut where is sheIn the house Reverend SirSummon herShe was unwilling to goBut in spite of her unwillingness the Teacher caused her to be summoned all the sameWhen she had come and saluted him and taken her seat the Teacher said to her Rohiṇī why did you not come beforeReverend Sir I was suffering from an eruption of the skin and was ashamed to comeBut do you know the reason why this eruption of the skin broke out on your bodyNo Reverend Sir I do notIt was because of anger that this eruption of the skin broke out on your bodyWhy Reverend Sir what did I doWell then listen said the TeacherSo saying he told her the followingIn times long past the chief consort of the king of Benāres took a dislike to one of the kings nautchgirls and said to herself I will make her suffer So she procured a number of large ripe scabs reduced them to powder and summoning that nautchgirl to her contrived secretly to place the powdered scabs in her bed and cloak and her goats hair coverlet Then as if in fun she sprinkled some of the powder on her bodyImmediately the girls body became covered with pimples and boils so as to have a horridly angry look and she went about scratching herselfWhen she lay down on her bed there too the powdered scabs ate her up and she suffered yet harsher painThe chief consort at that time was RohiṇīWhen the Teacher had related this Story of the Past he said Rohiṇī that was the evil deed which you committed at that timeAnger or jealousy however slight is always unbecoming So saying he pronounced the following Stanzaone should utterly renounce pride one should overcome every attachmentOne should put away angerHe who clings not to Name and Formand is free from attachment is not beset with painAt the conclusion of the lesson many obtained the Fruit of Conversion and the Fruits of the Second and Third PathsRohiṇī also was established in the Fruit of Conversion and at that moment her body took on a golden hueRohiṇī passed from that state of existence and was reborn in the Abode of the Thirtythree at the meetingpoint of the boundaries of four deitiesFair to look upon was she and possessed of the perfection of beauty When the four deities looked upon her desire arose within them and they began to quarrel over her saying She was reborn within my boundary she was reborn within my boundary Finally they went to Sakka king of gods and said to him Sire a dispute has arisen among us over this nymph decide the dispute for usWhen Sakka looked at the nymph desire arose within him also Said he What manner of thoughts have arisen within you since you saw this nymphThe first deity said As for me the thoughts which have arisen within me have no more been able to subside than a battledrumThe second said My thoughts have run wild like a mountain torrentThe third said From the time I first saw this nymph my eyes have popped out like the eyes of a crabThe fourth said My thoughts have no more been able to stand still than a banner raised on a shrineThen Sakka said to them Friends as for you your thoughts are on fire For my part if I can have this nymph I can live but if I cannot have her I shall surely dieThe deities replied Great king there is no need of your dyingSo saying they yielded the nymph to Sakka and went their wayShe was Sakkas darling and delightIf she ever said Let us go engage in such and such sport he could not refuse herWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand asked the venerable BakkulaFriend Bakkula how long is it since you went forthFriend in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any perception of ill willany perception of cruelty to have ever arisen in meFriend in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any thought of sensual desire to have ever arisen in meFriend in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any thought of ill willany thought of cruelty to have ever arisen in meFriend in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall ever having accepted a robe from a householderThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Aggāḷava Shrine with reference to a certain monkFor after the Teacher had given permission to the Congregation of Monks to lodge without the walls of the monastery and while the treasurer of Rājagaha and others were busy providing such lodgings a certain monk of ḷavi decided to build himself a lodging and seeing a tree which suited him began to cut it downThereupon a certain spirit who had been reborn in that tree and who had an infant child appeared before the monk carrying her child on her hip and begged him not to cut down the trees saying Master do not cut down my home it will be impossible for me to take my child and wander about without a homeBut the monk said I shall not be able to find another tree like this and paid no further attention to what she saidThe treespirit thought to herself If he but look upon this child he will desist and placed the child on a branch of the treeThe monk however had already swung his axe was unable to check the force of his upraised axe and cut off the arm of the child Furious with anger the treespirit raised both her hands and exclaimed I will strike him dead In an instant however the thought came to her This monk is a righteous manif I kill him I shall go to HellMoreover if other treespirits see monks cutting down their own trees they will say to themselves Such and such a treespirit killed a monk under such circumstances and will follow my example and kill other monksBesides this monk has a master I will therefore content myself with reporting this matter to his master Lowering her upraised hands she went weeping to the Teacher and having saluted him stood on one sideSaid the Teacher What is the matter treespiritThe treespirit replied Reverend Sir your disciple did this and that to me I was sorely tempted to kill him but I thought this and that refrained from killing him and came hereSo saying she told him the story in all its details When the Teacher heard her story he said to her Well done well done spirit you have done well in holding in like a swiftspeeding chariot your anger when it was thus aroused So saying he pronounced the following StanzaWhoever controls his anger like a swiftspeeding chariot when it is aroused Him I call a charioteer other folk are merely holders of reinsAt the conclusion of the lesson the treespirit was established in the Fruit of Conversion the assembled company also profited by itBut even after the treespirit had obtained the Fruit of Conversion she stood weepingThe Teacher asked her What is the matter treespirit Reverend Sir she replied my home has been destroyed what am I to do now Said the Teacher Enough treespirit be not disturbed I will give you a place of abode With these words he pointed out near the Perfumed Chamber at Jetavana a certain tree from which a treespirit had departed on the preceding day and said In such and such a place is a tree which stands by itself enter thereinAccordingly the treespirit entered into that treeThenceforth because the treespirit had received her place of abode as a gift from the Buddha although spirits of great power approached that tree they were unable to shake itThe Teacher took this occasion to lay down and enjoin upon the monks the observance of the precept regarding the injuring of plants and treesThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana after he had eaten a meal at the house of Uttarā with reference to the female lay disciple UttarāThe story in due sequence is as follows The story goes that there was a poor man in Rājagaha named Puṇṇa who made a living by working for hire for the treasurer SumanaPuṇṇa had a wife and a daughter named Uttarā both of whom were servants in the treasurers householdNow one day they made a proclamation in Rājagaha For seven days let everyone make holiday in RājagahaThe treasurer Sumana heard this proclamation and when Puṇṇa came to him early the following morning he addressed him saying My man our servants want to make holiday will you make holiday or will you work for hirePuṇṇa replied Master a holiday is for the rich I have not even enough rice in my house for tomorrows porridge what business have I making holiday I will take my oxen and go plowVery well take your oxen and go plowSo Puṇṇa took a strong pair of oxen and a plow and went home and said to his wife My dear wife the citizens are making holiday but I am so poor that I shall be obliged to work for hire today when you bring me my meal just cook me twice my usual allowance of rice So saying he went to the fieldOn that very day the Elder Sāriputta arose from a Trance of Cessation which had lasted seven days and considered within himself On whom shall I bestow my blessing today Perceiving that Puṇṇa had entered the Net of his Knowledge he considered further Has he faith and will he be able to entertain me Perceiving that Puṇṇa had faith that he would be able to entertain him and that he would thereby obtain a rich reward the Elder took bowl and robe went to the field where Puṇṇa was plowing took his stand on the bank of a pit and gazed earnestly at a certain bushWhen Puṇṇa saw the Elder he left his plow saluted the Elder with the Five Rests and said to him You must have need of a toothstickAnd preparing a toothstick for the Elder he gave it to himThereupon the Elder drew from under the folds of his robe his bowl and waterstrainer and gave them to PuṇṇaHe must wish some water thought Puṇṇa So taking the waterstrainer he strained water and gave it to the ElderThought the Elder This man lives in the last house of allIf I go to the door of his house his wife will not be able to see metherefore I will wait right here until she sets out on the road with his mealSo the Elder waited right there a little while and when he perceived that she had set out on the road he started off in the direction of the cityThe poor mans wife saw the Elder on the road and thought to herself Once when I had alms to give I did not see the Elder and once again when I saw the Elder I had not alms to giveToday however I not only see the Elder but also have alms to give Will he give me his blessingThereupon she set down the jar of rice saluted the Elder with the Five Rests and said to him Reverend Sir consider not whether this is coarse food or fine food but bestow a blessing on your servantThe Elder held out his bowl The woman held the jar with one hand and with the other hand took the boiled rice out of the jar and gave it to the Elder When she had given him half of the rice the Elder said EnoughSo saying he covered the bowl with his hand Said the woman Reverend Sir one portion cannot be divided into two partsBestow not a blessing on your servant in this present life but bestow a blessing upon her in the life to come I desire to give you all without reserve So saying she emptied all of the rice in the Elders bowl and made the following Earnest Wish May I be a partaker of the Law you have yourself beheldSo be it said the Elder Remaining standing he pronounced the words of thanksgiving Then seating himself in a pleasant place where there was water he ate his mealThe woman turned back sought fresh rice and boiled itPuṇṇa plowed half a karīsa of land and then unable longer to endure hunger he unyoked his oxen and went and sat down in the shade of a certain tree watching the roadAs his wife came along with her husbands meal of boiled rice she saw him and thought to herself There is my husband overcome with hunger sitting beside the road watching for meIf  he upbraids me saying You have tarried too long and strikes me with the handle of his whip that which I have done will go for naughtI will therefore speak first So she said to him Husband have patience today for once and do not bring to naught that which I have doneEarly in the morning I set out to bring you your rice but on the way seeing the Captain of the Faith I gave him your riceHaving so done I went back home and boiled more rice now I have returned Husband be well contentWhat say you wife asked Puṇṇa On hearing her explanation repeated the second time he said to her Wife you did well to give my rice to the noble Elder I also gave him a toothstick and water for rinsing the mouth early this very morning With contented heart rejoicing at the words he had heard weak because he had not eaten since sunrise he laid his head on her lap and fell asleepNow the piece he had plowed early in the morning with its wellbrokenup soil all turned to ruddy gold and was bright as a heap of Kaṇikāra flowersPuṇṇa woke up looked at the piece and said to his wife My dear wife this piece which I plowed looks to me as if it had turned to gold Are my eyes deceiving me just because I have had nothing to eat since early sunriseHusband to me too it looks just the same wayPuṇṇa arose went to the field and taking a lump of earth in his hand he struck the handle of the plow with it whereupon he perceived that it was solid gold Oh he exclaimed this very day is manifested the fruit of the alms given to the noble Captain of the Faith But it will be impossible for us to conceal so much wealth and to make use of it ourselves So he filled with gold the dinnerbasket his wife had brought and going to the royal palace as soon as the king was ready to receive him he entered and paid obeisance to the king What is it my man asked the king Your majesty replied Puṇṇa today all the ground I have plowed stands covered with gold Should not orders be given to haul it to the palaceWho are youPuṇṇa is my nameBut what did you do todayEarly in the morning I gave the Captain of the Faith a toothstick and water for rinsing the mouth likewise my wife gave him the boiled rice which she was bringing to meWhen the king heard this he exclaimed This very day is manifested the fruit of the alms which you gave to the Captain of the Faith Friend what shall I do Send several thousand carts and have the gold hauled to the palaceThe king sent the cartsAs the kings men gathered up the gold they said This is the property of the king Thereupon every particle of gold they took into their hands turned to earth once moreThey went and reported the matter to the kingThe king asked them What did you say when you gathered up the goldYour majesty replied the men we said that the gold was your propertyMy men replied the king who am I Go and say This is the property of Puṇṇa Then gather up the goldThe kings men did as they were told Immediately every particle they took into their hands turned to gold once moreThey hauled all of this gold to the palacecourt and heaped it up in a pile the pile was eighty cubits highThe king ordered the citizens to assemble and asked them Is there anyone in this city who possesses so much gold as thisNo your majesty there is notWhat should be given to himThe treasurers parasol your majestySaid the king Let his name be Treasurer GreatWealth Treasurer Bahudhana So the king gave him the treasurers parasol and bestowed all this great wealth upon himThen said Puṇṇa to the king Your majesty all this time we have lived in other peoples houses give us a place to live inThe king pointed to the site of the former treasurers house and said Well look  you notice a thicket growing over there Have that thicket cleared and a house built for yourself thereIn a few days Puṇṇa built him a house in this place When the house was finished he gave a festival in honor of the opening of the house and a festival in honor of the raising of the parasol simultaneously and for the space of seven days he gave alms to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the BuddhaIn pronouncing the words of thanksgiving the Teacher preached the Law in orderly sequenceAt the conclusion of his discourse the treasurer Puṇṇa and his wife and his daughter Uttarā all three obtained the Fruit of ConversionAfter a time the treasurer of Rājagaha selected the daughter of the treasurer Puṇṇa to be the wife of his own son I will not give her said Puṇṇa Said the treasurer of Rājagaha Do not act in this manner All this time you have dwelt near us nd now you have obtained great wealth and high position Give your daughter to be the wife of my son But Puṇṇa said to himself He is a heretic and my daughter cannot live without the Three Jewels I will not give him my daughterMany noble youths treasurers and accountants and others who held high office sought to persuade him to reconsider his decision saying Do not break off friendly relations with him give him your daughterFinally he accepted their advice and on the day of full moon of the month sāḷhi gave him his daughterFrom the day Uttarā went to the house of her husband she was no longer privileged to approach a monk or a nun or to give alms or to listen to the LawWhen two months and a half had thus passed she asked the womenservants who waited upon her How much of the rainy season still remainsHalf a month your ladyshipSo Uttarā sent the following message to her father Why have they thrown me into such a prison It would be far better to put a brand on me and proclaim me a common wenchthan to give me over to such an unbelieving household as thisFrom the day I first entered this house I have not so much as seen a monk nor have I had the opportunity to perform a single work of meritWhen her father received this message he expressed displeasure saying Oh how unhappy my daughter is And he sent fifteen thousand pieces of money to his daughter together with the following message There is a courtezan in this city named Sirimā who receives a thousand pieces of money a nightWith this money have her brought to your husbands house and install her as your husbands mistress Then you can devote your time to the performance of good worksSo Uttarā caused Sirimā to be summoned to her house and said to her Friend take this money and minister to your friend during the coming fortnightVery well replied Sirimā consenting to the bargainWhen Uttarās husband saw Sirimā he asked What does this mean Uttarā replied Husband during the coming fortnight my friend is to be your mistress For my part during the coming fortnight I desire to give alms and listen to the LawWhen Uttarās husband saw Sirimā beautiful woman that she was desire took possession of him and he immediately consented to the arrangement saying Very well so be itThereupon Uttarā invited the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha saying Reverend Sir during the coming fortnight pray take your meals right here and go nowhere else On obtaining the Teachers consent she rejoiced at heart and said to herself From this day forth until the Great Terminal Festival I shall have the privilege of waiting on the Teacher and listening to the Law And she bustled about the kitchen making the necessary arrangements saying Cook the porridge thus cook the cakes thusTomorrow will be the Terminal Festival thought her husband as he stood at his window looking towards the kitchen What is that foolish woman doing When he saw her going to and fro arranging for the feast her body moist with sweat and sprinkled with ashes and smeared with charcoal and soot he thought to himself Ah in such a place the fool does not enjoy luxury and comfort I will minister to the shaveling monklings thinks she and her heart rejoices as she goes about He laughed and left the windowAs he left the window Sirimā who stood near him thought to herself What did he see to make him laugh Looking out of the same window she saw Uttarā It was because he saw her that he laughed thought Sirimā doubtless an intimacy exists between themSirimā immediately conceived hatred towards Uttarā and said to herself Ill make her suffer So descending from the palaceterrace she entered the kitchen and going to the place where the cakes were being fried she took some boiling ghee in a spoon and advanced towards UttarāUttarā saw her advancing and said My friend has done me a great service This world may be narrow and the World of Brahmā low but the goodness of my friend is great indeedin that through her assistance I have received the privilege of giving alms and listening to the LawIf I cherish anger towards her may this ghee burn meIf not may it not burn me So saying she suffused her enemy with the sentiment of loveWhen Sirimā flung the boiling ghee on her head it felt like cold waterThe next spoonful will feel cool said Sirimā And filling the spoon again she advanced towards Uttarā with the second spoonful of boiling ghee in her handWhen Uttarās servingwomen saw her they tried to frighten her away crying out Begone miscreant What right have you to fling boiling ghee on the head of our mistress And springing to their feet in every part of the kitchen they beat her with their fists and kicked her with their feet and flung her to the groundUttarā although she strove to stop them was unable to do soFinally she stood over Sirimā pushed all of her servingwomen away and admonished Sirimā saying Why did you do so wicked a deed So saying she bathed her with hot water and anointed her with oil a hundred times refinedshe pushed them all away when they strove to belabor me and then did for me all that could possibly be doneAt that moment Sirimā realized that she was but a concubine And straightway she thought to herself It was indeed a most wicked deed I committed when I flung boiling ghee on the head of this woman merely because my master laughed at her As for this woman instead of ordering her servingwomen to seize meIf I do not ask her to pardon me my head is likely to split into seven pieces And forthwith Sirimā fell at the feet of Uttarā and said to her Pardon me my ladyUttarā replied I am a daughter and my father is living If my father pardons you I will also pardon youVery well my lady I will also ask pardon of your father the treasurer PuṇṇaPuṇṇa is my father in the round of birth and rebirth If my father in that state where there is no round of birth and rebirth will pardon you then will I also pardon youBut who is your father in that state where there is no round of birth and rebirthThe Buddha the Supremely EnlightenedI put no confidence in himI will cause you to do so Tomorrow the Teacher will come here with his retinue of monks obtain such offerings as you can and come right here and ask his pardonVery well my lady replied Sirimā And rising from her seat she went home and gave orders to the five hundred women of her retinue to put themselves in readiness to accompany her Then she procured various kinds of hard foods and sauces and on the following day taking these offerings with her she went to Uttarās house Not daring to place her offerings in the bowls of the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha she stood waitingUttarā took all of her offerings and made the proper disposal of themand at the conclusion of the meal Sirimā together with her retinue prostrated herself at the Teachers feetand at the conclusion of the meal Sirimā together with her retinue prostrated herself at the Teachers feetReverend Sir yesterday I did this and that But my friend only made her servingwomen stop beating me and could not do enough to befriend meRecognizing her goodness I asked her to pardon me But she said to me If the Teacher will pardon you I also will pardon you Uttarā is this trueYes Reverend Sir My friend flung boiling ghee on my headWhat thoughts did you then entertainReverend Sir I suffused her with love thinking to myself This world may be narrow and the World of Brahmā low but the goodness of my friend is great indeedin that through her assistance I have received the privilege of giving alms and listening to the LawIf I cherish anger towards her may this ghee burn me If not may it not burn me Said the Teacher Well done well done Uttarā That is the right way to overcome angerAnger should be overcome with kindness He that utters abuse and slander may be overcome by him who refrains from uttering abuse and slander An obstinate miser may be overcome by the giving of ones own A speaker of lies may be overcome by speaking the truth So saying he pronounced the following StanzaOne should overcome anger with kindnessOne should overcome evil with goodOne should overcome the niggard with gifts And the speaker of falsehood with truthThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder Moggallāna the GreatThe spirit straightway approached the Elder saluted him and took his stand before him Thereupon the Elder said to him Spirit you possess great glory what did you do to get itOh Reverend Sir do not ask meThe Elder repeated his question saying Please tell me Finally the spirit said Reverend Sir I neither gave alms nor rendered honor nor listened to the Law all that I did was to tell the truthThe Elderstopped at the doors of other mansions also and put the same question to one after another of the female spirits who approached himThey likewise strove to conceal the works of merit which they had performed but likewise failed to put off the Elder One of them said Reverend Sir as for almsgiving and the other duties of religion I did nothing But in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa I was the slave of a certain man who was excessively harsh and cruel He thought nothing of seizing a stick or a staff and striking off a persons headBut when angry thoughts arose within me I would rebuke myself saying He is your master and has power to make public proclamation concerning you or to cut off your nose or other members therefore be not angryThus would I rebuke myself and restrain my angry thoughts by so doing I attained this gloryAnother said Reverend Sir while I was guarding a field of sugarcane I gave a stalk of sugarcane to a certain monkAnother said I gave a timbarūsakaAnother said I gave an elāḷukaAnother said I gave a phārusakaAnother said I gave a handful of radishesAnother said I gave a handful of nimbfruit In such terms did each mention the slight gift which each had made All concluded as follows By these means did we obtain this gloryAfter listening to the recital of their former deeds of merit the Elder approached the Teacher and asked him Reverend Sir is it possible to obtain heavenly glory merely by telling the truth or restraining ones angry thoughts or giving a timbarūsaka and the likeMoggallāna why do you ask me Did not the female spirits explain the whole matter to youYes Reverend Sir I am convinced that by such slight acts as these heavenly glory may be gainedThen the Teacher said to him Moggallāna merely by telling the truth merely by putting away anger merely by giving a slight gift men may attain the heavenly world So saying he pronounced the following StanzaA man should speak the truth a man should not get angryA man should give when asked to give a little By these three acts a man may attain the World of the GodsThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Añjanavana near Sāketa with reference to a question asked by the monksThe story goes that once upon a time as the Exalted One accompanied by the Congregation of Monks was entering Sāketa for alms a certain old Brahman who lived in Sāketa passed out of the city and seeing the Possessor of the Ten Forces entering within the gate fell down before his feet and grasping him firmly by the ankles said to him Dear son is it not the duty of sons to care for their mother and father when they have grown old Why is it that for so long a time you have not shown yourself to usThis is the first time I have seen you Come look upon your mother And taking the Teacher with him he escorted him into his houseWhen the Teacher had entered the house he sat down on the seat prepared for him together with the Congregation of MonksThe Brahmans wife also approached the Teacher and falling before his feet said Dear son where have you been all this time Ought not mothers and fathers to be cared for when they have grown old And she directed her sons and daughters to salute the Teacher saying Go salute your brotherDelighted at heart the Brahman and his wife offered food to the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha saying Reverend Sir take all of your meals right here The Teacher replied The Buddhas never take their meals regularly in the same place Then said the Brahman and his wife Well then Reverend Sir be good enough to send to us all those who come to you and invite you to be their guestFrom that time forward the Teacher sent to the Brahman and his wife all those who came to him with an invitation to be their guest saying Go tell the BrahmanSuch persons would then go and say to the Brahman We would invite the Teacher for tomorrowand the Brahman on the following day would take from his own house jars of boiled rice and jars of curries and go to the place where the Teacher satIn case the Teacher was invited nowhere else he always took his meal in the house of the BrahmanBoth the Brahman and his wife gave alms regularly to the Tathāgata listened to the Law and in the course of time obtained the Fruit of the Third PathThe monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth Brethren the Brahman knows perfectly well that the Tathāgatas father is Suddhodana and that his mother is Mahāmāyā But although he knows this both he and his wife address the Tathāgata as our son and the Teacher acquiesces in this form of addresspray what can be the explanation of thisThe Teacher overheard their talk and said Monks both the Brahman and his wife are addressing their own son when they say to me Our son  Having said this he related the following Story of the PastMonks in times past this Brahman was my father for five hundred successive existences my uncle for five hundred existences and my grandfather for five hundred existenceslikewise the Brahmans wife was my mother for five hundred existences my aunt for five hundred existences and my grandmother for five hundred existencesThus I was brought up by this Brahman during fifteen hundred states of existence and by the wife of this Brahman during fifteen hundred states of existence Having thus explained that he had been their son during three thousand states of existence he pronounced the following StanzasThat old love springs up again like the lotus in the waterThrough previous association or present advantageIf the mind rests satisfied and the heart reposes confidence in a manOne may repose confidence in that man though it be the first time one has seen himFor the entire period of three months during which the Teacher kept residence he resorted only to that family for his mealsand at the end of the three months they experienced Arahatship and passed into NibbānaMen rendered high honors to their bodies placed both bodies on one hearse and carried them outThe Teacher surrounded by a retinue of five hundred monks accompanied the bodies to the burninggroundHearing the report They were the mother and father of the Buddhas a great multitude went forth from the cityThe Teacher entered a certain hall near the burningground and remained thereinMen saluted the Teacher saying to him Reverend Sir do not grieve because your mother and father are dead and held sweet converse with himInstead of repulsing them by saying Speak not thus the Teacher surveyed the thoughts of the company and preaching the Law with reference to that particular occasionShort indeed is this lifeeven before a hundred years have passed one diesIf one lives longerthen he dies of old ageThe monks not knowing that the Brahman and his wife had passed into Nibbāna asked the Teacher Reverend Sir what will be their future stateThe Teacher replied Monks in the case of such as they Arahats and sages there is no future stateSuch as they attain the Eternal the Deathless Great Nibbāna So saying he pronounced the following StanzaThey who do no injury the sages they who ever control their bodiesSuch go to a place from which they pass no more and having gone there sorrow notFriend for seven days after going forth I ate the countrys almsfood as a debtor on the eighth day final knowledge aroseThen Acela Kassapa said I would receive the going forth in this Dhamma and Discipline I would receive the full admissionAnd soon not long after his full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Kassapa by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence on Mount Vulture Peak with reference to Puṇṇā a female slave of the treasurer of RājagahaThe story goes that one day they gave her much rice to poundShe pounded away until late at night lighting a lamp to work by finally she became very weary and in order to rest herself stepped outside and stood in the wind with her body moist with sweatNow at that time Dabba the Malla was steward of lodgings for the monksHaving listened to the Law that he might show the monks the way to their respective lodgings he lighted his finger and preceding the monks created by supernatural power a light for themThe light enabled Puṇṇā to see the monks making their way along the mountain She thought to herself As for me I am oppressed by my own discomfort and so even at this time am unable to sleep Why is it that the reverend monks are unable to sleep Having considered the matter she came to the following conclusion It must be that some monk who resides there is sick or else is suffering from the bite of some reptile So when it was dawn she took some ricedust placed it in the palm of her hand moistened it with water and having thus mixed a cake cooked it over a bed of charcoal Then saying to herself I will eat it on the road leading to the bathingplace on the river she placed the cake in a fold of her dress and taking a waterpot in her hand set out for the bathingplace on the riverThe Teacher set out on the same path intending likewise to enter that village for almsWhen Puṇṇā saw the Teacher she thought to herself On other days when I have seen the Teacher I have had no alms to give him or if I have had alms to give him I have not seen him today however not only do I meet the Teacher face to face but I have alms to give himIf he would accept this cake without considering whether the food is of inferior or superior quality I would give it to him So setting her waterpot down on one side she saluted the Teacher and said to him Reverend Sir accept this coarse food and bestow your blessing upon meThe Teacher looked at Elder nanda whereupon the Elder drew from under a fold of his robe and presented to the Teacher a bowl which was an offering to the Teacher from a great kingThe Teacher held out the bowl and received therein the offering of the cake When Puṇṇā had placed the cake in the Teachers bowl she saluted him with the Five Rests and said to him Reverend Sir may the Truth which you have beheld be of avail to me alsohe Teacher replied So be it And remaining standing as before he pronounced the words of thanksgivingThereupon Puṇṇā thought to herself Although the Teacher bestowed on me a blessing as he took my cake yet he will not eat it himselfHe will doubtless keep it until he has gone a little way and will then give it to a crow or a dog Then he will go to the house of some king or prince and make a meal of choice foodThought the Teacher to himself What was the thought in the mind of this woman Perceiving what was in her mind the Teacher looked at Elder nanda and intimated that he wished to sit downThe Elder spread out a robe and offered the Teacher a seatThe Teacher sat down without the city and ate his breakfastThe deities squeezed out nectar food proper to gods and men alike throughout the circle of the worlds even as one squeezes a honeycomb and imparted it to the Teachers foodPuṇṇā stood looking onAt the conclusion of the Teachers breakfast the Elder gave him waterWhen the Teacher had finished his breakfast he addressed Puṇṇā and said Puṇṇā why have you blamed my disciplesI do not blame your disciples Reverend SirThen what did you say when you saw my disciplesReverend Sir the explanation is very simple I thought to myself As for me I am oppressed by my own discomfort and so am unable to sleep why is it that the reverend monks are unable to sleep It must be that some monk who resides there is sick or else is suffering from the bite of some reptile The Teacher listened to her words and then said to her Puṇṇā in your own case it is because you are afflicted with discomfort that you are unable to sleep But my disciples are assiduously watchful and therefore sleep not So saying he pronounced the following StanzaThey that are ever watchful they that study both by day and by nightThey that strive after Nibbāna such men rid themselves of the evil passionsAt the conclusion of the lesson Puṇṇā even as she stood there was established in the Fruit of Conversion the assembled company also profited by the lessonThe Teacher having made a meal of the cake which Puṇṇā made of riceflour and cooked over a bed of coals returned to the monasteryThereupon the monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth Brethren how hard it must have been for the Supremely Enlightened One to make his breakfast of the cake of riceflour which Puṇṇā cooked over a bed of coals and gave himAt that moment the Teacher drew near and asked them Monks what are you discussing now as you sit here all gathered together When they told him he said Monks this is not the first time I have eaten redricepowder which she gave me the same thing happened to me in a previous state of existence also So saying he recited the following StanzasYou used to eat leavings of grass you used to eat scum of redricegruelSuch was your food in days gone by why do you not eat your food todayWhere they know not a body by birth or trainingThere Great Brahmā the scum of redricegruel will sufficeBut you know full well that I am a horse of noblest breedI know my breed it is because of my breed that I will not eat your redricegruelAnd the Teacher related this Kuṇḍakasindhavapotaka Jātaka in detailThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the lay disciple AtulaFor Atula was a lay disciple who lived at Sāvatthi and he had a retinue of five hundred other lay disciples One day he took those lay disciples with him to the monastery to hear the Law Desiring to hear Elder Revata preach the Law he saluted Elder Revata and sat down respectfully on one sideNow this Venerable Elder Revata was a solitary recluse delighting in solitude even as a lion delights in solitude wherefore he had nothing to say to AtulaThis Elder has nothing to say thought Atula Provoked he arose from his seat went to Elder Sāriputta and took his stand respectfully on one side For what reason have you come to me asked Elder Sāriputta Reverend Sir replied Atula I took these lay disciples of mine to hear the Law and approached Elder Revata But he had nothing to say to me therefore I was provoked at him and have come here Preach the Law to meWell then lay disciple said the Elder Sāriputta sit down And forthwith Elder Sāriputta expounded the Abhidhamma at great lengthThought the lay disciple Abhidhamma is exceedingly abstruse and the Elder has expounded this alone to me at great length of what use is he to us Provoked he took his retinue with him and went to Elder nandaDriven with great speed by the men concealed within its bellySaid Elder nanda What is it lay disciple Atula replied Reverend Sir we approached Elder Revata for the purpose of hearing the Law and got not so much as a syllable from him Provoked at this we went to Elder Sāriputta and he expounded to us at great length Abhidhamma alone with all its subtleties Of what use is he to us thought we to ourselves and provoked at him also we came here Preach the Law to us Reverend SirOn and on sped the horse galloping so rapidly that by degrees the army of the king was left far behindWell then replied Elder nanda sit down and listen Thereupon Elder nanda expounded the Law to them very briefly and making it very easy for them to understandBut they were provoked at the Elder nanda also and going to the Teacher saluted him and sat down respectfully on one side Said the Teacher to them Lay disciples why have you come hereTo hear the Law Reverend SirBut you have heard the LawReverend Sir first we went to Elder Revata and he had nothing to say to us provoked at him we approached Elder Sāriputta and he expounded the Abhidhamma to us at great length but we were unable to understand his discourse and provoked at him approached the Elder nanda Elder nanda however expounded the Law to us very briefly wherefore we were provoked at him also and came hereThe Teacher heard them say their say and then replied Atula from days of yore until now it has been the invariable practice of men to blame him who said nothing him who said much and him who said littleThere is no one who deserves unqualified blame and no one who deserves unqualified praiseEven kings are blamed by some and praised by othersEven the great earth even the sun and moon even a Supremely Enlightened Buddha sitting and speaking in the midst of the Fourfold Assembly some blame and others praiseFor blame or praise bestowed by utter simpletons is a matter of no account But he whom a man of learning and intelligence blames or praises  he is blamed or praised indeed So saying he pronounced the following StanzasThis is an old old saying Atula this is no mere saying of todayThey blame him who sits silent they blame him who says muchThey also blame him who says little There is no one in the world that is not blamedThere never was there never will be there lives not nowA man who receives unqualified blame or unqualified praiseIf men of intelligence always from day to day praiseSome man as free from flaws wise endowed with learning and goodness Who would venture to find fault with such a man any more than with a coin made of gold of the Jambu riverEven the gods praise such a man even by Brahmā is he praisedThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to the monks of the Band of SixFor one day the monks of the Band of Six put wooden shoes on their feet and taking staves of wood in their two hands walked up and down on the surface of a flat rock The Teacher hearing the clatter asked Elder nanda nanda what is that noise The Elder replied The monks of the Band of Six are walking about in wooden shoes they are making the clatter you hear When the Teacher heard this he promulgated the following precept A monk should control his deeds his words and his thoughts So saying he expounded the Law by pronouncing the following StanzasAngry deeds should one control one should be restrained in actionOne should renounce evil deeds one should do good deedsAngry words should one control one should be restrained in wordOne should renounce evil words one should speak good wordsAngry thoughts should one control one should be restrained in thoughtOne should renounce evil thoughts one should cultivate good thoughtsWise men who control their deeds wise men who control their speechWise men who control their thoughts such men are indeed well controlledThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain killer of cowsAt Sāvatthi so we are told lived a certain killer of cows He would kill cows select the choicest portions of their flesh for his own table cause the same to be cooked and then sit down with son and wife and eat the same the rest he sold for a priceFor fiftyfive years he kept up this practice of killing cows During all this time although the Teacher resided at a neighboring monastery on no occasion did he give the Teacher so much as a spoonful of ricegruel or boiled rice by way of almsUnless he had meat to eat he never ate ricerecited the Jarā Sutta as One day while it was still light after selling some beef he gave his wife a piece of beef to cook for his supper and then went to the pool to batheWhile he was absent a friend of his came to the house and said to his wife Let me have a little of the beef which your husband has for sale a guest has come to my houseWe have no beef for sale Your friend has sold all his beef and has gone to the pool to batheDo not refuse my request if you have a piece of beef in the house give it to meThere is not a piece of beef in the house except a piece which your friend has set aside for his own supperThought the friend of the cowkiller If there is not a piece of beef in the house except a piece which my friend has set aside for his own supper and if he will not eat unless he can have meat to eat he will certainly not give me this piece of beef So he took the piece of beef himself and went off with itAfter the cowkiller had bathed he returned home When his wife set before him rice which she had boiled for him seasoned with leaves of her own cooking he said to her Where is the meatHusband there is noneDid I not give you meat to cook before I left the houseA friend of yours came to the house and said to me A guest has come to my house let me have a little of the beef which you have for sale I said to him There is not a piece of beef in the house except a piece which your friend has set aside for his own supper and he will not eat unless he can have meat to eat But in spite of what I said to him he took the piece of beef himself and went off with itUnless I have meat to eat with it I will not eat rice take it awayWhat is to be done husband Pray eat the riceThat I will not Having caused his wife to remove the rice he took a knife in his hand and left the house Now an ox was tethered in the rear of his house The man went up to the ox thrust his hand into the mouth of the ox jerked out his tongue cut it off at the root with his knife and returned to the house with it Having had it cooked on a bed of coals he placed it on the boiled rice and sat down to eat his supper He first ate a mouthful of rice and then placed a piece of meat in his mouthThat very moment his own tongue was cleft in twain and fell out of his mouth into the dish of riceThat very moment he received retribution similar in kind to the sin which he had committedWith a stream of blood flowing from his mouth he entered the court of his house and crawled about on his hands and knees bellowing just like an oxAt this time the cowkillers son stood close by watching his fatherHis mother said to him Son behold this cowkiller crawling about the court of the house on his hands and knees bellowing like an ox This punishment is likely to fall upon your own head Pay no attention to me but seek safety in flightThe son terrified by the fear of death bade farewell to his mother and fledHaving made good his escape he went to TakkasilāAs for the cowkiller after he had crawled about the court of the house for a time bellowing like an ox he died and was reborn in the Avīci HellThe ox also diedHaving gone to Takkasilā the cowkillers son became apprenticed to a goldsmithOne day his master as he set out for the village said to him You are to make such and such an ornamentSo saying his master departedThe apprentice made the ornament according to the directions he receivedhen his master returned and looked at the ornament he thought to himself No matter where this youth may go he will be able to earn his living anywhereSo when the apprentice came of age the goldsmith gave him his daughter in marriageHe increased with sons and daughters When his sons came of age they acquired the various arts and subsequently going to Sāvatthi to live established households of their own and became faithful followers of the BuddhaTheir father remained in Takkasilā spent his days without performing a single work of merit nd finally reached old ageHis sons thought to themselves Our father is now an old man and sent for him to come and live with them Then they thought to themselves Let us give alms in behalf of our father Accordingly they invited the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha to take a meal with themOn the following day they provided seats in their house for the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha served them with food showing them every attention and at the conclusion of the meal said to the Teacher Reverend Sir this food which we have presented to you is the food whereby our father lives render thanks therefor to our fatherThe Teacher thereupon addressed him and said Lay disciple you are an old man Your body has ripened and is like a withered leaf You have no good works to serve as provisions for the journey to the world beyond Make for yourself a refuge Be wise be not a simpleton Thus spoke the Teacher pronouncing the words of thanksgiving and having thus spoken pronounced the following StanzasNow art thou as a withered leafdeaths messengers await theeThou standest at the point of departurethou hast no provisions for the journeyMake for thyself an islandhaste thee to struggle be wiseWhen thy infirmities have been blown away and thou hast freed thyself from the evil passionsthou shalt go to the heavenly place of the ElectAt the conclusion of the lesson the lay disciple was established in the Fruit of Conversion the assembled company also profited by the lessonThey invited the Teacher also for the following day and gave alms to him When the Teacher had finished his meal and it was time for him to pronounce the words of thanksgiving they said to him Reverend Sir this food which we have presented to you is the food whereby our father lives render thanks therefor to him aloneSo the Teacher thanked him pronouncing the two following StanzasThy life is now brought to a closethou art come into the presence of DeathThou hast no abidingplace by the waythou hast no provisions for the journeyMake for thyself an islandhaste thee to struggle be wiseWhen thy infirmities have been blown away and thou hast freed thyself from the evil passionsthou shalt no more come unto birth and old ageThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain BrahmanThe story goes that early one morning this Brahman went out of the city stopped at the place where the monks put on their robes and stood and watched them as they put on their robesNow this place was thickly overgrown with grassAs one of the monks put on his robe the skirt of the robe dragged through the grass and became wet with drops of dewThought the Brahman The grass should be cleared away from this place So on the following day he took his mattock went thither cleared the place and made it as clean and smooth as a threshingfloorThe day after he went to that place again As the monks put on their robes he observed that the skirt of the robe of one of the monks dropped to the ground and dragged in the dust Thought the Brahman Sand should be sprinkled here So he brought sand and sprinkled it on the groundNow one day before breakfast the heat was intense On this occasion he noticed that as the monks put on their robes sweat poured from their bodies Thought the Brahman Here I ought to cause a pavilion to be erected Accordingly he caused a pavilion to be erectedAgain one day early in the morning it rainedOn this occasion also as the Brahman watched the monks he noticed that their robes were wetted by the drops of rain Thought the Brahman Here I ought to cause a hall to be erected So there he caused a hall to be erected When the hall was finished he thought to himself Now I will hold a festival in honor of the completion of the hall Accordingly he invited the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha seated the monks within and without the hall and gave almsAt the conclusion of the meal he took the Teachers bowl to permit him to pronounce the words of thanksgiving Reverend Sir said he as I stood in this place when the monks were putting on their robes and watched them I saw this and that and I did this and that And beginning at the beginning he told the Teacher the whole storyThe Teacher listened to his words and then said Brahman a wise man by doing good works time after time little by little gradually removes the stains of his own evil deeds So saying he pronounced the following StanzaOne after another little by little time after time a wise manShould blow away his own impurities even as a smith blows away the impurities of silverThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a monk named Elder TissaThe story goes that a certain youth of respectable family who lived at Sāvatthi retired from the world became a monk and made his full profession becoming known as Elder TissaSubsequently while he was in residence at a monastery in the country he received a coarse cloth eight cubits in length Having completed residence he celebrated the Terminal Festival and taking his cloth with him went home and placed it in the hands of his sisterThought his sister This robecloth is not suited to my brother So with a sharp knife she cut it into strips pounded them in a mortar whipped and beat and cleaned the shoddy and spinning fine yarn had it woven into a robeclothThe Elder procured thread and needles and assembling some young monks and novices who were skilled makers of robes went to his sister and said Give me that cloth I will have a robe made out of itShe took down a robecloth nine cubits in length and placed it in the hands of her youngest brotherHe took it spread it out and said My robecloth was a coarse one eight cubits long but this is a fine one nine cubits longThis is not mine it is yours I dont want it Give me the same one I gave youReverend Sir this cloth is yours take itHe refused to do soThen his sister told him everything she had done and gave him the cloth again saying Reverend Sir this one is yours take itFinally he took it went to the monastery and set the robemakers to workHis sister prepared ricegruel boiled rice and other provisions for the robemakersand on the day when the cloak was finished gave them an extra allowanceTissa looked at the robe and took a liking to it Said he Tomorrow I will wear this robe as an upper garment So he folded it and laid it on the bamboo rack During the night unable to digest the food he had eaten he died and was reborn as a louse in that very robeWhen his sister learned that he was dead she flung herself at the feet of the monks rolled on the ground and weptWhen the monks had performed the funeral rites over his body they saidSince there was no one to attend him in his sickness this robe belongs to the Congregation of Monks let us divide it among usThereupon that louse screamed These monks are plundering my property And thus screaming he ran this way and thatThe Teacher even as he sat in the Perfumed Chamber heard that sound by Supernatural Audition and said to Elder nanda nanda tell them to lay aside Tissas robe for seven daysThe Elder caused this to be doneAt the end of seven days that louse died and was reborn in the Abode of the Tusita godsOn the eighth day the Teacher issued the following order Let the monks now divide Tissas robe and take their several portionsThe monks did soHaving so done the monks began the following discussion Why was it that the Teacher caused Tissas robe to be put aside for seven days and on the eighth day permitted us to divide it among us and take our several portionsThe Teacher approached and asked Monks what are you discussing now as you sit here all gathered together When they told him he said Monks Tissa was reborn as a louse in his own robe When you set about to divide the robe among you he screamed They are plundering my propertyAnd thus screaming he ran this way and that Had you taken his robe he would have cherished a grudge against you and because of this sin would have been reborn in Hell That is the reason why I directed that the robe should be laid asideBut now he has been reborn in the Abode of the Tusita gods and for this reason I have permitted you to take the robe and divide it among you Again said the monks Reverend Sir a grievous matter indeed is this thing which is called Craving Yes monks replied the Teacher Craving is indeed a grievous matter among living beings here in the worldEven as rust which springs from iron eats away the iron and corrodes it and renders it useless so also this thing which is called Craving when it arises among living beings here in the world causes these same living beings to be reborn in Hell and plunges them to ruin So saying the Teacher pronounced the following StanzaEven as rust which springs from ironno sooner appears than it eats away the ironPrecisely so in the case of transgressorstheir own evil deeds bring them to an evil endThen seated in the midst of the Sangha of bhikkhus the venerable Bakkula attained final NibbanaThat seated in the midst of the Sangha of bhikkhus the venerable Bakkula attained final Nibbana  this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the venerable Bakkullaever having cut a robe with a cutterthis too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the venerable Bakkulaever having entered upon residence for the Rains in a resting place inside a villageTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodhas ParkThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Kapilavatthu for almsNow on that occasion there were many resting places prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyans dwellingDo many bhikkhus live thereNow on that occasion the venerable Ananda along with many bhikkhus was busy making robes at Ghata the Sakyans dwellingThen when it was evening the Blessed One rose from retreat and went to Ghata the Sakyans dwelling There he sat down on a seat made readyDo many bhikkhus live thereVenerable sir many resting places have been prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyans dwellingMany bhikkhus are living thereThis is our time for making robes venerable sirAnanda a bhikkhu does not shine by delighting in company by taking delight in company by devoting himself to delight in company by delighting in society by taking delight in society by rejoicing in societyIndeed Ananda it is not possible that a bhikkhu who delights in company takes delight in company and devotes himself to delight in company who delights in society takes delight in society and rejoices in society will ever obtain at will without trouble or difficulty the bliss of renunciation the bliss of seclusion the bliss of peace the bliss of enlightenmentBut it can be expected that when a bhikkhu lives alone withdrawn from society he will obtain at will without trouble or difficulty the bliss of renunciation the bliss of seclusion the bliss of peace the bliss of enlightenmentIndeed Ananda it is not possible that a bhikkhu who delights in company takes delight in company and devotes himself to delight in company who delights in society takes delight in society and rejoices in society will ever enter upon and abide in either the deliverance of mind that is temporary and delectable or in the deliverance of mind that is perpetual and unshakeableI do not see even a single kind of form Ananda from the change and alteration of which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in one who lusts for it and takes delight in itHowever Ananda there is this abiding discovered by the Tathagata to enter and abide in voidness internally by giving no attention to all signsTherefore Ananda if a bhikkhu should wish May I enter upon and abide in voidness internally he should steady his mind internally quiet it bring it to singleness and concentrate itAnd how does he steady his mind internally quiet it bring it to singleness and concentrate itHere Ananda quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana the second jhanathe third jhanathe fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThen he gives attention to voidness internallyWhile he is giving attention to voidness internally his mind does not enter into voidness internally or acquire confidence steadiness and decisionWhen that is so he understands thus While I am giving attention to voidness internally my mind does not enter into voidness

beforeWhile he is giving attention to voidness internally his mind enters into voidness internally and acquires confidence steadiness and decisionWhen that is so he understands thus While I am giving

grief will beset meIn this way he has full awareness of thatAnd when a bhikkhu abides thus if his mind inclines to standing he standsIn this way he has full awareness of thatWhen a bhikkhu abides thus if his mind inclines to talking he resolves Such talk as is low vulgar coarse ignoble unbeneficial and which does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and Nibbana that is talk of kings robbers ministers armies dangers battles food drink clothing beds garlands perfumes relatives vehicles villages towns cities countries women heroes streets wells the dead trivialities the origin of the world the origin of the sea whether things are so or are not so such talk I shall not utterIn this way he has full awareness of thatBut he resolves Such talk as

thoughts of nonill will and thoughts of noncruelty such thoughts I shall thinkIn this way he has full awareness of thatAnanda there are these five cords of sensual pleasureForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the earOdours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongue Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust These are the five cords of sensual pleasure  Herein a bhikkhu should constantly review his own mind thus Does any mental excitement concerning these five cords of sensual pleasure ever arise in me on any occasionIf on reviewing his mind the bhikkhu understands Mental excitement concerning these five cords of sensual pleasure does arise in me on certain occasions then he understands Desire and lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure are unabandoned in meIn this way he has full awareness of thatBut if on reviewing his mind the bhikkhu understands No mental excitement concerning these five cords of sensual pleasure arises in me on any occasion then he understands Desire and lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure are abandoned in meIn this way he has full awareness of thatAnanda there are these five aggregates affected by clinging in regard to which a bhikkhu should abide contemplating rise and fall thus Such is material form such its arising such its disappearance such is feeling such its arising such its disappearance such is perception such its arising such its disappearance such are formations such their arising such their disappearance such is consciousness such its arising such its disappearanceWhen he abides contemplating rise and fall in these five aggregates affected by clinging the conceit I am based on these five aggregates affected by clinging is abandoned in himWhen that is so that bhikkhu understands The conceit I am based on these five aggregates affected by clinging is abandoned in meIn that way he has full awareness of thatThese states have an entirely wholesome basis they are noble supramundane and inaccessible to the Evil OneWhat do you think Ananda What good does a disciple see that he should seek the Teachers company even if he is told to go awayVenerable sir our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One guided by the Blessed One have the Blessed One as their resortIt would be good if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these wordsHaving heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember itAnanda a disciple should not seek the Teachers company for the sake of discourses stanzas and expositionsWhy is thatFor a long time Ananda you have learned the teachings remembered them recited them verbally examined them with the mind and penetrated them well by viewBut such talk as deals with effacement as favours the minds release and which leads to complete disenchantment dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and Nibbana that is talk on wanting little on contentment seclusion aloofness from society arousing energy virtue concentration wisdom deliverance knowledge and vision of deliverance for the sake of such talk a disciple should seek the Teachers company even if he is told to go awaySince this is so Ananda a teachers undoing may come about a pupils undoing may come about and the undoing of one who lives the holy life may come aboutHere some teacher resorts to a secluded resting place the forest the root of a tree a mountain a ravine a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle thicket an open space a heap of strawWhile he lives thus withdrawn brahmins and householders from town and country visit himThis teacher is said to be undone by the teachers undoingHe has been struck down by evil unwholesome states that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and deathThis is how the teachers undoing comes aboutAnd how does a pupils undoing come aboutA pupil of that teacher emulating the teachers seclusion resorts to a secluded resting place the foresta heap of strawWhile he lives thus withdrawn brahmins and householders from town and country visit himThis pupil is said to be undone by the pupils undoingHe has been struck down by evil unwholesome states that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and deathThis is how the pupils undoing comes aboutAnd how does the undoing of one who lives the holy life come aboutHere a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished and fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedHe resorts to a secluded resting place the foresta heap of strawWhile he lives thus withdrawn brahmins and householders from town and country visit himBut a disciple of this teacher emulating his teachers seclusion resorts to a secluded resting place the foresta heap of strawWhile he lives thus withdrawn brahmins and householders from town and country visit himThis one who lives the holy life is said to be undone by the undoing of one who lives the holy lifeHe has been struck down by evil unwholesome states that defile bring renewal of being give trouble ripen in suffering and lead to future birth ageing and deathThus there comes to be the undoing of one who leads the holy lifeAnd herein Ananda the undoing of one who leads the holy life has a more painful result a more bitter result than the teachers undoing or the pupils undoing and it even leads to perditionThat will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeAnd how do disciples behave towards the Teacher with hostility not with friendlinessHere Ananda compassionate and seeking their welfare the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion This is for your welfare this is for your happinessHis disciples do not want to hear or give ear or exert their minds to understand they err and turn aside from the Teachers DispensationThus do disciples behave towards the Teacher with hostility not with friendlinessAnd how do disciples behave towards the Teacher with friendliness not with hostilityHere Ananda compassionate and seeking their welfare the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion This is for your welfare this is for your happinessHis disciples want to hear and give ear and exert their minds to understand they do not err and turn aside from the Teachers DispensationThus do disciples behave towards the Teacher with friendliness not with hostilityTherefore Ananda behave towards me with friendliness not with hostilityThat will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long timeI shall not treat you as the potter treats the raw damp clayRepeatedly restraining you I shall speak to you Ananda Repeatedly admonishing you I shall speak to you AnandaThe sound core will stand the testThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsWhen he had wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went for his daytime abiding to the dwelling of Kalakhemaka the SakyanWhen the Blessed One saw thishe thought There are many resting places prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyans dwellingand asked the venerable Ananda Ananda there are many resting places prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyans dwellingBut it can be expected that when a bhikkhu lives alone withdrawn from society he will enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind that is temporary and delectable or in the deliverance of mind that is perpetual and unshakeableIf while the Tathagata is abiding thus he is visited by bhikkhus or bhikkhunls by men or women lay followers by kings or kings ministers by other sectarians or their disciplesthen with a mind leaning to seclusion tending and inclining to seclusion withdrawn delighting in renunciation and altogether done with things that are the basis for taints he invariably talks to them in a way concerned with dismissing themThat is how a bhikkhu steadies his mind internally quiets it brings it to singleness and concentrates itWhile he is giving attention to imperturbability his mind does not enter into imperturbability or acquire confidence steadiness and decisionThen he gives attention to voidness internallyBulls first and treesThis story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about sixteen wonderful dreamsFor in the last watch of one night the King of Kosala who had been asleep all the night dreamed sixteen great dreams and woke up in great fright and alarm as to what they might portend for him So strong was the fear of death upon him that he could not stir but lay there huddled up on his bedNow when the night grew light his brahmins and chaplains came to him and with due obeisance asked whether his majesty had slept wellHow could I sleep well my directors answered the king For just at daybreak I dreamed sixteen wonderful dreams and I have been in terror ever since Tell me my directors what it all meansWe shall be able to judge on hearing them Then the king told them his dreams and asked what those visions would entail upon himThe brahmins fell awringing their handsWhy wring your hands brahmins asked the king Because sire these are evil dreamsWhat will come of them said the kingOne of three calamitiesharm to your kingdom to your life or to your richesIs there a remedy or is there notUndoubtedly these dreams in themselves are so threatening as to be without remedy but none the less we will find a remedy for them Otherwise what boots our much study and learningWhat then do you propose to do to avert the evilWherever four roads meet we would offer sacrifice sireMy directors cried the king in his terror my life is in your hands make haste and work my safetyLarge sums of money and large supplies of food of every kind will be ours thought the exultant brahmins and bidding the king have no fear they departed from the palace Outside the town they dug a sacrificial pit and collected a host of fourfooted creatures perfect and without blemish and a multitude of birds But still they discovered something lacking and back they kept coming to the king to ask for this that and the otherNow their doings were watched by Queen Mallikā who came to the king and asked what made these brahmins keep coming to himI envy you said the king a snake in your ear and you not to know of itWhat does your majesty meanI have dreamed oh such unlucky dreams The brahmins tell me they point to one of three calamities and they are anxious to offer sacrifices to avert the evil And this is what brings them here so oftenBut has your majesty consulted the Chief Brahmin both of this world and of the world of devasWho pray may he be my dear asked the kingKnow you not that chiefest personage of all the world the allknowing and pure the spotless masterbrahminSurely he the Blessed One will understand your dreams Go ask himAnd so I will my queen said the king And away he went to the monastery saluted the Master and sat downWhat pray brings your majesty here so early in the morning asked the Master in his sweet tonesSir said the king just before daybreak I dreamed sixteen wonderful dreams which so terrified me that I told them to the brahminsThey told me that my dreams boded evil and that to avert the threatened calamity they must offer sacrifice wherever four roads met And so they are busy with their preparations and many living creatures have the fear of death before their eyes But I pray you who are the chiefest personage in the world of men and devas you into whose ken comes all possible knowledge of things past and present and to beI pray you tell me what will come of my dreams O Blessed OneTrue it is sire that there is none other save me who can tell what your dreams signify or what will come of themI will tell you Only first of all relate to me your dreams as they appeared to youI will sir said the king and at once began this list following the order of the dreams appearanceBulls first and trees and cows and calvesHow was it sir that I had the following one of my dreams Methought four black bulls like collyrium in hue came from the four cardinal directions to the royal courtyard with avowed intent to fight and people flocked together to see the bullfight till a great crowd had gathered But the bulls only made a show of fighting roared and bellowed and finally went off without fighting at allThis was my first dream What will come of itSire that dream shall have no issue in your days or in mine But hereafter when kings shall be niggardly and unrighteous and when folk shall be unrighteous in days when the world is perverted when good is waning and evil waxing apacein those days of the worlds backsliding there shall fall no rain from the heavens the feet of the storm shall be lamed the crops shall wither and famine shall be on the land Then shall the clouds gather as if for rain from the four quarters of the heavens there shall be haste first to carry indoors the rice and crops that the women have spread in the sun to dry for fear the harvest should get wet and then with spade and basket in hand the men shall go forth to bank up the dykes As though in sign of coming rain the thunder shall bellow the lightning shall flash from the cloudsbut even as the bulls in your dream that fought not so the clouds shall flee away without rainingThis is what shall come of this dreamBut no harm shall come therefrom to you for it was with regard to the future that you dreamed this dream What the brahmins told you was said only to get themselves a livelihood And when the Master had thus told the fulfilment of this dream he said Tell me your second dream sireSir said the king my second dream was after this mannerMethought little tiny trees and shrubs burst through the soil and when they had grown scarce a span or two high they flowered and bore fruitThis was my second dream what shall come of itSire said the Master this dream shall have its fulfilment in days when the world has fallen into decay and when men are shortlivedSire said the Master this dream shall have its fulfilment in days when the world has fallen into decay and when men are shortlived In times to come the passions shall be strong quite young girls shall go to live with men and it shall be with them after the manner of women they shall conceive and bear childrenThe flowers typify their issues and the fruit their offspringBut you sire have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your third dream O great kingMethought sir I saw cows sucking the milk of calves which they had borne that selfsame dayThis was my third dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall have its fulfilment only in days to come when respect shall cease to be paid to ageFor in the future men shewing no reverence for parents or parentsinlaw shall themselves administer the family estate and if such be their good pleasure shall bestow food and clothing on the old folks but shall withhold their gifts if it be not their pleasure to giveThen shall the old folks destitute and dependent exist by favour of their own children like big cows suckled by calves a day oldBut you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your fourth dreamMethought sir I saw men unyoking a team of draughtoxen sturdy and strong and setting young steers to draw the loadand the steers proving unequal to the task laid on them refused and stood stockstill so that wains moved not on their wayThis was my fourth dream What shall come of itHere again the dream shall not have its fulfilment until the future in the days of unrighteous kingsFor in days to come unrighteous and niggardly kings shall shew no honour to wise lords skilled in precedent fertile in expedient and able to get through businessnor shall appoint to the courts of law and justice aged councillors of wisdom and of learning in the law Nay they shall honour the very young and foolish and appoint such to preside in the courts And these latter ignorant alike of statecraft and of practical knowledge shall not be able to bear the burthen of their honours or to governbut because of their incompetence shall throw off the yoke of office Whereon the aged and wise lords albeit right able to cope with all difficulties shall keep in mind how they were passed over and shall decline to aid sayingIt is no business of ours we are outsiders let the boys of the inner circle see to it Hence they shall stand aloof and ruin shall assail those kings on every hand It shall be even as when the yoke was laid on the young steers who were not strong enough for the burthen and not upon the team of sturdy and strong draughtoxen who alone were able to do the workHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your fifth dreamMethought sir I saw a horse with a mouth on either side to which fodder was given on both sides and it ate with both its mouthsThis was my fifth dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall have its fulfilment only in the future in the days of unrighteous and foolish kingswho shall appoint unrighteous and covetous men to be judges These base ones fools despising the good shall take bribes from both sides as they sit in the seat of judgment and shall be filled with this twofold corruption even as the horse that ate fodder with two mouths at onceHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your sixth dreamMethought sir I saw people holding out a wellscoured golden bowl worth a hundred thousand pieces and begging an old jackal to stale therein And I saw the beast do soThis was my sixth dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall only have its fulfilment in the futureThis dream too shall only have its fulfilment in the future For in the days to come unrighteous kings though sprung of a race of kings mistrusting the scions of their old nobility shall not honour them but exalt in their stead the lowbornwhereby the nobles shall be brought low and the lawborn raised to lordshipThen shall the great families be brought by very need to seek to live by dependence on the upstarts and shall offer them their daughters in marriage And the union of the noble maidens with the lowborn shall be like unto the staling of the old jackal in the golden bowlHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your seventh dreamA man was weaving rope sir and as he wove he threw it down at his feet Under his bench lay a hungry she jackal which kept eating the rope as he wove but without the man knowing it This is what I sawThis was my seventh dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the futureFor in days to come women shall lust after men and strong drink and finery and gadding abroad and after the joys of this world In their wickedness and profligacy these women shall drink strong drink with their paramours they shall flaunt in garlands and perfumes and unguents and heedless of even the most pressing of their household duties they shall keep watching for their paramours even at crevices high up in the outer wall aye they shall pound up the very seedcorn that should be sown on the morrow so as to provide good cheerin all these ways shall they plunder the store won by the hard work of their husbands in field and byre devouring the poor mens substance even as the hungry jackal under the bench ate up the rope of the ropemaker as he wove itHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your eighth dreamMethought sir I saw at a palace gate a big pitcher which was full to the brim and stood amid a number of empty onesAnd from the four cardinal points and from the four intermediate points as well there kept coming a constant stream of people of all the four castes carrying water in pipkins and pouring it into the full pitcher And the water overflowed and ran away But none the less they still kept on pouring more and more water into the overflowing vessel without a single man giving so much as a glance at the empty pitchersThis was my eighth dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment until the futureFor in days to come the world shall decay the kingdom shall grow weak its kings shall grow poor and niggardlythe foremost among them shall have no more than  pieces of money in his treasury Then shall these kings in their need set the whole of the countryfolk to work for themfor the kings sake shall the toiling folk leaving their own work sow grain and pulse and keep watch and reap and thresh and garner for the kings sake shall they plant sugarcanes make and drive sugarmills and boil down the molasses for the kings sake shall they lay out flowergardens and orchards and gather in the fruits And as they gather in all the divers kinds of produce they shall fill the royal garners to overflowing not giving so much as a glance at their own empty barns at home Thus it shall be like filling up the full pitcher heedless of the quiteempty onesHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your ninth dreamMethought sir I saw a deep pool with shelving banks all round and overgrown with the five kinds of lotusesFrom every side twofooted creatures and fourfooted creatures flocked thither to drink of its watersThe depths in the middle were muddy but the water was clear and sparkling at the margin where the various creatures went down into the poolThis was my ninth dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the futureFor in days to come kings shall grow unrighteous they shall rule after their own will and pleasure and shall not execute judgment according to righteousness These kings shall hunger after riches and wax fat on bribes they shall not shew mercy love and compassion toward their people but be fierce and cruel amassing wealth by crushing their subjects like sugarcanes in a mill and by taxing them even to the uttermost farthingUnable to pay the oppressive tax the people Shall fly from village and town and the like and take refuge upon the borders of the realm the heart of the land shall be a wilderness while the borders shall teem with peopleeven as the water was muddy in the middle of the pool and clear at the marginHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your tenth dreamMethought sir I saw rice boiling in a pot without getting done By not getting done I mean that it looked as though it were sharply marked off and kept apart so that the cooking went on in three distinct stages For part was sodden part hard and raw and part just cooked to a nicetyThis was my tenth dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the futureFor in days to come kings shall grow unrighteous the people surrounding the kings shall grow unrighteous too as also shall brahmins and householders townsmen and countryfolk yes all people alike shall grow unrighteous not excepting even sages and brahmins Next their very tutelary deitiesthe spirits to whom they offer sacrifice the spirits of the trees and the spirits of the airshall become unrighteous alsoThe very winds that blow over the realms of these unrighteous kings shall grow cruel and lawless they shall shake the mansions of the skies and thereby kindle the anger of the spirits that dwell there so that they will not suffer rain to fallor if it does rain it shall not fall on all the kingdom at once nor shall the kindly shower fall on all tilled or sown lands alike to help them in their needAnd as in the kingdom at large so in each several district and village and over each separate pool or lake the rain shall not fall at one and the same time on its whole expanse if it rain on the upper part it shall not rain upon the lowerhere the crops shall be spoiled by a heavy downpourthere wither for very drought and here again thrive apace with kindly showers to water themSo the crops sown within the confines of a single kingdomlike the rice in the one potshall have no uniform characterHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your eleventh dreamMethought sir I saw sour buttermilk bartered for precious sandalwood worth  pieces of moneyThis was my eleventh dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the futurein the days when my doctrine is waningFor in days to come many greedy and shameless Brethren shall arise who for their bellys sake shall preach the very words in which I inveighed against greed Because they have deserted by reason of their belly and have taken their stand on the side of the sectaries  they shall fail to make their preaching lead up to Nirvana Nay their only thought as they preach shall be by fine words and sweet voices to induce men to give them costly raiment and the like and to be minded to give such giftsOthers again seated in the highways at the streetcorners at the doors of kings palaces and so forth shall stoop to preach for money yea for mere coined kahāpanas halfkahāpanas pādas or māsakasAnd as they thus barter away for food or raiment or for kahāpanas and halfkahāpanas my doctrine the worth whereof is Nirvana they shall be even as those who bartered away for soar buttermilk precious sandalwood worth  piecesHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your twelfth dreamMethought sir I saw empty pumpkins sinking in the water What shall come of itThis dream also shall not have its fulfilment till the future in the days of unrighteous kings when the world is pervertedFor in those days shall kings shew favour not to the scions of the nobility but to the lowborn only and these latter shall become great lords whilst the nobles sink into povertyAlike in the royal presence in the palace gates in the council chamber and in the courts of justice the words of the lowborn alone shall be stablished as though they had sunk down till they rested on the bottomSo too in the assemblies of the Brotherhood in the greater and lesser conclaves and in enquiries regarding bowls robes lodging and the likethe counsel only of the wicked and the vile shall be considered to have saving power not that of the modest Brethren Thus everywhere it shall be as when the empty pumpkins sankHowbeit you have Nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your thirteenth dreamHereupon the king said Methought sir I saw huge blocks of solid rock as big as houses floating like ships upon the waters What shall come of itThis dream also shall not have its fulfilment before such times as those of which I have spokenFor in those days unrighteous kings shall shew honour to the lowborn who shall become great lords whilst the nobles sink into povertyNot to the nobles but to the upstarts alone shall respect be paidIn the royal presence in the council chamber or in the courts of justice the words of the nobles learned in the law shall drift idly by and not sink deep into the hearts of menwhen they speak the upstarts shall merely laugh them to scorn saying What is this these fellows are sayingSo too in the assemblies of the Brethren as afore said men shall not deem worthy of respect the excellent among the Brethren the words of such shall not sink deep but drift idly byeven as when the rocks floated upon the watersHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your fourteenth dreamMethought sir I saw tiny frogs no bigger than minute flowerets swiftly pursuing huge black snakes chopping them up like so many lotusstalks and gobbling them up What shall come of thisThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till those days to come such as those of which I have spoken when the world is decayingFor then shall mens passions be so strong and their lusts so hot that they shall be the thralls of the very youngest of their wives for the time being at whose sole disposal shall be slaves and hired servants oxen buffalos and all cattle gold and silver and everything that is in the houseShould the poor husband ask where the money or a robe is at once he shall be told that it is where it is that he should mind his own business and not be so inquisitive as to what is or is not in her house And therewithal in divers ways the wives with abuse and goading taunts shall establish their dominion over their husbands as over slaves and bondservantsThus shall it be like as when the tiny frogs no bigger than minute flowerets gobbled up the big black snakesHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your fifteenth dreamMethought sir I saw a village crow in which dwelt the whole of the Ten Vices escorted by a retinue of those birds which because of their golden sheen are called Royal Golden Mallards What shall come of itThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the future till the reign of weakling kingsIn days to come kings shall arise who shall know nothing about elephants or other arts and shall be cowards in the field Fearing to be deposed and cast from their royal estate they shall raise to power not their peers but their footmen bathattendants barbers and such like Thus shut out from royal favour and unable to support themselves the nobles shall be reduced to dancing attendance on the upstartsas when the crow had Royal Golden Mallards for a retinueHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefrom Tell me your sixteenth dreamHeretofore sir it always used to be panthers that preyed on goats but methought I saw goats chasing panthers and devouring themmunch munch munchwhilst at bare sight of the goats afar off terrorstricken wolves fled quaking with fear and hid themselves in their fastnesses in the thicket Such was my dream What shall come of itThis dream too shall not have its fulfilment till the future till the reign of unrighteous kingsIn those days the lowborn shall be raised to lordship and be made royal favourites whilst the nobles shall sink into obscurity and distressGaining influence in the courts of law because of their favour with the king these upstarts shall claim perforce the ancestral estates the raiment and all the property of the old nobility Andwhen these latter plead their rights before the courts then shall the kings minions have them cudgelled and bastinadoed and taken by the throat and cast out with words of scorn such asKnow your place fools What do you dispute with us The king shall know of your insolence and we will have your hands and feet chopped off and other correctives appliedHereupon the terrified nobles shall affirm that their own belongings really belong to the overbearing upstarts and will tell the favourites to accept them And they shall hie them home and there cower in an agony of fearLikewise evil Brethren shall harry at pleasure good and worthy Brethren till these latter finding none to help them shall flee to the jungleAnd this oppression of the nobles and of the good Brethren by the lowborn and by the evil brethren shall be like the scaring of wolves by goatsHowbeit you have nothing to fear therefromFor this dream too has reference to future times onlyIt was not truth it was not love for you that prompted the brahmins to prophesy as they did No it was greed of gain and the insight that is bred of covetousness that shaped all their selfseeking utterancesThus did the Master expound the import of these sixteen great dreams addingYou sire are not the first to have these dreams they were dreamed by kings of bygone days alsoand then as now the brahmins found in them a pretext for sacrifices whereupon at the instance of the wise and good the Bodhisatta was consultedand the dreams were expounded by them of old time in just the same manner as they have now been expounded And so saying at the kings request he told this story of the pastOnce on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin in the North country When he came to years of discretion he renounced the world for a hermits life he won the higher Knowledges and the Attainments and dwelt in the Himalaya country in the bliss that comes from InsightIn those days in just the same manner Brahmadatta dreamed these dreams at Benares and enquired of the brahmins concerning themAnd the brahmins then as now set to work at sacrificesAmongst them was a young brahmin of learning and wisdom a pupil of the kings chaplain who addressed his master thusMaster you have taught me the Three Vedas Is there not therein a text that says The slaying of one creature giveth not life to anotherMy son this means money to us a great deal of money You only seem anxious to spare the kings treasuryDo as you will master said the young brahmin as for me to what end shall I tarry longer here with you And so saying he left him and betook himself to the royal pleasaunceThat selfsame day the Bodhisatta knowing all this thought to himself If I visit today the haunts of men I shall work the deliverance of a great multitude from their bondage So passing through the air he alighted in the royal pleasaunce and seated himself radiant as a statue of gold upon the Ceremonial StoneThe young brahmin drew near and with due obeisance seated himself by the Bodhisatta in all friendlinessSweet converse passed and the Bodhisatta asked whether the young brahmin thought the king ruled righteouslySir answered the young man the king is righteous himself but the brahmins make him side with evilBeing consulted by the king as to sixteen dreams which he had dreamedthe brahmins clutched at the opportunity for sacrifices and set to work thereonOh sir would it not be a good thing that you should offer to make known to the king the real import of his dreams and so deliver great numbers of creatures from their dreadBut my son I do not know the king nor he meStill if he should cone here and ask me I will tell himI will bring the king sir said the young brahmin if you will only be so good as to wait here a minute till I come back And having gained the Bodhisattas consent he went before the king and said that there had alighted in the royal pleasaunce an airtravelling ascetic who said he would expound the kings dreams would not his majesty relate them to this asceticWhen the king heard this he repaired at once to the pleasaunce with a large retinue Saluting the ascetic he sat down by the holy mans side and asked whether it was true that he knew what would come of his dreamsCertainly sire said the Bodhisattabut first let me hear the dreams as you dreamed themReadily sir answered the king and he began as followsBulls first and trees and cows and calvesAnd his majesty went on to tell his dreams in just the same manner as that in which King Pasenadi had described themEnough said the Great Being you have nothing to fear or dread from all this Having thus reassured the king and having freed a great multitude from bondage the Bodhisatta again took up his position in midair whence he exhorted the king and established him in the Five Commandments ending with these wordsHenceforth O king join not with the brahmins in slaughtering animals for sacrifice His teaching ended the Bodhisatta passed straight through the air to his own abodeAnd the king remaining stedfast in the teaching he had heard passed away after a life of almsgiving and other good works to fare according to his desertsHis lesson ended the Master said You have nothing to fear from these dreams away with the sacrifice Having had the sacrifice removed and having saved the lives of a multitude of creatures he shewed the connexion and identified the Birth by saying nanda was the king of those days Sāriputta the young Brahmin and I the ascetic  put the whole story into the First BookIf his mind inclines to sitting he sitsIf his mind inclines to lying down he lies down thinking While I am lying down thus no evil unwholesome states will beset meWhat

the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence in the Brahman village Pañcasālā with reference to MāraFor one day the Teacher perceived that five hundred maidens possessed the faculties requisite for attaining the Fruit of Conversion and therefore went and took up his residence near this villageNow on a certain festival day those maidens went to the river and bathed and having so done adorned themselves with rich apparel and jewels and set out in the direction of the villageAccordingly the Teacher also entered that village and went about the village receiving almsNow Māra took possession of the bodies of all the inhabitants of that village with the result that the Teacher received not so much as a spoonful of boiled rice As the Teacher departed from that village with bowl clean as it had been washed Māra took his stand at the gate of that village and said to him Monk you received no almsEmbodiment of evil why have you so wrought that I should receive no almsVery well Reverend Sir enter the village againThis thought we are told was in Māras mind If he enters the village again I will take possession of the bodies of all the villagers and will cause them to clap their hands before his face laugh in his face and make all manner of fun of himAt that moment those maidens reached the gate of the village and seeing the Teacher saluted him and stood respectfully on one sideThen said Māra to the Teacher Reverend Sir seeing that you received not a morsel of food you must be oppressed with the pangs of hungerThe Teacher replied Embodiment of evil though today we received naught yet shall we spend the day in the bliss of joy like Great Brahmā in the Heaven of the Bright Gods So saying he pronounced the following StanzaOh happily let us live we who possess naughtLet us live on the food of joy like the Bright GodsThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the defeat of the king of KosalaThe story goes that the king of Kosala fought against his nephew Ajātasattu near the village Kāsika and suffered defeat three times As he returned from defeat the third time he thought to himself Since I have not been able to subdue this milkfaced youth what is the use of my living any longerSo he refused to eat and took to his bedThe news of what he had done spread throughout city and monasteryThe monks reported the matter to the Teacher saying Reverend Sir report has it that the king who thrice suffered defeat near the village Kāsika and has just now returned from defeat has refused to eat and has taken to his bed saying Since I have not been able to defeat this milkfaced youth what is the use of my living any longer When the Teacher heard this report he said Monks by winning a victory a man produces hatred and he that is defeated is afflicted with suffering So saying the Teacher pronounced the following StanzaVictory produces hatred he that is defeated is afflicted with sufferingHe that has renounced both victory and defeat lives in tranquillity and happinessThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain maiden of respectable familyThe story goes that the mother and father of this maiden arranged a marriage for her and invited the Teacher to be present on the weddingdaySo the Teacher accompanied by the Congregation of Monks went thither and sat downThe bride passed to and fro straining water for the Congregation of Monks and performing the other dutiesAs the bride passed to and fro the husband stood and gazed at herAs he gazed at her he was overpowered by desire and lust arose within himOvercome by nescience he ministered neither to the Buddha nor to the Eighty Chief Eldersbut made up his mind I will stretch forth my arms and embrace that womanThe Teacher perceived what was passing through his mind and so wrought that he no longer saw that womanSeeing her no longer he stood and gazed at the TeacherAs he stood there gazing at the Teacher the Teacher said to him Youth there is no fire like the fire of lust There is no sin like the sin of hatred There is no suffering like the suffering involved in keeping up the Aggregates of Being There is no happiness like the happiness of Nibbāna So saying he pronounced the following StanzaThere is no fire like the fire of lust There is no sin like the sin of hatredThere are no sufferings like the sufferings of existence There is no happiness like Supreme TranquillityThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at ḷavi with reference to a certain lay discipleFor one day as the Teacher seated in the Perfumed Chamber at Jetavana surveyed the world at dawn he beheld a certain poor man at ḷavi Perceiving that he possessed the faculties requisite for attaining the Fruit of Conversion he surrounded himself with a company of five hundred monks and went to ḷaviThe inhabitants of ḷavi straightway invited the Teacher to be their guestThat poor man also heard that the Teacher had arrived and made up his mind to go and hear the Teacher preach the LawBut that very day an ox of his strayed offSo he considered within himself Shall I seek that ox or shall I go and hear the Law And he came to the following conclusion I will first seek that ox and then go and hear the Law Accordingly early in the morning he set out to seek his oxThe residents of ḷavi provided seats for the Congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha served them with food and after the meal took the Teachers bowl that he might pronounce the words of thanksgivingSaid the Teacher He for whose sake I came hither a journey of thirty leagues has gone into the forest to seek his ox which was lost Not until he returns will I preach the Law And he held his peaceWhile it was still day that poor man found his ox and straightway drove the ox back to the herd Then he thought to himself Even if I can do nothing else I will at least pay my respects to the Teacher Accordingly although he was oppressed with the pangs of hunger he decided not to go home but went quickly to the Teacher and having paid obeisance to the Teacher sat down respectfully on one sideWhen the poor man came and stood before the Teacher the Teacher said to the steward of the alms Is there any food remaining over and above to the Congregation of MonksReverend Sir the food has not been touchedWell then serve this poor man with foodSo when the steward had provided that poor man with a seat in a place indicated by the Teacher he served him dutifully with riceporridge and other food both hard and softWhen the poor man had eaten his meal he rinsed his mouthAs soon as the poor mans physical sufferings had been relieved his mind became tranquilThen the Teacher preached the Law in orderly sequence expounding one after another the Four Noble TruthsAt the conclusion of the lesson the poor man was established in the Fruit of ConversionThen the Teacher pronounced the words of thanksgiving and having so done arose from his seat and departedThe multitude accompanied him a little way and then turned backThe monks who accompanied the Teacher were highly indignant and said Just consider brethren what the Teacher did Nothing of the sort ever happened before But today seeing a certain poor man the Teacher inquired about the supply of food and directed that food to be given to anotherThe Teacher turned around stopped  and said Monks what are you saying When he heard what they were saying he said to them It is even so monks When I came hither a journey of thirty leagues a long and difficult journey my sole reason for coming hither was the fact that I saw that this lay disciple possessed the faculties requisite for the attainment of the Fruit of Conversion Early in the morning oppressed with the pangs of hunger this man went to the forest and spent the day in the forest seeking his ox which was lostTherefore I thought to myself If I preach the Law to this man while he is suffering from the pangs of hunger he will not be able to comprehend it Therefore was it that I did what I did Monks there is no affliction like the affliction of hunger So saying he pronounced the following StanzaHunger is the greatest of afflictions the Aggregates of Being are the principal source of sufferingIf a man thoroughly understand this he has attained Nibbāna Supreme HappinessThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to King Pasenadi KosalaFor at a certain period of his life King Pasenadi Kosala used to eat boiled rice cooked by the bucketful and sauce and curry in proportion One day after he had eaten his breakfast unable to shake off the drowsiness occasioned by overeating he went to see the Teacher and paced back and forth before him with a very weary look Overcome with a desire to sleep but not daring to lie down and stretch himself out he sat down on one sideThereupon the Teacher said to him Did you come great king before you were well restedOh no Reverend Sir but I always suffer greatly after eating a mealThen said the Teacher to him Great king overeating brings just such suffering in its train o saying the Teacher pronounced the following StanzaIf a man gives way to indolence eats overmuchSpends his time in sleep and lies and rolls aboutLike a great hog fed on grainSuch a simpleton will enter the womb again and againAfter admonishing the king with this Stanza the Teacher continued Great king one ought to observe moderation in eatingfor in moderate eating there is comfort And admonishing him further the Teacher pronounced the following StanzaIf a man be ever mindfulif he observe moderation in taking foodHis sufferings will be but slighthe will grow old slowly preserving his lifeThe king was unable to memorize this Stanza So the Teacher said to the kings nephew Prince Goodlooking Sudassana who stood near Memorize this StanzaSudassana asked the Teacher Reverend Sir after I have memorized this Stanza what shall I do with itThe Teacher replied When the king eats his meal just as he is about to take the last lump of boiled rice you must recite this Stanza The king will understand its purport and will immediately throw away that lump of rice When it comes time to boil the rice for the kings next meal you must fetch just as many grains of fresh rice as there were grains of boiled rice in that lump of riceVery well Reverend Sir replied Sudassana So both evening and morning when the king ate his meal his nephew would recite that Stanza just as the king was about to take the last lump of boiled rice and would fetch for his next meal just as many grains of fresh rice as there were grains of boiled rice in the lump of boiled rice which the king had thrown awayAnd every time the king heard that Stanza recited he gave away a thousand pieces of money in almsThe king contented himself with a pintpot of boiled rice a day never exceeding that amount After a time he became cheerful and leanOne day the king went to pay his respects to the Teacher and having saluted the Teacher said to him Reverend Sir now I am happy Once more I am able to follow the chase and to catch wild beasts and horsesI used to quarrel with my nephew But recently however I gave my nephew my daughter the Princess Vajirā to wife I have given her this village that she may have a pool wherein to bathe My quarrels with my nephew have ceased and for this reason also I am happyThe other day a precious stone the property of the royal household was lost this has but recently returned to my hand and for this reason also I am happyDesiring to establish friendly relations with your disciples I established the daughter of one of your kinsmen in our household and for this reason also I am happyThe Teacher replied Great king health is the greatest blessing one can ask for contentment with whatever one has received is the greatest wealth confidence is the best of relatives But there is no happiness that can be compared with Nibbāna So saying he pronounced the following StanzaHealth is the greatest acquisition contentment is the greatest wealthConfidence is the best of relatives Nibbāna is the greatest happinessThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Vesāli with reference to a certain monkFor when the Teacher said Monks four months hence I shall pass into Nibbāna seven hundred monks of his retinue were overwhelmed with fear the Arahats experienced religious exaltation while those who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion were unable to restrain their tearsThe monks gathered in little groups and went about consulting each other and asking What are we to doNow a certain monk named Elder Tissa thought to himself If it be true that at the expiration of four months the Teacher will pass into Nibbāna inasmuch as I am not yet free from the evil passions it behooves me to win Arahatship while the Teacher yet remains alive Accordingly he adopted the Four Postures and kept residence by himselfnever associating with the other monks and never talking or conversing with any oneThe monks said to him Brother Tissa why do you act in this mannerTissa however paid no attention to what they saidThe monks therefore reported the matter to the Teacher saying Reverend Sir Elder Tissa has no affection for youThe Teacher caused Tissa to be summoned and asked him Tissa why do you act in this manner When Tissa told the motive that actuated him the Teacher applauded his conduct saying Well done Tissa Then said the Teacher to the monks Monks he only that is like Tissa has real affection for meFor though men honor me with perfumes and garlands they honor me not But they that practice the Higher and the Lower Law they alone truly honor me So saying he pronounced the following StanzaHe who has tasted the sweetness of solitude and the sweetness of tranquillitySuch a one is free from fear and free from sin for he drinks the sweetness of the joy of the LawThis religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Beḷuva village with reference to SakkaFor when the Tathāgatas Aggregate of Life was at an end and he was suffering from an attack of dysentery Sakka king of gods became aware of it and thought to himself It is my duty to go to the Teacher and to minister to him in his sickness Accordingly he laid aside his own body threequarters of a league in height approached the Teacher saluted him and with his own hands rubbed the Teachers feetThe Teacher said to him Who is thatIt is I Reverend Sir SakkaWhy did you come hereTo minister to you in your sickness Reverend SirSakka to the gods the smell of men even at a distance of a hundred leagues is like that of carrion tied to the throat depart hence for I have monks who will wait upon me in my sicknessReverend Sir at a distance of eightyfour thousand leagues I smelt the fragrance of your goodness and therefore came I hither I alone will minister to you in your sickness Sakka permitted no other so much as to touch with his hand the vessel which contained the excrement of the Teachers body but himself carried the vessel out on his own head Moreover he carried it out without the slightest contraction of the muscles of his mouth acting as though he were bearing about a vessel filled with perfumesThus did Sakka minister to the Teacher and departed only when the Teacher felt more comfortableThe monks began a discussion saying Oh how great must be the affection of Sakka for the Teacher To think that Sakka should lay aside such heavenly glory as is his to wait upon the Teacher in his sickness To think that he should carry out on his head the vessel containing the excrement of the Teachers body as though he were removing a vessel filled with perfumes without the slightest contraction of the muscles of his mouthHearing their talk the Teacher said What say you monks It is not at all strange that Sakka king of gods should cherish warm affection for meFor because of me this Sakka king of gods laid aside the form of Old Sakka obtained the Fruit of Conversion and took upon himself the form of Young Sakka For once when he came to me terrified with the fear of death preceded by the celestial musician Pañcasikha and sat down in Indasāla Cave in the midst of the company of the gods I dispelled his suffering by saying to himVāsava ask me whatever question you desire in your heart to askI will answer whatever question you ask meHaving dispelled his suffering I preached the Law to himAt the conclusion of the discourse fourteen crores of living beings obtained Comprehension of the Law and Sakka himself even as he sat there obtained the Fruit of Conversion and became Young SakkaThus I have been a mighty helper to himnd it is not at all strange that he should cherish warm affection for meFor monks it is a pleasant thing to look upon the Noble and it is likewise a pleasant thing to live with them in the same placebut to have aught to do with simpletons brings suffering So saying he pronounced the following StanzasIt is a good thing to look upon the Noble and to live with them is ever pleasantIt would be pleasant might one never look upon a simpleton at allFor he who walks in the company of simpletons suffers a long timeLiving with simpletons as with an enemy always brings sufferingPleasant is it to live with the steadfast even as is a meeting of kinsfolkThereforeOne should follow the steadfast the wise the learned the patient the dutiful the NobleOne should follow so good and intelligent a man as the moon follows the path of the starsHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu possesses faith virtue learning generosity and wisdomHe thinks Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of welltodo noblesAgain a bhikkhu possesses faithand wisdomThis bhikkhus is the path the way that leads to reappearance thereThis bhikkhus is the path the way that leads to reappearance thereThis bhikkhus is the path the way that leads to reappearance thereand he abides intent on pervading the beings that have reappeared thereJust as a man with good sight might take a gallnut in his hand and review it so the Brahma of a Thousand abides intent on pervading a worldsystem of a thousand worldsand he abides intent on pervading the beings that have reappeared thereThis

happinessTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkNow a number of bhikkhus were sitting in the assembly hall where they had met together on returning from their almsround after their meal when this discussion arose among them It is wonderful friends it is marvellousHowever their discussion was interrupted for the Blessed One rose from meditation when it was evening went to the assembly hall and sat down on a seat made readyThen he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus for what discussion are you sitting together here now And what was your discussion that was interruptedHere venerable sir we were sitting in the assembly hall where we had met together on returning from our almsround after our meal when this discussion arose among us It is wonderful friends it is marvellousThis was our discussion venerable sir that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrivedAnd how bhikkhus is mindfulness of the body developed and cultivated so that it is of great fruit and great benefitHere a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect and established mindfulness in front of himever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he understands I breathe in long or breathing out long he understands I breathe out long Breathing in short he understands I breathe in short or breathing out short he understands I breathe out short He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body of breath he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formationAs he abides thus diligent ardent and resolute his memories and intentions based on the household life are abandonedThat is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyAgain bhikkhus when walking a bhikkhu understands I am walking when standing he understands I am standing when sitting he understands I am sitting when lying down he understands I am lying downAs he abides thus diligent ardent and resolute his memories and intentions based on the household life are abandonedAgain bhikkhus a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl who acts in full awareness when eating drinking consuming food and tasting who acts in full awareness when defecating or urinating who acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silentAs he abides thus diligent ardent and resolute his memories and intentions based on the household life are abandonedAgain bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair bounded by skin as full of many kinds of impurity thus Tn this body there are headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urineJust as though there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain such as hill rice red rice beans peas millet and white rice and a man with good eyes were to open it and review it thus This is hill rice this is red rice these are beans these are peas this is millet this is white rice so too a bhikkhu reviews this same body as full of many kinds of impurity thus In this body there are headhairsand urineAs he abides thus diligent ardent and resolute his memories and intentions based on the household life are abandonedAgain bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this same body however it is placed however disposed as consisting of elements thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air elementJust as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces so too a bhikkhu reviews this same body however it is placed however disposed as consisting of elements thus Tn this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air elementAs he abides thus diligent ardent and resolute his memories and intentions connected with the household life are abandonedAgain bhikkhus as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground one two or three days dead bloated livid and oozing matterAs he abides thus diligentAgain as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground being devoured by crows hawks vultures dogs jackals or various kinds of wormsAs he abides thus diligentThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyAgain as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood held together with sinewsa fleshless skeleton smeared with blood held together with sinewsa skeleton without flesh and blood held together with sinewsdisconnected bones scattered in all directions  here a handbone there a footbone here a shin bone there a thighbone here a hipbone there a backbone here a ribbone there a breastbone here an armbone there a shoulderbone here a neckbone there a jawbone here a tooth there the skull As he abides thus diligentThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyAgain as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground bones bleached white the colour of shellsbones heaped up more than a year oldbones rotted and crumbled to dustAs he abides thus diligentThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyAgain bhikkhus quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionHe makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusionJust as a skilled bath man or a bath mans apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin and sprinkling it gradually with water kneads it till the moisture wets his ball of bath powder soaks it and pervades it inside and out yet the ball itself does not ooze so too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusionAs he abides thus diligentThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyAgain bhikkhus with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentrationHe makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentrationJust as though there were a lake whose waters welled up from belowAs he abides thus diligentThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyAgain bhikkhus with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindfulHe makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a pond of blue or white or red lotuses some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it and cool water drenches steeps fills and pervades them to their tips and their roots so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by cool water so too a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of raptureAs he abides thus diligentThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyAgain bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityHe sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mindJust as though a man were sitting covered from head down with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his whole body not covered by the white cloth so too a bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind so that there is no part of his body unpervaded by the pure bright mindAs he abides thus diligent ardent and resolute his memories and intentions based on the household life are abandonedThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyBhikkhus anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body has included within himself whatever wholesome states there are that partake of true knowledgeBhikkhus when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Mara finds an opportunity and a support in himSuppose a man were to throw a heavy stone ball upon a mound of wet clayWhat do you think bhikkhus Would that heavy ball find entry into that mound of wet clay Yes venerable sir So too bhikkhus when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Mara finds an opportunity and a support in himSuppose there were a dry sapless piece of wood and a man came with an upper firestick thinking I shall light a fire I shall produce heatWhat do you think bhikkhus Could the man light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the dry sapless piece of wood with an upper firestick Yes venerable sir So too bhikkhus when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Mara finds an opportunity and a support in himSuppose there were a hollow empty water jug set out on a stand and a man came with a supply of waterWhat do you think bhikkhus Could the man pour the water into the jug Yes venerable sir So too bhikkhus when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Mara finds an opportunity and a support in himBhikkhus when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Mara cannot find an opportunity or a support in himSuppose a man were to throw a light ball of string at a doorpanel made entirely of heartwoodWhat do you think bhikkhus Would that light ball of string find entry through that doorpanel made entirely of heartwood No venerable sir So too bhikkhus when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Mara cannot find an opportunity or a support in himSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood and a man came with an upper firestick thinking I shall light a fire I shall produce heatWhat do you think bhikkhus Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper fire stick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood No venerable sir So too bhikkhus when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Mara cannot find an opportunity or a support in himSuppose set out on a stand there were a water jug full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it and a man came with a supply of waterWhat do you think bhikkhus Could the man pour the water into the jug No venerable sir So too bhikkhus when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Mara cannot find an opportunity or a support in himBhikkhus when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body then when he inclines his mind towards realising any state that may be realised by direct knowledge he attains the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisSuppose set out on a stand there were a water jug full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from itWhenever a strong man tips it would water come out Yes venerable sir So too bhikkhus when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body then when he inclines his mind towards realising any state that may be realised by direct knowledge he attains the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisSuppose there were a square pond on level ground surrounded by an embankment full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from itWhenever a strong man loosens the embankment would water come out Yes venerable sir So too bhikkhus when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the bodyhe attains the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisSuppose there were a chariot on even ground at the crossroads harnessed to thoroughbreds waiting with goad lying ready so that a skilled trainer a charioteer of horses to be tamed might mount it and taking the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right hand might drive out and back by any road whenever he likes So too bhikkhus when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the bodyhe attains the ability to witness any aspect therein there being a suitable basisBhikkhus when mindfulness of the body has been repeatedly practised developed cultivated used as a vehicle used as a basis established consolidated and well undertaken these ten benefits may be expected What ten One becomes a conqueror of discontent and delight and discontent does not conquer oneself one abides overcoming discontent whenever it arises One becomes a conqueror of fear and dread and fear and dread do not conquer oneself one abides overcoming fear and dread whenever they arise One bears cold and heat hunger and thirst and contact with gadflies mosquitoes wind the sun and creeping things one endures illspoken unwelcome words and arisen bodily feelings that are painful racking sharp piercing disagreeable distressing and menacing to life One obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now One wields the various kinds of supernormal power  With the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human one hears both kinds of sounds the divine and the human those that are far as well as near One understands the minds of other beings of other persons having encompassed them with ones own mindOne understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lustan unliberated mind as unliberated One recollects ones manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars one recollects ones manifold past lives With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human one sees beings passing away and reappearing infej rior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and one understands how beings pass on according to their actions By realising for oneself with direct knowledge one here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsBhikkhus when mindfulness of the body has been repeatedly practised developed cultivated used as a vehicle used as a basis established consolidated and well undertaken these ten benefits may be expectedThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordshow it has been said by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened that mindfulness of the body when developed and cultivated is of great fruit and great benefithow it has been said by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened that mindfulness of the body when developed and cultivated

disposedThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodyThat too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the bodya bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus This body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fateThat too is how a bhikkhu

that it is not exempt from that fateand it had no inflow from east west north or south and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench steep fill and pervade the lake so that there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water so too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentrationwith their abandoning his mind becomes steadied internally quieted brought to singleness and concentratedJust as anyone who has extended his mind over the great ocean has included within it whatever streams there are that flow into the ocean so too anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body has included within himself whatever wholesome states there are that partake of true knowledgeOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesali in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodThen in the eve ning the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached the infirmarywhere he saw a certain bhikkhu who was frail and sick He then sat down in the prepared seatWhat fiveHere a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body perceiving the repulsiveness of food perceiving nondelight in the entire world contem plating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena and he has the perception of death well established internallyIf these five things do not slip away from a frail and sick bhikkhu it can be expected of him In no long time with the destruction of the taints he will realize for himself with direct knowledge in this very life the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom and having entered upon it he will dwell in itand addressed the bhikkhusBhikkhus if five things do not slip away from a frail and sick bhikkhu it can be expected of him In no long time with the

BrahmaworldTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisJust as a fire that starts in a shed made of rushes or grass burns down even a house with a peaked roof with walls plastered inside and outside shut off secured by bars with shuttered windows so too bhikkhus whatever fears arise all arise because of the fool not because of the wise manThus the fool brings fear the wise man brings no fear the fool brings trouble the wise man brings no trouble the fool brings calamity the wise man brings no calamityNo fear comes from the wise man no trouble comes from the wise man no calamity comes from the wise manTherefore bhikkhus you should train thus We shall be wise men we shall be inquirersWhen this was said the venerable Ananda asked the Blessed One In what way venerable sir can a bhikkhu be called a wise man and an inquirerWhen Ananda a bhikkhu is skilled in the elements skilled in the bases skilled in dependent origination skilled in what is possible and what is impossible in that way he can be called a wise man and an inquirerBut venerable sir in what way can a bhikkhu be called skilled in the elementsThere are Ananda these eighteen elements the eye element the form element the eyeconsciousness element the ear element the sound element the earconsciousness element the nose element the odour element the noseconsciousness element the tongue element the flavour element the tongueconsciousness element the body element the tangible element the bodyconsciousness element the mind element the mindobject element the mindconsciousness elementWhen he knows and sees these eighteen elements a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsBut venerable sir might there be another way in which a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsThere might be AnandaThere are Ananda these six elements the earth element the water element the fire element the air element the space element and the consciousness elementWhen he knows and sees these six elements a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsBut venerable sir might there be another way in which a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsThere might be AnandaThere are Ananda these six elements the pleasure element the pain element the joy element the grief element the equanimity element and the ignorance elementWhen he knows and sees these six elements a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsBut venerable sir might there be another way in which a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsThere might be AnandaThere are Ananda these six elements the sensual desire element the renunciation element the ill will element the nonill will element the cruelty element and the noncruelty elementWhen he knows and sees these six elements a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsBut venerable sir might there be another way in which a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsThere might be AnandaThere are Ananda these three elements the sensesphere element the finematerial element and the immaterial elementWhen he knows and sees these three elements a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsBut venerable sir might there be another way in which a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsThere might be AnandaThere are Ananda these two elements the conditioned element and the unconditioned elementWhen he knows and sees these two elements a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elementsBut venerable sir in what way can a bhikkhu be called skilled in the basesThere are Ananda these six internal and external bases the eye and forms the ear and sounds the nose and odours the tongue and flavours the body and tangibles the mind and mindobjectsBut venerable sir in what way can a bhikkhu be called skilled in dependent originationHere Ananda a bhikkhu knows thus When this exists that comes to be with the arising of this that arises When this does not exist that does not come to be with the cessation of this that ceases That is with ignorance as condition formations come to be with formations as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality with mentality materiality as condition the sixfold base with the sixfold base as condition contact with contact as condition feeling with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition being with being as condition birth with birth as condition ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to beSuch is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingBut with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of formations with the cessation of formations cessation of consciousness with the cessation of consciousness cessation of mentalitymateriality with the cessation of mentalitymateriality cessation of the sixfold base with the cessation of the sixfold base cessation of contact with the cessation of contact cessation of feeling with the cessation of feeling cessation of craving with the cessation of craving cessation of clinging with the cessation of clinging cessation of being with the cessation of being cessation of birth with the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of sufferingIn this way Ananda a bhikkhu can be called skilled in dependent originationBut venerable sir in what way can a bhikkhu be called skilled in what is possible and what is impossibleHere Ananda a bhikkhu understands It is impossible it cannot happen that a person possessing right view could treat any formation as permanent  there is no such possibility  And he understands It is possible that an ordinary person might treat some formation as permanent  there is such a possibility He understands It is impossible it cannot happen that a person possessing right view could treat any formation as pleasurable  there is no such possibility  And he understands It is possible that an ordinary person might treat some formation as pleasurable  there is such a possibilityHe understands It is impossible it carfnot happen that a person possessing right view could treat anything as self  there is no such possibility And he understands It is possible that an ordinary person might treat something as self  there is such a possibilityHe understands It is impossible it cannot happen that a person possessing right view could deprive his mother of life  there is no such possibility  And he understands It is possible that an ordinary person might deprive his mother of life  there is such a possibilityHe understands It is impossible it cannot happen that a person possessing right view could deprive his father of lifecould deprive an arahant of life  there is no such possibility And he understands It is possible that an ordinary person

hate shed a Tathagatas blood  there is no such possibility And he understands It is possible that an ordinary person might with a mind of hate shed a Tathagatas blood  there is such a possibilityHe understands It is impossible it cannot happen that a person possessing right view could cause a schism in the Sanghacould acknowledge another teacher  there is no such possibilityAnd he understands It is possible that an ordinary person might cause a schism in the Sanghamight acknowledge another teacher  there is such a possibilityHe understands It is impossible it cannot happen that two Accomplished Ones Fully Enlightened Ones could arise contemporaneously in one worldsystem  there is no such possibility   And he understands It is possible that one Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One might arise in one worldsystem  there is such a possibilityHe understands It is impossible it cannot happen that two Wheelturning Monarchs could arise contemporaneously in one

understands It is impossible it cannot happen that a woman could be a Wheelturning MonarchHe understands It is impossible it cannot happen that an unwished for undesired disagreeable result could be produced from good bodily conductHe understands It is impossible it cannot happen that a person engaging in bodily misconductAnd he understands It is possible that a person engaging in bodily misconductengaging in verbal misconductengaging in mental misconduct might on that account for that reason on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell  there is such a possibilityHe understands It is impossible it cannot happen that a person engaging in good bodily conductengaging in good verbal conduct engaging in good mental conduct could on that account for that reason on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell  there is no such possibilityAnd he understands It is possible that a person engaging in good bodily conductIn this way Ananda a bhikkhu can be called skilled in what is possible and what is impossibleWhen this was said the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellousWhat is the name of this discourse on the DhammaYou may remember this discourse on the Dhamma Ananda as The Many Kinds of Elements and as The Four Cycles and as The Mirror of the Dhamma and as The Drum of the Deathless and as The Supreme Victory in BattleThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsBhikkhus whatever fears arise all arise because of the fool not because of the wise man whatever troubles arise all arise because of the fool not because of the wise man whatever calamities arise all arise because of the fool not because of the wise manWhen he knows and sees these six internal and external bases a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the basesWhen a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understandingThen as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle This was said But why was it said While the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī it seems a certain deity came to him in the night and in order to do away with his doubtsThe inner tangle and the outer tangle This generation is entangled in a tangleAnd so I ask of Gotama this question Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle  he asked this question Here is the meaning in brief Tangle is a term for the network of cravingFor that is a tangle in the sense of lacing together like the tangle called network of branches in bamboo thickets etc because it goes on arising again and again up and down among the objects of consciousness beginning with what is visible But it is called the inner tangle and the outer tangle because it arises as craving for ones own requisites and anothers for ones own person and anothers and for the internal and external bases for consciousnessSince it arises in this way this generation is entangled in a tangleAs the bamboos etc are entangled by the bamboo tangle etc so too this generation in other words this order of living beings is all entangled by the tangle of cravingthe meaning is that it is intertwined interlaced by itAnd because it is entangled like thisHe addressed the Blessed One by his clan name as GotamaWho succeeds in disentangling this tangle who may disentangle this tangle that keeps the three kinds of existence entangled in this way What he asks is who is capable of disentangling itHowever when questioned thus the Blessed One whose knowledge of all things is unimpeded deity of deities excelling Sakka  excelling Brahmā fearless in the possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence wielder of the ten powers allseer with unobstructed knowledge in reply to explain the meaningWhen a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understandingThen as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangleuttered this stanza Of this same verse composed by the Great SageMy task is now to set out the true sense Divided into virtue and the restRight hard to find  There are here in the Victors Dispensation Seekers gone forth from home to homelessnessHave no right knowledge And who although desiring purityWho though they strive here gain no purityTo them pure in expositionsRelying on the teaching of the dwellers In the Great Monastery let all thoseI shall expound the comforting Path Of PurificationGood men who do desire purity Listen intently to my expositionHerein purification should be understood as Nibbāna which being devoid of all stains is utterly pureThe path of purification is the path to that purificationThe meaning is I shall expound that path of purificationIn some instances this path of purification is taught by insight aloneaccording as it is saidFormations are all impermanent When he sees thus with understandingAnd turns away from what is ill That is the path to purity And in some instances by jhāna and understandingHe is near unto Nibbāna In whom are jhāna and understanding And in some instances by deeds  etcBy deeds vision and righteousness By virtue the sublimest lifeBy these are mortals purified And not by lineage and wealth And in some instances by virtue etc according as it is saidHe who is possessed of constant virtueWho has understanding and is concentratedWho is strenuous and diligent as wellWill cross the flood so difficult to cross And in some instances by the foundations of mindfulness etc according as it is said Bhikkhus this path is the only way for the purification of beings  for the realization of Nibbāna that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness But in the answer to this question it is taught by virtue and the other twoHere is a brief commentary on the stanza Established well in virtue standing on virtue It is only one actually fulfilling virtue who is here said to stand on virtueSo the meaning here is this being established well in virtue by fulfilling virtueA man a living beingWise possessing the kind of understanding that is born of kamma by means of a rebirthlinking with triple rootcauseDevelops consciousness and understanding develops both concentration and insight For it is concentration that is described here under the heading of consciousnessand insight under that of understandingFor it is energy that is called ardour in the sense of burning up and consuming defilementsHe has that thus he is ardentSagacious it is understanding that is called sagacity possessing that is the meaningThis word shows protective understandingFor understanding is mentioned three times in the reply to the questionHerein the first is nave understanding the second is understanding consisting in insight while the third is the protective understanding that guides all affairsHe sees fear in the round of rebirths thus he is a bhikkhuHe succeeds in disentangling this tangle this bhikkhu who possesses the six things namely this virtue and this concentration described under the heading of consciousness and this threefold understanding and this ardourBut it is at the moment of the path that he is said to be disentangling that tangleThat is why the Blessed One saidWhen a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understandingThen as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangleHerein there is nothing for him to do about the nave understanding on account of which he is called wiseBut the words ardent and sagacious mean that by persevering with energy of the kind here described and by acting in full awareness with understanding he should having become well established in virtue develop the serenity and insight that are described as concentration and understanding This is how the Blessed One shows the path of purification under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding thereWhat has been shown so far is the three trainings the dispensation that is good in three ways the necessary condition for the threefold clearvision etc the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way the means to surmounting the states of loss etc the abandoning of defilements in three aspects prevention of transgression etc purification from the three kinds of defilements and the reason for the states of streamentry and so onHowHere the training of higher virtue is shown by virtue the training of higher consciousness by concentration and the training of higher understanding by understandingThe dispensations goodness in the beginning is shown by virtueBecause of the passage And what is the beginning of profitable things Virtue that is quite purified  and because of the passage beginning The not doing of any evil  virtue is the beginning of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of nonremorse and so onIts goodness in the middle is shown by concentrationBecause of the passage beginning Entering upon the profitable  concentration is the middle of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of supernormal power and so onIts goodness in the end is shown by understandingBecause of the passage The purifying of ones own mindthis is the Buddhas dispensation  and because understanding is its culmination understanding is the end of the dispensation And that is good because it brings about equipoise with respect to the desired and the undesiredJust as a solid massive rock Remains unshaken by the windSo too in face of blame and praise The wise remain immovable For this is said Likewise the necessary condition for the triple clearvision is shown by virtueFor with the support of perfected virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear vision but nothing besides thatThe necessary condition for the six kinds of direct knowledge is shown by concentrationFor with the support of perfected concentration one arrives at the six kinds of directknowledge but nothing besides thatThe necessary condition for the categories of discrimination is shown by understandingFor with the support of perfected understanding one arrives at the four kinds of discrimination but not for any other reasonAnd the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of sense desires is shown by virtue The avoidance of the extreme called devotion to mortification of self is shown by concentrationThe cultivation of the middle way is shown by understandingLikewise the means for surmounting the states of loss is shown by virtue the means for surmounting the element of sense desires by concentration and the means for surmounting all becoming by understandingAnd the abandoning of defilements by substitution of opposites is shown by virtue that by suppression is shown by concentration and that by cutting off is shown by understandingLikewise prevention of defilements transgression is shown by virtue prevention of obsession is shown by concentration prevention of inherent tendencies is shown by understandingAnd purification from the defilement of misconduct is shown by virtue purification from the defilement of craving by concentration and purification from the defilement of views by understandingLikewise the reason for the states of streamentry and oncereturn is shown by virtue that for the state of nonreturn by concentration that for Arahantship by understandingFor the streamenterer is called perfected in the kinds of virtue and likewise the oncereturnerBut the nonreturner is called perfected in concentrationSo thus far these nine and other like triads of special qualities have been shown that is the three trainings the dispensation that is good in three ways the necessary condition for the threefold clearvision the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way the means for surmounting the states of loss etc the abandoning of defilements in three aspects prevention of transgression etc purification from the three kinds of defilements and the reason for the states of streamentry and so onso I ask of Gotama this question that is why I ask thisof the sure straight way Comprising virtue and the other two that leads to purityit is the means of approach that is called the pathaccording as it is saidaccording as it is saidand similarly in the case of the right efforts and so onArdent  possessing energyJust as a man standing on the ground and taking up a wellsharpened knife might disentangle a great tangle of bamboos so too hestanding on the ground of virtue and taking up with the hand of protectiveunderstanding exerted by the power of energy the knife of insightunderstanding wellsharpened on the stone of concentration might disentangle cut away and demolish all the tangle of craving that had overgrown his own lifes continuityat the moment of fruition he has disentangled the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings in the world with its deitiesfor that has been established in him simply by the influence of previous kammaAnd the Arahant is called perfected in understanding From a visible datum sometimes as far down as a mental datum or vice versafollowing the order of the six kinds of objects of consciousness as given in the teachingThe words insight alone are meant to exclude but serenity  This is for emphasisAnd again insight should be understood as the three contemplations of impermanence pain and notself not contemplation of impermanence alonefor no insight comes about without momentary concentrationfor concentration is classed as both access and absorption  Taking this stanza as the teaching for one whose vehicle is insight does not imply that there is no concentrationBut the word alone actually excludes only that concentration with distinction of jhānanot virtue etc which is the opposite number in the pair serenity and insightHowever even when this path of purification is shown in this way under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding each comprising various special qualities it is still only shown extremely brieflyAnd so since that is insufficient to help all there is in order to show it in detail the following set of questions dealing in the first place with virtue What is virtue In what sense is it virtue What are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause What are the benefits of virtue How many kinds of virtue are there What is the defiling of it What is the cleansing of itHere are the answers WHAT IS VIRTUE It is the states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from killing living things etc or in one who fulfils the practice of the dutiesFor this is said in the Paṭisambhidā What is virtue There is virtue as volition virtue as consciousnessconcomitant virtue as restraint virtue as non transgression Herein virtue as volition is the volition present in one who abstains from killing living things etc or in one who fulfils the practice of the dutiesVirtue as consciousness concomitant is the abstinence in one who abstains from killing living things and so onFurthermore virtue as volition is the seven volitions that accompany the first seven of the ten courses of action in one who abandons the killing of living things and so onVirtue as consciousnessconcomitant is the three remaining states consisting of noncovetousness nonill will and right view stated in the way beginning Abandoning covetousness he dwells with a mind free from covetousness Virtue as restraint should be understood here as restraint in five ways restraint by the rules of the community  restraint by mindfulness restraint by knowledge restraint by patience and restraint by energyHerein restraint by the Pātimokkha is this He is furnished fully furnished with this Pātimokkha restraintRestraint by mindfulness is this He guards the eye faculty enters upon restraint of the eye faculty and use of requisites is here combined with thisBut what is called restraint by patience is that given in the way beginning He is one who bears cold and heat And what is called restraint by energy is that given in the way beginning He does not endure a thought of sense desires when it arises So this fivefold restraint and the abstinence in clansmen who dread evil from any chance of transgression met with should all be understood to be virtue as restraintVirtue as nontransgression is the nontransgression by body or speech of precepts of virtue that have been undertakenThis in the first place is the answer to the question What is virtue Now as to the rest  IN WHAT SENSE IS IT VIRTUE It is virtue in the sense of composing What is this composingIt is either a coordinating  meaning non inconsistency of bodily action etc due to virtuousnessFor those who understand etymology admit only these two meaningsOthers however comment on the meaning here in the way beginning The meaning of virtue is the meaning of head  the meaning of virtue is the meaning of cool  Now WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION MANIFESTATION AND PROXIMATE CAUSE HereThe characteristic of it is composing Even when analyzed in various waysAs visibility is of visible data Even when analyzed in various waysJust as visibleness is the characteristic of the visibledata base even when analyzed into the various categories of blue yellow etc because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed visiblenessso also this same composing described above as the coordinating of bodily action etc and as the foundation of profitable states is the characteristic of virtue even when analyzed into the various categories of volition etc because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed the state of coordination and foundationWhile such is its characteristicAction to stop misconduct then Of blamelessness in virtuous menAchievement as the quality Its function has a double senseSo what is called virtue should be understood to have the function of stopping misconduct as its function in the sense of action and a blameless function as its function in the sense of achievementFor under these headings of characteristic etc it is action or it is achievement that is called function Now virtue so say those who know Itself as purity will showAnd for its proximate cause they tell The pair conscience and shame as wellThis virtue is manifested as the kinds of purity stated thus Bodily purity verbal purity mental purity  it is manifested comes to be apprehended as a pure stateBut conscience and shame are said by those who know to be its proximate cause its near reason is the meaningFor when conscience and shame are in existence virtue arises and persistsand when they are not it neither arises nor persistsThis is how virtues characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause should be understoodRestraint by knowledge is this The currents in the world that flow Ajita said the Blessed OneAre stemmed by means of mindfulnessRestraint of currents I proclaim By understanding they are dammed purification of livelihood is here combined with thisor it is an upholding  meaning a state of basis owing to its serving as foundation for profitable states WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF VIRTUE Its benefits are the acquisition of the several special qualities beginning with nonremorseFor this is said nanda profitable habits have nonremorse as their aim and nonremorse as their benefit Also it is said further Householder there are these five benefits for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueWhat fiveHere householder one who is virtuous possessed of virtue obtains a large fortune as a consequence of diligence this is the first benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueAgain of one who is virtuous possessed of virtue a fair name is spread abroad this is the second benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueAgain whenever one who is virtuous possessed of virtue enters an assembly whether of khattiyas or brahmans or householders or ascetics he does so without fear or hesitation this is the third benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueAgain one who is virtuous possessed of virtue dies unconfused this is the fourth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtueAgain one who is virtuous possessed of virtue on the breakup of the body after death reappears in a happy destiny in the heavenly world this is the fifth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue There are also the many benefits of virtue beginning with being dear and loved and ending with destruction of cankers described in the passage beginning If a bhikkhu should wish May I be dear to my fellows in the life of purity and loved by them held in respect and honoured by them let him perfect the virtues This is how virtue has as its benefits the several special qualities beginning with nonremorseFurthermoreWithout which virtue clansmen find No footing in the dispensationDare anyone a limit place On benefits that virtue bringsNo Ganges and no Yamunā No Sarabhū SarassathīOr flowing Aciravatī Or noble River of MahīIs able to wash out the stain In things that breathe here in the worldFor only virtues water can Wash out the stain in living thingsNo breezes that come bringing rain No balm of yellow sandalwoodNo necklaces beside or gems Or soft effulgence of moonbeamsCan here avail to calm and soothe Mens fevers in this world whereasThis noble this supremely cool Wellguarded virtue quells the flameWhere is there to be found the scent That can with virtues scent compareAnd that is borne against the wind As easily as with itWhere Can such another stair be found That climbs as virtue does to heavenOr yet another door that gives Onto the City of NibbānaShine as they may there are no kings Adorned with jewellery and pearlsThat shine as does a man restrained Adorned with virtues ornamentVirtue entirely does away With dread of selfblame and the likeTheir virtue to the virtuous Gives gladness always by its fameThis root of all good qualities Robs of its power every faultFrom this brief sketch it may be known How virtue brings reward and how Now here is the answer to the question HOW MANY KINDS OF VIRTUE ARE THEREFirstly all this virtue is of one kind by reason of its own characteristic of composingIt is of two kinds as keeping and avoidingLikewise as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of purity As abstinence and nonabstinence As dependent and independent As temporary and lifelong As limited and unlimited As mundane and supramundaneIt is of three kinds as inferior medium and superiorLikewise as giving precedence to self giving precedence to the world and giving precedence to the Dhamma As adhered to not adhered to and tranquillized As purified unpurified and dubious As that of the trainer that of the nontrainer and that of the neithertrainer nornontrainerIt is of five kinds as virtue consisting in limited purification etcLikewise as abandoning refraining volition restraint and nontransgressionHerein in the section dealing with that of one kind the meaning should be understood as already statedIn the section dealing with that of two kinds fulfilling a training precept announced by the Blessed One thus This should be done is keepingHerein the word meaning is thisHerein keeping is accomplished by faith and energy avoiding by faith and mindfulnessThis is how it is of two kinds as keeping and avoidingIn the second dyad good behaviour is the best kind of behaviourGood behaviour itself is that of good behaviourThis is a term for virtue other than that which has livelihood as eighth It is the initial stage of the life of purity consisting in the path thus it is that of the beginning of the life of purity This is a term for the virtue that has livelihood as eighthIt is the initial stage of the path because it has actually to be purified in the prior stage tooHence it is said But his bodily action his verbal action and his livelihood have already been purified earlier Or the training precepts called lesser and minor are that of good behaviourOr what is included in the Double Code is that of the beginning of the life of purityThrough its perfection that of the beginning of the life of purity comes to be perfectedHence it is said also that this bhikkhu shall fulfil the state consisting in the beginning of the life of purity without having fulfilled the state consisting in good behaviourthat is not possible So it is of two kinds as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of purityIn the third dyad virtue as abstinence is simply abstention from killing living things etcthe other kinds consisting in volition etc are virtue as nonabstinence So it is of two kinds as abstinence and nonabstinenceIn the fourth dyad there are two kinds of dependence dependence through craving and dependence through false viewsHerein that produced by one who wishes for a fortunate kind of becoming thus Through this virtuous conduct rite I shall become a great deity or some minor deity  is dependent through cravingThat produced through such false view about purification as Purification is through virtuous conduct is dependent through false viewBut the supramundane and the mundane that is the prerequisite for the aforesaid supramundane are independent So it is of two kinds as dependent and independentIn the fifth dyad temporary virtue is that undertaken after deciding on a time limitLifelong virtue is that practiced in the same way but undertaking it for as long as life lasts So it is of two kinds as temporary and lifelongIn the sixth dyad the limited is that seen to be limited by gain fame relatives limbs or lifeThe opposite is unlimitedAnd this is said in the Paṭisambhidā What is the virtue that has a limitThere is virtue that has gain as its limit there is virtue that has fame as its limit there is virtue that has relatives as its limit there is virtue that has limbs as its limit there is virtue that has life as its limitWhat is virtue that has gain as its limitHere someone with gain as cause with gain as condition with gain as reason transgresses a training precept as undertaken that virtue has gain as its limit Also in the answer dealing with the unlimited it is said What is virtue that does not have gain as its limitHere someone does not with gain as cause with gain as condition with gain as reason even arouse the thought of transgressing a training precept as undertaken how then shall he actually transgress it That virtue does not have gain as its limit and the rest should be elaborated in the same waySo it is of two kinds as limited and unlimitedIn the seventh dyad all virtue subject to cankers is mundaneHerein the mundane brings about improvement in future becoming and is a prerequisite for the escape from becomingThe supramundane brings about the escape from becoming and is the plane of reviewing knowledge So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundaneIn the first of the triads the inferior is produced by inferior zeal purity of consciousness energy or inquiryThat undertaken out of desire for fame is inferiorOr again that defiled by selfpraise and disparagement of others etc thus I am possessed of virtue but these other bhikkhus are illconducted and evilnatured  is inferiorthat practiced for the purpose of ones own deliverance is mediumthe virtue of the perfections practiced for the deliverance of all beings is superior So it is of three kinds as inferior medium and superiorIn the second triad that practiced out of selfregard by one who regards self and desires to abandon what is unbecoming to self is virtue giving precedence to selfThat practiced out of regard for the world and out of desire to ward off the censure of the world is virtue giving precedence to the worldThat practiced out of regard for the Dhamma and out of desire to honour the majesty of the Dhamma is virtue giving precedence to the Dhamma So it is of three kinds as giving precedence to self and so onIn the third triad the virtue that in the dyads was called dependent is adheredto because it is adheredto through craving and false viewThat practiced by the magnanimous ordinary man as the prerequisite of the path and that associated with the path in trainers are notadheredtoThat associated with trainers and nontrainers fruition is tranquillized So it is of three kinds as adheredto and so onIn the fourth triad that fulfilled by one who has committed no offence or has made amends after committing one is pureSo long as he has not made amends after committing an offence it is impureVirtue in one who is dubious about whether a thing constitutes an offence or about what grade of offence has been committed or about whether he has committed an offence is dubiousHerein the meditator should purify impure virtue If dubious he should avoid cases about which he is doubtful and should get his doubts cleared up In this way his mind will be kept at rest So it is of three kinds as pure and so onIn the fifth triad the virtue associated with the four paths and with the first three fruitions is that of the trainerThat associated with the fruition of Arahantship is that of the nontrainerThe remaining kinds are that of the neither trainernornontrainer So it is of three kinds as that of the trainer and so onBut in the world the nature of such and such beings is called their habit of which they say This one is of happy habit  this one is of unhappy habit this one is of quarrelsome habit this one is of dandified habit Because of that it is said in the Paṭisambhidā figuratively Three kinds of virtue  profitable virtue unprofitable virtue indeterminate virtue So it is also called of three kinds as profitable and so onOf these the unprofitable is not included here since it has nothing whatever to do with the headings beginning with the characteristic which define virtue in the sense intended in this chapter So the threefoldness should be understood only in the way already statedIn the first of the tetradsThe unvirtuous he cultivates He visits not the virtuousAnd in his ignorance he sees No fault in a transgression hereWith wrong thoughts often in his mind His faculties he will not guardVirtue in such a constitution Comes to partake of diminutionBut he whose mind is satisfied With virtue that has been achievedWho never thinks to stir himself And take a meditation subject upContented with mere virtuousness Nor striving for a higher stateHis virtue bears the appellation Of that partaking of stagnationBut who possessed of virtue strives With concentration for his aimThat bhikkhus virtue in its function Is called partaking of distinctionWho finds mere virtue not enough But has dispassion for his goalHis virtue through such aspiration Comes to partake of penetrationSo it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution and so onIn the second tetrad there are training precepts announced for bhikkhus to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhunīs This is the virtue of bhikkhusThere are training precepts announced for bhikkhunīs to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhus This is the virtue of bhikkhunīsThe ten precepts of virtue for male and female novices are the virtue of the not fully admittedThe five training preceptsten when possibleas a permanent undertaking and eight as the factors of the Uposatha Day for male and female lay followers are the virtue of the laity So it is of four kinds as the virtue of bhikkhus and so onIn the third tetrad the nontransgression on the part of Uttarakuru human beings is natural virtueEach clans or localitys or sects own rules of conduct are customary virtueThe virtue of the Bodhisattas mother described thus It is the necessary rule nanda that when the Bodhisatta has descended into his mothers womb no thought of men that is connected with the cords of sense desire comes to her  is necessary virtueBut the virtue of such pure beings as Mahā Kassapa etc and of the Bodhisatta in his various births is virtue due to previous causes So it is of four kinds as natural virtue and so onIn the fourth tetrad The virtue described by the Blessed One thus Here a bhikkhu dwells restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint possessed of the proper conduct and resort and seeing fear in the slightest fault he trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training  is virtue of Pātimokkha restraint That described thus On seeing a visible object with the eye he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which if he left the eye faculty unguarded evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him he enters upon the way of its restraint he guards the eye faculty undertakes the restraint of the eye facultyOn hearing a sound with the ear  On smelling an odour with the nose  On tasting a flavour with the tongue  On touching a tangible object with the body  On cognizing a mental object with the mind he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which if he left the mind faculty unguarded evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him he enters upon the way of its restraint he guards the mind faculty undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty  is virtue of restraint of the sense faculties Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as entails transgression of the six training precepts announced with respect to livelihood and entails the evil states beginning with Scheming talking hinting belittling pursuing gain with gain is virtue of livelihood purification Use of the four requisites that is purified by the reflection stated in the way beginning Reflecting wisely he uses the robe only for protection from cold is called virtue concerning requisitesIt is of four kinds as partaking of diminution of stagnation of distinction of penetrationLikewise as that of bhikkhus of bhikkhunīs of the notfullyadmitted of the laity As natural customary necessary due to previous causes As virtue of Pātimokkha restraint of restraint of sense faculties of purification of livelihood and that concerning requisitesfor this is said in the Paṭisambhidā Five kinds of virtue virtue consisting in limited purification virtue consisting in unlimited purification virtue consisting in fulfilled purification virtue consisting in unadheredto purification virtue consisting in tranquillized purification not doing what is prohibited by him thus This should not be done is avoidingthey keep within that they proceed as people who fulfil the virtues thus it is keeping they preserve they protect they avoid thus it is avoidingor what is announced for the sake of good behaviour is that of good behaviourthe rest are that of the beginning of the life of purityand that included in the duties set out in the Khandhakas of Vinaya is that of good behaviourand the rest should be elaborated in the same waythat not subject to cankers is supramundaneaccording as it is said Discipline is for the purpose of restraint restraint is for the purpose of non remorse nonremorse is for the purpose of gladdening gladdening is for the purpose of happiness happiness is for the purpose of tranquillity tranquillity is for the purpose of bliss bliss is for the purpose of concentration concentration is for the purpose of correct knowledge and vision correct knowledge and vision is for the purpose of dispassion dispassion is for the purpose of fading away of greed fading away is for the purpose of deliverance deliverance is for the purpose of knowledge and vision of deliverance knowledge and vision of deliverance is for the purpose of complete extinction of craving etc through not clinging Talk has that purpose counsel has that purpose support has that purpose giving ear has that purpose that is to say the liberation of the mind through not clinging the medium is produced by medium zeal etcthe superior by superior that undertaken out of desire for the fruits of merit is mediumthat undertaken for the sake of the noble state thus This has to be done is superiorundefiled mundane virtue is mediumsupramundane is superiorOr again that motivated by craving the purpose of which is to enjoy continued existence is inferiorHere is an explanatory exposition together with a word commentary starting from the beginning Here in this dispensationA bhikkhu a clansman who has gone forth out of faith and is so styled because he sees fear in the round of rebirths or because he wears cloth garments that are torn and pieced together and so onRestrained with the Pātimokkha restraint here Pātimokkha  is the virtue of the training preceptsRestraint is restraining this is a term for bodily and verbal nontransgressionThe Pātimokkha itself as restraint is Pātimokkha restraintRestrained with the Pātimokkha restraint is restrained by means of the restraint consisting in that Pātimokkha he has it possesses it is the meaningDwells bears himself in one of the posturesThe meaning of possessed of the proper conduct and resort etc should be understood in the way in which it is given in the textFor this is saidHerein what is improper conductBodily transgression verbal transgression bodily and verbal transgressionthis is called improper conductAlso all unvirtuousness is improper conductHere someone makes a livelihood by gifts of bamboos or by gifts of leaves or by gifts of flowers fruits bathing powder and tooth sticks or by flattery or by beansoupery or by fondling or by going on errands on foot or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhasthis is called improper conductHerein what is proper conductBodily nontransgression verbal nontransgression bodily and verbal nontransgression this is called proper conductAlso all restraint through virtue is proper conductHere someone does not make a livelihood by gifts of bamboos or by gifts of leaves or by gifts of flowers fruits bathing powder and tooth sticks or by flattery or by beansoupery or by fondling or by going on errands on foot or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhasthis is called proper conductProper resort there is proper resort and improper resortHerein what is improper resortHere someone has prostitutes as resort or he has widows old maids eunuchs bhikkhunīs or taverns as resort or he dwells associated with kings kings ministers sectarians sectarians disciples in unbecoming association with laymen or he cultivates frequents honours such families as are faithless untrusting abusive and rude who wish harm wish ill wish woe wish no surcease of bondage for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs for male and female devotees this is called improper resortHerein what is proper resortHere someone does not have prostitutes as resort  or taverns as resort he does not dwell associated with kings  sectarians disciples in unbecoming association with laymen he cultivates frequents honours such families as are faithful and trusting who are a solace where the yellow cloth glows where the breeze of sages blows who wish good wish well wish joy wish surcease of bondage for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs for male and female devoteesthis is called proper resortThus he is furnished with fully furnished with provided with fully provided with supplied with possessed of endowed with this proper conduct and this proper resort Hence it is said Possessed of the proper conduct and resort Furthermore proper conduct and resort should also be understood here in the following wayHerein what is bodily improper conductHere someone acts disrespectfully before the Community and he stands jostling elder bhikkhus sits jostling them stands in front of them sits in front of them sits on a high seat sits with his head covered talks standing up talks waving his arms  walks with sandals while elder bhikkhus walk without sandals walks on a high walk while they walk on a low walk walks on a walk while they walk on the ground  stands pushing elder bhikkhus sits pushing them prevents new bhikkhus from getting a seat  and in the bath house  without asking elder bhikkhus he puts wood on the stove  bolts the door  and at the bathing place he enters the water jostling elder bhikkhus enters it in front of them bathes jostling them bathes in front of them comes out jostling them comes out in front of them  and entering inside a house he goes jostling elder bhikkhus goes in front of them pushing forward he goes in front of them  and where families have inner private screened rooms in which the women of the family  the girls of the family sit there he enters abruptly and he strokes a childs head  This is called bodily improper conductHerein what is verbal improper conductHere someone acts disrespectfully before the Community Without asking elder bhikkhus he talks on the Dhammaanswers questions recites the Pātimokkha talks standing up talks waving his arms  having entered inside a house he speaks to a woman or a girl thus You so andso of suchandsuch a clan what is there Is there rice gruel Is there cooked rice Is there any hard food to eat What shall we drink What hard food shall we eat What soft food shall we eatOr what will you give me he chatters like this  This is called verbal improper conductProper conduct should be understood in the opposite sense to thatFurthermore a bhikkhu is respectful deferential possessed of conscience and shame wears his inner robe properly wears his upper robe properly his manner inspires confidence whether in moving forwards or backwards looking ahead or aside bending or stretching his eyes are downcast he has deportment he guards the doors of his sense faculties knows the right measure in eating is devoted to wakefulness possesses mindfulness and full awareness wants little is contented is strenuous is a careful observer of good behaviour and treats the teachers with great respect This is called conductThis firstly is how conduct should be understoodfor it frees him who protects it guards it it sets him free from the pains of the states of loss etc that is why it is called PātimokkhaPossessed of the proper conduct and resort there is proper conduct and improper conductfor improper conduct is twofold as bodily and verbal resort is of three kinds resort as support resort as guarding and resort as anchoringHerein what is resort as supportA good friend who exhibits the instances of talk in whose presence one hears what has not been heard corrects what has been heard gets rid of doubt rectifies ones view and gains confidenceor by training under whom one grows in faith virtue learning generosity and understandingthis is called resort as supportWhat is resort as guardingHere A bhikkhu having entered inside a house having gone into a street goes with downcast eyes seeing the length of a plough yoke restrained not looking at an elephant not looking at a horse a carriage a pedestrian a woman a man not looking up not looking down not staring this way and that  This is called resort as guardingWhat is resort as anchoringIt is the four foundations of mindfulness on which the mind is anchoredfor this is said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus what is a bhikkhus resort his own native placeIt is these four foundations of mindfulness  This is called resort as anchoringBeing thus furnished with  endowed with this conduct and this resorthe is also on that account called one possessed of conduct and resortSeeing fear in the slightest fault  one who has the habit of seeing fear in faults of the minutest measure of such kinds as unintentional contravening of a minor training rule of the Pātimokkha or the arising of unprofitable thoughtsHe trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training whatever there is among the precepts of training to be trained in in all that he trains by taking it up rightly And here as far as the words one restrained by the Pātimokkha restraint virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is shown by discourse in terms of personsBut all that beginning with the words possessed of proper conduct and resort should be understood as said in order to show the way of practice that perfects that virtue in him who so practices it Now as regards the virtue of livelihood purification mentioned above next to the virtue of restraint of the faculties  the words of the six precepts announced on account of livelihood mean of the following six training precepts announced thus With livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason one of evil wishes a prey to wishes lays claim to a higher than human state that is nonexistent not a fact the contravention of which is defeat with livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason one who is not sick eats curry or boiled rice that he has ordered for his own use the contravention of which is an offence of wrongdoing  Of these six preceptsAs regards scheming etc  this is the text Herein what is schemingIt is the grimacing grimacery scheming schemery schemedness by what is called rejection of requisites or by indirect talk or it is the disposing posing composing of the deportment on the part of one bent on gain honour and renown of one of evil wishes a prey to wishesthis is called schemingHerein what is talkingTalking at others talking talking round talking up continual talking up persuading continual persuading suggesting

one who wants to show qualities that he has not gotA prey to wishes the meaning is of one who is attacked by themAnd after this the passage beginning or by what is called rejection of requisites is given in order to show the three instances of scheming given in the Mahāniddesa as rejection of requisites indirect talk and that based on deportmentHerein a bhikkhu is invited to accept robes etc and precisely because he wants them he refuses them out of evil wishes And then since he knows that those householders believe in him implicitly when they think Oh how few are our lords wishes He will not accept a thing  and they put fine robes etc before him by various means he then accepts making a show that he wants to be compassionate towards themit is this hypocrisy of his which becomes the cause of their subsequently bringing them even by cartloads that should be understood as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisitesFor this is said in the MahāniddesaWhat is the instance of scheming called rejection of requisitesHere householders invite bhikkhus to accept robes alms food resting place and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sickOne who is of evil wishes a prey to wishes wanting robes  alms food  resting place  the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick refuses robes He says What has an ascetic to do with expensive robes It is proper for an ascetic to gather rags from a charnel ground or from a rubbish heap or from a shop and make them into a patchwork cloak to wearWhat has an ascetic to do with expensive alms food It is proper for an ascetic to get his living by the dropping of lumps of food into his bowl while he wanders for gleaningsWhat has an ascetic to do with an expensive resting place It is proper for an ascetic to be a treerootdweller or an openairdwellerWhat has an ascetic to do with an expensive requisite of medicine as cure for the sick It is proper for an ascetic to cure himself with putrid urine and broken gallnutsAccordingly he wears a coarse robe eats coarse alms food uses a coarse resting place uses a coarse requisite of medicine as cure for the sick Then householders think This ascetic has few wishes is content is secluded keeps aloof from company is strenuous is a preacher of asceticismand they invite him more and more to accept robes alms food resting places and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sickHe says With three things present a faithful clansman produces much meritYou have faith the goods to be given are here and I am here to accept If I do not accept then you will be deprived of the merit That is no good to meRather will I accept out of compassion for youAccordingly he accepts many robesSuch grimacing grimacery scheming schemery schemedness is known as the

state of the act of fondlingFor when a man fondles children on his lap or on his shoulder like a nursehe nurses is the meaningThe state of the act of fondling is fondlingIn the description of hinting  a sign is any bodily or verbal act that gets others to give requisitesGiving a sign is making a sign such as What have you got to eat  etc on seeing people going along with foodIndication is talk that alludes to requisitesGiving indication on seeing cowboys he asks Are these milk cows calves or buttermilk cows calves  and when it is said They are milk cows calves venerable sir he remarks They are not milk cows calves If they were milk cows calves the bhikkhus would be getting milk etc and his getting it to the knowledge of the boys parents in this way and so making them give milk is giving indicationIndirect talk is talk that keeps near to the subjectAnd here there should be told the story of the bhikkhu supported by a familyA bhikkhu it seems who was supported by a family went into the house wanting to eat and sat downThe mistress of the house was unwilling to give On seeing him she said There is no rice and she went to a neighbours house as though to get riceThe bhikkhu went into the storeroom Looking round he saw sugarcane in the corner behind the door sugar in a bowl a string of salt fish in a basket rice in a jar and ghee in a pot He came out and sat downWhen the housewife came back she said I did not get any rice I saw a snake that was like sugarcane put in the corner behind the door looking for something to hit it with I saw a stone like a lump of sugar in a bowl When the snake had been hit with the clod it spread out a hood like a string of salt fish in a basket and its teeth as it tried to bite the clod were like rice grains in a jar Then the saliva mixed with poison that came out to its mouth in its fury was like ghee put in a potShe thought There is no hoodwinking the shaveling so she gave him the sugarcane and she cooked the rice and gave it all to him with the ghee the sugar and the fishSuch talk that keeps near to the subject should be understood as indirect talkRoundabout talk is talking round and round the subject as much as is allowedIn the description of belittling abusing is abusing by means of the ten instances of abuseReproaching is enumeration of faults such as He is faithless he is an unbelieverSnubbing is taking up verbally thus Dont say that hereOr alternatively when someone does not give taking him up thus Oh the prince of givers is snubbingand the thorough snubbing thus A mighty prince of givers  is continual

denigrationTalebearing is bearing tales from house to house from village to village from district to district thinking So they will give to me out of fear of my bearing talesThis is called belittling because it scrapes off  wipes off the virtuous qualities of others as a bamboo scraper does unguent or because it is a pursuit of gain by grinding and pulverizing others virtuous qualities like the pursuit of perfume by grinding perfumed substances that is why it is called belittlingIn the description of pursuing gain with gain pursuing is hunting afterGot from here is got from this houseThere is into that houseSeeking is wantingSeeking for is hunting afterSeeking out is hunting after again and againThe story of the bhikkhu who went round giving away the alms he had got at first to children of families here and there and in the end got milk and gruel should be told hereSearching etc are synonyms for seeking etc going in search of is seekingThis is the meaning of scheming and so onNow as regards the words The evil states beginning with  here the words beginning with should be understood to include the many evil states given in the Brahmajāla Sutta in the way beginning Or just as some worthy ascetics while eating the food given by the faithful make a living by wrong livelihood by such low arts as theseSo this wrong livelihood entails the transgression of these six training precepts announced on account of livelihood and it entails the evil states beginning with Scheming talking hinting belittling pursuing gain with gain And so it is the abstinence from all sorts of wrong livelihood that is virtue of livelihood purificationWhat is that It is the effort consisting in the search for requisitesPurification is purifiednessLivelihood purification is purification of livelihoodwith livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason he acts as gobetween the contravention of which is an offence entailing a meeting of the Orderwith livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason he says A bhikkhu who lives in your monastery is an Arahant the contravention of which is a serious offence in one who is aware of itwith livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason a bhikkhu who is not sick eats superior food that he has ordered for his own use the contravention of which is an offence requiring expiationWith livelihood as cause with livelihood as reason a bhikkhunī who is not sick eats superior food that she has ordered for her own use the contravention of which is an offence requiring confessionor carrying here goods that have been got from there by one bent on gain honour and renown by one of evil wishes a prey to wishesthis is called pursuing gain with gain Firstly as regards description of scheming on the part of one bent on gain honour and renown is on the part of one who is bent on gain on honour and on reputation on the part of one who longs for them is the meaningalms food  resting place the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick because he wants morewith faith present a faithful clansman produces much meritwith goods to be given present a faithful clansman produces much merit with those worthy to receive present a faithful clansman produces much merithe accepts much alms food he accepts many resting places he accepts many requisites of medicine as cure for the sickaccording as it is saidWhat is the instance of scheming called indirect talkhe who lives in such a monastery leanto mansion villa cave grotto hut pavilion watch tower hall barn meeting hall room at such a tree root is a very important asceticTalking is the same kind of talking on being asked a questionContinual talking up is talking by extolling people in all waysIs the sugarcane sweet thereIt is not allowed lay follower for bhikkhus to say Give me some sugarcaneif there is anything to be given there they give it to me only pointing to is what is meantSuggesting in all ways again and again is continual suggestingfor just as when beans are being cooked only a few do not get cooked the rest get cooked so too the person in whose speech only a little is true the rest being false is called a bean souphis state is beansouperythat fondlers act is the act of fondlingThe bhikkhu said Lay follower I saw a sign just now that alms will not be easy to get todayWhat venerable sirDisparaging is contemptuous talkSnubbing in all ways giving grounds and reasons is continual snubbingBackbiting is speaking censoriously behind anothers back after speaking kindly to his facefor this is like biting the flesh of anothers back when he is not looking on the part of one who is unable to look him in the face therefore it is called backbitingsearching for is seeking for searching out is seeking outand so the construction here should be understood thus that is to say by palmistry by fortunetelling by divining omens by interpreting dreams marks on the body holes gnawed by mice by fire sacrifice by spoon oblation  the wordmeaning of which is thison account of it they live thus it is livelihoodPutrid urine is the name for all kinds of cows urine whether old or not So in this fourfold virtue Pātimokkha restraint has to be undertaken by means of faithFor that is accomplished by faith since the announcing of training precepts is outside the disciples provinceHaving therefore undertaken through faith the training precepts without exception as announced one should completely perfect them without regard for lifeFor this is saidAs a hen guards her eggs Or as a yak her tailOr like a darling child Or like an only eyeSo you who are engaged Your virtue to protectBe prudent at all times And ever scrupulous Also it is said further So too sire when a training precept for disciples is announced by me my disciples do not transgress it even for the sake of life And the story of the elders bound by robbers in the forest should be understood in this senseIt seems that robbers in the Mahāvaṭṭanī Forest bound an elder with black creepers and made him lie downWhile he lay there for seven days he augmented his insight and after reaching the fruition of nonreturn he died there and was reborn in the BrahmāworldAlso they bound another elder in Tambapaṇṇi Island with string creepers and made him lie downWhen a forest fire came and the creepers were not cut he established insight and attained Nibbāna simultaneously with his deathWhen the Elder Abhaya a preacher of the Dīgha Nikāya passed by with five hundred bhikkhus he saw what had happened and he had the elders body cremated and a shrine builtTherefore let other clansmen alsoMaintain the rules of conduct pure Renouncing life if there be needRather than break virtues restraint By the Worlds Saviour decreed And as Pātimokkha restraint is undertaken out of faith so restraint of the sense faculties should be undertaken with mindfulnessFor that is accomplished by mindfulness because when the sense faculties functions are founded on mindfulness there is no liability to invasion by covetousness and the restSo recollecting the Fire Discourse which begins thus Better bhikkhus the extirpation of the eye faculty by a redhot burning blazing glowing iron spike than the apprehension of signs in the particulars of visible objects cognizable by the eye  this restraint should be properly undertaken by preventing with unremitting mindfulness any apprehension in the objective fields consisting of visible data etc of any signs etc likely to encourage covetousness etc to invade consciousness occurring in connection with the eye door and so onWhen not undertaken thus virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is unenduring it does not last like a crop not fenced in with branchesAnd it is raided by the robber defilements as a village with open gates is by thievesAnd lust leaks into his mind as rain does into a badlyroofed houseFor this is saidAmong the visible objects sounds and smellsAnd tastes and tangibles guard the facultiesFor when these doors are open and unguardedThen thieves will come and raid as twere a village And just as with an illroofed house The rain comes leaking in so tooWill lust come leaking in for sure Upon an undeveloped mind When it is undertaken thus virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is enduring it lasts like a crop well fenced in with branchesAnd it is not raided by the robber defilements as a village with wellguarded gates is not by thievesAnd lust does not leak into his mind as rain does not into a wellroofed houseFor this is saidAmong the visible objects sounds and smellsAnd tastes and tangibles guard the facultiesFor when these doors are closed and truly guardedThieves will not come and raid as twere a village And just as with a wellroofed house No rain comes leaking in so tooNo lust comes leaking in for sure Upon a welldeveloped mind This however is the teaching at its very highestThis mind is called quickly transformed  so restraint of the faculties should be undertaken by removing arisen lust with the contemplation of foulness as was done by the Elder Vaṅgīsa soon after he had gone forthAs the elder was wandering for alms it seems soon after going forth lust arose in him on seeing a womanThereupon he said to the venerable nandaI am afire with sensual lust And burning flames consume my mindIn pity tell me Gotama How to extinguish it for good The elder saidYou do perceive mistakenly That burning flames consume your mindLook for no sign of beauty there For that it is which leads to lustSee foulness there and keep your mind Harmoniously concentratedFormations see as alien As ill not self so this great lustMay be extinguished and no more Take fire thus ever and again The elder expelled his lust and then went on with his alms roundMoreover a bhikkhu who is fulfilling restraint of the faculties should be like the Elder Cittagutta resident in the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka and like the Elder Mahā Mitta resident at the Great Monastery of CorakaIn the Great Cave of Kuraṇḍaka it seems there was a lovely painting of the Renunciation of the Seven Buddhas A number of bhikkhus wandering about among the dwellings saw the painting and said What a lovely painting venerable sir The elder said For more than sixty years friends I have lived in the cave and I did not know whether there was any painting there or notNow today I know it through those who have eyes The elder it seems though he had lived there for so long had never raised his eyes and looked up at the caveAnd at the door of his cave there was a great ironwood treeAnd the elder had never looked up at that eitherHe knew it was in flower when he saw its petals on the ground each yearThe king heard of the elders great virtues and he sent for him three times desiring to pay homage to him When the elder did not go he had the breasts of all the women with infants in the town bound and sealed off saying As long as the elder does not come let the children go without milkOut of compassion for the children the elder went to MahāgāmaWhen the king heard that he had come he said Go and bring the elder in I shall take the precepts Having had him brought up into the inner palace he paid homage to him and provided him with a meal Then saying Today venerable sir there is no opportunity I shall take the precepts tomorrow he took the elders bowl After following him for a little he paid homage with the queen and turned backwhether it was the king who paid homage or whether it was the queen the elder said May the king be happyBhikkhus asked Why is it venerable sir that whether it is the king who pays the homage or the queen you say May the king be happy The elder replied Friends I do not notice whether it is the king or the queen At the end of seven days when it was found that the elder was not happy living there he was dismissed by the king He went back to the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka When it was night he went out onto his walkA deity who dwelt in the ironwood tree stood by with a torch of sticksThen his meditation subject became quite clear and plainThe elder thinking How clear my meditation subject is today  was glad and immediately after the middle watch he reached Arahantship making the whole rock resoundSo when another clansman seeks his own goodLet him not be hungryeyed Like a monkey in the grovesLike a wild deer in the woods Like a nervous little childLet him go with eyes downcast Seeing a plough yokes length beforeThat he fall not in the power Of the forestmonkey mindThe Elder Mahā Mittas mother was sick with a poisoned tumour She told her daughter who as a bhikkhunī had also gone forth Lady go to your brother Tell him my trouble and bring back some medicineShe went and told himThe elder said I do not know how to gather root medicines and such things and concoct a medicine from them But rather I will tell you a medicine since I went forth I have not broken my virtue of restraint of the sense faculties by looking at the bodily form of the opposite sex with a lustful mind By this declaration of truth may my mother get well Go and tell the lay devotee and rub her bodyShe went and told her what had happened and then did as she had been instructedAt that very moment the lay devotees tumour vanished shrinking away like a lump of froth She got up and uttered a cry of joy If the Fully Enlightened One were still alive why should he not stroke with his netadorned hand the head of a bhikkhu like my sonSoLet another noble clansman Gone forth in the DispensationKeep as did the Elder Mitta Perfect faculty restraint As restraint of the faculties is to be undertaken by means of mindfulness so livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energyFor that is accomplished by energy because the abandoning of wrong livelihood is effected in one who has rightly applied energyAbandoning therefore unbefitting wrong search this should be undertaken with energy by means of the right kind of search consisting in going on alms round etc avoiding what is of impure origin as though it were a poisonous snake and using only requisites of pure originHerein for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices any requisites obtained from the Community from a group of bhikkhus or from laymen who have confidence in his special qualities of teaching the Dhamma etc are called of pure originBut those obtained on alms round etc are of extremely pure originFor one who has taken up the ascetic practices those obtained on alms round etc andas long as this is in accordance with the rules of the ascetic practicesfrom people who have confidence in his special qualities of asceticism are called of pure originAs to the robe and the other requisites no hint indication roundabout talk or intimation about robes and alms food is allowable for a bhikkhu who is purifying his livelihoodBut a hint indication or roundabout talk about a resting place is allowable for one who has not taken up the ascetic practicesHerein a hint is when one who is getting the preparing of the ground etc done for the purpose of making a resting place is asked What is being done venerable sir Who is having it done  and he replies No one or any other such giving of hintsAn indication is saying Lay follower where do you liveIn a mansion venerable sirRoundabout talk is saying The resting place for the Community of Bhikkhus is crowded or any other such oblique talkAll however is allowed in the case of medicineBut when the disease is cured is it or is it not allowed to use the medicine obtained in this wayHerein the Vinaya specialists say that the opening has been given by the Blessed One therefore it is allowableBut the Suttanta specialists say that though there is no offence nevertheless the livelihood is sullied therefore it is not allowableBut one who does not use hints indications roundabout talk or intimation though these are permitted by the Blessed One and who depends only on the special qualities of fewness of wishes etc and makes use only of requisites obtained otherwise than by indication etc even when he thus risks his life is called supreme in living in effacement like the venerable SāriputtaIt seems that the venerable one was cultivating seclusion at one time living in a certain forest with the Elder Mahā Moggallāna One day an affliction of colic arose in him causing him great painIn the evening the Elder Mahā Moggallāna went to attend upon him Seeing him lying down he asked what the reason was And then he asked What used to make you better formerly friendThe elder said When I was a layman friend my mother used to mix ghee honey sugar and so on and give me rice gruel with pure milk That used to make me betterThen the other said So be it friend If either you or I have merit perhaps tomorrow we shall get someNow a deity who dwelt in a tree at the end of the walk overheard their conversation Thinking I will find rice gruel for the lord tomorrow he went meanwhile to the family who was supporting the elder and entered into the body of the eldest son causing him discomfortThen he told the assembled relatives the price of the cure If you prepare rice gruel of such a kind tomorrow for the elder I will set this one freeThe Elder Mahā Moggallāna came in the morning and said Stay here friend till I come back from the alms round Then he went into the villageThose people met him They took his bowl filled it with the stipulated kind of rice gruel and gave it back to himThe elder made as though to goThe elder left Bringing the alms food to the venerable Sāriputta he said Here friend Sāriputta eatWhen the elder saw it he thought The gruel is very nice How was it got  and seeing how it had been obtained he said Friend the alms food cannot be usedInstead of thinking He does not eat alms food brought by the likes of me the other at once took the bowl by the rim and turned it over on one sideAs the rice gruel fell on the ground the elders affliction vanished From then on it did not appear again during fortyfive yearsThen he said to the venerable Mahā Moggallāna Friend even if ones bowels come out and trail on the ground it is not fitting to eat gruel got by verbal intimationThe honey and the gruel obtained By influence of verbal hintsIf I were to consent to eat My livelihood might well be blamedAnd even if my bowels obtrude And trail outside and even thoughMy life is to be jeopardized I will not blot my livelihood For I will satisfy my heart By shunning all wrong kinds of searchAnd never will I undertake The search the Buddhas have condemnedAnd here too should be told the story of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mango eater who lived at Cīragumba So in all respectsAnd seeing clearly give no thought To any search that is not goodA man who has gone forth in faith Should purify his livelihood And as livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energy so virtue dependent on requisites is to be undertaken by means of understandingFor that is accomplished by understanding because one who possesses understanding is able to see the advantages and the dangers in requisitesSo one should abandon greed for requisites and undertake that virtue by using requisites obtained lawfully and properly after reviewing them with understanding in the way aforesaidHerein reviewing is of two kinds at the time of receiving requisites and at the time of using themFor use is blameless in one who at the time of receiving robes etc reviews them either as mere elements or as repulsive and puts them aside for later use and in one who reviews them thus at the time of using themHere is an explanation to settle the matterThere are four kinds of use use as theft use as a debt  use as an inheritance use as a masterHerein use by one who is unvirtuous and makes use of requisites even sitting in the midst of the Community is called use as thefttherefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used and the alms food lump by lump One who cannot do this should review it before the meal after the meal in the first watch in the middle watch and in the last watchIf dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it he finds himself in the position of one who has used it as a debtAlso the resting place should be reviewed each time it is usedRecourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of medicine is properPurification is of four kinds purification by the Teaching purification by restraint purification by search and purification by reviewingHerein virtue of the Pātimokkha restraint is called purification by the Teachingfor that is so called because it purifies by means of teachingVirtue of restraint of faculties is called purification by restraintVirtue dependent on requisites is called purification by reviewingHence it was said above  There is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulnessUse of the requisites by the seven kinds of trainers is called use as an inheritanceBut how then is it the Blessed Ones requisites or the laitys requisites that are usedAlthough given by the laity they actually belong to the Blessed One because it is by the Blessed One that they are permitted That is why it should be understood that the Blessed Ones requisites are usedThe confirmation here is in the Dhammadāyāda Sutta Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called use as a masterfor they make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of cravingAs regards these kinds of use use as a master and use as an inheritance are allowable for allUse as a debt is not allowableBut this use of what is reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because it is the opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance tooFor one possessed of virtue is called a trainer too because of possessing this trainingAs regards these three kinds of use since use as a master is best when a bhikkhu undertakes virtue dependent on requisites he should aspire to that and use them after reviewing them in the way describedAnd this is saidOf alms food and of dwelling And of a resting placeAnd also of the water For washing dirt from robesWho listens to the Dhamma As taught by the Sublime OneThe truly wise disciple Makes use after reviewing By alms food and by dwelling And by a resting placeAnd also by the water For washing dirt from robesunsullied By any of these mattersA bhikkhu is like a drop of water Lying on leaves of lotusSince aid it is and timely Procured from anotherIn chewing and in eating In tasting food besidesThe right amount he reckons Mindful without remittingHe treats it as an ointment Applied upon a wound So like the childs flesh in the desert Like the greasing for the axleHe should eat without delusion Nutriment to keep alive And in connection with the fulfilling of this virtue dependent on requisites there should be told the story of the novice Saṅgharakkhita the NephewFor he made use of requisites after reviewingSeeing me eat a dish of rice Quite cold my preceptor observedNovice if you are not restrained Be careful not to burn your tongueOn hearing my Preceptors words I then and there felt urged to actAnd sitting in a single session I reached the goal of ArahantshipSince I am now waxed full in thought Like the full moon of the fifteenth And all my cankers are destroyed There is no more becoming nowAnd so should any other man Aspiring to end sufferingMake use of all the requisites Wisely after reviewing themSo virtue is of four kinds as virtue of Pātimokkha restraint and so onand the evidence here is the refusal of the request to allow disciples to announce training precepts As seven days went by thus And if he has got putrid urine with mixed gall nuts and foursweets for the purpose of curing a certain affliction and he eats only the broken gall nuts thinking Other companions in the life of purity will eat the foursweets his undertaking of the ascetic practices is befittingfor he is then called a bhikkhu who is supreme in the Noble Ones heritages But lay follower a mansion is not allowed for bhikkhus Or any other such giving of indicationThey said Even without being told by you we regularly supply the elders needs and on the following day they prepared rice gruel of the kind neededbut they said Eat venerable sir we shall give you more When the elder had eaten they gave him another bowlfuland he uttered this exclamationUse without reviewing by one who is virtuous is use as a debtbut while this is so though there is an offence for one who uses it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance there is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulnessfor that is so called because it purifies by means of the restraint in the mental resolution I shall not do so againVirtue of livelihood purification is called purification by searchfor that is so called because search is purified in one who abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and properlyfor that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already describedfor they are the Buddhas sons therefore they make use of the requisites as the heirs of requisites belonging to their fatherto say nothing of use as theftaccording as it is saidMaking the whole rock resound making the whole rock reverberate as one doing so by means of an earth tremor But some say that is was owing to the cheering of the deities who lived thereThe Elder Mahā Tissa it seems was going on a journey during a famine and being tired in body and weak through lack of food and travel weariness he lay down at the root of a mango tree covered with fruit There were many fallen mangoes here and thereThen a lay devotee who was older than he went to the elder and learning of his exhaustion gave him mango juice to drink Then he mounted him on his back and took him to his homeNor your mother nor your father etc Meanwhile the elder admonished himself as follows  And beginning the comprehension of formations and augmenting insight he realized Arahantship after the other paths in due succession while he was still mounted on his backThrough ownerless mangoes were lying fallen on the ground near him he would not eat them in the absence of someone to accept them fromAs repulsive in this way Firstly perception of repulsiveness in nutriment in the case of alms food then as bringing repulsiveness to mind thus But all these robes etc which are not in themselves disgusting become utterly disgusting on reaching this filthy bodyAs elements in this way This robe etc consists merely of the four elements and occurs when its conditions are present and the person who uses it likewiseUse as theft use by one who is unworthyAnd the requisites are allowed by the Blessed One to one in his own dispensation who is virtuous not unvirtuousand the generosity of the givers is towards one who is virtuous not towards one who is notsince they expect great fruit from their actionsIn the first pentad in the fivefold section the meaning should be understood in accordance with the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order and so onFor this is said in the PaṭisambhidāThat of the training precepts for those not fully admitted to the Order such is virtue consisting in limited purification What is virtue consisting in unlimited purificationThat of the training precepts for those fully admitted to the Order such is virtue consisting in unlimited purification What is virtue consisting in fulfilled purificationThat of magnanimous ordinary men devoted to profitable things who are perfecting the course that ends in trainership regardless of the physical body and life having given up attachment to life such is virtue of fulfilled purificationThat of the seven kinds of trainer such is virtue consisting in purification not adhered to What is virtue consisting in tranquillized purificationThat of the Perfect Ones disciples with cankers destroyed of the Paccekabuddhas of the Perfect Ones accomplished and fully enlightened such is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification  Herein the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order should be understood as virtue consisting in limited purification because it is limited by the number of training precepts that is five or eight or ten That of those fully admitted to the Order is describable thusNine thousand millions and a hundred And eighty millions then as wellAnd fifty plus a hundred thousand And thirtysix again to swellThe total restraint disciplines These rules the Enlightened One explainsTold under heads for filling out Which the Discipline restraint containsSo although limited in number it should yet be understood as virtue consisting in unlimited purification since it is undertaken without reserve and has no obvious limit such as gain fame relatives limbs or life Like the virtue of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mangoeater who lived at Cīragumba For that venerable one never abandoned the following good mans recollectionWealth for a sound limbs sake should be renounced And one who guards his life gives up his limbsAnd wealth and limbs and life each one of these A man gives up who practices the DhammaAnd he never transgressed a training precept even when his life was in the balance and in this way he reached Arahantship with that same virtue of unlimited purification as his support while he was being carried on a lay devotees backAccording to as it is saidNor your mother nor your father Nor your relatives and kinHave done as much as this for you Because you are possessed of virtueSo stirred with urgency and wisely Comprehending with insightWhile carried on his helpers back He reached the goal of Arahantship The magnanimous ordinary mans virtue which from the time of admission to the Order is devoid even of the stain of a wrong thought because of its extreme purity like a gem of purest water like wellrefined gold becomes the proximate cause for Arahantship itself which is why it is called consisting of fulfilled purification like that of the lders Saṅgharakkhita the Great and Saṅgharakkhita the NephewThe Elder Saṅgharakkhita the Great  aged over sixty was lying it seems on his deathbed The Order of Bhikkhus questioned him about attainment of the supramundane stateThe elder said I have no supramundane state Friend thinking to see the Blessed One Metteyya I did not try for insightHe helped the elder to sit up and went outAs he went out the elder reached Arahantship and he gave a sign by snapping his fingersThe Order assembled and said to him Venerable sir you have done a difficult thing in achieving the supramundane state in the hour of deathThat was not difficult friends But rather I will tell you what is difficult Friends I see no action done by me without mindfulness and unknowingly since the time I went forthHis nephew also reached Arahantship in the same way at the age of fifty yearsNow if a man has little learning And he is careless of his virtueThey censure him on both accounts For lack of virtue and of learningBut if he is of little learning Yet he is careful of his virtueThey praise him for his virtue so It is as though he too had learningAnd if he is of ample learning Yet he is careless of his virtueThey blame him for his virtue so It is as though he had no learningBut if he is of ample learning And he is careful of his virtueThey give him praise on both accounts For virtue and as well for learningThe Buddhas pupil of much learning Who keeps the Law with understandingA jewel of Jambu River gold Who is here fit to censure himDeities praise him constantly By Brahmā also is he praised  What should be understood as virtue consisting in purification not adhered to is trainers virtue because it is not adhered to by false view and ordinary mens virtue when not adhered to by greed Like the virtue of the Elder Tissa the Landowners Son Wanting to become established in Arahantship in dependence on such virtue this venerable one told his enemiesI broke the bones of both my legs To give the pledge you asked from meI am revolted and ashamed At death accompanied by greedAnd after I had thought on this And wisely then applied insightWhen the sun rose and shone on me I had become an Arahant Also there was a certain senior elder who was very ill and unable to eat with his own hand He was writhing smeared with his own urine and excrement Seeing him a certain young bhikkhu said Oh what a painful process life isThe senior elder told him If I were to die now friend I should obtain the bliss of heaven I have no doubt of that But the bliss obtained by breaking this virtue would be like the lay state obtained by disavowing the training and he added I shall die together with my virtue As he lay there he comprehended that same illness with insight and he reached Arahantship Having done so he pronounced these verses to the Order of BhikkhusI am victim of a sickening diseaseThat racks me with its burden of cruel painSo this my corpse will soon have withered upAs flowers in the dust burnt by the sunUnbeautiful called beautiful Unclean while reckoned as if cleanThough full of ordure seeming fair To him that cannot see it clearSo out upon this ailing rotting body Fetid and filthy punished with afflictionDoting on which this silly generation Has lost the way to be reborn in heaven   It is the virtue of the Arahants etc that should be understood as tranquillized purification because of tranquillization of all disturbance and because of purifiednessSo it is of five kinds as consisting in limited purification and so on What is virtue consisting in limited purification What is virtue consisting in purification not adhered toThen the young bhikkhu who was attending on him said Venerable sir people have come as much as twelve leagues thinking that you have reached Nibbāna It will be a disappointment for many if you die as an ordinary manSo help me to sit up and give me the chanceHe exercised insight by discerning the feeling in the illness under the heading of the feeling aggregate and the remaining material dhammas as materialityIn the second pentad the meaning should be understood as the abandoning etc of killing living things etcFive kinds of virtue In the case of killing living things abandoning is virtue abstention is virtue volition is virtue restraint is virtue non transgression is virtueIn the case of taking what is not given  In the case of sexual misconduct  In the case of false speech  In the case of malicious speech  In the case of harsh speech  In the case of gossip  In the case of covetousness  In the case of ill will  In the case of wrong view  Through renunciation in the case of lust abandoning is virtue  Through nonillwill in the case of illwill  Through perception of light in the case of stiffnessandtorpor  Through nondistraction  agitation  Through definition of states  uncertainty  Through knowledge  ignorance  Through gladdening in the case of boredom  Through the first jhāna in the case of the hindrances abandoning is virtue  Through the second jhāna  applied and sustained thought  Through the third jhāna  happiness  Through the fourth jhāna in the case of pleasure and pain abandoning is virtue  Through the attainment of the base consisting of boundless space in the case of perceptions of matter perceptions of resistance and perceptions of variety abandoning is virtue  Through the attainment of the base consisting of boundless consciousness in the case of the perception of the base consisting of boundless space  Through the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness in the case of the perception of the base consisting of boundless consciousness  Through the attainment of the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception in the case of the perception of the base consisting of nothingness  Through the contemplation of impermanence in the case of the perception of permanence abandoning is virtue  Through the contemplation of pain in the case of the perception of pleasure  Through the contemplation of notself in the case of the perception of self  Through the contemplation of dispassion in the case of the perception of delighting  Through the contemplation of fading away in the case of greed  Through the contemplation of cessation in the case of originating  Through the contemplation of relinquishment in the case of grasping  Through the contemplation of destruction in the case of the perception of compactness abandoning is virtue  Through the contemplation of fall of formations in the case of accumulating kamma  Through the contemplation of change in the case of the perception of lastingness  Through the contemplation of the signless in the case of a sign  Through the contemplation of the desireless in the case of desire  Through the contemplation of voidness in the case of misinterpreting  Through insight into states that is higher understanding in the case of misinterpreting due to grasping  Through correct knowledge and vision in the case of misinterpreting due to confusion  Through the contemplation of danger in the case of misinterpreting due to reliance on formations  Through reflection in the case of nonreflection  Through the contemplation of turning away in the case of misinterpreting due to bondage Through the path of streamentry in the case of defilements coefficient with false view abandoning is virtue  Through the path of oncereturn in the case of gross defilements  Through the path of nonreturn in the case of residual defilements  Through the path of Arahantship in the case of all defilements abandoning is virtue abstention is virtue volition is virtue restraint is virtue nontransgression is virtue Such virtues lead to nonremorse in the mind to gladdening to happiness to tranquillity to joy to repetition to development to cultivation to embellishment to the requisite for concentration to the equipment of concentration to fulfilment to complete dispassion to fading away to cessation to peace to directknowledge to enlightenment to Nibbāna And here there is no state called abandoning other than the mere nonarising of the killing of living things etc as statedBut the abandoning of a given unprofitable state upholds a given profitable state in the sense of providing a foundation for it and concentrates it by preventing waveringThe other four things mentioned refer to the presence of occurrence of will as abstention from such and such as restraint of such and such as the volition associated with both of these and as nontransgression in one who does not transgress such and suchBut their meaning of virtue has been explained alreadySo it is of five kinds as virtue consisting in abandoning and so onAt this point What is virtueIn what sense is it virtueWhat are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate causeWhat are the benefits of virtueHow many kinds of virtue are therethe answers to the questions are completefor this is said in the Paṭisambhidāso it is called virtue in the sense of composing  reckoned as upholding and concentrating as stated earlier However it was also asked WHAT IS THE DEFILING OF IT and WHAT IS THE CLEANSING OF ITWe answer that virtues tornness etc is its defiling and that its untornness etc is its cleansingNow that tornness etc are comprised under the breach that has gain fame etc as its cause and under the seven bonds of sexualityWhen a man has broken the training course at the beginning or at the end in any instance of the seven classes of offences his virtue is called torn like a cloth that is cut at the edgeBut when he has broken it in the middle it is called rent like a cloth that is rent in the middleWhen he has broken it twice or thrice in succession it is called blotched like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with a discrepant colour appearing on the back or the bellyWhen he has broken it all over at intervals it is called mottled like a cow speckled all over with discrepant coloured spots at intervalsThis in the first place is how there comes to be tornness with the breach that has gain etc as its causeAnd likewise with the seven bonds of sexualityHere brahman some ascetic or brahman claims to lead the life of purity rightly for he does not enter into actual sexual intercourse with women Yet he agrees to massage manipulation bathing and rubbing down by women He enjoys it desires it and takes satisfaction in it This is what is torn rent blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purityThis man is said to lead a life of purity that is unclean As one who is bound by the bond of sexuality he will not be released from birthyet he jokes plays and amuses himself with women Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these thingsFurthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these thingsFurthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these things yet herecalls laughs and talks and games that he formerly had with women Furthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these thingsyet he leads the life of purity aspiring to some order of deities thinking Through this rite or this ritual or this asceticism I shall become a great deity or some lesser deityHe enjoys it desires it and takes satisfaction in itThis brahman is what is torn rent blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purity This man  will not be released from suffering I say This is how tornness etc should be understood as included under the breach that has gain etc as its cause and under the seven bonds of sexualityUntornness however is accomplished by the complete nonbreaking of the training precepts by making amends for those broken for which amends should be made by the absence of the seven bonds of sexuality and as well by the non arising of such evil things as anger enmity contempt domineering envy avarice deceit fraud obduracy presumption pride  haughtiness conceit  and negligence  and by the arising of such qualities as fewness of wishes contentment and effacement Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain etc and rectified by making amends after being broken by the faults of negligence etc and not damaged by the bonds of sexuality and by such evil things as anger and enmity are called entirely untorn unrent unblotched and unmottledAnd those same virtues are liberating since they bring about the state of a freeman and praised by the wise since it is by the wise that they are praised and unadheredto since they are not adhered to by means of craving and views and conducive to concentration since they conduce to access concentration or to absorption concentrationThat is why their untornness etc should be understood as cleansing This cleansing comes about in two ways through seeing the danger of failure in virtue and through seeing the benefit of perfected virtueHerein the danger of failure in virtue can be seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning Bhikkhus there are these five dangers for the unvirtuous in the failure of virtue Furthermore on account of his unvirtuousness an unvirtuous person is displeasing to deities and human beings is uninstructable by his fellows in the life of purity suffers when unvirtuousness is censured and is remorseful when the virtuous are praised Owing to that unvirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp clothContact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are brought to longlasting suffering in the states of lossHe is worthless because he causes no great fruit to accrue to those who give him giftsHe is as hard to purify as a cesspit many years oldHe is like a log from a pyre  for he is outside both recluseship and the lay stateThough claiming the bhikkhu state he is no bhikkhu so he is like a donkey following a herd of cattleHe is always nervous like a man who is everyones enemyHe is as unfit to live with as a dead carcaseThough he may have the qualities of learning etc he is as unfit for the homage of his fellows in the life of purity as a charnelground fire is for that of brahmansHe is as incapable of reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing a visible objectHe is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of a kingdomThough he fancies he is happy yet he suffers because he reaps suffering as told in the Discourse on the Mass of Fire Now the Blessed One has shown that when the unvirtuous have their minds captured by pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence of the five cords of sense desires in receiving salutation in being honoured etc the result of that kamma directly visible in all ways is very violent pain with that kamma as its condition capable of producing a gush of hot blood by causing agony of heart with the mere recollection of itHere is the text Bhikkhus do you see that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowing Yes venerable sirIt would be better venerable sir that he should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden It would be painful venerable sir if he sat down or lay down embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowingI say to you bhikkhus I declare to you bhikkhus that it would be better for one gone forth who is unvirtuous who is evilnatured of unclean and suspect habits secretive of his acts who is not an ascetic and claims to be one who does not lead the life of purity and claims to do so who is rotten within lecherous and full of corruption to sit down or lie down embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing and glowingWhy is thatBy his doing so bhikkhus he might come to death or deadly suffering yet he would not on that account on the breakup of the body after death reappear in states of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell But if one who is unvirtuous evilnatured  and full of corruption should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden  that would be long for his harm and suffering on the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in states of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell Having thus shown by means of the analogy of the mass of fire the suffering that is bound up with women and has as its condition the indulgence of the five cords of sense desires by the unvirtuousWhat do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong horse hair rope twisted round both legs by a strong man and tightened so that it cut through the outer skin and having cut through the outer skin it cut through the inner skin and having cut through the inner skin it cut through the flesh and having cut through the flesh it cut through the sinews and having cut through the sinews it cut through the bones and having cut through the bones it remained crushing the bone marrowor that he should consent to the homage of great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man wound ones breast with a sharp spear tempered in oilor that he should consent to the reverential salutation of great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that ones body should be wrapped by a strong man in a redhot iron sheet burning blazing and glowing or that he should use robes given out of faith by great warriornobles great brahmans great householders  And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that ones mouth should be prised open by a strong man with redhot iron tongs burning blazing and glowing and that into his mouth should be put a redhot iron ball burning blazing and glowing which burns his lips and burns his mouth and tongue and throat and belly and passes out below carrying with it his bowels and entrailsor that he should use alms food given out of faith by great warriornobles   And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man seize him by the head or seize him by the shoulders and seat him or lay him on a redhot iron bed or iron chair burning blazing and glowingor that he should use a bed or chair given out of faith by great warriornobles   And What do you think bhikkhus which is better that one should have a strong man take him feet up and head down and plunge him into a redhot metal cauldron burning blazing and glowing to be boiled there in a swirl of froth and as he boils in the swirl of froth to be swept now up now down and now acrossor that he should use a dwelling given out of faith by great warriornobles   What pleasure has a man of broken virtue Forsaking not sense pleasures which bear fruitWhat pleasure has he in accepting homage Who having failed in virtue must partakeOf pain that will excel in agony The crushing of his legs with horsehair ropesWhat pleasure has a man devoid of virtue Accepting salutations of the faithfulWhich is the cause of pain acuter still Than pain produced by stabbing with a spearWhat is the pleasure in the use of garments For one without restraint whereby in hellHe will for long be forced to undergo The contact of the blazing iron sheetAlthough to him his alms food may seem tasty Who has no virtue it is direst poisonBecause of which he surely will be made For long to swallow burning iron ballsAnd when the virtueless make use of couches And chairs though reckoned pleasing it is painBecause they will be tortured long indeed On redhot blazing iron beds and chairsThen what delight is there for one unvirtuous Inhabiting a dwelling given in faithSince for that reason he will have to dwell Shut up inside a blazing iron panDescribed him in these terms Of suspect habits Full of corruption lecherous as well By nature evilrotten too within The Teacher of the world in him condemning So out upon the life of him abiding Without restraint of him that wears the guiseOf the ascetic that he will not be And damages and undermines himselfAvoids it here as those that would look well Keep far away from dung or from a corpseWhat is the life he leads since any person No matter who with virtue to his creditHe is not free from any sort of terror Though free enough from pleasure of attainmentWhile heavens door is bolted fast against him He is well set upon the road to hellWho else if not one destitute of virtue More fit to be the object of compassionMany indeed and grave are the defects That brand a man neglectful of his virtueSeeing danger in the failure of virtue should be understood as reviewing in such ways as these And seeing benefits in perfected virtue should be understood in the opposite senseFurthermoreHis virtue is immaculate His wearing of the bowl and robesGives pleasure and inspires trust His going forth will bear its fruitA bhikkhu in his virtue pure Has never fear that selfreproachWill enter in his heart indeed There is no darkness in the sunA bhikkhu in his virtue bright Shines forth in the Ascetics WoodAs by the brightness of his beams The moon lights up the firmamentNow if the bodily perfume Of virtuous bhikkhus can succeedIn pleasing even deities What of the perfume of his virtueIt is more perfect far than all The other perfumes in the worldBecause the perfume virtue gives Is borne unchecked in all directionsThe deeds done for a virtuous man Though they be few will bear much fruitAnd so the virtuous man becomes A vessel of honour and renownThere are no cankers here and now To plague the virtuous man at allThe virtuous man digs out the root Of suffering in lives to comePerfection among human kind And even among deitiesIf wished for is not hard to gain For him whose virtue is perfectedThan the perfection of Nibbāna The state where utter peace prevailsBut once his virtue is perfected His mind then seeks no other kindSo let a wise man know it well This root of all perfections branchesSuch is the blessed fruit of virtue Showing full many a varied formThe mind of one who understands thus shudders at failure in virtue and reaches out towards the perfecting of virtueSo virtue should be cleansed with all care seeing this danger of failure in virtue and this benefit of the perfection of virtue in the way statedAnd at this point in the Path of Purification which is shown under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding by the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue  virtue firstly has been fully illustratedin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplefor this is said by the Blessed Oneageing and death  he will not be released from suffering I sayFurthermore brahman  while he does not agree to these thingsyet he gazes and stares at women eye to eye yet he listens to the sound of women through a wall or through a fence as they laugh or talk or sing or weep yet he sees a householder or a householders son possessed of endowed with and indulging in the five cords of sense desire Furthermore brahman while he does not agree to these thingsWhat do you think bhikkhus which is better that one gone forth should sit down or lie down embracing that mass of fire burning blazing and glowing or that he should sit down or lie down embracing a warriornoble maiden or a brahman maiden or a maiden of householder family with soft delicate hands and feetto the same intent he showed by the following similes of the horsehair rope the sharp spear the iron sheet the iron ball the iron bed the iron chair and the iron cauldron the pain that has as its condition acceptance of homage and reverential salutation and the use of robes alms food bed and chair and dwelling by unvirtuous bhikkhus Of pain more violent even than the pain In the embracing of a mass of fireThe first chapter called The Description of VirtueNow while a meditator is engaged in the pursuit of virtue he should set about undertaking the ascetic practices in order to perfect those special qualities of fewness of wishes contentment etc by which the virtue of the kind already described is cleansedFor when his virtue is thus washed clean of stains by the waters of such special qualities as fewness of wishes contentment effacement seclusion dispersal energy and modest needs it will become quite purified and his vows will succeed as wellAnd so when his whole behaviour has been purified by the special quality of blameless virtue and vows and he has become established in the first three of the ancient Noble Ones heritages he may become worthy to attain to the fourth called delight in development We shall therefore begin the explanation of the ascetic practicesThirteen kinds of ascetic practices have been allowed by the Blessed One to clansmen who have given up the things of the flesh and regardless of body and life are desirous of undertaking a practice in conformity with their aimThey are i the refuseragwearers practice ii the triplerobewearers practice iii the almsfoodeaters practice iv the housetohouseseekers practice v the onesessioners practice vi the bowlfoodeaters practice vii the laterfoodrefusers practice viii the forestdwellers practice ix the treerootdwellers practice x the openairdwellers practice xi the charnelgrounddwellers practice xii the anybedusers practice xiii the sitters practiceHereinAs to meaning characteristic et cetera The undertaking and directionsAnd then the grade and breach as well And benefits of each besidesAs to the profitable triad Ascetic and so on distinguishedAnd as to groups and also singly The exposition should be known Herein as to meaning in the first place i It is refuse since owing to its being found on refuse in any such place as a street a charnel ground or a midden it belongs as it were to the refuse in the sense of being dumped in anyone of these places Or alternatively like refuse it gets to a vile state  thus it is refuse  it goes to a vile state is what is meantThe wearing of a refuserag which has acquired its derivative name in this way is refuserag wearing  That is his habit thus he is a refuseragwearer His practice is called the triple robewearers practiceii In the same way he has the habit of wearing the triple robe in other words the cloak of patches the upper garment and the inner clothing thus he is a triplerobewearer Therefore it should be understood as a term for that by undertaking which one becomes a refuseragwearerIt is the action that is called the practiceThe practice of the refuseragwearer is the refuserag wearers practice iii The dropping of the lumps of material sustenance called alms is alms food  the falling into the bowl of lumps given by others is what is meantHe gleans that alms food  he seeks it by approaching such and such a family thus he is called an almsfood eater Or his vow is to gather  the lump  thus he is a lumpgatherer  To gather is to wander for A lumpgatherer is the same as an almsfoodeater The practice of the almsfoodeater is the almsfoodeaters practiceiv It is a hiatus that is called a gap  It is removed from a gap thus it is called gapless  the meaning is it is without hiatusIt is together with what is gapless  thus it is with the gapless  devoid of hiatusfrom house to houseis what is meantHis habit is to wander on whatiswiththegapless thus he is a gapless wanderer  A gapless wanderer is the same as a housetohouseseeker His practice is the housetohouseseekers practicev Eating in one session is onesession He has that habit thus he is a one sessionerHis practice is the onesessioners practicevi Alms in one bowl only because of refusing a second vessel is bowlalms Now making bowl alms the name for the taking of alms food in the bowl bowlalmsfood is his habit thus he is a bowl foodeater His practice is the bowlfoodeaters practiceviii His habit is dwelling in the forest thus he is a forestdwellerHis practice is the laterfoodrefusers practiceThis bhikkhu is like that Thus he is a laterfoodrefuser When it has taken a fruit into its beak and that drops it does not eat any moreBut it is said in the commentary Khalu is a certain kind of birdThis is the name for one who as an undertaking refuses extra foodNot a laterfoodeater is a nolaterfoodeater  that is a laterfoodrefuserFood obtained later by one who has shown that he is satisfied is called laterfood  The eating of that later food is laterfoodeating Making laterfood the name for that laterfoodeating laterfood is his habit thus he is a later foodeater vii No is a particle in the sense of refusingHis practice is the forestdwellers practiceix Dwelling at the root of a tree is treerootdwelling He has that habit thus he is a treerootdwellerThe practice of the treerootdweller is the treeroot dwellers practicex xi Likewise with the openairdweller and the charnelgrounddwellerThis firstly is how the exposition should be known here as to meaningOr alternatively they are ascetic because they shake off opposition and they are practices because they are a way All these however are the practices of a bhikkhu who is ascetic because he has shaken off defilement by undertaking one or other of them Or the knowledge that has got the name ascetic because it shakes off defilement is a practice belonging to these thus they are ascetic practices His practice is the sitters practicexiii He has the habit of keeping to the sitting posture when resting refusing to lie down thus he is a sitterHis practice is the anybedusers practiceHe has the habit of dwelling in that as distributed thus he is an as distributeduser  that is an anybeduserxii Only what has been distributed is as distributed  This is a term for the resting place first allotted thus This one falls to youAll of them have as their characteristic the volition of undertakingFor this is said in the commentary He who does the undertaking is a personThat whereby he does the undertaking is states of consciousness and consciousness concomitantsThe volition of the act of undertaking is the ascetic practiceWhat it rejects is the instanceAll have the function of eliminating cupidity and they manifest themselves with the production of noncupidity For their proximate cause they have the noble states consisting of fewness of wishes and so onThis is how the exposition should be known as to characteristic etc hereAs regards the five beginning with the undertaking and directions during the Blessed Ones lifetime all ascetic practices should be undertaken in the Blessed Ones presenceAfter his attainment of Nibbāna this should be done in the presence of a principal discipleWhen he is not available it should be done in the presence of one whose cankers are destroyed of a nonreturner of a oncereturner of a streamenterer of one who knows the three Piṭakas of one who knows two of the Piṭakas of one who knows one of the Piṭakas of one who knows one Collection of a teacher of the CommentariesWhen he is not available it should be done in the presence of an observer of an ascetic practice When he is not available then after one has swept out the shrine terrace they can be undertaken seated in a reverential posture as though pronouncing them in the Fully Enlightened Ones presence Also it is permitted to undertake them by oneselfAnd here should be told the story of the senior of the two brothers who were elders at Cetiyapabbata and their fewness of wishes with respect to the ascetic practices This firstly is what applies to all the practicesEkasaṅgītika one who knows one of the five collections beginning with the Collection of Long Discourses Out of fewness of wishes that his ascetic practice should get known the elder lay down Afterwards he undertook the practice anew So the story has come downThen one night the other saw him by the light of a flash of lightning sitting up on his bed He asked Are you a sitter venerable sirThat elder it seems was a sitter but no one knew itNow we shall proceed to comment on the undertaking directions grade breach and benefits of each one separatelyi First the refuseragwearers practice is undertaken with one of these two statements I refuse robes given by householders or I undertake the refuserag wearers practiceOne who has done this should get a robe of one of the following kinds one from a charnel ground one from a shop a cloth from a street a cloth from a midden one from a childbed an ablution cloth a cloth from a washing place one worn going to and returning from the charnel ground one scorched by fire one gnawed by cattle one gnawed by ants one gnawed by rats one cut at the end one cut at the edge one carried as a flag a robe from a shrine an ascetics robe one from a consecration one produced by supernormal power one from a highway one borne by the wind one presented by deities one from the sea Taking one of these robe cloths he should tear off and throw away the weak parts and then wash the sound parts and make up a robe He can use it after getting rid of his old robe given by householdersHerein one from a charnel ground is one dropped on a charnel groundOne from a shop is one dropped at the door of a shopA cloth from a street is a cloth thrown into a street from inside a window by those who seek meritA cloth from a midden is a cloth thrown onto a place for rubbishOne from a childbed is a cloth thrown away after wiping up the stains of childbirth with itThe mother of Tissa the Minister it seems had the stains of childbirth wiped up with a cloth worth a hundred pieces and thinking The refuserag wearers will take it she had it thrown onto the Tālaveli RoadAn ablution cloth is one that people who are made by devil doctors to bathe themselves including their heads are accustomed to throw away as a cloth of ill luckA cloth from washing place is rags thrown away at a washing place where bathing is doneOne worn going to and coming from is one that people throw away after they have gone to a charnel ground and returned and bathedOne scorched by fire is one partly scorched by fireOne gnawed by cattle etc are obviousOne carried as a flag Those who board a ship do so after hoisting a flagIt is allowable to take this when they have gone out of sightAlso it is allowable when the two armies have gone away to take a flag that has been hoisted on a battlefieldA robe from a shrine is an offering made by draping a termitemound in clothAn ascetics robe is one belonging to a bhikkhuOne from a consecration is one thrown away at the kings consecration placeOne produced by supernormal power is a comebhikkhu robeBut one dropped by the owners negligence should be taken only after waiting a whileOne borne by the wind is one that falls a long way off having been carried by the wind It is allowable to take it if the owners are not in sightOne presented by deities is one given by deities like that given to the Elder Anuruddha One from the sea is one washed up on dry land by the sea wavesOne given thus We give it to the Order or got by those who go out for alms cloth is not a refuseragAnd in the case of one presented by a bhikkhu one given after it has been got at a presentation of robes by householders at the end of the Rains or a restingplace robe that is one automatically supplied by a householder to the occupant of a certain resting place is not a refuseragIt is a refuserag only when given after not having been so obtainedAnd herein that placed by the donors at a bhikkhus feet but given by that bhikkhu to the refuserag wearer by placing it in his hand is called pure in one wayThat given to a bhikkhu by placing it in his hand but placed by him at the refuserag wearers feet is also pure in one wayThat which is both placed at a bhikkhus feet and then given by him in the same way is pure in both waysOne obtained by being placed in the hand and given by being placed in the hand too is not a strict mans robeSo a refuserag wearer should use the robe after getting to know about the kinds of refuserags These are the directions for it in this instanceThe grades are these There are three kinds of refuserag wearers the strict the medium and the mildHerein one who takes it only from a charnel ground is strictOne who takes one left by someone thinking One gone forth will take it is mediumOne who takes one given by being placed at his feet by a bhikkhu is mildThe moment anyone of these of his own choice or inclination agrees to accept a robe given by a householder his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He actually practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the refuserag robe  he is established in the first of the Noble Ones heritages  there is no suffering due to protecting he exists independent of others there is no fear of robbers there is no craving connected with use of robes it is a requisite suitable for an ascetic it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus valueless easy to get and blameless  it inspires confidence it produces the fruits of fewness of wishes etc the right way is cultivated a good example is set to later generationsWhile striving for Deaths armys rout The ascetic clad in ragrobe cloutGot from a rubbish heap shines bright As mailclad warrior in the fightLeaving rare Kāsi cloth and more This robe worethe worlds great teacher Of rags from off a rubbish heap Who would not have a robe to keepMinding the words he did profess When he went into homelessnessLet him to wear such rags delight As one in seemly garb bedightThis firstly is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the refuseragwearers practiceThis firstly is the undertakingBhikkhus took it for the purpose of mending worn placesfor people throw away such as these toofor people throw that awayOne from a highway is one dropped in the middle of a roadThe name of a street in Mahāgāma Also in Anurādhapura they sayii Next there is the triplerobewearers practice This is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a fourth robe or I undertake the triple robewearers practiceWhen a triplerobe wearer has got cloth for a robe he can put it by for as long as owing to illhealth he is unable to make it up or for as long as he does not find a helper or lacks a needle etcand there is no fault in his putting it byBut it is not allowed to put it by once it has been dyed That is called cheating the ascetic practiceThese are the directions for itThis too has three gradesHerein one who is strict should at the time of dyeing first dye either the inner cloth or the upper garment and having dyed it he should wear that round the waist and dye the otherThen he can put that on over the shoulder and dye the cloak of patchesBut he is not allowed to wear the cloak of patches round the waistThis is the duty when in an abode inside a villageBut it is allowable for him in the forest to wash and dye two togetherHowever he should sit in a place near to the robes so that if he sees anyone he can pull a yellow cloth over himselfBut for the medium one there is a yellow cloth in the dyeing room for use while dyeing and it is allowable for him to wear that as an inner cloth or to put it on as an upper garment in order to do the work of dyeingFor the mild one it is allowable to wear or put on the robes of bhikkhus who are in communion in order to do the work of dyeingA bedspread that remains where it is is also allowable for himAnd it is allowed for him to use from time to time the robes of bhikkhus who are in communionIt is allowed to one who wears the triple robe as an ascetic practice to have a yellow shouldercloth too as a fourthThe moment anyone of these three agrees to accept a fourth robe his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these The bhikkhu who is a triplerobe wearer is content with the robe as a protection for the bodyHence he goes taking it with him as a bird does its wings  and such special qualities as having few undertakings avoidance of storage of cloth a frugal existence the abandoning of greed for many robes living in effacement by observing moderation even in what is permitted production of the fruits of fewness of wishes etc are perfectedNo risk of hoarding haunts the man of wit Who wants no extra cloth for requisiteUsing the triple robe whereer he goes The pleasant relish of content he knowsSo would the adept wander undeterred With naught else but his robes as flies the birdWith its own wings then let him too rejoice That frugalness in garments be his choiceThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the triplerobewearers practicebut he must not take it about himbut it must be only a span wide and three hands longTatraṭṭhakapaccattharaṇaa bedspread that remains there A name for what has been determined upon as a bedspread in ones own resting place or in someone elsesThey say accordingly that there is no breach of the ascetic practice even when these two that is the bedspread and the undyed cloth are kept as extra robesiii The almsfoodeaters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a supplementary food supply or I undertake the alms foodeaters practiceNow this almsfood eater should not accept the following fourteen kinds of meal a meal offered to the Order a meal offered to specified bhikkhus an invitation a meal given by a ticket one each halfmoon day one each Uposatha day one each first of the halfmoon a meal given for visitors a meal for travellers a meal for the sick a meal for sicknurses a meal supplied to a particular residence a meal given in a principal house a meal given in turnIf instead of saying Take a meal given to the Order meals are given saying The Order is taking alms in our house you may take alms too it is allowable to consentTickets from the Order that are not for actual food and also a meal cooked in a monastery are allowable as well These are the directions for itThis too has three gradesHerein one who is strict takes alms brought both from before and from behind and he gives the bowl to those who take it while he stands outside a door He also takes alms brought to the refectory and given there But he does not take alms by sitting and waiting for it to be brought later that dayThe medium one takes it as well by sitting and waiting for it to be brought later that day but he does not consent to its being brought the next dayThe mild one consents to alms being brought on the next day and on the day afterBoth these last miss the joy of an independent lifeThere is perhaps a preaching on the Noble Ones heritages in some village The strict one says to the others Let us go friends and listen to the DhammaOne of them says I have been made to sit and wait by a man venerable sirThe other wanders for alms in the morning and then he goes and savours the taste of the DhammaThe moment anyone of these three agrees to the extra gain consisting of a meal given to the Order etc his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He actually practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the eating of lumps of alms food  he is established in the second of the Noble Ones heritages his existence is independent of others it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus Valueless easy to get blameless  idleness is eliminated livelihood is purified the practice of the minor training rule of the Pātimokkha is fulfilled he is not maintained by another he helps others pride is abandoned craving for tastes is checked the training precepts about eating as a group substituting one meal invitation for another  and good behaviour are not contravened his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes he cultivates the right way he has compassion for later generationsThe monk content with alms for food Has independent livelihoodAnd greed in him no footing finds He is as free as the four windsHe never need be indolent His livelihood is innocentSo let a wise man not disdain Almsgathering for his domainSince it is saidIf a bhikkhu can support himself on almsAnd live without anothers maintenanceThe very gods indeed might envy himAnd pay no heed as well to gain and fame This is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the almsfoodeaters practiceand the other I have consented to receive alms tomorrow venerable sirSo they are both losersA meal to be given by setting it out in a principal house onlyTickets that are not for actual food but deal with medicine etciv The housetohouse seekers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a greedy alms round or I undertake the housetohouse seekers practiceNow the housetohouse seeker should stop at the village gate and make sure that there is no dangerIf there is danger in any street or village it is allowable to leave it out and wander for alms elsewhereWhen there is a house door or a street or a village where he regularly gets nothing at all he can go past it not counting it as a villageBut wherever he gets anything at all it is not allowed subsequently to go past there and leave it outThis bhikkhu should enter the village early so that he will be able to leave out any inconvenient place and go elsewhereBut if people who are giving a gift of a meal in a monastery or who are coming along the road take his bowl and give alms food it is allowableAnd as this bhikkhu is going along the road he should when it is the time wander for alms in any village he comes to and not pass it byIf he gets nothing there or only a little he should wander for alms in the next village in orderThese are the directions for it This too has three gradesHerein one who is strict does not take alms brought from before or brought from behind or brought to the refectory and given there He hands over his bowl at a door howeverfor in this ascetic practice there is none equal to the Elder Mahā KassapaThe medium one takes what is brought from before and from behind and what is brought to the refectory and he hands over his bowl at a door But he does not sit waiting for almsThus he conforms to the rule of the strict almsfood eaterThe mild one sits waiting for alms to be brought that dayThe ascetic practice of these three is broken as soon as the greedy alms round starts by going only to the houses where good alms food is givenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He is always a stranger among families and is like the moon  he abandons avarice about families he is compassionate impartially he avoids the dangers in being supported by a family he does not delight in invitations he does not hope for meals to be brought his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so onIs moonlike ever new to familiesNor does he grudge to help all equallyFree from the risks of housedependencyWho would the selfindulgent round forsakeHis downcast eyes range a yokelength beforeAnd roam the world at will the while to makeThen let him wisely seek from door to doorThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the housetohouseseekers practiceyet an instance in which even he handed over his bowl is mentioned The monk who at each house his begging pliesv The onesessioners practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse eating in several sessions or I undertake the onesessioners practiceWhen the onesessioner sits down in the sitting hall instead of sitting on an elders seat he should notice which seat is likely to fall to him and sit down on thatIf his teacher or preceptor arrives while the meal is still unfinished it is allowable for him to get up and do the dutiesBut the Elder Tipiṭaka CūlaAbhaya said He should either keep his seat and finish his meal or if he gets up he should leave the rest of his meal in order not to break the ascetic practice And this is one whose meal is still unfinished therefore let him do the duties but in that case let him not eat the rest of the mealThese are the directionsThis too has three gradesHerein one who is strict may not take anything more than the food that he has laid his hand on whether it is little or muchAnd if people bring him ghee etc thinking The elder has eaten nothing while these are allowable for the purpose of medicine they are not so for the purpose of foodThe medium one may take more as long as the meal in the bowl is not exhaustedHe is either one who stops with the water because he eats until he takes water for washing the bowl or one who stops with the session because he eats until he gets upThe ascetic practice of these three is broken at the moment when food has been eaten at more than one sessionThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He has little affliction and little sickness he has lightness strength and a happy life there is no contravening rules about food that is not what is left over from a meal craving for tastes is eliminated his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so onWho gladly in one session takes his mealNo longing to indulge his sense of tasteTempts him to leave his work to go to wasteHis own true happiness a monk may findIn eating in one session pure in mindPurity and effacement wait on thisFor it gives reason to abide in blissThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the onesessioners practiceThe mild one may eat as long as he does not get up from his seatfor he is called one who stops when the food is finishedNo illness due to eating shall he feelvi The bowlfoodeaters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a second vessel or I undertake the bowlfoodeaters practiceWhen at the time of drinking rice gruel the bowlfood eater gets curry that is put in a dish he can first either eat the curry or drink the rice gruelIf he puts it in the rice gruel the rice gruel becomes repulsive when a curry made with cured fish etc is put into it So it is allowable to do this only in order to use it without making it repulsiveConsequently this is said with reference to such curry as thatBut what is unrepulsive such as honey sugar etc should be put into itAnd in taking it he should take the right amountIt is allowable to take green vegetables with the hand and eat themBut unless he does that they should be put into the bowlBecause a second vessel has been refused it is not allowable to use anything else not even the leaf of a tree These are its directionsThis too has three gradesHerein for one who is strict except at the time of eating sugarcane it is not allowed while eating to throw rubbish awayThe medium one is allowed to break them up with one hand while eating and he is called a hand asceticThe moment anyone of these three agrees to a second vessel his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these Craving for variety of tastes is eliminatedHe baffles doubts that might arise With extra dishes downcast eyesThe true devotedness imply Of one uprooting gluttonyWearing content as if twere part Of his own nature glad at heartNone but a bowlfood eater may Consume his food in such a wayThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the bowlfoodeaters practiceand it is not allowed while eating to break up ricelumps fish meat and cakes The rubbish should be thrown away and the ricelumps etc broken up before starting to eatThe mild one is called a bowl ascetic anything that can be put into his bowl he is allowed while eating to break up that is rice lumps etc with his hand or such things as palm sugar ginger etc with his teethexcessiveness of wishes is abandoned he sees the purpose and the right amount in nutriment he is not bothered with carrying saucers etc about his life conforms to the principles of fewness of wishes and so onvii The laterfoodrefusers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse additional food or I undertake the laterfoodrefusers practiceNow when that laterfood refuser has shown that he is satisfied he should not again have the food made allowable by having it put into his hands according to the rule for bhikkhus and eat itThese are the directions for itThis too has three gradesHerein there is no showing that he has had enough with respect to the first lump but there is when he refuses more while that is being swallowed So when one who is strict has thus shown that he has had enough with respect to the second lump he does not eat the second lump after swallowing the firstThe medium one eats also that food with respect to which he has shown that he has had enoughBut the mild one goes on eating until he gets up from his seatThe moment any one of these three has eaten what has been made allowable again after he has shown that he has had enough his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these One is far from committing an offence concerned with extra food there is no overloading of the stomach there is no keeping food back there is no renewed search for food he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so onHe needs no extra search in weary mood Nor stores up food till later in the dayNor overloads his stomach in this way When a wise man refuses later foodSo would the adept from such faults abstain Let him assume this practice for his gainThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the laterfoodrefusers practicePraised by the Blessed One which will augment The special qualities such as contentviii The forestdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse an abode in a village or I undertake the forestdwellers practiceNow that forest dweller must leave an abode in a village in order to meet the dawn in the forestHerein a village abode is the village itself with its precinctsA village may consist of one cottage or several cottages it may be enclosed by a wall or not have human inhabitants or not and it can also be a caravan that is inhabited for more than four monthsThe village precincts cover the range of a stone thrown by a man of medium stature standing between the gateposts of a walled village if there are two gateposts as at Anurādhapura The Vinaya experts say that this stones throw is characterized as up to the place where a thrown stone falls as for instance when young men exercise their arms and throw stones in order to show off their strengthBut the Suttanta experts say that it is up to where one thrown to scare crows normally fallsIn the case of an unwalled village the house precinct is where the water falls when a woman standing in the door of the outermost house of all throws water from a basinWithin a stones throw of the kind already described from that point is the village Within a second stones throw is the village precinctForest according to the Vinaya method firstly is described thus Except the village and its precincts all is forest According to the Abhidhamma method it is described thus Having gone out beyond the boundary post all that is forest But according to the Suttanta method its characteristic is this A forest abode is five hundred bowlengths distant That should be defined by measuring it with a strung instructors bow from the gatepost of a walled village or from the range of the first stones throw from an unwalled one up to the monastery wallBut if the monastery is not walled it is said in the Vinaya commentaries it should be measured by making the first dwelling of all the limit or else the refectory or regular meeting place or Bodhi Tree or shrine even if that is far from a dwelling belonging to the monasteryBut in the Majjhima commentary it is said that omitting the precincts of the monastery and the village the distance to be measured is that between where the two stones fallThis is the measure hereEven if the village is close by and the sounds of men are audible to people in the monastery still if it is not possible to go straight to it because of rocks rivers etcBut anyone who blocks the path to the village here and there for the purpose of lengthening it so as to be able to say that he is taking up the practice is cheating the ascetic practiceIf a forestdwelling bhikkhus preceptor or teacher is ill and does not get what he needs in the forest he should take him to a village abode and attend him thereBut he should leave in time to meet the dawn in a place proper for the practiceIf the affliction increases towards the time of dawn he must attend himand not bother about the purity of his ascetic practice These are the directionsThis too has three gradesHerein one who is strict must always meet the dawn in the forestThe medium one is allowed to live in a village for the four months of the RainsAnd the mild one for the winter months tooIf in the period defined any one of these three goes from the forest and hears the Dhamma in a village abode his ascetic practice is not broken if he meets the dawn thereBut if when the preacher has got up he thinks We shall go after lying down awhile and he meets the dawn while asleep or if of his own choice he meets the dawn while in a village abode then his ascetic practice is broken This is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these A forestdwelling bhikkhu who has given attention to the perception of forest can obtain hitherto unobtained concentration or preserve that already obtained And the Master is pleased with himaccording as it is said So Nāgita I am pleased with that bhikkhus dwelling in the forest And when he lives in a remote abode his mind is not distracted by unsuitable visible objects and so on He is free from anxiety he abandons attachment to life he enjoys the taste of the bliss of seclusion and the state of the refuserag wearer etc becomes himHe lives secluded and apart Remote abodes delight his heartThe Saviour of the world besides He gladdens that in groves abidesThe hermit that in woods can dwell Alone may gain the bliss as wellWhose savour is beyond the price Of royal bliss in paradiseWearing the robe of rags he may Go forth into the forest fraySuch is his mail for weapons too The other practices will doOne so equipped can be assured Of routing Māra and his hordeSo let the forest glades delight A wise man for his dwellings siteThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the forestdwellers practicein between the five hundred bowlengths can be reckoned by that road even if one has to go by boatnor is it broken if he meets it as he is on his way back after hearing the Dhammaix The treerootdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a roof or I undertake the treerootdwellers practiceThe treeroot dweller should avoid such trees as a tree near a frontier a shrine tree a gum tree a fruit tree a bats tree a hollow tree or a tree standing in the middle of a monastery He can choose a tree standing on the outskirts of a monastery These are the directionsThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict is not allowed to have a tree that he has chosen tidied upHe can move the fallen leaves with his foot while dwelling thereThe medium one is allowed to get it tidied up by those who happen to come alongThe mild one can take up residence there after summoning monastery attendants and novices and getting them to clear it up level it strew sand and make a fence round with a gate fixed in itOn a special day a treeroot dweller should sit in some concealed place elsewhere rather than thereThe moment any one of these three makes his abode under a roof his ascetic practice is brokenThe reciters of the Aṅguttara say that it is broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn under a roofThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these He practices in conformity with the dependence because of the words The going forth by depending on the root of a tree as an abode  it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus Valueless easy to get and blameless  perception of impermanence is aroused through seeing the continual alteration of young leaves avarice about abodes and love of building work are absent he dwells in the company of deities he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so onThe Blessed One praised roots of trees As one of the dependencies Can he that loves secludedness Find such another dwelling placeSecluded at the roots of trees And guarded well by deitiesHe lives in true devotedness Nor covets any dwelling placeAnd when the tender leaves are seen Bright red at first then turning greenAnd then to yellow as they fall He sheds belief once and for all In permanenceNo wise man will disdain at all For contemplating rise and fallTree roots have been Bequeathed by him secluded sceneThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the treerootdwellers practicex The openairdwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse a roof and a tree root or I undertake the openairdwellers practiceAn openair dweller is allowed to enter the Uposathahouse for the purpose of hearing the Dhamma or for the purpose of the UposathaIf it rains while he is inside he can go out when the rain is over instead of going out while it is still rainingHe is allowed to enter the eating hall or the fire room in order to do the duties or to go under a roof in order to ask elder bhikkhus in the eating hall about a meal or when teaching and taking lessons or to take beds chairs etc inside that have been wrongly left outsideIf he is going along a road with a requisite belonging to a senior and it rains he is allowed to go into a wayside rest houseIf he has nothing with him he is not allowed to hurry in order to get to a rest housebut he can go at his normal pace and enter it and stay there as long as it rains These are the directions for itAnd the same rule applies to the treeroot dweller tooThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict is not allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a houseHe should make a robetent right out in the open and live in thatThe medium one is allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house so long as he is not covered by themThe mild one is allowed these a rock overhang without a dripledge cut in it a hut of branches cloth stiffened with paste and a tent treated as a fixture that has been left by field watchers and so onThe moment any one of these three goes under a roof or to a tree root to dwell there his ascetic practice is brokenThe reciters of the Aṅguttara say that it is broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn thereThis is the breach in this caseThe benefits are these the impediment of dwellings is severed stiffness and torpor are expelled his conduct deserves the praise Like deer the bhikkhus live unattached and homeless  he is detached he is free to go in any direction he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so onThat aids the homeless bhikkhus strife Easy to getThe moon and sun furnish his light Under the starbejewelled vaultThe open air provides a life and leaves his mind Alert as a deer so he shall findStiffness and torpor brought to halt And concentration his delightThe joy seclusions savour gives He shall discover soon who livesIn open air and that is why The wise prefer the open skyThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the openairdwellers practicexi The charnelgrounddwellers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse what is not a charnel ground or I undertake the charnel grounddwellers practiceWithout a dripledge cut  means without a dripledge made above which might come under the heading of a dripledge made to prevent rain water from coming inBut if the rain water comes under the overhang and is allowed to go in under it then this comes under the heading of the open air Now the charnelground dweller should not live in some place just because the people who built the village have called it the charnel groundfor it is not a charnel ground unless a dead body has been burnt on it But as soon as one has been burnt on it it becomes a charnel ground And even if it has been neglected for a dozen years it is so stillOne who dwells there should not be the sort of person who gets walks pavilions etc built has beds and chairs set out and drinking and washing water kept ready and preaches Dhammafor this ascetic practice is a momentous thing Whoever goes to live there should be diligent And he should first inform the senior elder of the Order or the kings local representative in order to prevent troubleWhen he walks up and down he should do so looking at the pyre with half an eyeOn his way to the charnel ground he should avoid the main roads and take a bypathHe should define all the objects there while it is dayso that they will not assume frightening shapes for him at night Even if nonhuman beings wander about screeching he must not hit them with anythingIt is not allowed to miss going to the charnel ground even for a single dayThe reciters of the Aṅguttara say that after spending the middle watch in the charnel ground he is allowed to leave in the last watchHe should not take such foods as sesame flour pease pudding fish meat milk oil sugar etc which are liked by nonhuman beingsHe should not enter the homes of families These are the directions for itThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict should live where there are always burnings and corpses and mourningThe medium one is allowed to live where there is one of these threeThe mild one is allowed to live in a place that possesses the bare characteristics of a charnel ground already statedWhen any one of these three makes his abode in some place not a charnel ground his ascetic practice is brokenIt is on the day on which he does not go to the charnel ground the Aṅguttara reciters sayThis is the breach in this caseThe benefits are these He acquires mindfulness of death he lives diligently the sign of foulness is available  greed for sense desires is removed he constantly sees the bodys true nature he has a great sense of urgency he abandons vanity of health etc he vanquishes fear and dread  nonhuman beings respect and honour him he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so onwith many corpses present to his gazeRightly he strives because he gains a sense of urgencyWhile in his search for final peace he curbs all vanityLet him that feels a leaning to Nibbāna in his heartThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the charnelground dwellers practicethe dweller in a charnel ground for death is ever present to his thoughtEven in sleep shows naught Of negligenceHe may be sure there is no lust after sense pleasure preys Upon his mindEmbrace this practice for it has rare virtues to impartHe should not go into families houses because he smells of the dead and is followed by pisāca goblinsxii The anybedusers practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse greed for resting places or I undertake the anybedusers practiceThe anybed user should be content with whatever resting place he gets thus This falls to your lot He must not make anyone else shift from his bedThese are the directionsThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict is not allowed to ask about the resting place that has fallen to his lot Is it far  or Is it too near  or Is it infested by nonhuman beings snakes and so on  or Is it hot  or Is it cold The medium one is allowed to askThe mild one is allowed to inspect it and if he does not like it to choose anotherAs soon as greed for resting places arises in any one of these three his ascetic practice is broken This is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these The advice He should be content with what he gets is carried out he regards the welfare of his fellows in the life of purity he gives up caring about inferiority and superiority approval and disapproval are abandoned the door is closed against excessive wishes he lives in conformity with the principles of fewness of wishes and so onOne vowed to any bed will be Content with what he gets and heCan sleep in bliss without dismay On nothing but a spread of hayHe is not eager for the best No lowly couch does he detestHe aids his young companions too That to the monks good life are newSo for a wise man to delight In any kind of bed is rightA Noble One this custom loves As one the sages Lord approvesThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the anybedusers practicebut not to go and inspect itxiii The sitters practice is undertaken with one of the following statements I refuse lying down or I undertake the sitters practiceThe sitter can get up in any one of three watches of the night and walk up and downThese are the directionsThis has three grades tooHerein one who is strict is not allowed a backrest or cloth band or bindingstrap to prevent falling while asleepThe medium one is allowed any one of these threeThe mild one is allowed a backrest a cloth band a bindingstrap a cushion a fivelimb and a sevenlimbA sevenlimb is one made with four legs a support for the back and an arm support on each sideThey made that it seems for the Elder Pīṭhābhaya The elder became a nonreturner and then attained NibbānaAs soon as any one of these three lies down his ascetic practice is brokenThis is the breach in this instanceThe benefits are these The mental shackle described thus He dwells indulging in the pleasure of lying prone the pleasure of lolling the pleasure of torpor  is severed his state is suitable for devotion to any meditation subject his deportment inspires confidence his state favours the application of energy he develops the right practiceThe adept that can place crosswise His feet to rest upon his thighsAnd sit with back erect shall make Foul Māras evil heart to quakeNo more in supine joys to plump And wallow in lethargic dumpWho sits for rest and finds it good Shines forth in the Ascetics WoodThe happiness and bliss it brings Has naught to do with worldly thingsSo must the sitters vow befit The manners of a man of witThis is the commentary on the undertaking directions grades breach and benefits in the case of the sitters practicefor lying down is the only posture not allowedA fivelimb is a chair made with four legs and a support for the backAs to the profitable triad Ascetic and so on distinguishedAs to groups and also singly The exposition should be known Now there is the commentary according to the stanza Herein as to the profitable triad all the ascetic practices that is to say those of trainers ordinary men and men whose cankers have been destroyed may be either profitable or in the Arahants case indeterminate No ascetic practice is unprofitableBut if someone should say There is also an unprofitable ascetic practice because of the words One of evil wishes a prey to wishes becomes a forest dweller  etcWhoever has his dwelling in the forest is a forest dwellerBut as it was said above  they are the practices of a bhikkhu who is ascetic because he has shaken off defilement by undertaking one or other of them Or the knowledge that has got the name ascetic because it shakes off defilement is a practice belonging to these thus they are ascetic practices Or alternatively they are ascetic because they shake off opposition and they are practices because they are a way Consequently it was rightly said that no ascetic practice is unprofitableAnd those who hold that an ascetic practice is outside the profitable triad have no ascetic practice as regards meaningOwing to the shaking off of what is nonexistent could it be called an ascetic practiceAlso there are the words Proceeded to undertake the ascetic qualities  and it follows that those words are contradicted So that should not be accepted This in the first place is the commentary on the profitable triadAs to ascetic and so on distinguished the following things should be understood that is to say asceticHerein ascetic means either a person whose defilements are shaken off or a state that entails shaking off defilementsA preacher of asceticism one is ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism another is not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism another is neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism and another is both ascetic and a preacher of asceticismHerein one who has shaken off his defilements with an ascetic practice but does not advise and instruct another in an ascetic practice like the Elder Bakkula is ascetic but not a preacher of asceticismOne who has not shaken off his own defilements but only advises and instructs another in an ascetic practice like the Elder Upananda is not ascetic but a preacher of asceticismOne who has failed in both like Lāḷudāyin is neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticismOne who has succeeded in both like the General of the Dhamma is both ascetic and a preacher of asceticismAscetic states the five states that go with the volition of an ascetic practice that is to say fewness of wishes contentment effacement seclusion and that specific quality are called ascetic states because of the words Depending on fewness of wishes  and so on  Herein fewness of wishes and contentment are nongreedEffacement and seclusion belong to the two states nongreed and nondelusionThat specific quality is knowledgeHerein by means of nongreed a man shakes off greed for things that are forbidden By means of nondelusion he shakes off the delusion that hides the dangers in those same thingsAnd by means of nongreed he shakes off indulgence in pleasure due to sense desires that occurs under the heading of using what is allowed And by means of nondelusion he shakes off indulgence in self mortification that occurs under the heading of excessive effacement in the ascetic practicesThat is why these states should be understood as ascetic statesAscetic practices these should be understood as the thirteen that is to say the refuseragwearers practice  the sitters practiceFor whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitable they are suitable for one of greedy temperament and for one of deluded temperamentWhyBecause the cultivation of ascetic practices is both a difficult progress and an abiding in effacementOr the cultivation of the forestdwellers practice and the treerootdwellers practice here are suitable for one of hating temperamentfor hate too subsides in one who dwells there without coming into conflict This is the commentary as to ascetic and so on distinguished and  As to groups and also singly Now  as to groups these ascetic practices are in fact only eight that is to say three principal and five individual practicesHerein the three namely the housetohouseseekers practice the onesessioners practice and the openairdwellers practice are principal practicesFor one who keeps the housetohouseseekers practice will keep the almsfoodeaters practiceAnd what need has one who keeps the openairdwellers practice to keep the treerootdwellers practice or the anybedusers practiceSo there are these three principal practices that together with the five individual practices that is to say the forestdwellers practice the refuseragwearers practice the triplerobewearers practice the sitters practice and the charnelgrounddwellers practice come to eight onlyAgain they come to four that is to say two connected with robes five connected with alms food five connected with the resting place and one connected with energyHerein it is the sitters practice that is connected with energyAgain they all amount to two only since twelve are dependent on requisites and one on energyAlso they are two according to what is and what is not to be cultivatedFor when one cultivating an ascetic practice finds that his meditation subject improves he should cultivate itBut when he finds that whether he cultivates one or not his meditation subject only improves and does not deteriorate he should cultivate them out of compassion for later generationsAnd when he finds that whether he cultivates them or not his meditation subject does not improve he should still cultivate them for the sake of acquiring the habit for the futureSo they are of two kinds as what is and what is not to be cultivated And all are of one kind as volitionFor there is only one ascetic practice namely that consisting in the volition of undertakingAlso it is said in the Commentary It is the volition that is the ascetic practice they say Singly with thirteen for bhikkhus eight for bhikkhunīs twelve for novices seven for female probationers and female novices and two for male and female lay followers there are thus fortytwoIf there is a charnel ground in the open that complies with the forestdwellers practice one bhikkhu is able to put all the ascetic practices into effect simultaneouslyBut the two namely the forestdwellers practice and the laterfoodrefusers practice are forbidden to bhikkhunīs by training precept And it is hard for them to observe the three namely the openairdwellers practice the treeroot dwellers practice and the charnelgrounddwellers practicebecause a bhikkhunī is not allowed to live without a companionThis being so the purpose of cultivating the ascetic practice would scarcely be servedIt is because they are reduced by five owing to this inability to make use of certain of them that they are to be understood as eight only for bhikkhunīsExcept for the triplerobewearers practice all the other twelve as stated should be understood to be for novices and all the other seven for female probationers and female novicesThe two namely the onesessioners practice and the bowlfoodeaters practice are proper for male and female lay followers to employ In this way there are two ascetic practices This is the commentary as to groups and also singlyAnd this is the end of the treatise on the ascetic practices to be undertaken for the purpose of perfecting those special qualities of fewness of wishes contentment etc by means of which there comes about the cleansing of virtue as described in the Path of Purification which is shown under the three headings of virtue concentration and understanding contained in the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplehe should be told We have not said that he does not live in the forest with unprofitable consciousnessand he may be one of evil wishes or of few wishesNow no one called ascetic on account of what is unprofitable could have these as his practices nor does what is unprofitable shake off anything so that those things to which it belonged as a practice could be called ascetic practicesAnd what is unprofitable does not both shake off cupidity for robes etc and become the practice of the waya preacher of asceticismascetic statesascetic practicesand for whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitableaccording as it is said Now the venerable Bakkula was ascetic but not a preacher of asceticismaccording as it is said Now the venerable Upananda son of the Sakyans was not ascetic but a preacher of asceticismaccording as it is said Now the venerable Lāḷudāyin was neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticismaccording as it is said Now the venerable Sāriputta was ascetic and a preacher of asceticismwhich have already been described as to meaning and as to characteristic and so forthand greed subsides with the difficult progresswhile delusion is got rid of in those diligent by effacementand the bowlfoodeaters practice and the laterfoodrefusers practice will be well kept by one who keeps the onesessioners practicethe rest are obviousbut when he is cultivating one and finds that his meditation subject deteriorates he should not cultivate itand even if available she would not escape having to live in companyand it is hard to find a female companion with like desire for such a placeThe second chapter called The Description of the Ascetic PracticesThose who hold a reference to the inhabitants of the Abhayagiri Monastery at AnurādhapuraThat being so they could have no meaning of shaking off defilements or possibility of being undertaken because in the ultimate sense they would be non existent concepts having no existenceFor they say that ascetic practice is a concept consisting in a name Idamatthitāthat specific quality Owing to these profitable states it exists  The knowledge by means of which one who has gone forth should be established in the refuseragwearers practice etc and by means of which on being so instructed one undertakes and persists in the ascetic qualitiesthat knowledge is idamatthitāthat a woman could occupy the position of Sakka that a woman could occupy the position of Mara that a woman could occupy the position of Brahma  there is no such possibility And he understands It is possible that a man might be a Wheelturning Monarchthat a man might occupy the position of Sakkathat a man might occupy the position of Marathat a man might occupy the position of Brahma  there is such a possibilityfrom good verbal conductfrom good mental conduct  there is no such possibility And he understands It is possible that a wished for desired agreeable result might be produced from good bodily conductfrom good verbal conductfrom good mental conduct  there is such a possibilityengaging in verbal misconduct engaging in mental misconduct could on that account for that reason on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world  there is no such possibilityengaging in good verbal conduct engaging in good mental conduct might on that account for that reason on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldNow concentration is described under the heading of consciousness in the phrase develops consciousness and understanding  It should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that has been purified by means of the special qualities of fewness of wishes etc and perfected by observance of the ascetic practicesBut that concentration has been shown only very briefly and so it is not even easy to understand much less to develop There is therefore the following set of questions the purpose of which is to show the method of its development in detail What is concentration In what sense is it concentration What are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause How many kinds of concentration are there What is its defilement What is its cleansing How should it be developed What are the benefits of the development of concentrationHere are the answers WHAT IS CONCENTRATION Concentration is of many sorts and has various aspectsAn answer that attempted to cover it all would accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose and would besides lead to distraction so we shall confine ourselves to the kind intended here calling concentration profitable unification of mind IN WHAT SENSE IS IT CONCENTRATION It is concentration in the sense of concentrating What is this concentratingIt is the centring of consciousness and consciousnessconcomitants evenly and rightly on a single object placing is what is meantSo it is the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object undistracted and unscattered that should be understood as concentrating WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION MANIFESTATION AND PROXIMATE CAUSE Concentration has nondistraction as its characteristic Its function is to eliminate distraction It is manifested as nonwaveringBecause of the words Being blissful his mind becomes concentrated  its proximate cause is bliss HOW MANY KINDS OF CONCENTRATION ARE THERE First of all it is of one kind with the characteristic of nondistractionThen it is of two kinds as access and absorption likewise as mundane and supramundane as with happiness and without happiness and as accompanied by bliss and accompanied by equanimityIt is of three kinds as inferior medium and superior likewise as with applied thought and sustained thought etc as accompanied by happiness etc and as limited exalted and measurelessIt is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge etc likewise as limited with limited object etc according to the factors of the four jhānas as partaking of diminution etc as of the sense sphere etc and as predominance and so onIt is of five kinds according to the factors of the five jhānas reckoned by the fivefold methodHerein the section dealing with that of one kind is evident in meaningIn the section dealing with that of two kinds access concentration is the unification of mind obtained by the following that is to say the six recollections mindfulness of death the recollection of peace the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment and the defining of the four elements and it is the unification that precedes absorption concentrationAbsorption concentration is the unification that follows immediately upon the preliminarywork because of the words The firstjhāna preliminarywork is a condition as proximity condition for the first jhāna  So it is of two kinds as access and absorptionIn the second dyad mundane concentration is profitable unification of mind in the three planesSupramundane concentration is the unification associated with the noble paths So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundaneIn the third dyad concentration with happiness is the unification of mind in two jhānas in the fourfold reckoning and in three jhānas in the fivefold reckoningConcentration without happiness is the unification in the remaining two jhānasBut access concentration may be with happiness or without happiness So it is of two kinds as with happiness and without happinessIn the fourth dyad concentration accompanied by bliss is the unification in three jhānas in the fourfold and four in the fivefold reckoningThat accompanied by equanimity is that in the remaining jhānaAccess concentration may be accompanied by bliss or accompanied by equanimity So it is of two kinds as accompanied by bliss and accompanied by equanimityIn the first of the triads what has only just been acquired is inferior What is not very well developed is medium What is well developed and has reached mastery is superior So it is of three kinds as inferior medium and superiorIn the second triad that with applied thought and sustained thought is the concentration of the first jhāna together with access concentrationThat without applied thought with sustained thought only is the concentration of the second jhāna in the fivefold reckoningFor when a man sees danger only in applied thought and not in sustained thought he aspires only to abandon applied thought when he passes beyond the first jhāna and so he obtains concentration without applied thought and with sustained thought onlyThis is said with reference to himConcentration without applied thought and sustained thought is the unification in the three jhānas beginning with the second in the fourfold reckoning and with the third in the fivefold reckoning  So it is of three kinds as with applied thought and sustained thought and so onIn the third triad concentration accompanied by happiness is the unification in the two first jhānas in the fourfold reckoning and in the three first jhānas in the fivefold reckoningConcentration accompanied by bliss is the unification in those same jhānas and in the third and the fourth respectively in the two reckoningsThat accompanied by equanimity is that in the remaining jhānaAccess concentration may be accompanied by bliss and happiness or accompanied by equanimity So it is of three kinds as accompanied by happiness and so onIn the fourth triad limited concentration is unification on the plane of accessExalted concentration is unification in profitable consciousness etc of the fine material sphere and immaterial sphereMeasureless concentration is unification associated with the noble paths So it is of three kinds as limited exalted and measurelessIn the first of the tetrads there is concentration of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge There is that of difficult progress and swift direct knowledge There is that of easy progress and sluggish directknowledge And there is that of easy progress and swift directknowledgeHerein the development of concentration that occurs from the time of the first conscious reaction up to the arising of the access of a given jhāna is called progressAnd the understanding that occurs from the time of access until absorption is called directknowledgeThat progress is difficult for some being troublesome owing to the tenacious resistance of the inimical states beginning with the hindrances The meaning is that it is cultivated without easeIt is easy for others because of the absence of those difficultiesAlso the directknowledge is sluggish in some and occurs slowly not quicklyIn others it is swift and occurs rapidly not slowlyHerein we shall comment below upon the suitable and unsuitable  the preparatory tasks consisting in the severing of impediments  etc and skill in absorption  When a man cultivates what is unsuitable his progress is difficult and his directknowledge sluggishWhen he cultivates what is suitable his progress is easy and his directknowledge swiftBut if he cultivates the unsuitable in the earlier stage and the suitable in the later stage or if he cultivates the suitable in the earlier stage and the unsuitable in the later stage then it should be understood as mixed in his caseLikewise if he devotes himself to development without carrying out the preparatory tasks of severing impediments etc his progress is difficultIt is easy in the opposite caseAnd if he is not accomplished in skill in absorption his direct knowledge is sluggishIt is swift if he is so accomplishedBesides they should be understood as classed according to craving and ignorance and according to whether one has had practice in serenity and insightIf not it is easyAnd if he is overwhelmed by ignorance his directknowledge is sluggishIf not it is swiftAnd if he has had no practice in serenity his progress is difficultIf he has it is easyAnd if he has had no practice in insight his directknowledge is sluggish If he has it is swiftAlso they should be understood as classed according to defilements and facultiesFor if a mans defilements are sharp and his faculties dull then his progress is difficult and his directknowledge sluggish but if his faculties are keen his directknowledge is swiftAnd if his defilements are blunt and his faculties dull then his progress is easy and his directknowledge sluggishSo as regards this progress and this directknowledge when a person reaches concentration with difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge his concentration is called concentration of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledgesimilarly in the cases of the remaining three So it is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish directknowledge and so onIn the second tetrad there is limited concentration with a limited object there is limited concentration with a measureless object there is measureless concentration with a limited object and there is measureless concentration with a measureless objectHerein concentration that is unfamiliar and incapable of being a condition for a higher jhāna is limitedWhen it occurs with an unextended object  it is with a limited objectWhen it is familiar well developed and capable of being a condition for a higher jhāna it is measurelessAnd when it occurs with an extended object it is with a measureless objectThe mixed method can be understood as the mixture of the characteristics already statedSo it is of four kinds as limited with limited object and so onIn the third tetrad the first jhāna has five factors that is to say applied thought sustained thought happiness bliss and concentration following suppression of the hindrances The second has the three factors remaining after the elimination of applied and sustained thought The third has two factors with the fading away of happiness The fourth where bliss is abandoned has two factors with concentration and the equanimous feeling that accompanies itThus there are four kinds of concentration according to the factors of these four jhānasSo it is of four kinds according to the factors of the four jhānasIn the fourth tetrad there is concentration partaking of diminution there is concentration partaking of stagnation there is concentration partaking of distinction and there is concentration partaking of penetrationHerein it should be understood that the state of partaking of diminution is accessibility to opposition the state of partaking of stagnation is stationariness of the mindfulness that is in conformity with that concentration the state of partaking of distinction is the attaining of higher distinction and the state of partaking of penetration is accessibility to perception and attention accompanied by dispassionWhen his mindfulness that is in conformity with that stagnates then his understanding partakes of stagnationWhen he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought then his understanding partakes of distinctionWhen he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by dispassion and directed to fading away then his understanding partakes of penetration The kinds of concentration associated with that fourfold understanding are also four in numberSo it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution and so onIn the fifth tetrad there are the following four kinds of concentration that is to say sensesphere concentration finematerialsphere concentration immaterial sphere concentration and unincluded that is path concentrationHerein sense sphere concentration is all kinds of access unificationLikewise the other three are respectively profitable unification of mind associated with finematerial immaterial and path jhāna So it is of four kinds as of the sensesphere and so onIn the sixth tetrad If a bhikkhu obtains concentration obtains unification of mind by making zeal predominant this is called concentration due to zeal If  by making energy predominant  If  by making natural purity of consciousness predominant If  by making inquiry predominant this is called concentration due to inquiry  So it is of four kinds as predominanceIn the pentad there are five jhānas by dividing in two what is called the second jhāna in the fourfold reckoning  taking the second jhāna to be due to the surmounting of only applied thought and the third jhāna to be due to the surmounting of both applied and sustained thought There are five kinds of concentration according to the factors of these five jhānasSo its fivefoldness should be understood according to the five sets of jhāna factors What is its defilement What is its cleansingHere the answer is given in the Vibhaṅga Defilement is the state partaking of diminutionHerein the state partaking of diminution should be understood in this way When a man has attained the first jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire then his understanding partakes of diminution And the state partaking of distinction should be understood in this way When he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought then his understanding partakes of distinction For if a man is overwhelmed by craving his progress is difficultbut if his faculties are keen his directknowledge is swiftaccording as it is said When a man has attained the first jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire then his understanding partakes of diminutioncleansing is the state partaking of distinction  How should it be developed The method of developing the kind of concentration associated with the noble paths mentioned under that of two kinds as mundane and supramundane etc is included in the method of developing understanding So we shall say nothing separately here about how that is to be developedBut mundane concentration should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that is quite purified in the way already stated He should sever any of the ten impediments that he may have He should then approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration andThe detail is this Firstly it was said above he should sever any of the ten impediments that he may haveA dwelling family and gain A class and building too as fifthAnd travel kin affliction books And supernormal powers tenHerein the dwelling itself is the impediment due to the dwellingSo too with the family and so onHerein a single inner room or a single hut or a whole monastery for the Community is called a dwellingThis is not an impediment for everyoneIt is an impediment only for anyone whose mind is exercised about the building etc that goes on there or who has many belongings stored there or whose mind is caught up by some business connected with it For any other it is not an impedimentHere is a relevant story Two clansmen left Anurādhapura it seems and eventually went forth at the ThūpārāmaOne of them made himself familiar with the Two Codes and when he had acquired five years seniority he took part in the Pavāraṇā and then left for the place called PācīnakhaṇḍarājīNow when the one who had gone to Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī had lived there a long time and had become an elder he thought This place is good for retreat suppose I told my friend about itSo he set out and in due course he entered the ThūpārāmaAs he entered the elder of the same seniority saw him went to meet him took his bowl and robe and did the dutiesThe visiting elder went into his lodging He thought Now my friend will be sending me ghee or molasses or a drinkHe got nothing that night and in the morning he thought Now he will be sending me rice gruel and solid food sent by his supportersWhen he saw none he thought There is no one to bring it No doubt they will give it when we go into the town Early in the morning they went into the town togetherWhen they had wandered through one street and had got only a ladleful of gruel they sat down in a sitting hall to drink itThen the visitor thought Perhaps there is no individual giving of gruel But as soon as it is the time for the meal people will give special food But when it was time for the meal they ate what they had got by wandering for alms Then the visitor said Venerable sir how is this Do you live in this way all the time Yes friendVenerable sir Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī is comfortable let us go thereThe visitor asked But venerable sir why do you take this roadDid you not recommend Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī friendBut how is this venerable sir have you no extra belongings in the place you have lived in for so longThat is so friend The bed and chair belong to the Community and they are put away as usual There is nothing elseBut venerable sir I have left my staff and my oil tube and my sandal bag thereYes venerable sirHe was glad in his heart and he paid homage to the elder For those like you venerable sir everywhere is a forest dwellingThe Thūpārāma is a place where the relics of four Buddhas are deposited there is suitable hearing of the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace there is the Great Shrine to be seen and one can visit elders It is like the time of the BuddhaIt is here that you should live On the following day he took his bowl and outer robe and went away by himselfIt is no impediment for one like that Family means a family consisting of relatives or of supportersFor even a family consisting of supporters is an impediment for someone who lives in close association with it in the way beginning He is pleased when they are pleased  and who does not even go to a neighbouring monastery to hear the Dhamma without members of the familyBut even mother and father are not an impediment for another as in the case of the young bhikkhu the nephew of the elder who lived at the Koraṇḍaka MonasteryHe went to Rohaṇa for instruction it seemsOne day the elder set out for Rohaṇa to fetch him backThe young bhikkhu too thought I have lived here for a long time Now I might go and visit my preceptor and find out how the lay devotee is and he left RohaṇaThe two met on the banks of the Mahaveli RiverHe did the duties to the elder at the foot of a tree When asked Where are you going  he told him his purposeThe elder said You have done well The lay devotee is always asking after you That was why I came You may go but I shall stay here for the Rains and he dismissed himHe arrived at the monastery on the actual day for taking up residence for the RainsThe lodging allotted to him happened to be the one for which his father had undertaken responsibilityHis father came on the following day and asked To whom was our lodging allotted venerable sirs  When he heard that it had fallen to a young visitor he went to him After paying homage to him he said Venerable sir there is an obligation for him who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging What is it lay followerIt is to take alms food only in our house for the three months and to let us know the time of departure after the Pavāraṇā ceremonyThe lay devotee went home and told his wife There is a visiting lord who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging He must be carefully looked afterand she agreed She prepared good food of various kinds for himWhen he had eaten alms food there during the three months and had completed the residence for the Rains he announced his departureThen his relatives said Let it be tomorrow venerable sir and on the following day when they had fed him in their house and filled his oil tube and given him a lump of sugar and a ninecubit length of cloth they said Now you are leaving venerable sirHis preceptor had completed the Pavāraṇā ceremony and was on his way back They met at the same place as beforeHe did the duties to the elder at the foot of a treeThe elder asked him How was it my dear did you see the good woman lay devotee He replied Yes venerable sir and he told him all that had happened He then anointed the elders feet with the oil made him a drink with the sugar and presented him with the length of cloth He then after paying homage to the elder told him Venerable sir only Rohaṇa suits me and he departedThe elder too arrived back at his monastery and next day he went into the village of KoraṇḍakaThe lay devotee his sister had always kept looking down the road thinking My brother is now coming with my sonSuspecting that it must have been out of fewness of wishes that the youth had gone away without announcing himself the elder comforted her and told her all that had happened and he took the length of cloth out of his bag and showed it to herShe was appeased She prostrated herself in the direction taken by her son and she said Surely the Blessed One taught the way of the Rathavinīta the way of the Nālaka the way of the Tuvaṭaka and the way of the great Noble Ones heritages showing contentment with the four requisites and delight in development making a bhikkhu such as my son a bodywitnessSo although for three months he ate in the house of the mother who bore him yet he never said I am your son you are my mother Oh admirable man Even mother and father are no impediment for one such as him so how much less any other family that supports himGain is the four requisitesHow are they an impedimentWherever a meritorious bhikkhu goes people give him a large supply of requisitesWith giving blessings to them and teaching them the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the ascetics dutiesFrom sunrise till the first watch of the night he never breaks his association with peopleAgain even at dawn almsfood eaters fond of opulence come and say Venerable sir such and such a man lay follower woman lay follower friend friends daughter wants to see you and being ready to go he replies Take the bowl and robe friend So he is always on the alert Thus these requisites are an impediment for himHe should leave his group and wander by himself where he is not knownThis is the way his impediment is severed Class is a class of students of suttas or students of Abhidhamma If with the groups instruction and questioning he gets no opportunity for the ascetics duties then that group is an impediment for him He should sever that impediment in this wayif those bhikkhus have already acquired the main part and little still remains he should finish that off and then go to the forestIf they have only acquired little and much still remains he should without travelling more than a league approach another instructor of a class within the radius of a league and say Help those venerable ones with instruction etcIf he does not find anyone in this way he should take leave of the class saying I have a task to see to friends go where it suits you and he should do his own work Building is new building work Since one engaged in this must know about what material has and has not been got by carpenters etc and must see about what has and has not been done it is always an impedimentIt should be severed in this way If little remains it should be completedIf much remains it should be handed over to the Community or to bhikkhus who are entrusted with the Communitys affairs if it is a new building for the Community Travel is going on a journeyIf someone is expected to give the going forth somewhere else or if some requisite is obtainable there Kin in the case of the monastery means teacher preceptor coresident pupil those with the same preceptor as oneself and those with the same teacher as oneself and in the case of the house it means mother father brother and so onWhen they are sick they are an impediment for him Therefore that impediment should be severed by curing them with nursingHerein when the preceptor is sick he must be cared for as long as life lasts if the sickness does not soon departLikewise the teacher at the going forth the teacher at the admission the coresident the pupils to whom one has given the admission and the going forth and those who have the same preceptorBut the teacher from whom one takes the dependence the teacher who gives one instruction the pupil to whom one has given the dependence the pupil to whom one is giving instruction and those who have that same teacher as oneself should be looked after as long as the dependence or the instruction has not been terminatedIf one is able to do so one should look after them even beyond that periodMother and father should be treated like the preceptorIf he has none he should go in search of it as alms and give thatBut in the case of brothers or sisters one should only give them what is theirsIf they have none then one should give ones own temporarily and later get it backIt is not allowed either to make medicine for or to give it to a sisters husband who is not related by bloodBut it is allowed to make it for their children since they are blood relatives Affliction is any kind of illnessIt is an impediment when it is actually afflicting therefore it should be severed by treatment with medicineBut if it is not cured after taking medicine for a few days then the ascetics duties should be done after apostrophizing ones person in this way I am not your slave or your hireling I have come to suffering through maintaining you through the beginningless round of rebirthsBooks means responsibility for the scripturesThat is an impediment only for one who is constantly busy with recitations etc but not for othersHere are relevant storiesThe Elder Revata it seems the Majjhima reciter went to the Elder Revata the dweller in Malaya  and asked him for a meditation subjectThe elder asked him How are you in the scriptures friendI am studying the Majjhima Nikāya venerable sirThe Majjhima is a hard responsibility friend When a man is still learning the First Fifty by heart he is faced with the Middle Fifty and when he is still learning that by heart he is faced with the Last FiftyHow can you take up a meditation subjectVenerable sir when I have taken a meditation subject from you I shall not look at the scriptures again He took the meditation subject and doing no recitation for nineteen years he reached Arahantship in the twentieth year He told bhikkhus who came for recitation I have not looked at the scriptures for twenty years friends yet I am familiar with them You may begin And from beginning to end he had no hesitation even over a single syllableThe Elder MahāNāga too who lived at Karuliyagiri put aside the scriptures for eighteen years and then he recited the Dhātukathā to the bhikkhusWhen they checked this with the towndwelling elders of Anurādha pura not a single question was found out of its orderIn the Great Monastery too the Elder TipiṭakaCūḷaAbhaya had the golden drum struck saying I shall expound the three Piṭakas in the circle of experts in the Five Collections of discourses and this was before he had learnt the commentariesThe Community of Bhikkhus said Which teachers teaching is it Unless you give only the teaching of our own teachers we shall not let you speakAlso his preceptor asked him when he went to wait on him Did you have the drum beaten friendYes venerable sirI shall expound the scriptures venerable sirThey explain it in this way venerable sirGo and learn it from our own teachersWhere shall I go venerable sirThere is an elder named Mahā Dhammarakkhita living in the Tulādhārapabbata Monastery in the Rohaṇa country beyond the Mahaveli River He knows all the scriptures Go to himSaying Good venerable sir he paid homage to the elder He went with five hundred bhikkhus to the Elder MahāDhammarakkhita and when he had paid homage to him he sat downThe elder asked Why have you comeTo hear the Dhamma venerable sirStill you may repeat them in my presence by nightThe inhabitants of the village had a large pavilion built at the door of his dwelling and they came daily to hear the Dhammaexplaining by day the Elder Dhammarakkhita eventually completed the instruction Then he sat down on a mat on the ground before the Elder Abhaya and said Friend explain a meditation subject to meWhat are you saying venerable sir have I not heard it all from youWhat can I explain to you that you do not already know The senior elder said This path is different for one who has actually travelled byThe Elder Abhaya was then it seems a streamentererWhen the Elder Abhaya had given his teacher a meditation subject he returned to Anurādhapura Later while he was expounding the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace he heard that the elder had attained NibbānaOn hearing this he said Bring me my robe friends Then he put on the robe and said The Arahant path befits our teacher friendsOur teacher was a true thoroughbredHe sat down on a mat before his own Dhamma pupil and said Explain a meditation subject to meThe Arahant path befits our teacher friendsFor such as these books are no impedimentSupernormal powers are the supernormal powers of the ordinary manThey are hard to maintain like a prone infant or like young cornBut they are an impediment for insight not for concentration since they are obtainable through concentrationSo the supernormal powers are an impediment that should be severed by one who seeks insight the others are impediments to be severed by one who seeks concentration This in the first place is the detailed explanation of the impedimentsfor in developing path understanding that is developed tooNow the ten impediments are The other stayed on where he wasfor he has lived long in this cityNow as the elder came out from the city by the southern gate he took the Kumbhakāragāma road which leads to PācīnakhaṇḍarājīHave you already collected so much friend living there for just one dayThe elders sister who was a lay devotee was always asking the elder how her son was getting onHe consented in silenceThough the youth went to his relatives home at the time of the mealno one recognized himHe gave his blessing and set out for RohaṇaWhen she saw him coming alone she thought My son must be dead that is why the elder is coming alone and she fell at the elders feet lamenting and weepingor if it is for himself it should be handed over to those whom he entrusts with his own affairsbut if these are not available he should relinquish it to the Community and departand he cannot rest content without getting it that will be an impediment for even if he goes into the forest to do the ascetics duties he will find it hard to get rid of thoughts about the journey So one in this position should apply himself to the ascetics duties after he has done the journey and transacted the businessif they live within the kingdom and look to their son for help it should be givenAlso if they have no medicine he should give them his ownbut one should not complain if one does not get it backThe same applies to ones brothers wifebut one can give it to ones sister saying Give it to your husbandFor what reasonFriend Abhaya how do the teachers explain this passageThe elder dissented saying HumAgain three times each time in a different way he said They explain it in this way venerable sirThe elder always dissented saying Hum Then he said Friend your first explanation was the way of the teachers But it is because you have not actually learnt it from the teachers lips that you are unable to maintain that the teachers say such and suchFriend Abhaya they ask me about the Dīgha and the Majjhima from time to timebut I have not looked at the others for thirty yearsand I shall explain them to you by dayHe said Good venerable sir and he acted accordinglywhat had been repeated by nightand the slightest thing breaks themApproach the good friend the giver of a meditation subject  meditation subjects are of two kinds that is generally useful meditation subjects and special meditation subjectsHerein lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus etc and also mindfulness of death are what are called generally useful meditation subjectsSome say perception of foulness tooWhen a bhikkhu takes up a meditation subject he should first develop lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus within the boundary limiting it at first to all bhikkhus in this monastery in this way May they be happy and free from afflictionThen towards all the principal people in the village that is his alms resortWith lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus he produces kindliness in his coresidentsWith lovingkindness towards the deities within the boundary he is protected by kindly deities with lawful protectionWith loving kindness towards the principal people in the village that is his alms resort his requisites are protected by welldisposed principal people with lawful protectionWith lovingkindness to all human beings there he goes about without incurring their dislike since they trust himWith lovingkindness to all living beings he can wander unhindered everywhereWith mindfulness of death thinking I have got to die he gives up improper search  and with a growing sense of urgency he comes to live without attachmentWhen his mind is familiar with the perception of foulness then even divine objects do not tempt his mind to greedSo these are called generally useful and they are called meditation subjects since they are needed generally and desirable owing to their great helpfulness and since they are subjects for the meditation work intendedWhat is called a special meditation subject is that one from among the forty meditation subjects that is suitable to a mans own temperament It is special because he must carry it constantly about with him and because it is the proximate cause for each higher stage of developmentSo it is the one who gives this twofold meditation subject that is called the giver of a meditation subjectThe good friendHe is revered and dearly loved And one who speaks and suffers speechThe speech he utters is profound He does not urge without a reason and so on is one who possesses such special qualities as these  He is wholly solicitous of welfare and partial to progressBecause of the words beginning nanda it is owing to my being a good friend to them that living beings subject to birth are freed from birth  it is only the Fully Enlightened One who possesses all the aspects of the good friendSince that is so while he is available only a meditation subject taken in the Blessed Ones presence is well takenBut after his final attainment of Nibbāna it is proper to take it from anyone of the eighty great disciples still livingWhen they are no more available one who wants to take a particular meditation subject should take it from someone with cankers destroyed who has by means of that particular meditation subject produced the fourfold and fivefold jhāna and has reached the destruction of cankers by augmenting insight that had that jhāna as its proximate causeBut how then does someone with cankers destroyed declare himself thus I am one whose cankers are destroyedWhy not He declares himself when he knows that his instructions will be carried outDid not the Elder Assagutta spread out his leather mat in the air and sitting crosslegged on it explain a meditation subject to a bhikkhu who was starting his meditation subject because he knew that that bhikkhu was one who would carry out his instructions for the meditation subjectSo if someone with cankers destroyed is available that is good If not then one should take it from a nonreturner a oncereturner a streamenterer an ordinary man who has obtained jhāna one who knows three Piṭakas one who knows two Piṭakas one who knows one Piṭaka in descending order according as availableIf not even one who knows one Piṭaka is available then it should be taken from one who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary and one who is himself conscientiousFor a teacher such as this who knows the texts guards the heritage and protects the tradition will follow the teachers opinion rather than his ownHence the Ancient Elders said three times One who is conscientious will guard itNow those beginning with one whose cankers are destroyed mentioned above will describe only the path they have themselves reachedBut with a learned man his instructions and his answers to questions are purified by his having approached such and such teachers and so he will explain a meditation subject showing a broad track like a big elephant going through a stretch of jungle and he will select suttas and reasons from here and there adding explanations of what is suitable and unsuitableSo a meditation subject should be taken by approaching the good friend such as this the giver of a meditation subject and by doing all the duties to himIf he is available in the same monastery it is good If not one should go to where he livesWhen a bhikkhu goes to him he should not do so with feet washed and anointed wearing sandals with an umbrella surrounded by pupils and bringing oil tube honey molasses etcWhen entering that monastery he should do so expecting nothing and even provided with a toothstick that he has had made allowable on the way according to the rules And he should not enter some other room thinking I shall go to the teacher after resting awhile and after washing and anointing my feet and so onWhyIf there are bhikkhus there who are hostile to the teacher they might ask him the reason for his coming and speak dispraise of the teacher saying You are done for if you go to him they might make him regret his coming and turn him back So he should ask for the teachers dwelling and go straight thereIf the teacher is junior he should not consent to the teachers receiving his bowl and robe and so onIf the teacher is senior then he should go and pay homage to him and remain standingWhen told Put down the bowl and robe friend he may put them downWhen told Have some water to drink he can drink if he wants toWhen told You may wash your feet he should not do so at onceBut when told Wash friend it was not brought by me it was brought by others then he can wash his feet sitting in a screened place out of sight of the teacher or in the open to one side of the dwellingIf the teacher brings an oil tube he should get up and take it carefully with both handsIf he did not take it it might make the teacher wonder Does this bhikkhu resent sharing so soon but having taken it he should not anoint his feet at onceFor if it were oil for anointing the teachers limbs it would not be properSo he should first anoint his head then his shoulders etcHe should not say Explain a meditation subject to me venerable sir on the very day he arrivesBut starting from the next day he can if the teacher has a habitual attendant ask his permission to do the dutiesIf he does not allow it when asked they can be done when the opportunity offersWhen he does them three toothsticks should be brought a small a medium and a big oneWhichever of these the teacher uses for three days should then be brought regularlyIf the teacher uses either kind indiscriminately he can bring whatever is availableWhy so many wordsas by the Blessed One  Bhikkhus a pupil should perform the duties to the teacher rightlyHerein this is the right performance of duties He should rise early removing his sandals and arranging his robe on one shoulder he should give the toothsticks and the mouthwashing water and he should prepare the seatIf there is rice gruel he should wash the dish and bring the rice gruel  All should be done as prescribed in the Khandhakas as the right duties in the passage beginning To please the teacher by perfection in the duties he should pay homage in the evening and he should leave when dismissed with the words You may go When the teacher asks him Why have you come he can explain the reason for his comingor he should go at an unaccustomed time and when asked What have you come for  he can announce itIf the teacher says Come in the morning he should do soBut if his stomach burns with a bile affliction at that hour or if his food does not get digested owing to sluggish digestive heat or if some other ailment afflicts him he should let it be known and proposing a time that suits himself he should come at that timeFor if a meditation subject is expounded at an inconvenient time one cannot give attentionThis is the detailed explanation of the words approach the good friend the giver of a meditation subjectThen he should develop it towards all deities within the boundarythen to all human beings there and to all living beings dependent on the human beingsthen they are easy for him to live withhe should do so fulfilling the duties of a bhikkhu setting out on a journey carrying his bowl and robes himself doing all the duties in each monastery on the way with few belongings and living in the greatest effacementfor if the water has been brought by the teacher himself it would be improperbut when told This is meant for all the limbs friend anoint your feet he should put a little on his head and then anoint his feet Then he should give it back saying when the teacher takes it May I return this oil tube venerable sir and two kinds of mouthwashing water and bathing water that is hot and cold should be set outIf he does not ask but agrees to the duties being done then after ten days or a fortnight have gone by he should make an opportunity by staying back one day at the time of his dismissal and announcing the reason for his comingThey say it is the Dakkhiṇagiri in the Magadha countryA water port of entry is a port of entry on the sea or on an estuaryA land port of entry is one on the edge of a forest and acts as the gateway on the road of approach to great citiesIn earth in an earth disk of the kind about to be describedBounded only in one that has boundsNot made up in a disk of earth consisting of an ordinary threshingfloor disk and so onMade up prepared in the manner about to be describedApprehends the sign he apprehends in that with knowledge connected with meditative development the sign of earth of the kind about to be described as one does with the eye the sign of the face in a lookingglassOne who is learning the earth kasiṇa one who is apprehending grasping an earth kasiṇa as a learning sign The meaning is one who is producing an earth kasiṇa that has become the sign of learningSaid in the Old Commentaryand here arousing should be regarded as the establishing of the sign in that wayAs regard the words the size of a bushel etc it would be desirable that a bushel and a saucer were of equal sizebut some say that the size of a saucer is a span and four fingers and the the size of a bushel is larger than thatHe sees to it that that sign is well apprehended that meditator makes that disk of earth a wellapprehended signHe anchors his mind by bringing his own mind to access jhāna he anchors it keeps it from other objectsTo that object to that object called earth kasiṇa which has appeared rightly owing to its having been well apprehendedWhen it is well attended to thus by adverting and attending again and again by producing much repetition and development instigated by that he sees that it is well definedHaving thoroughly established his mindfulness there observing it again and again with his mind not straying outside he sees that it is well attended toWhen after apprehending the sign in it by opening the eyes and looking and then closing them again it appears to him as he adverts to it just as it did at the moment of looking with open eyes then he has made it well apprehendedHowever in the Island of Sri Lanka there is a river it seems called the Rāvanagaṅgā The clay in the places where the banks are cut away by its stream is the colour of dawnApprehend the sign apprehend with the mind the sign apprehended by the eye in the earth kasiṇaAnd develop it the apprehending of the sign as it occurs should be continued intensively and constantly practicedJust as one who sees his reflection on the surface of a lookingglass does not open his eyes too widely or too little  nor does he review the colour of the lookingglass or give attention to its characteristicbut rather looks with moderately opened eyes and sees only the sign of his face so too this meditator looks with moderately opened eyes at the earth kasiṇa and is occupied only with the signThe dawn colour that is there in the kasiṇa should not be thought aboutthough it cannot be denied that it is apprehended by eyeconsciousnessThat is why instead of saying here should not be looked at he says that it should not be apprehended by reviewingAlso the earth elements characteristic of hardness which is there should not be given attention because the apprehension has to be done through the channel of seeingAnd after saying while not ignoring the colour he said relegating the colour to the position of a property of the physical support showing that here the concern is not with the colour which is the channel but rather that this colour should be treated as an accessory of the physical supportOn the concept as the mental datum since that is what is outstanding the term of ordinary usage earth as applied to earth with its accessories since the prominence of its individual effect is due to outstandingness of the earth element setting the mind on that mental datum consisting of a name concept  the kasiṇa should be given attention as earth earthIf the mind is to be set on a mere concept by means of a term of common usage ought earth to be given attention by means of different namesIt can be What is wrong It is to show that that is done he said Mahī medinī and so onthe meaning is that the kasiṇa should be given attention with awareness of both the accompanying earth aspect and its ancillary colouraspect but taking the earthaspect with its ancillary concomitant colour as both supported equally by that physical support the diskComes into focus becomes the resort of minddoor impulsionWhy should he notIf after the learning sign was produced he went on developing it by looking at the disk of the earth there would be no arising of the counterpart signStamped with the three characteristics of the formed beginning with rise  or marked with the three characteristics beginning with impermanenceIf it is not like thatis not possessed of colour etcthen how is it the object of jhāna It is in order to answer that question that the sentence beginning For it is  is givenSince there is no arising from anywhere of what has no individualessence he therefore said Being the mere mode of appearanceBorn of the perception produced by the perception during development simply born from the perception during developmentone and a half kosa   bowsOne who is occupied with exercising and caring for the bodyIt guards the line  thus it is lineage  When it occurs limitedly it guards the naming and the recognition of the naming as restricted to a definite scope The exalted lineage is explainable in the same wayBut the limited should be regarded as the materiality peculiar to sense sphere states which are the resort of craving for sense desires and destitute of the exalted or the unsurpassed So it is said to protect and keep theseFor just as recognition does not take place without a meaning for its objective support  so naming does not take place without what is named The intention is that it is as if the sixth and seventh impulsions had lapsed since impulsion beyond the fifth is exhausted The elders opinion was that just as the first impulsion which lacks the quality of repetition does not arouse changeoflineage because of its weakness while the second or the third which have the quality of repetition can do so because they are strong on that account so too the sixth and seventh fix in absorption owing to their strength due to their quality of repetitionfor the first volition which is not a repetition has result experienceable here and now while the second to the sixth which are repetitions have result experienceable in future becomingsAnd the text quoted is not a reason because strength due to the quality of repetition is not a principle without exceptions But it is unsupported by a sutta or by any teachers statement in conformity with a suttaEither in the fourth or the fifth etc is said for the purpose of concluding the discussion with a paragraph showing the correctness of the meaning already stated Herein if the sixth and seventh impulsions are said to have lapsed because impulsion is exhausted how does seventhimpulsion volition come to have result experienceable in the next rebirth and to be of immediate effect on rebirthThis is not owing to strength got through a repetition conditionWhat then It is owing to the difference in the functions position Herein experienceability of result in the next rebirth and immediateness of effect on rebirth are due to the last volitions final position not to its strength For the function of impulsion has three positions that is initial medial and finalSo the fact that the sixth and seventh lapse because impulsion is used up cannot be objected toThe normal extent does not apply here in the seven instances because of the immeasurability of the conscious moment in some and the extreme brevity of the moment in othersfor extent is inapplicable here in the sense of complete cognitive serieswhich is why in fruition next to the path etc is saidThe inmates of the Abhayagiri Monastery in AnurādhapuraAt that moment at the moment of dissolution for when the moment of arising is past repetition occurs starting with the moment of presenceIts of that jhāna consciousnessThey say that with the words There could be the arising of the pain faculty it is shown that since grief arises even in obtainers of jhānait is demonstrated thereby that hate can exist without being a hindrance just as greed canfor grief does not arise without hateNor they say is there any conflict with the Paṭṭhāna text to be fancied heresince what is shown there is only grief that occurs making lost jhāna its object because the grief that occurs making its object a jhāna that has not been lost is not relevant thereAnd they say that it cannot be maintained that grief does not arise at all in those who have obtained jhāna since it did arise in Asita who had the eight attainments  and he was not one who had lost jhāna So they sayThat is wrong because there is no hate without the nature of a hindranceThe way to regard that is that when the jhāna is lost for some trivial reason such men reinstate it without difficultyAnd it is no reason to argue it is because it arose in Asita since there is falling away from jhāna with the arising of griefIf there were it would arise in fine material and immaterial beings and it does notAccordingly when in such passages as In the immaterial state due to the hindrance of lust there is the hindrance of stiffness and torpor  the hindrance of agitation the hindrance of ignorance  ill will and worry are not mentioned as hindrancesthat does not imply that they are not hindrances even by supposing that it was because lust etc were not actually hindrances and were called hindrances there figuratively because of resemblance to hindrancesTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at

said to the Blessed One Venerable sir I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed Ones utterance which he has spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning to be thusSariputta robes are of two kinds I say to be cultivated and not to be cultivated So it was said by the Blessed OneAnd with reference to what was this saidVenerable sir such robes as cause unwholesome states to increase and wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates them should not be cultivated But such robes as cause unwholesome states to diminish and wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates them

Persons are of two kinds I say to be cultivated and not to be cultivatedVenerable sir I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed Ones utterance which he has spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning to be thusGood good SariputtaIt is good that you understand the detailed meaning of my utterance which I spoke in brief without expounding the detailed meaning to be thusSariputta if all nobles understood thus the detailed meaning of my utterance which I spoke in brief it would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long timeIf all brahmins all merchantsall workers understood thus the meaning of my utterance which I spoke in brief it would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long timeIf the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people understood thus the detailed meaning of my utterance which I spoke in brief it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long timeThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Sariputta was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsBhikkhus bodily conduct is of two kinds I say to be cultivated and not to be cultivated And bodily conduct is either the one or the otherNow the water kasiṇa comes next after the earth kasiṇa Here is the detailed explanation One who wants to develop the water kasiṇa should as in the case of the earth kasiṇa seat himself comfortably and apprehend the sign in water that is either made up or not made up etc and so all the rest should be repeated in detail And as in this case so with all those that follow in this chapterWe shall in fact not repeat even this much and shall only point out what is differentHere too when someone has had practice in previous lives the sign arises for him in water that is not made up such as a pool a lake a lagoon or the ocean as in the case of the Elder CūḷaSīvaThe venerable one it seems thought to abandon gain and honour and live a secluded life He boarded a ship at Mahātittha and sailed to Jambudīpa  As he gazed at the ocean meanwhile the kasiṇa sign the counterpart of that ocean arose in himSomeone with no such previous practice should guard against the four faults of a kasiṇa and not apprehend the water as one of the colours blue yellow red or white He should fill a bowl or a fourfooted water pot to the brim with water uncontaminated by soil taken in the open through a clean cloth strainer or with any other clear unturbid water He should put it in a screened place on the outskirts of the monastery as already described and seat himself comfortably He should neither review its colournor bring its characteristic to mindApprehending the colour as belonging to its physical support he should set his mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum and using any among the various names for water such as rain  liquid  dew  fluid  he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious water waterAs he develops it in this way the two signs eventually arise in him in the way already describedHere however the learning sign has the appearance of moving If the water has bubbles of froth mixed with it the learning sign has the same appearance and it is evident as a fault in the kasiṇaBut the counterpart sign appears inactive like a crystal fan set in space like the disk of a looking glass made of crystalWith the appearance of that sign he reaches access jhāna and the jhāna tetrad and pentad in the way already describedAnyone who wants to develop the fire kasiṇa should apprehend the sign in fireHerein when someone with merit having had previous practice is apprehending the sign it arises in him in any sort of fire not made up as he looks at the fiery combustion in a lamps flame or in a furnace or in a place for baking bowls or in a forest conflagration as in the Elder Cittaguttas caseThe sign arose in that elder as he was looking at a lamps flame while he was in the Uposatha house on the day of preaching the DhammaAnyone else should make one upHere are the directions for making it He should split up some damp heartwood dry it and break it up into short lengths He should go to a suitable tree root or to a shed and there make a pile in the way done for baking bowls and have it lit He should make a hole a span and four fingers wide in a rush mat or a piece of leather or a clothand after hanging it in front of the fire he should sit down in the way already described Instead of giving attention to the grass and sticks below or the smoke above he should apprehend the sign in the dense combustion in the middle He should not review the colour as blue or yellow etc or give attention to its characteristic as heat etcbut taking the colour as belonging to its physical support and setting his mind on the name concept as the most outstanding mental datum and using any among the names for fire such as the Bright One  the Leaver of the Black Trail  the Knower of Creatures  the Altar of Sacrifice  etc he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious fire fireAs he develops it in this way the two signs eventually arise in him as already describedHerein the learning sign appears like the fire to keep sinking down as the flame keeps detaching itselfBut when someone apprehends it in a kasiṇa that is not made up any fault in the kasiṇa is evident in the learning sign and any firebrand or pile of embers or ashes or smoke appears in itThe counterpart sign appears motionless like a piece of red cloth set in space like a gold fan like a gold columnWith its appearance he reaches access jhāna and the jhāna tetrad and pentad in the way already describedAnyone who wants to develop the air kasiṇa should apprehend the sign in airAnd that is done either by sight or by touchFor this is said in the Commentaries One who is learning the air kasiṇa apprehends the sign in air He notices the tops of growing sugarcane moving to and fro or he notices the tops of bamboos or the tops of trees or the ends of the hair moving to and fro or he notices the touch of it on the bodySo when he sees sugarcanes with dense foliage standing with tops level or bamboos or trees or else hair four fingers long on a mans head being struck by the wind he should establish mindfulness in this way This wind is striking on this place Or he can establish mindfulness where the wind strikes a part of his body after entering by a window opening or by a crack in a wall and using any among the names for wind beginning with wind  breeze  blowing  he should develop the kasiṇa by using preferably the obvious air airHere the learning sign appears to move like the swirl of hot steam on rice gruel just withdrawn from an ovenThe rest should be understood in the way already describedThe counterpart sign is quiet and motionlessNext it is said in the Commentaries One who is learning the blue kasiṇa apprehends the sign in blue whether in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element Firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a bush with blue flowers or such flowers spread out on a place of offering or any blue cloth or gemBut anyone else should take flowers such as blue lotuses girikaṇṇikā flowers etc and spread them out to fill a tray or a flat basket completely so that no stamen or stalk shows or with only their petals Or he can fill it with blue cloth bunched up togetheror he can fasten the cloth over the rim of the trayOr he can make a kasiṇa disk either portable as described under the earth kasiṇa or on a wall with one of the colour elements such as bronzegreen leafgreen añjanaointment black surrounding it with a different colourAfter that he should bring it to mind as blue blue in the way already described under the earth kasiṇaAnd here too any fault in the kasiṇa is evident in the learning sign the stamens and stalks and the gaps between the petals etc are apparentThe counterpart sign appears like a crystal fan in space free from the kasiṇa diskThe rest should be understood as already describedor basket like the covering of a drumLikewise with the yellow kasiṇaThat venerable one it seems saw an offering being made on the flower altar with pattaṅga flowers at Cittalapabbata and as soon as he saw it the sign arose in him the size of the flower altarAnyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way described for the blue kasiṇa with kaṇikāra flowers etc or with yellow cloth or with a colour element He should bring it to mind as yellow yellowThe rest is as beforefor this is said One who is learning the yellow kasiṇa apprehends the sign in yellow either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour elementTherefore here too when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a flowering bush or flowers spread out or yellow cloth or colour element as in the case of the Elder CittaguttaLikewise with the red kasiṇaBut anyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way already described for the blue kasiṇa with jayasumana flowers or bandhujīvaka or red koraṇḍaka flowers etc or with red cloth or with a colour elementHe should bring it to mind as red red The rest is as beforefor this is said One who is learning the red kasiṇa apprehends the sign in red either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour elementTherefore here too when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a bandhujīvaka bush etc in flower or such flowers spread out or a red cloth or gem or colour elementOf the white kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the white kasiṇa apprehends the sign in white either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour element So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees a flowering bush of such a kind or vassikasumana flowers etc spread out or a heap of white lotuses or lilies white cloth or colour element and it also arises in a tin disk a silver disk and the moons diskAnyone else should make a kasiṇa in the way already described for the blue kasiṇa with the white flowers already mentioned or with cloth or colour element He should bring it to mind as white whiteThe rest is as beforeOf the light kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the light kasiṇa apprehends the sign in light in a hole in a wall or in a keyhole or in a window opening So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees the circle thrown on a wall or a floor by sunlight or moonlight entering through a hole in a wall etc or when he sees a circle thrown on the ground by sunlight or moonlight coming through a gap in the branches of a denseleaved tree or through a gap in a hut made of closely packed branchesAnyone else should use that same kind of circle of luminosity just described developing it as luminosity luminosity or light lightIf he cannot do so he can light a lamp inside a pot close the pots mouth make a hole in it and place it with the hole facing a wallThe lamplight coming out of the hole throws a circle on the wall He should develop that as light lightHere the learning sign is like the circle thrown on the wall or the groundThe counterpart sign is like a compact bright cluster of lightsThe rest is as beforeThis lasts longer than the other kindsOf the limitedspace kasiṇa it is said One who is learning the space kasiṇa apprehends the sign in a hole in a wall or in a keyhole or in a window opening So firstly when someone has merit having had previous practice the sign arises in him when he sees any such gap as a hole in a wallAnyone else should make a hole a span and four fingers broad in a well thatched hut or in a piece of leather or in a rush mat and so on He should develop one of these or a hole such as a hole in a wall as space spaceHere the learning sign resembles the hole together with the wall etc that surrounds it Attempts to extend it failThe counterpart sign appears only as a circle of space Attempts to extend it succeedThe rest should be understood as described under the earth kasiṇaHe with Ten Powers ten kasiṇasTells who all things did see each of which can beThe cause of fourfold and of fivefold jhāna The finematerial spheres own master keyTo tackle each andhow they are developed Now knowing their descriptions and the waywith its special part to playStudy each There are some further points that will repayOf these the earth kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as the state described as Having been one he becomes many  etc and stepping or standing or sitting on space or on water by creating earth and the acquisition of the bases of mastery by the limited and measureless methodThe water kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as diving in and out of the earth  causing rain storms creating rivers and seas making the earth and rocks and palaces quake The fire kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as smoking flaming causing showers of sparks countering fire with fire ability to burn only what one wants to burn  causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye burning up the body by means of the fire element at the time of attaining Nibbāna The air kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as going with the speed of the wind causing wind stormsThe blue kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating black forms causing darkness acquisition of the bases of mastery by the method of fairness and ugliness and attainment of the liberation by the beautiful The yellow kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating yellow forms resolving that something shall be gold  acquisition of the bases of mastery in the way stated and attainment of the liberation by the beautifulThe red kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating red forms acquisition of the bases of mastery in the way stated and attainment of the liberation by the beautifulThe white kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating white forms banishing stiffness and torpor dispelling darkness causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eyeThe light kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as creating luminous forms banishing stiffness and torpor dispelling darkness causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eyeThe space kasiṇa is the basis for such powers as revealing the hidden maintaining postures inside the earth and rocks by creating space inside them travelling unobstructed through walls and so onThe classification above below around exclusive measureless applies to all kasiṇasHerein above is upwards towards the skys levelBelow is downwards towards the earths levelAround is marked off all around like the perimeter of a fieldFor one extends a kasiṇa upwards only another downwards another all roundHence above below around is saidThe word exclusive however shows that anyone such state has nothing to do with any otherJust as there is water and nothing else in all directions for one who is actually in water so too the earth kasiṇa is the earth kasiṇa only it has nothing in common with any other kasiṇaSimilarly in each instanceMeasureless means measureless intentnessHe is intent upon the entirety with his mindNo kasiṇa can be developed by any living being described as follows Beings hindered by kamma by defilement or by kammaresult who lack faith zeal and understanding will be incapable of entering into the certainty of rightness in profitable states Herein the words hindered by kamma refer to those who possess bad kamma entailing immediate effect on rebirthBy kammaresult who have had a rebirth linking with no profitable rootcause or with only two profitable rootcausesLack faith are destitute of faith in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaZeal are destitute of zeal for the unopposed wayUnderstanding are destitute of mundane and supramundane right viewWill be incapable of entering into the certainty of rightness in profitable states means that they are incapable of entering into the noble path called certainty and rightness in profitable statesAnd this does not apply only to kasiṇas for none of them will succeed in developing any meditation subject at allSo the task of devotion to a meditation subject must be undertaken by a clansman who has no hindrance by kamma result who shuns hindrance by kamma and by defilement and who fosters faith zeal and understanding by listening to the Dhamma frequenting good men and so onin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of Concentrationfor this is said He perceives the earth kasiṇaor for some reason another projects it thusabove below around exclusive measureless  and so onas one who wants to see visible objects with the divine eye projects lighttaking no measurements in this way This is its beginning this is its middleBy defilement who have fixed wrong view or are hermaphrodites or eunuchsThe fifth chaptercalled The Description of the Remaining KasiṇasThe attainment of the immaterial states is not produced by means of the space kasiṇa and with the words ending with the white kasiṇa the light kasiṇa is included in the white kasiṇaNow ten kinds of foulness as corpses without consciousness were listed next after the kasiṇas thus the bloated the livid the festering the cut up the gnawed the scattered the hacked and scattered the bleeding the worm infested a skeleton  The bloated it is bloated because bloated by gradual dilation and swelling after the close of life as a bellows is with wind What is bloated is the same as the bloated Or alternatively what is bloated is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the bloated This is a term for a corpse in that particular stateThe livid what has patchy discolouration is called livid  What is livid is the same as the livid Or alternatively what is livid is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the livid The festering what is trickling with pus in broken places is festering  What is festering is the same as the festering Or alternatively what is festering is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the festering This is a term for a corpse in that particular stateThe cut up what has been opened up by cutting it in two is called cut up  What is cut up is the same as the cut up Or alternatively what is cut up is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the cut up This is a term for a corpse cut in the middleThe gnawed what has been chewed here and there in various ways by dogs jackals etc is what is gnawed  What is gnawed is the same as the gnawed Or alternatively what is gnawed is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the gnawed This is a term for a corpse in that particular stateThe scattered what is strewed about is scattered  What is scattered is the same as the scattered Or alternatively what is scattered is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is the scattered This is a term for a corpse that is strewed here and there in this way Here a hand there a foot there the head The hacked and scattered it is hacked and it is scattered in the way just described thus it is hacked and scattered This is a term for a corpse scattered in the way just described after it has been hacked with a knife in a crowsfoot pattern on every limbThe bleeding it sprinkles  scatters blood  and it trickles here and there thus it is the bleeding This is a term for a corpse smeared with trickling bloodThe worminfested it is maggots that are called worms  it sprinkles worms  thus it is worminfested This is a term for a corpse full of maggotsA skeleton bone is the same as skeleton Or alternatively bone is vile because of repulsiveness thus it is a skeleton This is a term both for a single bone and for a framework of bonesThese names are also used both for the signs that arise with the bloated etc as their support and for the jhānas obtained in the signsThis is a term for a corpse that is reddishcoloured in places where flesh is prominent whitishcoloured in places where pus has collected but mostly blueblack  as if draped with blueblack cloth in the blueblack placesHerein when a meditator wants to develop the jhāna called of the bloated by arousing the sign of the bloated on a bloated body he should in the way already described approach a teacher of the kind mentioned under the earth kasiṇa and learn the meditation subject from himIn explaining the meditation subject to him the teacher should explain it all that is the directions for going with the aim of acquiring the sign of foulness the characterizing of the surrounding signs the eleven ways of apprehending the sign the reviewing of the path gone by and come by concluding with the directions for absorptionAnd when the meditator has learnt it all well he should go to an abode of the kind already described and live there while seeking the sign of the bloatedMeanwhile when he hears people saying that at some village gate or on some road or at some forests edge or at the base of some rock or at the root of some tree or on some charnel ground a bloated corpse is lying he should not go there at once like one who plunges into a river where there is no fordWhy notBecause this foulness is beset by wild beasts and nonhuman beingsOr perhaps the way to it goes by a village gate or a bathing place or an irrigated fieldand there a visible object of the opposite sex might come into focus Or perhaps the body is of the opposite sexBut if he judges himself thus This is not difficult for one like me then he can go thereAnd when he goes he should do so only after he has spoken to the senior elder of the Community or to some wellknown bhikkhuWhyBecause if all his limbs are seized with shuddering at the charnel ground or if his gorge rises when he is confronted with disagreeable objects such as the visible forms and sounds of nonhuman beings lions tigers etc or something else afflicts himBesides robbers may meet there thinking a charnel ground a safe place for them whether or not they have done anything wrongAnd when men chase them they drop their goods near the bhikkhu and run awayPerhaps the men seize the bhikkhu saying We have found the thief with the goods and bully himThen he whom he told will explain to the men Do not bully him he went to do this special work after telling me and he will rescue himThis is the advantage of going only after informing someoneTherefore he should inform a bhikkhu of the kind described and then set out eager to see the sign and as happy and joyful as a warriornoble on his way to the scene of anointing as one going to offer libations at the hall of sacrifice or as a pauper on his way to unearth a hidden treasure And he should go there in the way advised by the CommentariesFor this is saidOne who is learning the bloated sign of foulness goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established with his sense faculties turned inwards with his mind not turned outwards reviewing the path gone by and come byIn the place where the bloated sign of foulness has been left he notes any stone or termitemound or tree or bush or creeper there each with its particular sign and in relation to the objectWhen he has done this he characterizes the bloated sign of foulness by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence by its colour by its mark by its shape by its direction by its location by its delimitation by its joints by its openings by its concavities by its convexities and all roundWhen he has properly apprehended the sign properly remembered it properly defined it he goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established with his sense faculties turned inwards with his mind not turned outwards reviewing the path gone by and come byWhen he walks he resolves that his walk is oriented towards itWhat is the purpose what is the advantage of characterizing the surrounding signsCharacterizing the surrounding signs has nondelusion for its purpose it has nondelusion for its advantageWhat is the purpose what is the advantage of apprehending the sign in the other eleven waysApprehending the sign in the other eleven ways has anchoring the mind for its purpose it has anchoring the mind for its advantageWhat is the purpose what is the advantage of reviewing the path gone by and come byReviewing the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purpose it has keeping the mind on the track for its advantageWhen he has established reverence for it by seeing its advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it he anchors his mind upon that object Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and deathQuite secluded from sense desires secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna  seclusionHe has arrived at the first jhāna of the finematerial sphere His is a heavenly abiding and an instance of the meritorious action consisting in meditative development So if he goes to the charnel ground to test his control of mind let him do so after striking the gong or summoning a chapterIf he goes there mainly for developing that meditation subject let him go alone with no companion without renouncing his basic meditation subject and keeping it always in mind taking a walking stick or a staff to keep off attacks by dogs etc ensuring unremitting mindfulness by establishing it well with his mind not turned outwards because he has ensured that his faculties of which his mind is the sixth are turned inwardsAs he goes out of the monastery he should note the gate I have gone out in such a direction by such a gateAnd he should not approach it upwindSo instead of approaching it upwind he should go downwindIf he cannot go by a downwind pathif there is a mountain or a ravine or a rock or a fence or a patch of thorns or water or a bog in the waythen he should go stopping his nose with the corner of his robeThese are the duties in goingWhen he has gone there in this way he should not at once look at the sign of foulnessFor perhaps if he stands in a certain direction the object does not appear clearly to him and his mind is not wieldySo rather than there he should stand where the object appears clearly and his mind is wieldyAnd he should avoid standing to leeward or to windward of itFor if he stands to leeward he is bothered by the corpse smell and his mind straysand if he stands to windward and nonhuman beings are dwelling there they may get annoyed and do him a mischiefSo he should move round a little and not stand too much to windwardThen he should stand not too far off or too near or too much towards the feet or the headFor if he stands too far off the object is not clear to himIf he stands too much towards the feet or the head not all the foulness becomes manifest to him equallySo he should stand not too far off or too near opposite the middle of the body in a place convenient for him to look at itThen he should characterize the surrounding signs in the way stated thus In the place where the bloated sign of foulness has been left he notes any stone  or creeper there with its sign These are the directions for characterizing them If there is a rock in the eyes focus near the sign he should define it in this way This rock is high or low small or large brown or black or white long or roundIf there is a termitemound he should define it in this way This is high or low small or large brown or black or white long or roundIf there is a tree he should define it in this way This is a pipal fig tree or a banyan fig tree or a kacchaka fig tree or a kapittha fig tree it is tall or short small or large black or whiteIf there is a bush he should define it in this way This is a sindi bush or a karamanda bush or a kaṇavīra bush or a koraṇḍaka bush it is tall or short small or largeIf there is a creeper he should define it in this way This is a pumpkin creeper or a gourd creeper or a brown creeper or a black creeper or a stinking creeperAlso with its particular sign and in relation to the object was said  but that is included by what has just been saidHaving done this again he should bring to mind the fact that it has an individual essence its own state of being bloated which is not common to anything else since it was said that he defines it by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essenceThe meaning is that it should be defined according to individual essence according to its own nature as the inflated the bloatedHaving defined it in this way he should apprehend the sign in the following six ways that is to say by its colour by its mark by its shape by its direction by its location by its delimitationHowThe meditator should define it by its colour thus This is the body of one who is black or white or yellowskinnedInstead of defining it by the female mark or the male mark he should define it by its mark thus This is the body of one who was in the first phase of life in the middle phase in the last phaseBy its shape he should define it only by the shape of the bloated thus This is the shape of its head this is the shape of its neck this is the shape of its hand this is the shape of its chest this is the shape of its belly this is the shape of its navel this is the shape of its hips this is the shape of its thigh this is the shape of its calf this is the shape of its footHe should define it by its direction thus There are two directions in this body that is down from the navel as the lower direction and up from it as the upper directionHe should define it by its location thus The hand is in this location the foot in this the head in this the middle of the body in thisHe should define it by its delimitation thus This body is delimited below by the soles of the feet above by the tips of the hair all round by the skin the space so delimited is filled up with thirtytwo pieces of corpseHowever a female body is not appropriate for a man or a male one for a womanTo quote the Majjhima Commentary Even when decaying a woman invades a mans mind and stays thereBut when a clansman has cultivated the meditation subject under former Enlightened Ones kept the ascetic practices threshed out the great primary elements discerned formations defined mentalitymateriality eliminated the perception of a being done the ascetics duties lived the moral life and developed the development when he contains the seed of turning away from formations and has mature knowledge and little defilement then the counterpart sign appears to him in the place while he keeps lookingIf it does not appear in that way then it appears to him as he is apprehending the sign in the six waysBut if it does not appear to him even then he should apprehend the sign again in five more ways by its joints by its openings by its concavities by its convexities and all roundHerein by its joints is properly by its hundred and eighty jointsBut how can he define the hundred and eighty joints in the bloatedConsequently he can define it by its fourteen major joints thus Three joints in the right arm three in the left arm three in the right leg three in the left leg one neck joint one waist jointBy its openings an opening is the hollow between the arm and the side the hollow between the legs the hollow of the stomach the hollow of the ear He should define it by its openings in this wayOr alternatively the opened or closed state of the eyes and the opened or closed state of the mouth can be definedBy its concavities he should define any concave place on the body such as the eye sockets or the inside of the mouth or the base of the neckOr he can define it thus I am standing in a concave place the body is in a convex placeBy its convexities he should define any raised place on the body such as the knee or the chest or the foreheadOr he can define it thus I am standing in a convex place the body is in a concave placeAll round the whole body should be defined all roundAfter working over the whole body with knowledge he should establish his mind thus The bloated the bloated upon any part that appears clearly to himIf it has not appeared even yet and if there is special intensity of the bloatedness in the belly he should establish his mind thus The bloated the bloated on thatNow as to the words he sees that the sign is properly apprehended etc the explanation is thisThe meditator should apprehend the sign thoroughly in that body in the way of apprehending the sign already describedHe should advert to it with wellestablished mindfulnessHe should see that it is properly remembered properly defined by doing that again and againStanding in a place not too far from and not too near to the body he should open his eyes look and apprehend the signHe should open his eyes and look a hundred times a thousand times thinking Repulsiveness of the bloated repulsiveness of the bloated and he should close his eyes and advert to itAs he does so again and again the learning sign becomes properly apprehended by himWhen is it properly apprehendedWhen it comes into focus alike whether he opens his eyes and looks or closes his eyes and adverts then it is called properly apprehendedWhen he has thus properly apprehended the sign properly remembered it and properly defined it then if he is unable to conclude his development on the spot he can go to his own lodging alone in the same way as described of his coming with no companion keeping that same meditation subject in mind with mindfulness well established and with his mind not turned outwards owing to his faculties being turned inwardsAs he leaves the charnel ground he should define the path he comes back by thus The path by which I have left goes in an easterly direction westerly  northerly  southerly direction or It goes in an intermediate directionor In this place it goes to the left in this place to the right and In this place there is a stone in this a termitemound in this a tree in this a bush in this a creeper When he has defined the path he has come back by and when once back he is walking up and down he should see that his walk is oriented towards it too the meaning is that he should walk up and down on a piece of ground that faces in the direction of the sign of foulnessAnd when he sits he should prepare a seat oriented towards it tooBut if there is a bog or a ravine or a tree or a fence or a swamp in that direction if he cannot walk up and down on a piece of ground facing in that direction if he cannot prepare his seat thus because there is no room for itNow as to the questions beginning with what is the purpose  characterizing the surrounding signsThe intention of the answer that begins with the words has nondelusion for its purpose is this If someone goes at the wrong time to the place where the sign of the bloated is and opens his eyes for the purpose of apprehending the sign by characterizing the surrounding signs then as soon as he looks the dead body appears as if it were standing up and threatening and pursuing him and when he sees the hideous and fearful object his mind reels he is like one demented gripped by panic fear and terror and his hair stands on endFor among the thirtyeight meditation subjects expounded in the texts no object is so frightening as this oneThere are some who lose jhāna in this meditation subjectWhyBecause it is so frighteningSo the meditator must stand firm Establishing his mindfulness well he should remove his fears in this way No dead body gets up and pursues oneIf that stone or that creeper close to it were to come the body might come tooIts appearance to you in this way is born of your perception created by your perception Today your meditation subject has appeared to you Do not be afraid bhikkhu He should laugh it off and direct his mind to the signIn that way he will arrive at distinctionThe words Characterizing the surrounding signs has nondelusion for its purpose are said on this accountTo succeed in apprehending the sign in the eleven ways is to anchor the meditation subjectFor the opening of his eyes and looking conditions the arising of the learning signWhen he is sure of absorption he works up insight and realizes ArahantshipHence it was said apprehending the sign in the other eleven ways has anchoring the mind for its purposeThe reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purpose the meaning is that the reviewing of the path gone by and of the path come back by mentioned is for the purpose of keeping properly to the track of the meditation subjectFor if this bhikkhu is going along with his meditation subject and people on the way ask him about the day What is today venerable sir  or they ask him some question about Dhamma or they welcome him he ought not to go on in silence thinking I have a meditation subjectThe day must be told the question must be answeredAs he does so the newly acquired sign vanishesBut even if it does vanish he should still tell the day when askedAlso reception of visitors must be attended to on seeing a visiting bhikkhuAnd the newly acquired sign vanishes while he is carrying out these too When he wants to go again thinking I shall go and take up the sign he finds he cannot go to the charnel ground because it has been invaded by nonhuman beings or by wild beasts or the sign has disappearedFor a bloated corpse only lasts one or two days and then turns into a livid corpseOf all the meditation subjects there is none so hard to come by as thisSo when the sign has vanished in this way the bhikkhu should sit down in his night quarters or in his day quarters and first of all review the path gone by and come by up to the place where he is actually sitting crosslegged doing it in this way I went out of the monastery by this gate I took a path leading in such and such a direction I turned left at such and such a place I turned right at such and such a placein one part of it there was a stone in another a termitemound or a tree or a bush or a creeperAs he reviews it in this way the sign becomes evident and appears as if placed in front of himHence it was said the reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping the mind on the track for its purposeNow as to the words when he has established reverence for it by seeing its advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it he anchors the mind on that object here having gained jhāna by exercising his mind on the repulsiveness in the bloated he should increase insight with the jhāna as its proximate cause and then he should see the advantages in this way Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and deathJust as a pauper who acquired a treasure of gems would guard and love it with great affection feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of it I have got what is hard indeed to get  so too this bhikkhu I have got this meditation subject which is indeed as hard to get as a very valuable treasure is for a pauper to getFor one whose meditation subject is the four elements discerns the four primary elements in himself one whose meditation subject is breathing discerns the wind in his own nostrils and one whose meditation subject is a kasiṇa makes a kasiṇa and develops it at his ease so these other meditation subjects are easily gotBut this one lasts only one or two days after which it turns into a livid corpse There is none harder to get than this one  should guard the sign loving it and feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of itIn his night quarters and in his day quarters he should keep his mind anchored there thus Repulsiveness of the bloated repulsiveness of the bloatedAs he does so the counterpart sign arisesHere is the difference between the two signs The learning sign appears as a hideous dreadful and frightening sightbut the counterpart sign appears like a man with big limbs lying down after eating his fillSimultaneously with his acquiring the counterpart sign his lust is abandoned by suppression owing to his giving no attention externally to sense desires as objectAnd owing to his abandoning of approval ill will is abandoned too as pus is with the abandoning of bloodLikewise stiffness and torpor are abandoned through exertion of energy agitation and worry are abandoned through devotion to peaceful things that cause no remorse and uncertainty about the Master who teaches the way about the way and about the fruit of the way is abandoned through the actual experience of the distinction attained So the five hindrances are abandonedAnd there are present applied thought with the characteristic of directing the mind on to that same sign and sustained thought accomplishing the function of pressing on the sign and happiness due to the acquisition of distinction and tranquillity due to the production of tranquillity in one whose mind is happy and bliss with that tranquillity as its sign and unification that has bliss as its sign due to the production of concentration in one whose mind is blissful So the jhāna factors become manifestThus access which is the obverse of the first jhāna is produced in him too at that same momentAll after that up to absorption in the first jhāna and mastery in it should be understood as described under the earth kasiṇaand he might risk his life therefor a female body is unsuitable for a man and a male body for a woman If only recently dead it may even look beautiful hence there might be danger to the life of puritythen he whom he told will have his bowl and robe well looked after in the monasteryor he will care for him by sending young bhikkhus or novices to himwhen he sits he prepares a seat that is oriented towards itThen he sees that the sign is properly apprehended that it is properly remembered that it is properly defined After that he should define the path by which he goes This path goes in an easterly direction  westerly  northerly  southerly direction or It goes in an intermediate directionand In this place it goes to the left in this place to the right and In this place there is a stone in this a termite mound in this a tree in this a bush in this a creeperHe should go to the place where the sign is defining in this way the path by which he goesfor if he did so and the smell of corpses assailed his nose his brain might get upset or he might throw up his food or he might repent his coming thinking What a place of corpses I have come tohe should make sure of the directionand if he stands too near he may get frightenedafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a rock this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a rockafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a termite mound this is the sign of foulnessafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a tree this is the sign of foulnessafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a bush this is the sign of foulnessafter which he should observe the relative positions thus In this place this is a creeper this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a creeperfor he characterizes it with its particular sign when he defines it again and againand he characterizes it in relation to the object when he defines it by combining it each time in pairs thus This is a rock this is the sign of foulness this is the sign of foulness this is a rockOr alternatively he can define it thus I am standing in this direction the sign of foulness is in that directionOr alternatively he can define it thus I am in this location the sign of foulness is in thatOr alternatively he can define it thus This is the delimitation of its hand this is the delimitation of its foot this is the delimitation of its head this is the delimitation of the middle part of its bodyOr alternatively he can delimit as much of it as he has apprehended thus Just this much of the bloated is like thisfor the object namely the repulsive aspect does not make its appearance in a body of the opposite sex which merely becomes a condition for the wrong kind of excitementThat is why the sign should be apprehended in the six ways only in a body of the same sexbut he should turn his mind in that directionthen he can both walk up and down and sit in a place where there is room even though it does not face that waybut since that stone or that creeper does not come the body will not come eitherand as he exercises his mind on that the counterpart sign arisesand as he exercises his mind on that he reaches absorptioneven by saying I do not know if he does not knowa legitimate welcome must be responded toif he does not know the answer to the question he should still say I do not knowand if he does know it he should explain it surely and he must respond to a welcomeand all the remaining duties in the Khandhakas must be carried out too that is the duties of the shrine terrace the duties of the Bodhitree terrace the duties of the Uposatha house the duties of the refectory and the bath house and those to the teacher the preceptor visitors departing bhikkhus and the resthaving gone by that path I saw the foulness in such and such a placeI stood there facing in such and such a direction and observed such and such surrounding signs I apprehended the sign of foulness in this way I left the charnel ground in such and such a direction I came back by such and such a path doing this and this and I am now sitting herethe meditation subject rides in its track as it did beforeand strike at it with thought and applied thought over and over againAnd he should advert to the sign bring it to mindthe meaning is it becomes the sign for interference by defilementAs regards the livid and the rest the characterizing already described starting with the going in the way beginning One who is learning the bloated sign of foulness goes alone with no companion with unremitting mindfulness established  should all be understood with its exposition and intention substituting for the word bloated the appropriate word in each case thus One who is learning the livid sign of foulness  One who is learning the festering sign of foulness But the differences are as follows  The livid should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the livid repulsiveness of the lividThe festering should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the festering repulsiveness of the festeringThe cut up is found on a battlefield or in a robbers forest or on a charnel ground where kings have robbers cut upSo if when he goes there it comes into focus at one adverting although lying in different places that is goodIf not then he should not touch it with his own handIf he cannot find anyone to do it he should put it together with a walking stick or a staff in such a way that there is only a fingers breadth separating the partsHaving put it together thus he should bring it to mind as Repulsiveness of the cut up repulsiveness of the cut upThe gnawed should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the gnawed repulsiveness of the gnawedAfter getting the scattered put together or putting it together in the way described under the cut up so that there is only a fingers breadth separating the pieces it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the scattered repulsiveness of the scatteredThe hacked and scattered is found in the same places as those described under the cut upTherefore after going there and getting it put together or putting it together in the way described under the cut up so that there is only a fingers breadth separating the pieces it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the hacked and scattered repulsiveness of the hacked and scatteredThe bleeding is found at the time when blood is trickling from the openings of wounds received on battlefields etc or from the openings of burst boils and abscesses when the hands and feet have been cut offSo on seeing that it should be brought to mind as Repulsiveness of the bleeding repulsiveness of the bleedingThere is a worminfested corpse when at the end of two or three days a mass of maggots oozes out from the corpses nine orificesIt can be brought to mind with respect to anyone of these as Repulsiveness of the worminfested repulsiveness of the worminfestedHere the learning sign appears as though movingA skeleton is described in various aspects in the way beginning As though he were looking at a corpse thrown onto a charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood held together by sinews So he should go in the way already described to where it has been put and noticing any stones etc with their surrounding signs and in relation to the object he should characterize it by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence thus This is a skeleton and he should apprehend the sign in the eleven ways by colour and the restBut if he looks at it apprehending it only by its colour as white it does not appear to him with its individual essence as repulsive but only as a variant of the white kasiṇaConsequently he should only look at it as a skeleton in the repulsive aspectMark is a term for the hand etc hereHe should define it by its shape however according as it is long short square round small or largeBy its direction and by its location are as already described Having defined it by its delimitation according to the periphery of each bone he should reach absorption by apprehending whichever appears most evident to himBut it can also be defined by its concavities and by its convexities according to the concave and convex places in each boneAnd it can also be defined by position thus I am standing in a concave place the skeleton is in a convex place or I am standing in a convex place the skeleton is in a concave placeIt should be defined by its joints according as any two bones are joined togetherIt should be defined all round by directing knowledge to it comprehensively thus In this place there is this skeletonAnd in this case just as in the case of those that precede it beginning with the worminfested the apprehending of the sign should be observed in this elevenfold manner as appropriateThis meditation subject is successful with a whole skeleton frame and even with a single bone as wellSo having learnt the sign in anyone of these in the eleven ways he should bring it to mind as Repulsiveness of a skeleton repulsiveness of a skeletonHere the learning sign and the counterpart sign are alike so it is said That is correct for a single boneBut when the learning sign becomes manifest in a skeleton frame what is correct to say is that there are gaps in the learning signAnd the learning sign even in a single bone should be dreadful and terrifyingWhat is said in the Commentaries in this context allows that deductionFor there after saying this There is no counterpart sign in the four divine abidings and in the ten kinds of foulnessThe learning sign appears hideous dreadful and terrifying and so onSo what we said was well considered And it is only this that is correct hereBesides the appearance of a womans whole body as a collection of bones to the Elder MahāTissa through his merely looking at her teeth demonstrates this here The Divine Ruler with ten hundred eyes Did him  fair in fame This foulness of ten species in such wisewith the Ten Powers eulogize Who made known as cause of jhānaTo tackle each and how they are developed Now knowing their description and the wayThere are some further points that will repay Study each with its special part to playHere the learning sign appears blotchycolouredbut the counterpart signs appearance has the colour which is most prevalentHere the learning sign appears as though tricklingbut the counterpart sign appears motionless and quietor in the jungle in a place where men are torn up by lions and tigersfor by doing so he would become familiar with itHe should get a monastery attendant or one studying to become an ascetic or someone else to put it together in one placeHerein the learning sign appears as though cut in the middlebut the counterpart sign appears wholeHere the learning sign appears as though gnawed here and therebut the counterpart sign appears wholeHere the learning sign appears with the gaps evidentbut the counterpart sign appears wholeHere when the learning sign becomes evident it does so with the fissures of the woundsbut the counterpart sign appears wholeHere the learning sign appears to have the aspect of moving like a red banner struck by windbut the counterpart sign appears quietand the mass lies there like a heap of paddy or boiled rice as big as the body whether the body is that of a dog a jackal a human being an ox a buffalo an elephant a horse a python or what you willFor the sign arose for the Elder CūḷaPiṇḍapātikaTissa in the corpse of an elephants carcass in the Kāḷadīghavāpi reservoirbut the counterpart sign appears quiet like a ball of boiled riceso he should define it by its mark according to hand foot head chest arm waist thigh and shinIt should be defined by its openings according to the gaps separating the bonesIf the sign does not arise even in this way then the mind should be established on the frontal bonewhile the counterpart sign appears wholebut the counterpart sign produces happiness and joy because it brings accessand in the case of the ten kinds of foulness the sign comes into being as soon as the repulsiveness is seen without any thinking about it it is again said immediately next Here the sign is twofold the learning sign and the counterpart signfor in the case of the divine abidings the sign is the breaking down of boundaries itselfHe would come to handle it without disgust as a corpseburner wouldOne who has reached jhāna in anyone of these goes free from cupidity he resembles an Arahant without greed because his greed has been well suppressedAt the same time however this classification of foulness should be understood as stated in accordance with the particular individual essences successively reached by the dead body and also in accordance with the particular subdivisions of the greedy temperamentWhen a corpse has entered upon the repulsive state it may have reached the individual essence of the bloated or anyone of the individual essences beginning with that of the lividSo the sign should be apprehended as Repulsiveness of the bloated Repulsiveness of the livid according to whichever he has been able to find This it should be understood is how the classification of foulness comes to be tenfold with the bodys arrival at each particular individual essenceAnd individually the bloated suits one who is greedy about shape since it makes evident the disfigurement of the bodys shapeThe livid suits one who is greedy about the bodys colour since it makes evident the disfigurement of the skins colourThe festering suits one who is greedy about the smell of the body aroused by scents perfumes etc since it makes evident the evil smells connected with this sore the bodyThe cut up suits one who is greedy about compactness in the body since it makes evident the hollowness inside itThe gnawed suits one who is greedy about accumulation of flesh in such parts of the body as the breasts since it makes it evident how a fine accumulation of flesh comes to nothingThe scattered suits one who is greedy about the grace of the limbs since it makes it evident how limbs can be scatteredThe hacked and scattered suits one who is greedy about a fine body as a whole since it makes evident the disintegration and alteration of the body as a wholeThe bleeding suits one who is greedy about elegance produced by ornaments since it makes evident its repulsiveness when smeared with bloodThe worminfested suits one who is greedy about ownership of the body since it makes it evident how the body is shared with many families of wormsThis it should be understood is how the classification of foulness comes to be tenfold according to the subdivisions of the greedy temperament But as regards the tenfold foulness just as it is only by virtue of its rudder that a boat keeps steady in a river with turbulent waters and a rapid current and it cannot be steadied without a rudder so too here owing to the weak hold on the object consciousness when unified only keeps steady by virtue of applied thought and it cannot be steadied without applied thought which is why there is only the first jhāna here not the second and the restAnd repulsive as this object is still it arouses joy and happiness in him by his seeing its advantages thus Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death and by his abandoning the hindrances oppression just as a garbage heap does in a flowerscavenger by his seeing the advantages thus Now I shall get a high wage and as the workings of purges and emetics do in a man suffering the pains of sicknessThis foulness while of ten kinds has only one characteristicFor though it is of ten kinds nevertheless its characteristic is only its impure stinking disgusting and repulsive state And foulness appears with this characteristic not only in a dead body but also in a living one as it did to the Elder MahāTissa who lived at Cetiyapabbata  and to the novice attendant on the Elder Saṅgharakkhita while he was watching the king riding an elephantFor a living body is just as foul as a dead oneThis is the bodys nature it is a collection of over three hundred bones jointed by one hundred and eighty joints bound together by nine hundred sinews plastered over with nine hundred pieces of flesh enveloped in the moist inner skin enclosed in the outer cuticle with orifices here and there constantly dribbling and trickling like a grease pot inhabited by a community of worms the home of disease the basis of painful states perpetually oozing from the nine orifices like a chronic open carbunclewhich when untended with tooth sticks and mouthwashing and headanointing and bathing and underclothing and dressing would judged by the universal repulsiveness of the body make even a king if he wandered from village to village with his hair in its natural wild disorder no different from a flowerscavenger or an outcaste or what you will So there is no distinction between a kings body and an outcastes in so far as its impure stinking nauseating repulsiveness is concernedBut by rubbing out the stains on its teeth with tooth sticks and mouth washing and all that by concealing its private parts under several cloths by daubing it with various scents and salves by pranking it with nosegays and such things it is worked up into a state that permits of its being taken as I and mineSo men delight in women and women in men without perceiving the true nature of its characteristic foulness now masked by this adventitious adornmentBut in the ultimate sense there is no place here even the size of an atom fit to lust afterAnd then when any such bits of it as head hairs body hairs nails teeth spittle snot excrement or urine have dropped off the body beings will not touch them they are ashamed humiliated and disgustedBut as long as anyone of these things remains in it though it is just as repulsive they take it as agreeable desirable permanent pleasant self because they are wrapped in the murk of ignorance and dyed with affection and greed for selfTaking it as they do they resemble the old jackal who saw a flower not yet fallen from a kiṃsuka tree in a forest and yearned after it thinking This is a piece of meat it is a piece of meatThere was a jackal chanced to see A flowering kiṃsuka in a woodIn haste he went to where it stood I have found a meatbearing tree He chewed the blooms that fell but couldOf course find nothing fit to eat He took it thus Unlike the meat There on the tree this is no goodA wise man will not think to treat As foul only the part that fellBut treats as foul the part as well That in the body has its seatFools cannot in their folly tell Nor can escape its painful spellBut since the wise have thus laid bare Be it alive or dead they knowThis filthy bodys nature so There is no beauty lurking thereFor this is saidThis filthy body stinks outright Like ordure like a privys siteThis body men that have insight Condemn as object of a fools delightA tumour where nine holes abide Wrapped in a coat of clammy hideAnd trickling filth on every side Polluting the air with stenches far and wideIf it perchance should come about That what is inside it came outSurely a man would need a knout With which to put the crows and dogs to routSo a capable bhikkhu should apprehend the sign whether in a living bodyin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of ConcentrationA skeleton suits one who is greedy about fine teeth since it makes evident the repulsiveness of the bones in the bodyonly the characteristic of foulness is not evident in a living body being hidden by adventitious embellishmentsfrom both of whose eyes eyefilth trickles from whose ears comes earfilth from whose nostrils snot from whose mouth food and bile and phlegm and blood from whose lower outlets excrement and urine and from whose ninetynine thousand pores the broth of stale sweat seepswith bluebottles and their like buzzing round itAnd soon get caught in Evils snare They take the body to be fairor in a dead one wherever the aspect of foulness is manifest and he should make the meditation subject reach absorptioncalled The Description of Foulness as a Meditation SubjectThe sixth chapterOne who wants to develop the recollection of virtue should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own different kinds of virtue in their special qualities of being untorn etc as follows Indeed my various kinds of virtue are untorn unrent unblotched unmottled liberating praised by the wise not adhered to and conducive to concentration And a layman should recollect them in the form of laymens virtue while one gone forth into homelessness should recollect them in the form of the virtue of those gone forthWhether they are the virtues of laymen or of those gone forth when no one of them is broken in the beginning or in the end not being torn like a cloth ragged at the ends then they are untornWhen no one of them is broken in the middle not being rent like a cloth that is punctured in the middle then they are unrentWhen they are not broken twice or thrice in succession not being blotched like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with discrepantcoloured oblong or round patch appearing on her back or belly then they are unblotchedWhen they are not broken all over at intervals not being mottled like a cow speckled with discrepantcoloured spots then they are unmottledOr in general they are untorn unrent unblotched unmottled when they are undamaged by the seven bonds of sexuality and by anger and enmity and the other evil things Those same virtues are liberating since they liberate by freeing from the slavery of cravingThey are praised by the wise because they are praised by such wise men as Enlightened OnesThey are not adhered to since they are not adhered to with craving and false view or because of the impossibility of misapprehending that There is this flaw in your virtuesAs long as he recollects his own virtues in their special qualities of being untorn etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greedhis mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by virtue  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious momentBut owing to the profundity of the virtues special qualities or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of virtue too because it arises with the virtues special qualities as the meansAnd when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of virtue he has respect for the training He lives in communion with his fellows in the life of purity He is sedulous in welcoming He is devoid of the fear of selfreproach and so on He sees fear in the slightest fault He attains fullness of faith and so on He has much happiness and gladnessAnd if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of his virtue Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of virtue in the detailed explanationThey are conducive to concentration since they conduce to access concentration and absorption concentration or to path concentration and fruition concentrationor obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusionOne who wants to develop the recollection of generosity should be naturally devoted to generosity and the constant practice of giving and sharingOr alternatively if he is one who is starting the development of it he should make the resolution From now on when there is anyone present to receive I shall not eat even a single mouthful without having given a gift And that very day he should give a gift by sharing according to his means and his ability with those who have distinguished qualities When he has apprehended the sign in that he should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own generosity in its special qualities of being free from the stain of avarice etc as follows It is gain for me it is great gain for me that in a generation obsessed by the stain of avarice I abide with my heart free from stain by avarice and am freely generous and openhanded that I delight in relinquishing expect to be asked and rejoice in giving and sharing Herein it is gain for me it is my gain advantage The intention is I surely partake of those kinds of gain for a giver that have been commended by the Blessed One as follows A man who gives life by giving food shall have life either divine or human  and A giver is loved and frequented by many  and One who gives is ever loved according to the wise mans law  and so onIt is great gain for me it is great gain for me that this Dispensation or the human state has been gained by meWhyBecause of the fact that I abide with my mind free from stain by avarice  and rejoice in giving and sharingHerein obsessed by the stain of avarice is overwhelmed by the stain of avariceGeneration beings so called owing to the fact of their being generatedSo the meaning here is this among beings who are overwhelmed by the stain of avarice which is one of the dark states that corrupt the natural transparency of consciousness and which has the characteristic of inability to bear sharing ones own good fortune with othersFree from stain by avarice because of being both free from avarice and from the other stains greed hate and the restI abide with my heart I abide with my consciousness of the kind already stated is the meaningBut in the sutta I live the home life with my heart free  etc is said because it was taught there as a mental abiding to depend on constantly to Mahānāma the Sakyan who was a streamenterer asking about an abiding to depend onThere the meaning is I live overcoming Freely generous liberally generousOpenhanded with hands that are purifiedWhat is meant is with hands that are always washed in order to give gifts carefully with ones own handsThat I delight in relinquishing the act of relinquishing is relinquishing  the meaning is giving upTo delight in relinquishing is to delight in constant devotion to that relinquishingExpect to be asked  accustomed to being asked because of giving whatever others ask for is the meaningYājayoga is a readingin which case the meaning is devoted to sacrifice  in other words to sacrificing And rejoice in sharingthe meaning is he recollects thus I give gifts and I share out what is to be used by myself and I rejoice in bothBut owing to the profundity of the generositys special qualities or owing to his being occupied in recollecting the generositys special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna is known as recollection of generosity too because it arises with the generositys special qualities as the meansAnd when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of generosity he becomes ever more intent on generosity his preference is for nongreed he acts in conformity with lovingkindness he is fearless He has much happiness and gladness And if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of his giving Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of generosity in the detailed explanationhis mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by generosity  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious momentAs long as he recollects his own generosity in its special qualities of freedom from stain by avarice etc in this way then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greedor obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusionOne who wants to develop the recollection of deities should possess the special qualities of faith etc evoked by means of the noble path recollect his own special qualities of faith etc with deities standing as witnesses as followsand he should go into solitary retreat and There are deities of the Realm of the Four Kings  there are deities of the Realm of the Thirtythree  there are deities who are Gone to Divine Bliss  who are Contented  who Delight in Creating  who Wield Power Over Others Creations  there are deities of Brahmās Retinue  there are deities higher than that And those deities were possessed of faith such that on dying here they were reborn there and such faith is present in me tooAnd those deities were possessed of virtue of learning In the sutta however it is said On the occasion Mahānāma on which a noble disciple recollects the faith the virtue the learning the generosity and the understanding that are both his own and of those deities on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed  Although this is said it should nevertheless be understood as said for the purpose of showing that the special qualities of faith etc in oneself are those in the deities making the deities stand as witnessesFor it is said definitely in the Commentary He recollects his own special qualities making the deities stand as witnessesAs long as in the prior stage he recollects the deities special qualities of faith etc and in the later stage he recollects the special qualities of faith etc existing in himself then On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greedor obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion his mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by deities  So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already stated  the jhāna factors arise in a single conscious momentBut owing to the profundity of the special qualities of faith etc or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorptionAnd that access jhāna itself is known as recollection of deities too because it arises with the deities special qualities as the meansAnd when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of deities he becomes dearly loved by deities He obtains even greater fullness of faith He has much happiness and gladnessAnd if he penetrates no higher he is at least headed for a happy destinyNow when a man is truly wise His constant task will surely beThis recollection of deities Blessed with such mighty potencyThis is the section dealing with the recollection of deities in the detailed explanationof generosity of understanding such that when they died here they were reborn there and such understanding is present in me too Now in setting forth the detail of these recollections after the words His mind has rectitude on that occasion being inspired by the Perfect One it is added When a noble disciples mind has rectitude Mahānāma the meaning inspires him the law inspires him and the application of the law makes him glad When he is glad happiness is born in him  Herein the meaning inspires him should be understood as said of contentment inspired by the meaning beginning This Blessed One is such since he is  The law inspires him is said of contentment inspired by the textThe application of the law makes him glad is said of both And when in the case of the recollection of deities inspired by deities is said this should be understood as said either of the consciousness that occurs in the prior stage inspired by deities or of the consciousness that occurs in the later stage inspired by the special qualities that are similar to those of the deities and are productive of the deities state These six recollections succeed only in noble disciplesFor the special qualities of the Enlightened One the Law and the Community are evident to themand they possess the virtue with the special qualities of untornness etc the generosity that is free from stain by avarice and the special qualities of faith etc similar to those of deitiesAnd in the Mahānāma Sutta they are expounded in detail by the Blessed One in order to show a streamwinner an abiding to depend upon when he asked for oneAlso in the Gedha Sutta  Here bhikkhus a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One in this way That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished  His mind has rectitude on that occasion He has renounced got free from emerged from cupidityCupidity bhikkhus is a term for the five cords of sense desireSome beings gain purity here by making this recollection their prop  they are expounded in order that a noble disciple should purify his consciousness by means of the recollections and so attain further purification in the ultimate sense thus And in the Sambādhokāsa Sutta taught by the venerable MahāKaccāna they are expounded as the realization of the wideopen through the susceptibility of purification that exists in the ultimate sense only in a noble disciple thus It is wonderful friends it is marvellous how the realization of the wideopen in the crowded house life has been discovered by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened for the purification of beings for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the ending of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realization of Nibbāna that is to say the six stations of recollectionWhat sixHere friends a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One  Some beings are susceptible to purification in this way Also in the Uposatha Sutta And what is the Noble Ones Uposatha VisākhāIt is the gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by imperfectionsAnd what is the gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by imperfectionsHere Visākhā a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One   they are expounded in order to show the greatness of the fruit of the Uposatha as a mindpurifying meditation subject for a noble disciple who is observing the UposathaAnd in the Book of Elevens  One who has faith is successful Mahānāma not one who has no faithOne who is energetic  One whose mindfulness is established  One who is concentrated  One who has understanding is successful Mahānāma not one who has no understandingHaving established yourself in these five things Mahānāma you should develop six thingsHere Mahānāma you should recollect the Perfect One That Blessed One is such since   when a noble disciple has asked Venerable sir in what way should we abide who abide in various ways they are expounded to him in order to show the way of abiding in this way For when he is recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha etc even only according to hearsay his consciousness settles downby virtue of which the hindrances are suppressed In his supreme gladness he initiates insight and he even attains to Arahantship like the Elder Phussadeva who dwelt at KaṭakandhakāraThat venerable one it seems saw a figure of the Enlightened One created by Māra He thought How good this appears despite its having greed hate and delusion What can the Blessed Ones goodness have been like For he was quite without greed hate and delusion  He acquired happiness with the Blessed One as object and by augmenting his insight he reached Arahantshipin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peoplein the Treatise on the Development of ConcentrationStill though this is so they can be brought to mind by an ordinary man too if he possesses the special qualities of purified virtue and the restThe seventh chaptercalled The Description of Six RecollectionsAt SavatthiThen the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side and said to himVenerable sir does the Blessed One recall ever having gone to the brahma world by spiritual power with a mindmade body I recall Ananda having gone to the brahma world by spiritual power with a mindmade bodyI recall ananda having gone to the brahma world by spiritual power with this body composed of the four great elementsThat the Blessed One is able to go to the brahma world by spiritual power with a mindmade body and that he recalls having gone to the brahma world by spiritual power with this body composed of the four great elements that is wonderful and amazing venerable sir on the part of the Blessed OneThe Tathagatas Ananda are wonderful and possess wonderful qualities the Tathagatas are amazing and possess amazing qualitiesWhen Ananda the Tathagata immerses the body in the mind and the mind in the body and when he dwells having entered upon a blissful perception and a buoyant perception in regard to the body on that occasion the body of the Tathagata becomes more buoyant malleable wieldy and luminousJust as an iron ball Ananda heated all day becomes more buoyant malleable wieldy and luminous so too when the Tathagata immerses the body in the mind and the mind in the body and when he dwells having entered upon a blissful perception and a buoyant perception in regard to the body on that occasion the body of the Tathiigata becomes more buoyant malleable wieldy and luminousWhen Ananda the Tathagata immerses the body in the mind and the mind in the body and when he dwells having entered upon a blissful perception and a buoyant perception in regard to the body on that occasion the body of the Tathfigata rises up without difficulty from the earth into the air He wields the various kinds of spiritual power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahma worldJust as Ananda a tuft of cotton wool or kapok being light sustained by the wind rises up without difficulty from the earth into the air so too when the Tathagata immerses the body in the mind and the mind in the body and when he dwells having entered upon a blissful perception and a buoyant perception in regard to the body on that occasion the body of the Tathsgata rises up without difficulty from the earth into the air He wields the various kinds of spiritual power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahma worldBut venerable sir does the Blessed One recall ever having gone to the brahma world by spiritual power with this body of the four great elements  immerses the body in the mind having taken the body he mounts it on the mind he makes it dependent on the mind he sends it along the course of the mindfor it is a blissful perception because it accom panies the peaceful bliss  and a buoyant perception because there is no inhibition by the defilementsA blissful perception a buoyant perception  this is the perception associated with the mind of direct knowledge immerses the mind in the body having taken the mind he mounts it on the body he makes it dependent on the body he sends it along the course of the body The body is the coarse physical body Movement along the course of the body is sluggish The mind is an exalted mind Movement along the course of the mind is buoyant  This is a term of unique occurrence in the Word of the Buddha preserved in the TipitakaNow comes the description of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment which was listed as the one perception next to the immaterial states Herein it nourishes  thus it is nutriment That is of four kinds as physical nutriment nutriment consisting of contact nutriment consisting of mental volition and nutriment consisting of consciousnessBut what is it here that nourishes whatPhysical nutriment nourishes the materiality of the octad that has nutritive essence as eighthAnd to show how they bring fear thus physical nutriment should be illustrated by the simile of the childs flesh But of these four kinds of nutriment it is only physical nutriment classed as what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted that is intended here as nutriment in this senseThe perception arisen as the apprehension of the repulsive aspect in that nutriment is perception of repulsiveness in nutrimentOne who wants to develop that perception of repulsiveness in nutriment should learn the meditation subject and see that he has no uncertainty about even a single word of what he has learnt Then he should go into solitary retreat and review repulsiveness in ten aspects in the physical nutrimentclassified as what is eaten drunk chewed and tasted that is to say as to going seeking using secretion receptacle what is uncooked  what is cooked  fruit outflow and smearingHerein as to going even when a man has gone forth in so mighty a dispensation still after he has perhaps spent all night reciting the Enlightened Ones word or doing the ascetic s work after he has risen early to do the duties connected with the shrine terrace and the Enlightenmenttree terrace to set out the water for drinking and washing to sweep the grounds and to see to the needs of the body after he has sat down on his seat and given attention to his meditation subject twenty or thirty times and got up again then he must take his bowl and outer robe he must leave behind the ascetics woods that are not crowded with people offer the bliss of seclusion possess shade and water and are clean cool delightful places he must disregard the Noble Ones delight in seclusion and he must set out for the village in order to get nutriment as a jackal for the charnel groundAnd as he goes thus from the time when he steps down from his bed or chair he has to tread on a carpet covered with the dust of his feet geckos droppings and so onNext he has to see the doorstep which is more repulsive than the inside of the room since it is often fouled with the droppings of rats bats and so onNext the lower terrace which is more repulsive than the terrace above since it is all smeared with the droppings of owls pigeons and so onNext the grounds which are more repulsive than the lower floor since they are defiled by old grass and leaves blown about by the wind by sick novices urine excrement spittle and snot and in the rainy season by water mud and so onAnd he has to see the road to the monastery which is more repulsive than the groundsIn due course after standing in the debating lodge when he has finished paying homage at the Enlightenment Tree and the shrine he sets out thinking Instead of looking at the shrine that is like a cluster of pearls and the Enlightenment Tree that is as lovely as a bouquet of peacocks tail feathers and the abode that is as fair as a gods palace I must now turn my back on such a charming place and go abroad for the sake of food and on the way to the village the view of a road of stumps and thorns and an uneven road broken up by the force of water awaits himNext after he has put on his waist cloth as one who hides an abscess and tied his waist band as one who ties a bandage on a wound and robed himself in his upper robes as one who hides a skeleton and taken out his bowl as one who takes out a pan for medicine when he reaches the vicinity of the village gate perhaps the sight of an elephants carcass a horses carcass a buffalos carcass a human carcass a snakes carcass or a dogs carcass awaits himNext as he stands in the village gateway he must scan the village streets in order to avoid danger from savage elephants horses and so onSo this repulsive experience beginning with the carpet that has to be trodden on and ending with the various kinds of carcasses that have to be seen and smelled has to be undergone for the sake of nutrimentOh nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to going How as to seekingWhen he has endured the repulsiveness of going in this way and has gone into the village and is clothed in his cloak of patches he has to wander in the village streets from house to house like a beggar with a dish in his handAnd in the rainy season wherever he treads his feet sink into water and mire up to the flesh of the calves He has to hold the bowl in one hand and his robe up with the otherIn the hot season he has to go about with his body covered with the dirt grass and dust blown about by the windOn reaching such and such a house door he has to see and even to tread in gutters and cesspools covered with bluebottles and seething with all the species of worms all mixed up with fish washings meat washings rice washings spittle snot dogs and pigs excrement and what notAnd when he enters a house some give and some do notAnd when they give some give yesterdays cooked rice and stale cakes and rancid jelly sauce and so onSome not giving say Please pass on venerable sir others keep silent as if they did not see him Some avert their faces Others treat him with harsh words such as Go away you baldheadOh nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to seekingHow as to usingAfter he has sought the nutriment in this way and is sitting at ease in a comfortable place outside the village then so long as he has not dipped his hand into it he would be able to invite a respected bhikkhu or a decent person if he saw one to share itAnd when its good appearance has been spoilt by his squeezing it up and it has been made into a ball and put into his mouth then the lower teeth function as a mortar the upper teeth as a pestle and the tongue as a handIt gets pounded there with the pestle of the teeth like a dogs dinner in a dogs trough while he turns it over and over with his tongue then the thin spittle at the tip of the tongue smears it and the thick spittle behind the middle of the tongue smears it and the filth from the teeth in the parts where a toothstick cannot reach smears itWhen thus mashed up and besmeared this peculiar compound now destitute of the original colour and smell is reduced to a condition as utterly nauseating as a dogs vomit in a dogs troughYet notwithstanding that it is like this it can still be swallowed because it is no longer in range of the eyes focus This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to using How as to secretionBuddhas and Paccekabuddhas and Wheelturning Monarchs have only one of the four secretions consisting of bile phlegm pus and bloodSo when the food has arrived at the stage of being eaten and it enters inside then in one whose secretion of bile is in excess it becomes as utterly nauseating as if smeared with thick madhuka oiland in one whose secretion of blood is in excess it is as utterly nauseating as if smeared with dye This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to secretionHow as to receptacleWhen it has gone inside the belly and is smeared with one of these secretions then the receptacle it goes into is no gold dish or crystal or silver dish and so onOn the contrary if it is swallowed by one ten years old it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for ten yearsIf it is swallowed by one twenty years old thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety ears oldif it is swallowed by one a hundred years old it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for a hundred years This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to receptacleHow as to what is uncooked After this nutriment has arrived at such a place for its receptacle then for as long as it remains uncooked it stays in that same place just described which is shrouded in absolute darkness pervaded by draughts tainted by various smells of ordure and utterly fetid and loathsome And just as when a cloud out of season has rained during a drought and bits of grass and leaves and rushes and the carcasses of snakes dogs and human beings that have collected in a pit at the gate of an outcaste village remain there warmed by the suns heat until the pit becomes covered with froth and bubbles so too what has been swallowed that day and yesterday and the day before remains there together and being smothered by the layer of phlegm and covered with froth and bubbles produced by digestion through being fermented by the heat of the bodily fires it becomes quite loathsome This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is uncookedHow as to what is cookedWhen it has been completely cooked there by the bodily fires it does not turn into gold silver etc as the ores of gold silver etc do through smeltingInstead giving off froth and bubbles it turns into excrement and fills the receptacle for digested food like brown clay squeezed with a smoothing trowel and packed into a tube and it turns into urine and fills the bladder This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is cookedHow as to fruitWhen it has been rightly cooked it produces the various kinds of ordure consisting of head hairs body hairs nails teeth and the rest When wrongly cooked it produces the hundred diseases beginning with itch ringworm smallpox leprosy plague consumption coughs flux and so on Such is its fruit This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to fruit How as to outflowOn being swallowed it enters by one door after which it flows out by several doors in the way beginning Eyedirt from the eye ear dirt from the ear And on being swallowed it is swallowed even in the company of large gatheringsBut on flowing out now converted into excrement urine etc it is excreted only in solitudeOn the first day one is delighted to eat it elated and full of happiness and joyOn the second day one stops ones nose to void it with a wry face disgusted and dismayedAnd on the first day one swallows it lustfully greedily gluttonously infatuatedly But on the second day after a single night has passed one excretes it with distaste ashamed humiliated and disgustedHence the Ancients saidThe food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suckGo in all by a single door But by nine doors come oozing outThe food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suckMen like to eat in company But to excrete in secrecyThe food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suckThese a man eats with high delight And then excretes with dumb disgustThe food and drink so greatly prized The crisp to chew the soft to suckA single night will be enough To bring them to putridityThis is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to outflowHow as to smearingAt the time of using it he smears his hands lips tongue and palateand they become repulsive by being smeared with it And even when washed they have to be washed again and again in order to remove the smellAnd just as when rice is being boiled the husks the red powder covering the grain etc rise up and smear the mouth rim and lid of the cauldron so too when eaten it rises up during its cooking and simmering by the bodily fire that pervades the whole body it turns into tartar which smears the teethAnd when these doors are smeared by it they never become either clean or pleasing even though washed every dayAnd after one has washed a certain one of these the hand has to be washed againAs he reviews repulsiveness in this way in ten aspects and strikes at it with thought and applied thought physical nutriment becomes evident to him in its repulsive aspectHe cultivates that sign again and again develops and repeatedly practices itAs he does so the hindrances are suppressedBut perception is evident here in the apprehension of the repulsive aspectWhen a bhikkhu devotes himself to this perception of repulsiveness in nutriment his mind retreats retracts and recoils from craving for flavoursHe nourishes himself with nutriment without vanity and only for the purpose of crossing over suffering as one who seeks to cross over the desert eats his own dead childs flesh Then his greed for the five cords of sense desire comes to be fully understood without difficulty by means of the full understanding of the physical nutrimentHe fully understands the materiality aggregate by means of the fullunderstanding of the five cords of sense desireDevelopment of mindfulness occupied with the body comes to perfection in him through the repulsiveness of what is uncooked and the rest He has entered upon a way that is in conformity with the perception of foulnessAnd by keeping to this way even if he does not experience the deathless goal in this life he is at least bound for a happy destinyThis is the detailed explanation of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutrimentcontact as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of feelingmental volition as nutriment nourishes rebirth linking in the three kinds of becomingconsciousness as nutriment nourishes mentalitymateriality at the moment of rebirthlinkingwhen there is nutriment as mental volition there is rebirthlinking which brings perilwhen there is nutriment as contact there is approaching which brings perilNow when there is physical nutriment there is attachment which brings periland consciousness as nutriment by the simile of the hundred spears mental volition as nutriment by the simile of the pit of live coals contact as nutriment by the simile of the hideless cow and not only that but he has to suffer his nose to be assailed by the smell of themfrom which flies come up and settle on his outer cloak of patches and on his bowl and on his headWhen he has wandered for alms in the village in this way like a beggar he has to depart from itSo this experience beginning with the entry into the village and ending with the departure from it which is repulsive owing to the water mud etc that has to be trodden in and seen and endured has to be undergone for the sake of nutrimentbut as soon as he has dipped his hand into it out of desire to eat he would be ashamed to say Take someAnd when he has dipped his hand in and is squeezing it up the sweat trickling down his five fingers wets any dry crisp food there may be and makes it soddenbut those with weak merit have all fourin one whose secretion of phlegm in excess it is as if smeared with the juice of nāgabalā leavesin one whose secretion of pus is in excess it is as if smeared with rancid buttermilkand it turns into spittle phlegm etc which respectively smear the tongue palate etc and it turns into eyedirt eardirt snot urine excrement etc which respectively smear the eyes ears nose and nether passagesAnd after one has washed a certain one of these the repulsiveness does not depart from it even after two or three washings with cow dung and clay and scented powder This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to smearingand his mind is concentrated in access concentration but without reaching absorption because of the profundity of physical nutriment as a state with an individual essencewhich is why this meditation subject goes by the name of perception of repulsiveness in nutrimentThe word perception is used for the dhamma with the characteristic of perceiving  as in the case of perception of visible objects perception of sound etc and it is used for insight as in the case of perception of impermanence perception of suffering etc and it is used for serenity as in the passage Perception of the bloated and perception of visible objects have these one meaning or different meanings Sopāka  and so onfor it is the apprehending of the repulsive aspect in nutriment or the access jhāna produced by means of that that is intended here by perception of repulsiveness in nutrimentHere however it should be understood as the preliminary work for serenityIt nourishes  the meaning is that it leads up fetches produces its own fruit through its state as a condition for the fruits arising or presence which state is called nutriment conditionIt is made into a mouthful  thus it is physical  In this way it gets its designation from the concrete object but as to characteristic it should be understood to have the characteristic of nutritive essence  It is physical and it is nutriment in the sense stated thus it is physical nutriment so with the restIt touches  thus it is contact for although this is an immaterial state it occurs also as the aspect of touching on an object which is why it is said to have the characteristic of touchingIt wills  thus it is volition  the meaning is that it arranges itself together with associated states upon the object Mental volition is volition occupied with the mindIt cognizes by conjecturing about rebirth  thus it is consciousness Then twenty or thirty is taken as the number already observed by the time of setting out on the alms round Or alternatively from going up to smearing is one turn then it is after giving attention to the meditation subject by twenty or thirty turns in this wayTwenty or thirty times here some say that the definition of the number of times is according to what is presentbycontinuity  But others say that it is by way of warming up the seat for development that has not reached suppression of hindrances does not remove the bodily discomfort in the act of sitting because of the lack of pervading happiness So there is inconstancy of posture tooPaccattharaṇa  a spread consisting of a rug to be spread on the ground for protecting the skinin a lodge for thinking in the way beginning Where must I go for alms todayBut those who are scrupulously clean by nature wash their hands again after washing the mouth and so onA certain one is said with reference to the anal orificeThat sign that object as the sign for development which sign is called physical nutriment and has appeared in the repulsive aspect to one who gives his attention to it repeatedly in the ways already describedFor it is owing to profundity that the first pair of truths is hard to seeAnd there while development occurs through the repulsive aspect it is only the dhammas on account of which there comes to be the concept of physical nutriment that are repulsive not the concept But it is because the occurrence of development is contingent only upon dhammas with an individual essence and because the profundity is due to that actual individual essence of dhammas that have individual essences that the jhāna cannot reach absorption in it through apprehension of the repulsive aspectBy characterizing individual essences by making certain of the specific characteristics of hardness and so onFor this meditation subject does not consist in the observing of a mere concept as in the case of the earth kasiṇa as a meditation subject neither does it consist in the observing of the colour blue etc as in the case of the blue kasiṇa as a meditation subject nor in the observing of the general characteristics of impermanence etc in formations as in the case of insight as a meditation subject but rather it consists in the observing of the individual essences of earth and so onThat is why by characterizing individual essences is said which means by making certain of the specific characteristics of hardness and so onHerein as regards earth element etc the meaning of element is the meaning of individual essence the meaning of individual essence is the meaning of voidness the meaning of voidness is the meaning of notalivingbeingSo it is just earth in the sense of individual essence voidness and notalivingbeing that is the element hence it is earth elementso too in the case of the water element and the restThe earth element is the element that is the foothold for the conascent material states Likewise the water element is the element of their cohesion the fire element is the element of their ripening and the air element is the element of their conveyance and distensionWhat occurs in attendance upon self by its pertaining to the state that may be taken as self because it is included in ones own continuity as internal In addition attention should be given to the elements in the following ways as to word meaning by groups by particles by characteristic etc as to how originated as to variety and unity as to resolution and nonresolution  as to the similar and the dissimilar as to distinction between internal and external as to inclusion as to condition as to lack of conscious reaction as to analysis of conditions Herein one who gives his attention to them as to word meaning should do so separately and generally thus separately it is earth because it is spread out it flows or it glides or it satisfies  thus it is water it heats  thus it is fire it blows  thus it is air But without differentiation they are elements because of bearing their own characteristics because of grasping suffering and because of sorting out suffering This is how they should be given attention as to word meaningBy groups there is the earth element described under the twenty aspects beginning with head hairs body hairs and also the water element described under the twelve aspects beginning with bile phlegm etc Now as to theseColour odour taste and nutritive Essence and the four elementsFrom combination of these eight There comes the common usage head hairsAnd separately from these eight There is no common usage head hairsConsequently head hairs are only a mere group of eight statesLikewise body hairs and the restA component here that is kammaoriginated is a group of ten states that is to say the former eight together with the life faculty and sexBut it is on account of respective prominence of stiffenedness or cohesion that it comes to be styled earth element or water elementThis is how they should be given attention to by groupsand that is held together by the water element measuring half as much Being maintained by the fire element and distended by the air element it does not get scattered or dissipated Instead of getting scattered or dissipated it arrives at the alternative states of the female and male sex etc and manifests smallness bigness length shortness toughness rigidity and so onBy particles in this body the earth element taken as reduced to fine dust and powdered to the size of the smallest atom might amount to an average doṇa measure fullThe liquid water element that is the mode of cohesion being founded on earth maintained by fire and distended by air does not trickle or run away Instead of trickling or running away it provides continued refreshmentsAnd here the fire element that cooks what is eaten drunk etc and is the mode of warming and has the characteristic of heat being established on earth held together by water and distended by air maintains this body and ensures its proper appearanceAnd this body being maintained by it shows no putrefactionSo this mechanism of elements carries on like a magic trick deceiving foolish people with the male and female sex and so on This is how they should be given attention by particlesand being propelled by the other motile air it shows intimation and it flexes and extends and it wriggles the hands and feet doing so in the postures comprising of walking standing sitting and lying downAnd this body being distended by the latter kind of air does not collapse but stands erectThe air element that courses through all the limbs and has the characteristic of moving and distending being founded upon earth held together by water and maintained by fire distends this bodyThis is how they should be given attention to by characteristic and so onThe air element has the characteristic of distending Its function is to cause motion It is manifested as conveyingThe fire element has the characteristic of heat Its function is to mature  It is manifested as a continued supply of softnessThe water element has the characteristic of trickling Its function is to intensify It is manifested as holding togetherAs to characteristic etc he should advert to the four elements in this way The earth elementwhat are its characteristic function manifestation defining them in this way The earth element has the characteristic of hardness Its function is to act as a foundation It is manifested as receivingall the rest are of fourfold origination This is how they should be given attention as to how originatedinbreath and outbreath are consciousnessoriginated onlyThe fire that cooks what is eaten etc is kamma originated onlythe four consisting of tears sweat spittle and snot are temperatureoriginated and consciousnessoriginated onlythe four consisting of gorge dung pus and urine are temperatureoriginated onlyAs to how originated among the fortytwo components beginning with head hairs shown in the detailed treatment of the earth element etcAs to variety and unity there is variety in the specific characteristics etc of all the elementsfor the characteristic function and manifestation of the earth element is oneand those of the water element etc are differentBut there is unity in them as materiality great primary element state  imperma nence etc notwithstanding the fact that they are various according to specific characteristic etc and according to origination by kamma and so onBy reason of great manifestation and so on means that these elements are called great primaries for the following reasons namely manifestation of greatness likeness to great creatures great maintenance great alteration and because they are great and because they are entitiesThey are great primaries by reason of great manifestation and so onAll these elements are instances of materiality because they do not exceed the characteristic of being molested Herein manifestation of greatness they are manifested as great both in a continuity that is not clung to and in a continuity that is clung toFor their manifestation of greatness in a continuity that is not clung to is givenTwo times a hundred thousand leagues And then four nahutas as wellThis earth this bearer of all wealth Has that much thickness as they tell in the description of the recollection of the Buddha in the way beginning And they are manifested on a great scale also in a continuity that is clung to for instance in the bodies of fishes turtles deities Dānava demons and so onFor this is said Bhikkhus there are individual creatures of a hundred leagues in the great ocean  and so on Likeness to great creatures just as a magician turns water that is not crystal into crystal and turns a clod that is not gold into gold and shows themand being himself neither a spirit nor a bird shows himself as a spirit or a bird so too being themselves not blueblack they turn themselves into blueblack derived materiality being themselves not yellow  not red  not white they turn themselves into white derived materiality and show that In this way they are great primaries in being like the great creatures of a magicianAnd just as whomsoever the great creatures such as the spirits grasp hold of  they have no standing place either inside him or outside him and yet they have no standing independently of him so too these elements are not found to stand either inside or outside each other yet they have no standing independently of one another Thus they are also great primaries in being equal to the great creatures such as the spirits because they have no thinkable standing place relative to each otherAnd just as the great creatures known as female spirits conceal their own fearfulness with a pleasing colour shape and gesture to deceive beings so too these elements conceal each their own characteristic and function classed as hardness etc by means of a pleasing skin colour of womens and mens bodies etc and pleasing shapes of limbs and pleasing gestures of fingers toes and eyebrows and they deceive simple people by concealing their own functions and characteristics beginning with hardness and do not allow their individual essences to be seen Thus they are great primaries in being equal to the great creatures  the female spirits since they are deceiversOr alternatively they are great primaries since they are primaries whose maintenance is great Great maintenance this is because they have to be sustained by the great requisitesFor these elements are great primaries since they have become  have occurred by means of the food clothing etc which are great in importance because they have to be found every day Great alteration the unclungto and the clungto are the basis of great alterationsHerein the great alteration of the unclungto evidences itself in the emergence of an aeon and that of the clungto in the disturbance of the elements in the bodyFor accordinglyOut of the ground and races higher And higher right to the Brahmā heavenThe conflagrations flame bursts up When the world is burnt up by fireA whole world system measuring One hundred thousand millions wideSubsides as with its furious waters The flood dissolves the world besideOne hundred thousand million leagues A whole world systems broad extentIs rent and scattered when the world Succumbs to the air elementThe bite of woodenmouths can make The body stiff to all intentWhen roused is its earth element It might be gripped by such a snakeThe bite of rottenmouths can make The body rot to all intentWhen roused its water element It might be gripped by such a snakeThe bite of fierymouths can make The body burn to all intentWhen roused is its fire element It might be gripped by such a snakeThe bite of daggermouths can make The body burst to all intentWhen roused is its air element It might be gripped by such a snakeSo they are great primaries because they have become the basis of great alteration Because they are great and because they are entities great because they need great effort to discern them and entities because they are existent thus they are great primaries because they are great and because they are entities This is how all these elements are great primaries by reason of great manifestation and so onAgain they are elements because of bearing their own characteristics because of grasping suffering and because of sorting out suffering  and because none of them are exempt from the characteristic of being elementsThus there is unity of all since all are materiality great primaries elements states impermanent and so on This is how they should be given attention as to variety and unitythey are not self in the sense of having no core of permanence and so onthey are painful in the sense of causing terrorThey are impermanent in the sense of liability to destructionThey are states owing to bearing their own characteristics and owing to their so bearing for the length of the moment appropriate to themAs to resolution and nonresolution  they are positionally unresolvable since they always arise together in every single minimal material group consisting of the bare octad and the othersbut they are resolvable by characteristic This is how they should be given attention as to resolution and nonresolution As to the similar and dissimilar and although they are unresolved in this way yet the first two similar in heavinessand so are the last two in lightnessbut for this reason the first two are dissimilar to the last two and the last two to the first two This is how they should be given attention as to the similar and dissimilarAs to distinction between internal and external the internal elements are the material support for the physical bases of consciousness for the kinds of intimation and for the material faculties They are associated with postures and they are of fourfold originationThe external elements are of the opposite kind This is how they should be given attention as to distinction between internal and externalAs to inclusion kammaoriginated earth element is included together with the other kammaoriginated elements because there is no difference in their originationLikewise the consciousnessoriginated is included together with other consciousnessoriginated elements This is how they should be given attention as to inclusionThe air element which is founded on earth held together by water and maintained by fire is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their distension This is how they should be given attention as to conditionThe fire element which is founded on earth held together by water and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their maintainingThe water element which is founded on earth maintained by fire and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their cohesionAs to condition the earth element which is held together by water maintained by fire and distended by air is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their foundationAnd the other three do not know The earth element is a condition for us by acting as our foundationAnd similarly in each instance This is how they should be given attention as to lack of conscious reactionAs to lack of conscious reaction here too the earth element does not know I am the earth element or I am a condition by acting as a foundation for three great primaries And the other three do not know The earth element is a condition for us by acting as a foundation for three great primariesAs to analysis of conditions there are four conditions for the elements that is to say kamma consciousness nutriment and temperatureTemperature is the productive condition for the temperatureoriginated elements for the rest it is the presence condition and nondisappearance conditionNutriment is the producing condition for the nutrimentoriginated elements for the rest it is the nutriment condition presence condition and nondisappearance conditionConsciousness is the producing condition for the consciousnessoriginated elements for the rest it is the postnascence condition presence condition and nondisappearance conditionKamma is the producing condition for the kammaoriginated elements for the rest it is indirectly the decisivesupportive conditionConsciousness etc only are the conditions for the consciousnessoriginated elements the others are notHerein kamma only is the condition for the kammaoriginated elements consciousness  etc ie nutriment and temperature are notHerein the kammaoriginated great primary is the condition for the kamma originated great primaries and also for the consciousnessoriginated great primariesThe temperatureoriginated great primary is the condition for the temperatureoriginated great primaries and also for the kammaoriginated great primaries and so on Likewise are the consciousnessoriginated great primary and the nutriment originated great primaryHerein the kammaoriginated earth element is a condition for the other kammaoriginated elements both as conascence mutuality support presence and nondisappearance conditions and as foundation but not as producing conditionAnd for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and nondisappearance conditions too but not as cohesion or producing conditionAnd the fire element here is a condition for the other three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as maintaining but not as producing conditionIt is a condition for the other three great primaries in a triple continuity as support presence and nondisappearance conditions but not as foundation or producing conditionAnd here the water element is a condition for the remaining three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as cohesion but not as producing conditionAnd for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and nondisappearance conditions too but not as maintaining or producing conditionAnd the air element here is a condition for the other three elements both as conascence etc conditions and as distension but not as producing conditionAnd for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support presence and non disappearance conditions too but not as distension or producing conditionThe same method applies in the case of the consciousnessoriginated the nutrimentoriginated and the temperatureoriginated earth element and the restAnd when these elements have been made to occur through the influence of the conascence etc conditionsWith three in four ways to one due And likewise with one due to threeWith two in six ways due to two Thus their occurrence comes to beBut with the last two dependent on the first two with the first two dependent on the last two with the second and fourth dependent on the first and third with the first and third dependent on the second and fourth with the second and third dependent on the first and fourth and with the first and fourth dependent on the second and third they occur in six ways with two elements due to twoLikewise each one beginning with earth occurs in dependence on the other three thus with one due to three their occurrence takes place in four waysTaking each one beginning with earth there are three others whose occurrence is due to that one thus with three due to one their occurrence takes place in four waysAt the time of moving forward and moving backward  the earth element among these is a condition for pressingThat seconded by the water element is a condition for establishing on a foundationBut the water element seconded by the earth element is a condition for lowering downThe fire element seconded by the air element is a condition for lifting upThe air element seconded by the fire element is a condition for shifting forwards and shifting sideways  This is how they should be given attention as to analysis of conditionsAs he gives his attention to them as to word meaning etc in this way the elements become evident to him under each headingAs he again and again adverts and gives attention to them access concentration arises in the way already describedAnd this concentration too is called definition of the four elements because it arises in one who defines the four elements owing to the influence of his knowledgeSince he does not entertain false notions about wild beasts spirits ogres etc because he has abolished the perception of living beings he conquers fear and dread and conquers delight and aversion  he is not exhilarated or depressed by agreeable and disagreeable thingsThis bhikkhu who is devoted to the defining of the four elements immerses himself in voidness and eliminates the perception of living beingsand as one of great understanding he either ends in the deathless or he is bound for a happy destinyThe noble meditator lion Will make this mighty theme his sportDefining the four elements Is ever the wise mans resortThis is the description of the development of the defining of the four elementsThis completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause How should it be developed in the set of questions beginning with What is concentration which was formulated in order to show the method of development of concentration in detail And so it is developed in two forms with the development of these meditation subjectsThe unification of mind in the case of the remaining meditation subjects is absorption concentrationHence it was said above This completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause How should it be developedHerein the unification of mind in the case of ten meditation subjects and in the consciousness preceding absorption in the case of the remaining meditation subjects is access concentrationThis concentration as intended here is twofold that is to say access concentration and absorption concentrationBecause of bearing their own characteristics these are not like the Primordial Essence and the self imagined by the theorists which are nonexistent as to individual essenceOn the contrary these do bear their own characteristics which is why they are elementsFrom resolution of these eight the eight dhammas beginning with colour when resolved by means of understanding are apprehendable in the ultimate sense through mutual negation  but head hairs are not apprehendable in the ultimate sense through negation of colour and so onConsequently the term of common usage head hairs is applied to these dhammas in their coarisen state but if they are each taken separately There is no commonusage head hairs The meaning is that it is a mere conventional termOnly a mere group of eight states is said taking the colour etc which are real  as a unity by means of the concept a head hair not only because they are merely the eight statesTherefore  a paramaṇu as a particle of space is not the province of the physical eye it is the province of the divine eyeHeld by conjoining through cohesion and prevented from being scatteredKept guarded so that it may not lapse into a wet and slippery state through the water element which has trickling as its essenceThis is said with reference to the water element as a juice that helps growthIt blows  it is stirred the meaning is that the conglomeration of elements is made to move by its action as cause for successive arising at adjacent locations Conveying is acting as cause for the successive arising at adjacent locations of the conglomeration of elements Propelling is the act of causing the successive arising at adjacent locations of material groups A great primary is a great wonder because it shows various unreal things  various wonders  and various marvels  Or alternatively there are great wonders here thus there are magiciansAnd spirits etc are huge creatures owing to being born from them thus they are great primaries Or alternatively this term great primary can be regarded as a generic term for all of themBut earth etc are great primaries because they deceive and because like the huge creatures their standing place cannot be pointed toSo although their standing place is undemonstrable still each one assists the other by its particular functionthe functions of establishing etc whereby each becomes a condition for the others as conascence condition and so onAnd if they were found outside each other they would be already resolved  and that being so any description of them as unresolved would be meaninglessFor if these elements were found inside each other they would not each perform their particular functions owing to mutual frustrationLikewise their undemonstrability since they are not found inside or outside each other though they rely upon each other for supportThe deception lies in causing the apparent individual essences of blueblack etc and it lies in causing the appearance of what has the aspect of woman and man and so onThe term producing condition refers to causing origination though as a condition it is actually kamma conditionFor this is said Profitable and unprofitable volition is a condition as kamma condition for resultant aggregates and for materiality due to kamma performed For the rest for consciousnessoriginated and so onHowever because of the words With a person as decisive support and With a grove as decisive support in the Suttas the decisivesupport condition can be indirectly understood according to the Suttas in the sense of absence withoutIt is the indirectly decisive support condition because in the Paṭṭhāna the decisivesupport condition has only been given for immaterial dhammas so there is directly no decisivesupport condition in kamma for material dhammas it is given in detail for one of not over quick understanding whose meditation subject is elementsand as here so also in the Rāhulovāda and Dhātuvibhaṅga SuttasThe question what are the benefits of the development of concentration was also asked however  Herein the benefits of the development of concentration are fivefold as a blissful abiding here and now and so onFor the development of absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding here and now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop concentration thinking We shall attain and dwell with unified mind for a whole dayWhen ordinary people and trainers develop it thinking After emerging we shall exercise insight with concentrated consciousness the development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefit of insight by serving as the proximate cause for insight and so too does access concentration as a method of arriving at wide open conditions in crowded circumstancesBut when they have already produced the eight attainments and then aspiring to the kinds of directknowledge described in the way beginning Having been one he becomes many  they produce them by entering upon jhāna as the basis for directknowledge and emerging from it then the development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of the kinds of directknowledge since it becomes the proximate cause for the kinds of directknowledge whenever there is an occasionHence the Blessed One said He attains the ability to be a witness through realization by directknowledge of any state realizable by directknowledge to which his mind inclines whenever there is an occasion When ordinary people have not lost their jhāna and they aspire to rebirth in the Brahmāworld thus Let us be reborn in the Brahmāworld or even though they do not make the actual aspiration then the development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefits of an improved form of existence since it ensures that for themHence the Blessed One said Where do they reappear after developing the first jhāna limitedlyThey reappear in the company of the deities of Brahmās Retinue  and so onAnd even the development of access concentration ensures an improved form of existence in the happy destinies of the sensual sphereBut when Noble Ones who have already produced the eight attainments develop concentration thinking We shall enter upon the attainment of cessation and by being without consciousness for seven days we shall abide in bliss here and now by reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna then the development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of cessationHence it is said Understanding as mastery owing to  sixteen kinds of behaviour of knowledge and to nine kinds of behaviour of concentration is knowledge of the attainment of cessation That is how this benefit of the development of concentration is fivefold as a blissful abiding here and now and so onIt cleans defiling stains pollution And brings rewards past calculationSo wise men fail not in devotion To the pursuit of concentrationAnd at this point in the Path of Purification which is taught under the headings of virtue concentration and understanding in the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue  concentration has been fully explainedin the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good peopleHence the Blessed One said But Cunda it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones disciplineHence the Blessed One said Bhikkhus develop concentrationa bhikkhu who is concentrated understands correctly these are called blissful abidings in the Noble Ones discipline concluding The Description of ConcentrationThe eleventh chapterThe process of existence in the round of rebirths which is a very cramped place is crowded by the defilements of craving and so onPersons are of two kinds I say to be cultivated and not to be cultivated So it was said by the Blessed OneSariputta the detailed meaning of my utterance which I spoke in brief should be regarded thusSariputta the detailed meaning of my utterance which I spoke in brief should be regarded thusNow concentration was described under the heading of consciousness in the stanza When a wise man established well in virtue Develops consciousness and understanding  And that has been developed in all its aspects by the bhikkhu who is thus possessed of the more advanced development of concentration that has acquired with directknowledge the benefits described in Chs XII and XIIIBut understanding comes next and that has still to be developedNow that is not easy firstly even to know about let alone to develop when it is taught very brieflyIn order therefore to deal with the detailed method of its development there is the following set of questions What is understanding In what sense is it understanding What are its characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause How many kinds of understanding are there How is it developed What are the benefits of developing understandingHere are the answers WHAT IS UNDERSTANDING Understanding is of many sorts and has various aspectsAn answer that attempted to explain it all would accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose and would besides lead to distraction so we shall confine ourselves to the kind intended here which is understanding consisting in insight knowledge associated with profitable consciousness IN WHAT SENSE IS IT UNDERSTANDINGIt is understanding in the sense of act of understanding What is this act of understandingIt is knowing in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving and cognizing For though the state of knowing is equally present in perception  in consciousness  and in understanding  nevertheless perception is only the mere perceiving of an object as say blue or yellowConsciousness knows the objects as blue or yellow and it brings about the penetration of its characteristicsUnderstanding knows the object in the way already stated it brings about the penetration of the characteristics and it brings about by endeavouring the manifestation of the pathSuppose there were three people a child without discretion a villager and a moneychanger who saw a heap of coins lying on a moneychangers counter The child without discretion knows merely that the coins are figured and ornamented long square or round he does not know that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and enjoymentAnd the villager knows that they are figured and ornamented etc and that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and enjoymentThe moneychanger knows all those kinds and he does so by looking at the coin and by listening to the sound of it when struck and by smelling its smell tasting its taste and weighing it in his hand and he knows that it was made in a certain village or town or city or on a certain mountain or by a certain master And this may be understood as an illustrationPerception is like the child without discretion seeing the coin because it apprehends the mere mode of appearance of the object as blue and so onConsciousness is like the villager seeing the coin because it apprehends the mode of the object as blue etc and because it extends further reaching the penetration of its characteristicsUnderstanding is like the moneychanger seeing the coin because after apprehending the mode of the object as blue etc and extending to the penetration of the characteristics it extends still further reaching the manifestation of the pathThat is why knowing in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving and cognizingHowever it is not always to be found where perception and consciousness areBut when it is it is not disconnected from those states And because it cannot be taken as disconnected thus This is perception this is consciousness this is understanding its difference is consequently subtle and hard to seeHence the venerable Nāgasena said A difficult thing O King has been done by the Blessed OneThe difficult thing O King done by the Blessed One was the defining of the immaterial states of consciousness and its concomitants which occur with a single object and which he declared thus This is contact this is feeling this is perception this is volition this is consciousness  WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION MANIFESTATION AND PROXIMATE CAUSE Understanding has the characteristic of penetrating the individual essences of states Its function is to abolish the darkness of delusion which conceals the individual essences of states It is manifested as nondelusionBecause of the words One who is concentrated knows and sees correctly  its proximate cause is concentrationit cannot bring about the penetration of its characteristics as impermanent painful and notselfbut it cannot bring about by endeavouring the manifestation of the supramundane pathbut he does not know such distinctions as This one is genuine this is false this is halfvalueFor that is what the words it is understanding in the sense of act of understanding refer tothis act of understanding should be understood as What venerable Nāgasena is the difficult thing that has been done by the Blessed One HOW MANY KINDS OF UNDERSTANDING ARE THERE  Firstly as having the characteristic of penetrating the individual essences of states it is of one kindAs mundane and supramundane it is of two kindsLikewise as subject to cankers and free from cankers and so on  As the defining of mentality and of materiality  As accompanied by joy or by equanimity  As the planes of seeing and of developmentIt is of three kinds as consisting in what is reasoned consisting in what is learnt  and consisting in developmentLikewise as having a limited exalted or measureless object  As skill in improvement detriment and means  As interpreting the internal and so onIt is of four kinds as knowledge of the four truths  And as the four discriminations Herein the singlefold section is obvious in meaningAs regards the twofold section the mundane is that associated with the mundane pathSo it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane and the supramundane is that associated with the supramundane pathIn the second dyad that subject to cankers is that which is the object of cankersThat free from cankers is not their objectThis dyad is the same in meaning as the mundane and supramundanethe dyads subject to cankers associated with cankersSo it is of two kinds as subject to cankers and free from cankers and so onIn the third dyad when a man wants to begin insight his understanding of the defining of the four immaterial aggregates is understanding as defining of mentalityand his understanding of the defining of the material aggregate is understanding as defining of materiality So it is of two kinds as the defining of mentality and of materialityIn the fourth dyad understanding belonging to two of the kinds of sensesphere profitable consciousness and belonging to sixteen of the kinds of path consciousness with four of the jhānas in the fivefold method is accompanied by joyUnderstanding belonging to two of the kinds of sensesphere profitable consciousness and belonging to four kinds of path consciousness with the fifth jhānas is accompanied by equanimity So it is of two kinds as accompanied by joy or by equanimityIn the fifth dyad understanding belonging to the first path is the plane of seeingUnderstanding belonging to the remaining three paths is the plane of development  So it is of two kinds as the planes of seeing and of developmentAs regards the triads understanding acquired without hearing from another is that consisting in what is reasoned because it is produced by ones own reasoningUnderstanding acquired by hearing from another is that consisting in what is heard because it is produced by hearingUnderstanding that has reached absorption having been somehow produced by development is that consisting in developmentAnd this is saidIn the spheres of work invented by ingenuity or in the spheres of craft invented by ingenuity or in the sorts of science invented by ingenuity any preference view choice opinion judgment liking for pondering over things that concerns ownership of deeds or is in conformity with truth or is of such kind as to conform with Materiality is impermanent or Feeling  perception  formations  consciousness is impermanent that one acquires without hearing it from anotherthat is called understanding consisting in what is reasoned that one acquires by hearing it from anotherthat is called understanding consisting in what is learnt And all understanding in anyone who has attained is understanding consisting in development So it is of three kinds as consisting in what is thought out in what is heard and in developmentIn the second triad the understanding that occurs contingent upon sensesphere states has a limited objectThat which occurs contingent upon finematerialsphere states or immaterialsphere states has an exalted objectThat is mundane insightThat which occurs contingent upon Nibbāna has a measureless objectThat is supramundane insight So it is of three kinds as having a limited an exalted or a measureless objectIn the third triad it is increase that is called improvement That is twofold as the elimination of harm and the arousing of goodSkill in improvement is skill in theseaccording as it is saidWhen a man brings these things to mind both unarisen unprofitable things do not arise and arisen unprofitable things are abandoned in him or when he brings these things to mind both unarisen profitable things ariseand arisen profitable things advance to growth increase development and perfection in him Whatever here is understanding act of understanding for words elided see Dhs  nondelusion investigation of states right view is called skill in improvement Nonincrease is what is called detriment That also is twofold as the diminution of good and the arousing of harmSkill in detriment is skill in theseWhen a man brings these things to mind both unarisen profitable things do not arise   and so onBut in either of these cases any skill in means to cause the production of such and such things which skill occurs at that moment and is aroused on that occasion is what is called skill in meansSo it is of three kinds as skill in improvement in detriment and in meansIn the fourth triad insightunderstanding initiated by apprehending ones own aggregates is interpreting the internalThat initiated by apprehending both is interpreting the internal and external So it is of three kinds as interpreting the internal and so onAs regards the tetrads in the first tetrad knowledge that occurs contingent upon the truth of suffering is knowledge of sufferingand knowledge that occurs contingent upon the way leading to the cessation of suffering is knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering So it is of four kinds as knowledge of the four truthsIn the second tetrad the four kinds of knowledge classed as that concerned with meaning etc are called the four discriminationsFor this is said Knowledge about meaning is the discrimination of meaning Knowledge about law is the discrimination of law Knowledge about enunciation of language dealing with meaning and law is the discrimination of language Knowledge about kinds of knowledge is discrimination of perspicuity  Herein meaning is briefly a term for the fruit of a cause For in accordance with the cause it is served arrived at reached therefore it is called meaning But in particular the five things namely anything conditionally produced Nibbāna the meaning of what is spoken  result and functional  should be understood as meaningWhen anyone reviews that meaning any knowledge of his falling within the category concerned with meaning is the discrimination of meaningLaw is briefly a term for a condition For since a condition necessitates whatever it may be makes it occur or allows it to happen it is therefore called law But in particular the five things namely any cause that produces fruit the noble path what is spoken what is profitable and what is unprofitable should be understood as lawWhen anyone reviews that law any knowledge of his falling within the category concerned with law is the discrimination of lawThis same meaning is shown in the Abhidhamma  Knowledge about suffering is the discrimination of meaningKnowledge about the origin of suffering is the discrimination of law Knowledge about the cessation of suffering is the discrimination of meaning Knowledge about the way leading to the cessation of suffering is the discrimination of law  Knowledge about cause is the discrimination of lawKnowledge about the fruit of a cause is the discrimination of meaning  whatever things are born become brought to birth produced completed made manifestKnowledge about the things from which those things were born became were brought to birth produced completed made manifest is the discrimination of law  Knowledge about ageing and death is the discrimination of meaningKnowledge about the origin of ageing and death is the discrimination of law Knowledge about the cessation of ageing and death is the discrimination of meaning Knowledge about the way leading to the cessation of ageing and death is the discrimination of law Knowledge about birth  becoming  clinging  craving  feeling  contact  the sixfold base  mentality materiality  consciousness  knowledge about formations is the discrimination of meaning Knowledge about the origin of formations is the discrimination of law Knowledge about the cessation of formations is the discrimination of meaningKnowledge about the way leading to the cessation of formations is the discrimination of law  Here a bhikkhu knows the Dhamma the Discourses Songs Expositions Stanzas Exclamations Sayings Birth Stories Marvels and Answers to QuestionsHe knows the meaning of whatever is said thus This is the meaning of this that was said this is the meaning of this that was said What states are profitableOn an occasion when profitable consciousness of the sense sphere has arisen that is accompanied by joy and associated with knowledge having a visible datum as its object  or a mental datum as its object or contingent upon whatever it may be on that occasion there is contact   there is nonwavering these things are profitableKnowledge about these things is the discrimination of lawKnowledge about their result is the discrimination of meaning   by the following analysis Knowledge about enunciation of language dealing with meaning and law  there is the language that is individual essence the usage that has no exceptions and deals with that meaning and that lawAny knowledge falling within the category concerned with the enunciation of that with the speaking with the utterance of that concerned with the rootspeech of all beings the Magadhan language that is individual essence in other words the language of law  any knowledge that as soon as it hears it spoken pronounced uttered knows This is the individualessence language this is not the individual essence languagesuch knowledge is discrimination of languageOne who has reached the discrimination of language knows on hearing the words phasso vedanā etc that that is the individualessence languageKnowledge about kinds of knowledge  when a man is reviewing and makes any of the foregoing kinds of knowledge the object of his knowledge then any knowledge in him that has knowledge as its object is discrimination of perspicuity and so is any knowledge about these aforesaid kinds of knowledge which is concerned with details of their individual domains functions and so onAnd these four kinds of discrimination can be placed in two categories the plane of the trainer and the plane of the nontrainerHerein those of the chief disciples and great disciples come into the category of the nontrainers planeThose of the Elder nanda the householder Citta the layman Dhammika the householder Upāli the laywoman Khujjuttarā etc come into the category of the trainers planeAnd though they come into the categories of the two planes thus they are nevertheless distinguishable in five aspects that is to say as achievement mastery of scriptures hearing questioning and prior effortHerein achievement is the reaching of ArahantshipMastery of scriptures is mastery of the Buddhas wordHearing is learning the Dhamma carefully and attentivelyQuestioning is discussion of knotty passages and explanatory passages in the texts commentaries and so on Prior effort is devotion to insight in the dispensation of former Buddhas up to the vicinity of the stages of conformity and changeof lineage by one who has practiced the duty of going with the meditation subject on alms round and coming back with itOthers have saidA prior effort and great knowledge Knowledge of dialects of scripturesAnd questioning and then achievement And likewise waiting on a teacherSuccess in friendsthese are conditions Productive of discriminationsHerein prior effort is the same as that already statedGreat learning is skill in some science or sphere of craftDialects means skill in the hundredandone tonguesScriptures means mastery of the Buddhas word even if only of the Chapter of SimilesAchievement is streamentry  or ArahantshipWaiting on a teacher is living with very learned intelligent teachersSuccess in friends is acquisition of friends such as thatHerein Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas reach the discriminations through prior effort and through achievementDisciples do so through all these meansAnd there is no special way of developing a meditation subject in order to attain discriminationsBut in trainers the attaining of the discriminations comes about next upon the liberation consisting in trainers fruitionand in nontrainers it does so next upon the liberation consisting in nontrainers fruitionFor the discriminations come to success in Noble Ones only through the noble fruition as the ten powers do in Perfect Ones So these were the discriminations referred to when it was said above It is of four kinds  as the four discriminations and free from cankers and dissociated from cankers  and so on  The same method applies to Herein what is understanding consisting in what is reasonedHerein what is skill in improvementaccording as it is said Herein what is skill in detrimentaccording as it is said And all understanding of means thereto is skill in means That initiated by apprehending anothers aggregates or external materiality not bound up with the faculties that is inanimate matter is interpreting the externalknowledge that occurs contingent upon the origin of suffering is knowledge of the origin of sufferingknowledge that occurs contingent upon the cessation of suffering is knowledge of the cessation of sufferingKnowledge about is the discrimination of meaningthis is called the discrimination of law
