Only very few have ever attempted it and they have been exterminated the world knows them no moreThe only exception is Liu Bei who did not understand the conditions and vigorously contended against him with the result that he is now at Jiangxia in a very parlous stateTo submit is to secure the safety of wives and children to be rich and honoredBut the dignity of the country would be left to chance and fatehowever that is not worth consideration Lu Su interrupted angrily Would you make our lord crook the knee to such a rebel as Cao Cao Well replied Zhuge Liang there is another way and a cheaper there would be no need to lead the sheep and shoulder wine pots for presents nor any need to yield territory and surrender seals of officeIt would not even be necessary to cross the river yourselvesAll you would require is a simple messenger and a little boat to ferry a couple of people across the riverIf Cao Cao only got these two persons under his hand his hordes and legions would just drop their weapons furl their banners and silently vanish away What two persons could cause Cao Cao to go away as you say asked Zhou Yu Two persons who could be easily spared from this populous country They would not be missed any more than a leaf from a tree or a grain of millet from a granaryBut if Cao Cao could only get them would he not go away rejoicing But who are the two asked Zhou Yu againWhen I was living in the country they told me that Cao Cao was building a pavilion on the River Zhang it was to be named the Bronze Bird TowerIt is an exceedingly handsome building and he has sought throughout all the world for the most beautiful women to live in it For Cao Cao really is a sensualistNow there are two very famous beauties in Wu born of the Qiao family So beautiful are they that birds alight and fishes drown the moon hides her face and the flowers blush for shame at sight of them Cao Cao has declared with an oath that he only wants two things in this worldthe imperial throne in peace and the sight of those two women on the Bronze Bird Terraces Given these two he would go down to his grave without regretThis expedition of his his huge army that threatens this country has for its real aim these two womenWhy do you not buy these two from their father the State Patriarch Qiao for any sum however large and send them over the river The object of the army being attained it will simply be marched awayThis is the use that Fan Li of Yue made to the king of Wu of the famous beauty Xi Shi How do you know Cao Cao so greatly desires these two said Zhou YuBecause his son Cao Zhi who is an able writer at the command of his father wrote a poem An Ode to the Bronze Bird Terrace theme only allowing allusions to the family fitness for the throneHe has sworn to possess these two womenI think I can remember the poem if you wish to hear itI admire it greatly Try said Zhou Yu So Zhuge Liang recited the poem Let me follow in the footsteps of the enlightened ruler that I may rejoice And ascend the storied terrace that I may gladden my heart That I may see the wide extent of the palace That I may gaze upon the plans of the virtuous oneHe has established the exalted gates high as the hills He has built the lofty towers piercing the blue vault He has set up the beautiful building in the midst of the heavens Whence the eye can range over the cities of the westOn the banks of the rolling River Zhang he planned it Whence abundance of fruits could be looked for in his gardensThe two towers rise one on either flank This named Golden Phoenix that Jade DragonHe would have the two Qiaos these beautiful ladies of Wu That he might rejoice with them morning and eveningLook down there is the grand beauty of an imperial city And the rolling vapors lie floating beneathHe will rejoice in the multitude of scholars that assemble Answering to the felicitous dream of King WenLook up and there is the gorgeous harmony of springtime And the singing of many birds delighting the ear The lofty sky stands over allThe house desires success in its double undertaking That the humane influence may be poured out over all the world That the perfection of reverence may be offered to the RulerOnly the richly prosperous rule of Kings Wu and Huan Could compare with that of the sacred understanding That fortuneWhat beautyThe gracious kindness spreads afar The imperial family is supported Peace reigns over all the empire Bounded only by the universeBright as the glory of the sun and moon Ever honorable and ever enduring The Ruler shall live to the age of the eastern emperor The dragon banner shall wave to the farthest limitHis glorious chariot shall be guided with perfect wisdom His thoughts shall reform all the world Felicitous produce shall be abundant And the people shall rest firmMy desire is that these towers shall endure forever And that joy shall never cease through all the agesZhou Yu listened to the end but then suddenly jumped up in a tremendous rage Turning to the north and pointing with his finger he cried You old rebel this insult is too deep Zhuge Liang hastily rose too and soothed him saying But remember the Khan of the Xiongnu PeopleThe Han emperor gave him a princess of the family to wife although he had made many incursions into our territory That was the price of peace You surely would not grudge two more women from among the common people You do not know Sir replied Zhou YuOf those two women of the Qiao family you mentioned Elder Qiao is the widow of Sun Ce our late ruler and Younger Qiao is my wife Zhuge Liang feigned the greatest astonishment and said No indeed I did not knowI blundered a deadly fault a deadly fault One of us two has to go either the old rebel or I we shall not both live I swear that cried Zhou YuHowever such a matter needs a good deal of thought replied Zhuge LiangWe must not make any mistake Zhou Yu replied I hold a sacred trust from my late lord Sun Ce I would not bow the knee to any such as Cao CaoWhat I said just now was to see how you stoodI left Poyang Lake with the intention of attacking the north and nothing can change that intention not even the sword at my breast or the ax on my neckBut I trust you will lend an arm and we will smite Cao Cao together Should I be happy enough not to be rejected I would render such humble service as I couldPerhaps presently I might be able to offer a plan to oppose him I am going to see my lord tomorrow to discuss this matter said Zhou YuZhuge Liang and Lu Su then leftNext day at dawn Sun Quan went to the council chamber where his officials civil and military were already assembledThey numbered about sixty in all The civil with Zhang Zhao at their head were on the right the military with Cheng Pu as their leader were ranged on the left All were in full ceremonial dress and the swords of the soldiers clanked on the pavementSoon Zhou Yu entered and when Sun Quan had finished the usual gracious remarks Zhou Yu said I hear that Cao Cao is encamped on the river and has sent a dispatch to you my lord I would ask what your opinion is Thereupon the dispatch was produced and handed to Zhou YuAfter reading it through he said smiling The old thief thinks there are no people in this land that he writes in this contemptuous strain What do you think Sir asked Sun QuanHave you discussed this with the officials asked Zhou YuWe have been discussing this for days Some counsel surrender and some advise fightI am undecided and therefore I have asked you to come and decide the point Who advise surrender asked Zhou YuZhang Zhao and his party are firmly set in this opinion Zhou Yu then turned to Zhang Zhao and said I should be pleased to hear why you are for surrender Master Then Zhang Zhao replied Cao Cao has been attacking all opponents in the name of the Emperor who is entirely in his hands He does everything in the name of the governmentLately he has taken Jingzhou and thereby increased his prestigeOur defense against him was the Great River but now he also has a large fleet and can attack by waterHow can we withstand himWherefore I counsel submission till some chance shall offer This is but the opinion of an illadvised student said Zhou YuHow can you think of abandoning this country that we have held for three generations That being so said Sun Quan where is a plan to come from Though Cao Cao assumes the name of the Prime Minister of the empire he is at heart a rebelYou O General are able in war and brave You are the heir to your father and brother You command brave and tried soldiers and you have plentiful supplies You are able to overrun the whole country and rid it of every evil There is no reason why you should surrender to a rebelMoreover Cao Cao has undertaken this expedition in defiance of all the rules of war The north is unsubdued Ma Teng and Han Sui threaten his rear and yet he persists in his southern march This is the first point against Cao CaoThe northern soldiers are unused to fighting on the water Cao Cao is relinquishing his welltried cavalry and trusting to ships That is the second point against himAgain we are now in full winter and the weather is at its coldest so there is no food for the horses That is the third point againstSoldiers from the central state marching in a wet country among lakes and rivers will find themselves in an unaccustomed climate and suffer from malaria That is the fourth point againstNow when Cao Caos armies have all these points against them defeat is certain however numerous they may be and you can take Cao Cao captive just as soon as you wishGive me a few legions of veterans and I will go and destroy him Sun Quan started up from his place saying The rebellious old rascal has been wanting to overthrow the Hans and set up himself for yearsHe has rid himself of all those he feared save only myself and I swear that one of us two shall go now Both of us cannot liveWhat you say Noble Friend is just what I think and Heaven has certainly sent you to my assistance Thy servant will fight a decisive battle said Zhou Yu and shrink not from any sacrificeOnly General do not hesitate Sun Quan drew the sword that hung at his side and slashed off a corner of the table in front of him exclaiming Let any other person mention surrender and he shall be served as I have served this table Then he handed the sword to Zhou Yu at the same time giving him a commission as CommanderinChief and Supreme Admiral Cheng Pu being ViceAdmiral Lu Su was also nominated as Commanding AssistantIn conclusion Sun Quan said With this sword you will slay any officer who may disobey your commands Zhou Yu took the sword and turning to the assembly said You have heard our lords charge to me to lead you to destroy Cao Cao you will all assemble tomorrow at the riverside camp to receive my ordersShould any be late or fail then the full rigor of military lawthe seven prohibitions and the fiftyfour capital penaltiesthere provided will be enforced Zhou Yu took leave of Sun Quan and left the chamber the various officers also went their several waysWhen Zhou Yu reached his own place he sent for Zhuge Liang to consult over the business in hand He told Zhuge Liang of the decision that had been taken and asked for a plan of campaignBut your master has not yet made up his mind said Zhuge LiangTill he has no plan can be decided upon What do you mean In his heart Sun Quan is still fearful of Cao Caos numbers and frets over the inequality of the two armiesYou will have to explain away those numbers and bring him to a final decision before anything can be effected What you say is excellent said Zhou Yu and he went to the palace that night to see his masterSun Quan said You must have something of real importance to say if you come like this at night Zhou Yu said I am making my dispositions tomorrow you have quite made up your mind The fact is said Sun Quan I still feel nervous about the disparity of numbers Surely we are too fewThat is really all I feel doubtful about It is precisely because you have this one remaining doubt that I am comeAnd I will explain Cao Caos letter speaks of a million of marines and so you feel doubts and fears and do not wait to consider the real truth Let us examine the case thoroughlyWe find that he has of central regions soldiers say some one hundred fifty thousand troops and many of them are sickHe only got seventy or eighty thousand northern soldiers from Yuan Shao and many of those are of doubtful loyaltyNow these sick men and these men of doubtful loyalty seem a great many but they are not at all fearsomeI could smash them with fifty thousand soldiersYou my lord have no further anxiety Sun Quan patted his general on the back saying You have explained my difficulty and relieved my doubts Zhang Zhao is an old fool who constantly bars my expeditionsOnly you and Lu Su have any real understanding of my heartTomorrow you and Lu Su and Cheng Pu will start and I shall have a strong reserve ready with plentiful supplies to support youIf difficulties arise you can at once send for me and I will engage with my own army Zhou Yu left but in his innermost heart he said to himself If that Zhuge Liang can gauge my masters thoughts so very accurately he is too clever for me and will be a dangerHe will have to be put out of the way Zhou Yu sent a messenger over to Lu Su to talk over this last scheme When he had laid it bare Lu Su did not favor itNo no said Lu Su it is selfdestruction to make away with your ablest officer before Cao Cao shall have been destroyed But Zhuge Liang will certainly help Liu Bei to our disadvantage Try what his brother Zhuge Jin can do to persuade himIt would be an excellent thing to have these two in our service Yes indeed replied Zhou YuNext morning at dawn Zhou Yu went to his camp and took his seat in the council tentThe armed guards took up their stations right and left and the officers ranged themselves in lines to listen to the ordersNow Cheng Pu who was older than Zhou Yu but was made second in command was very angry at being passed over so he made a pretense of indisposition and stayed away from this assembly But he sent his eldest son Cheng Zi to represent himZhou Yu addressed the gathering saying The law knows no partiality and you will all have to attend to your several dutiesCao Cao is now more absolute than ever was Dong Zhuo and the Emperor is really a prisoner in Xuchang guarded by the most cruel soldiersWe have a command to destroy Cao Cao and with your willing help we shall advanceThe army must cause no hardship to the people anywhereRewards for good service and punishments for faults shall be given impartially Having delivered this charge Zhou Yu told off Han Dang and Huang Gai as Leaders of the Van and ordered the ships under his own command to get under way and go to the Three Gorges They would get orders by and bye Then he appointed four armies with two leaders over eachthe first body was under Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai the second Pan Zhang and Ling Tong the third Taishi Ci and Lu Meng the fourth Lu Xun and Dong XiLu Fan and Zhu Zhi were appointed inspectors to move from place to place and keep the various units up to their work and acting with due regard to the general planLand and marine forces were to move simultaneously The expedition would soon start Having received their orders each returned to his command and busied himself in preparationCheng Zi the son of Cheng Pu returned and told his father what arrangements had been made and Cheng Pu was amazed at Zhou Yus skillSaid he I have always despised Zhou Yu as a mere student who would never be a general but this shows that he has a leaders talentI must support him So Cheng Pu went over to the quarters of the CommanderinChief and confessed his faultHe was received kindly and all was overNext Zhou Yu sent for Zhuge Jin and said to him Evidently your brother is a genius a man born to be a kings counselor Why then does he serve Liu BeiNow that he is here I wish you to use every effort to persuade him to stay with us Thus our lord would gain able support and you two brothers would be together which would be pleasant for you both I wish you success Zhuge Jin replied I am ashamed of the little service I have rendered since I came here and I can do no other than obey your command to the best of my ability Thereupon he went away to his brother whom he found in the guesthouseThe younger brother received him and when he had reached the inner rooms Zhuge Liang bowed respectfully and weeping told his experiences since they parted and his sorrow at their separationThen Zhuge Jin weeping also said Brother do you remember the story of Bo Yi and Shu Qi the brothers who would not be separated Ah Zhou Yu has sent him to talk me over thought Zhuge LiangSo he replied They were two of the noble people of old days yes I know Those two although they perished of hunger near the Shouyang Hills yet never separatedYou and I born of the same mother and suckled at the same breast yet serve different masters and never meetAre you not ashamed when you think of such examples as Bo Yi and Shu Qi Zhuge Liang replied You are talking now of love but what I stand for is dutyWe are both men of Han and Liu Bei is of the familyIf you Brother could leave the South Land and join me in serving the rightful branch then on the one side we should be honored as Ministers of Han and on the other we should be together as people of the same flesh and blood should be Thus love and duty would both receive their proper meedWhat do you think of it my brother I came to persuade him and loIt is I who is being talked over thought Zhuge JinHe had no fitting reply to make so he rose and took his leaveReturning to Zhou Yu he related the story of the interviewWhat do you think asked Zhou YuGeneral Sun Quan has treated me with great kindness and I could not turn my back on him replied Zhuge JinSince you decide to remain loyal there is no need to say much I think I have a plan to win over your brother The wisest people see eye to eye For each but sees the right But should their several interests clash They all the fiercer fightThe means by which Zhou Yu tried to get the support of Zhuge Liang will be described in the next chapter CHAPTER In The Three Gorges Cao Cao Loses Soldiers In The Meeting Of Heroes Jiang Gan Is Lured Into A Ruse Zhou Yu was very annoyed by the words of Zhuge Jin and a fierce hatred for Zhuge Liang took root in his heartHe nourished a secret resolve to make away with Zhuge Liang He continued his preparations for war and when the troops were all mustered and ready he went in for a farewell interview with his lordYou go on first Noble Sir said Sun QuanI will then march to support you Zhou Yu took his leave and then with Cheng Pu and Lu Su marched out with the army He invited Zhuge Liang to accompany the expedition and when Zhuge Liang cheerfully accepted the four embarked in the same shipThey set sail and the flotilla made for XiakouAbout twenty miles from Three Gorges the fleet anchored near the shore and Zhou Yu built a stockade on the bank near the middle of their line with the Western Hills as a support Other camps were made near his Zhuge Liang however took up his quarters in a small shipWhen the camp dispositions were complete Zhou Yu sent to request Zhuge Liang to come and give him adviceZhuge Liang came and after the salutations were ended Zhou Yu said Cao Cao though he had fewer troops than Yuan Shao nevertheless overcame Yuan Shao because he followed the advice given by Xun You to destroy Yuan Shaos supplies at WuchaoNow Cao Cao has over eight hundred thousand troops while I have but fifty or sixty thousandIn order to defeat him his supplies must be destroyed firstI have found out that the main depot is at the Iron Pile MountainsAs you have lived hereabout you know the topography quite well and I wish to entrust the task of cutting off supplies to you and your colleagues Guan Yu Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun I will assist you with a thousand soldiers I wish you to start without delayIn this way we can best serve our masters Zhuge Liang saw through this at onceHe thought to himself This is a ruse in revenge for my not having been persuaded to enter the service of the South LandIf I refuse I shall be laughed at So I will do as he asks and trust to find some means of deliverance from the evil he intends Therefore Zhuge Liang accepted the task with alacrity much to the joy of Zhou YuAfter the leader of the expedition had taken his leave Lu Su went to Zhou Yu secretly and said Why have you set him this task Because I wish to compass his death without appearing ridiculous I hope to get him killed by the hand of Cao Cao and prevent his doing further mischief Lu Su left and went to see Zhuge Liang to find out if he suspected anythingLu Su found him looking quite unconcerned and getting the soldiers ready to marchUnable to let Zhuge Liang go without a warning however Lu Su put a tentative question Do you think this expedition will succeed Zhuge Liang laughingly replied I am an adept at all sorts of fighting with foot horse and chariots on land and marines on the water There is no doubt of my successI am not like you and your friend only capable in one direction What do you mean by our being capable only in one direction said Lu Su I have heard the street children in your country singingTo lay an ambush hold a pass Lu Su is the man to choose But when you on the water fight Zhou Yu is the man to useYou are only fit for ambushes and guarding passes on land just as Zhou Yu only understands fighting on the water Lu Su carried this story to Zhou Yu which only incensed him the more against Zhuge LiangHow dare he flout me saying I cannot fight a land battleI will not let him goI will go myself with ten thousand troops and cut off Cao Caos supplies Lu Su went back and told this to Zhuge Liang who smiled and said Zhou Yu only wanted me to go on this expedition because he wanted Cao Cao to kill meAnd so I teased him a little But he cannot bear that Now is the critical moment and Marquis Sun Quan and my master must act in harmony if we are to succeedIf each one tries to harm the other the whole scheme will failCao Cao is no fool and it is he who usually attack enemies through cutting off their supplies Do you not think Cao Cao has already taken double precautions against any surprise of his own depotIf Zhou Yu tries he will be taken prisonerWhat he ought to do is to bring about a decisive naval battle whereby to dishearten the northern soldiers and then find some other means to defeat them utterlyIf you could persuade him what his best course was it would be well Without loss of time Lu Su went to Zhou Yu to relate what Zhuge Liang had told himZhou Yu shook his head when he heard it and beat the ground with his foot saying This man is far too clever he beats me ten to oneHe will have to be done away with or my country will suffer Said Lu Su This is the moment to use people you must think of the countrys good first of allWhen once Cao Cao is defeated you may do as you please Zhou Yu had to confess the reasonableness of thisLiu Bei had ordered his nephew Liu Qi to hold Jiangxia while he and the bulk of the army returned to XiakouThence he saw the opposite bank thick with banners and flags and glittering with every kind of arms and armor He knew then that the expedition from the South Land had started So he moved all his force from Jiangxia to FankouThen he assembled his officers and said to them Zhuge Liang went to Wu some time ago and no word has come from him so I know not how the business standsWill any one volunteer to go to find out I will go said Mi ZhuSo presents were prepared and gifts of flesh and wine and Mi Zhu prepared to journey to the South Land on the pretext of offering a congratulatory feast to the armyHe set out in a small ship and went down riverHe stopped opposite the camp and the soldiers reported his arrival to Zhou Yu who ordered him to be brought inMi Zhu bowed low and expressed the respect which Liu Bei had for Zhou Yu and offered the various giftsThe ceremony of reception was followed by a banquet in honor of the guestMi Zhu said Zhuge Liang has been here a long time and I desire that he may return with me Zhuge Liang is making plans with me and I could not let him return said Zhou YuI also wish to see Liu Bei that we may make joint plans but when one is at the head of a great army one cannot get away even for a momentIf your master would only come here it would be very gracious on his part Mi Zhu agreed that Liu Bei might come and presently took his leaveThen Lu Su asked Zhou Yu What is your reason for desiring Liu Bei to come Liu Bei is the one bold and dangerous man and must be removedI am taking this opportunity to persuade him to come and when he shall be slain a great danger will cease to threaten our country Lu Su tried to dissuade him from this scheme but Zhou Yu was deaf to all Lu Su said Zhou Yu even issued ordersArrange half a hundred executioners to be ready to hide within the lining of the tent if Liu Bei decides to come and when I drop a cup that will be a signal for them to fall on and slay him Mi Zhu returned and told Liu Bei that his presence was desired by Zhou Yu Suspecting nothing Liu Bei at once ordered them to prepare a fast vessel to take him without loss of timeGuan Yu was opposed to his going saying Zhou Yu is artful and treacherous and there is no news from Zhuge Liang Pray think more carefully Liu Bei replied I have joined my forces to theirs in this attack on our common enemyIf Zhou Yu wishes to see me and I refuse to go it is a betrayalNothing will succeed if both sides nourish suspicions If you have finally decided to go then will I go with you said Guan YuAnd I also cried Zhang FeiBut Liu Bei said Let Guan Yu come with me while you and Zhao Yun keep guardJian Yong will hold ExianI shall not be away long So leaving these orders Liu Bei embarked with Guan Yu on a small boat The escort did not exceed twenty The light craft traveled very quickly down the riverLiu Bei rejoiced greatly at the sight of the war vessels in tiers by the bank the soldiers in their breastplates and all the pomp and panoply of war All was in excellent order As soon as he arrived the guards ran to tell Zhou YuHow many ships has he asked Zhou YuThey replied Only one and the escort is only about a score His fate is sealed said Zhou YuZhou Yu sent for the executioners and placed them in hiding between the outer and inner tents and when all was arranged for the assassination he contemplated he went out to receive his visitor Liu Bei came with his brother and escort into the midst of the army to the Commanders tentAfter the salutations Zhou Yu wished Liu Bei to take the upper seat but he declined saying General you are famous through all the empire while I am a nobody Do not overwhelm me with too great deference So they took the positions of simple friends and refreshments were brought inNow by chance Zhuge Liang came on shore and heard that his master had arrived and was with the CommanderinChief The news gave Zhuge Liang a great shock and he said to himself What is to be done now He made his way to the reception tent and stole a look thereinHe saw murder written on Zhou Yus countenance and noted the assassins hidden within the walls of the tentThen he got a look at Liu Bei who was laughing and talking quite unconcernedlyBut when he noticed the redoubtable figure of Guan Yu near his masters side he became quite calm and contentedMy lord faces no danger said Zhuge Liang and he went away to the river bank to await the end of the interviewMeanwhile the banquet of welcome proceeded After the wine had gone around several times Zhou Yu picked up a cup to give the signal agreed upon But at that moment Zhou Yu saw so fierce a look upon the face of the trusty henchman who stood sword in hand behind his guest that Zhou Yu hesitated and hastily asked who he wasThat is my brother Guan Yu replied Liu BeiZhou Yu quite startled said Is he the slayer of Yan Liang and Wen Chou Exactly he it is replied Liu BeiThe sweat of fear broke out all over Zhou Yus body and trickled down his back Then nearly spilling it he poured out a cup of wine and presented it to Guan YuJust then Lu Su came in and Liu Bei said to him Where is Zhuge LiangI would trouble you to ask him to come Wait till we have defeated Cao Cao said Zhou Yu then you shall see him Liu Bei dared not repeat his request but Guan Yu gave him a meaningful look which Liu Bei understood and rose saying I would take leave now I will come again to congratulate you when the enemy has been defeated and your success shall be complete Zhou Yu did not press him to remain but escorted him to the great gates of the camp and Liu Bei leftWhen he reached the river bank they found Zhuge Liang awaiting them in their boatLiu Bei was exceedingly pleased but Zhuge Liang said Sir do you know in how great danger you were today Suddenly sobered Liu Bei said No I did not think of danger If Guan Yu had not been there you would have been killed said Zhuge Liang Liu Bei after a moments reflection saw that it was trueHe begged Zhuge Liang to return with him to Fankou but Zhuge Liang refused I am quite safe said Zhuge LiangAlthough I am living in the tigers mouth I am as steady as the Taishan MountainsNow my lord return and prepare your ships and soldiersOn the twentieth day of the eleventh month send Zhao Yun with a small ship to the south bank to wait for me Be sure there is no miscarriage What are your intentions said Liu BeiWhen the southeast wind begins I shall return Liu Bei would have questioned him further but Zhuge Liang pressed him to go So the boat started up river again while Zhuge Liang returned to his temporary lodgingThe boat had not proceeded far when appeared a small fleet of fifty ships sweeping down with the current and in the prow of the leading vessel stood a tall figure armed with a spear Guan Yu was ready to fightBut when they were near they recognized that was Zhang Fei who had come down fearing lest his brother might be in some difficulty from which the strong arm of Guan Yu might even be insufficient to rescue himThe three brothers thus returned togetherAfter Zhou Yu having escorted Liu Bei to the gate of his camp had returned to his quarters Lu Su soon came to see him Then you had cajoled Liu Bei into coming why did you not carry out your plan asked Lu Su Because of that Guan Yu he is a very tiger and he never left his brother for a momentIf anything had been attempted he would certainly have had my life Lu Su knew that Zhou Yu spoke the truthThen suddenly they announced a messenger with a letter from Cao Cao Zhou Yu ordered them to bring him in and took the letterBut when he saw the superscription The First Minister of Han to CommanderinChief Zhou Yu he fell into a frenzy of rage tore the letter to fragments and threw them on the ground To death with this fellow cried heWhen two countries are at war their emissaries are not slain said Lu SuMessengers are slain to show ones dignity and independence replied Zhou YuThe unhappy bearer of the letter was decapitated and his head sent back to Cao Cao by the hands of his escort Zhou Yu then decided to moveThe van under Gan Ning was to advance supported by two wings led by Han Dang and Jiang QinZhou Yu would lead the center body in supportThe next morning the early meal was eaten in the fourth watch and the ships got under weigh in the fifth with a great beating of drums Cao Cao was greatly angered when he heard that his letter had been torn to fragments and he resolved to attack forthwithHis advance was led by the Supreme Admiral Cai Mao the ViceAdmiral Zhang Yun and others of the Jingzhou officers who had joined his sideCao Cao went as hastily as possible to the meeting of the three rivers and saw the ships of the South Land sailing upIn the bow of the foremost ship stood a fine figure of a warrior who cried I am Gan Ning I challenge any one to combat Cai Mao sent his young brother Cai Xun to accept the challenge but as Cai Xuns ship approached Gan Ning shot an arrow and Cai Xun fellGan Ning pressed forward his crossbowmen keeping up a heavy discharge which Cao Caos troops could not standThe wings of Han Dang from the left and Jiang Qin from the right also joined inCao Caos soldiers being mostly from the dry plains of the north did not know how to fight effectually on water and the southern ships had the battle all their own way The slaughter was very great However after a contest lasting till afternoon Zhou Yu thought it more prudent in view of the superior numbers of his enemy not to risk further the advantage he had gainedSo he beat the gongs as the signal to cease battle and recall the shipsCao Cao was worsted but his ships returned to the bank where a camp was made and order was restoredCao Cao sent for his defeated leaders and reproached them saying You did not do your bestYou let an inferior force overcome you Cai Mao defended himself saying The Jingzhou marines have not been exercised for a long time and the others have never been trained for naval warfare at allA naval camp must be instituted the northern soldiers trained and the Jingzhou force drilledWhen they have been made efficient they will win victories If you know what should be done why have you not done it said Cao Cao What is the use of telling me thisGet to work So Cai Mao and Zhang Yun organized a naval camp on the river bankThey established twentyfour Water Gates with the large ships outside as a sort of rampart and under their protection the smaller ships went to and fro freely At night when the lanterns and torches were lit the very sky was illuminated and the water shone red with the glareOn land the smoke of the camp fires could be traced for one hundred mile without a breakZhou Yu returned to camp and feasted his victorious fighting force A messenger bore the joyful tidings of victory to his master Sun QuanWhen night fell Zhou Yu went up to the summit of one of the hills and looked out over the long line of bright lights stretching toward the west showing the extent of the enemys camp He said nothing but a great fear came in upon himNext day Zhou Yu decided that he would go in person to find out the strength of the enemy So he bade them prepare a small squadron which he manned with strong hardy men armed with powerful bows and stiff crossbows He also placed musicians on each ship They set sail and started up the streamWhen they got opposite Cao Caos camp the heavy stones that served as anchors were dropped and the music was played while Zhou Yu scanned the enemys naval camp What he saw gave him no satisfaction for everything was most admirable He said How well and correctly built is that naval base Any one knows the names of those in command They are Cai Mao and Zhang Yun said his officersThey have lived in our country a long time said Zhou Yu and are thoroughly experienced in naval warfareI must find some means of removing them before I can effect anything Meanwhile on shore the sentinels had told Cao Cao that the enemy crafts were spying upon them and Cao Cao ordered out some ships to capture the spiesZhou Yu saw the commotion of the commanding flags on shore and hastily gave the order to unmoor and sail down stream The squadron at once got under way and scattered to and fro went the oars and each ship seemed to flyBefore Cao Caos ships could get out after them they were all far away Cao Caos ships took up the chase but soon saw pursuit was useless They returned and reported their failureAgain Cao Cao found fault with his officers and said The other day you lost a battle and the soldiers were greatly dispiritedNow the enemy have spied out our camp What can be done In eager response to his question one stepped out saying When I was a youth Zhou Yu and I were fellow students and pledged friendsMy threeinch tongue is still good and I will go over and persuade him to surrender Cao Cao rejoiced to find so speedy a solution looked at the speakerIt was Jiang Gan of Jiujiang one of the counseling staff in the campAre you a good friend of Zhou Yu said Cao CaoRest content O Prime Minister replied Jiang GanIf I only get on the other side of the river I shall succeed What preparations are necessary asked Cao CaoJust a youth as my servant and a couple of rowers nothing else Cao Cao offered him wine wished him success and sent him on his wayClad in a simple white robe and seated in his little craft the messenger reached Zhou Yus camp and bade the guards say that an old friend Jiang Gan wished to see himThe commander was in his tent at a council when the message came and he laughed as he said to those about him A persuader is coming Then he whispered certain instructions in the ear of each one of them and they went out to await his arrival Zhou Yu received his friend in full ceremonial garbA crowd of officers in rich silken robes were about himThe guest appeared his sole attendant a lad dressed in a simple blue gownJiang Gan bore himself proudly as he advanced and Zhou Yu made a low obeisance You have been well I hope since last we met said Jiang GanYou have wandered far and suffered much in this task of emissary in Cao Caos cause said Zhou YuI have not seen you for a very long time said the envoy much taken aback and I came to visit you for the sake of old timesWhy do you call me an emissary for the Cao Caos cause Though I am not so profound a musician as Shi Kuang of old yet I can comprehend the thought behind the music replied Zhou YuAs you choose to treat your old friend like this I think I will take my leave said Jiang GanZhou Yu laughed again and taking Jiang Gan by the arm said Well I feared you might be coming on his behalf to try to persuade meBut if this is not your intention you need not go away so hastily So they two entered the tent and when they had exchanged salutes and were seated as friends Zhou Yu bade them call his officers that he might introduce themThey soon appeared civil and military officials all dressed in their bestThe military officers were clad in glittering silver armor and the staff looked very imposing as they stood ranged in two lines The visitor was introduced to them allPresently a banquet was spread and while they feasted the musicians played songs of victory and the wine circulated merrilyUnder its mellowing influence Zhou Yus reserve seemed to thaw and he said Jiang Gan is an old fellow student of mine and we are pledged friends Though he has arrived here from the north he is no artful pleader so you need not be afraid of him Then Zhou Yu took off the commanding sword which he wore as CommanderinChief and handed it to Taishi Ci saying You take this and wear it for the day as master of the feastThis day we meet only as friends and speak only of friendship and if any one shall begin a discussion of the questions at issue between Cao Cao and our country just slay him Taishi Ci took the sword and seated himself in his placeJiang Gan was not a little overcome but he said no wordZhou Yu said Since I assumed command I have tasted no drop of wine but today as an old friend is present and there is no reason to fear him I am going to drink freely So saying he quaffed a huge goblet and laughed loudlyThe rhinoceros cups went swiftly round from guest to guest till all were half drunk Then Zhou Yu laying hold of the guests hand led him outside the tentThe guards who stood around all braced themselves up and seized their shinning weaponsDo you not think my soldiers a fine lot of fellows said Zhou YuStrong as bears and bold as tigers replied Jiang Gan Then Zhou Yu led him to the rear of the tent whence he saw the grain and forage piled up in mountainous heapsDo you not think I have a fairly good store of grain and forage Your troops are brave and your supplies ample the worlds rumor is not unfounded Zhou Yu pretended to be quite intoxicated and went on When you and I were students together we never looked forward to a day like this did we For a genius like you it is nothing extraordinary said the guest Zhou Yu again seized his hand and they sat downA man of the time I have found a proper lord to serve In his service we rely upon the right feeling between minister and prince outside and at home we are firm in the kindly feeling of relatives He listens to my words and follows my plans We share the same good or evil fortuneEven when the great old persuaders like Su Qin Zhang Yi Lu Jia and Li Yiji lived again even when their words poured forth like a rushing river their tongues were as a sharp sword it is impossible to move such as I am Zhou Yu burst into a loud laugh as he finished and Jiang Gans face had become claycoloredZhou Yu then led his guest back into the tent and again they fell to drinkingPresently Zhou Yu pointed to the others at table and said These are all the best and bravest of the land of the south one might call this the Meeting of Heroes They drank on till daylight failed and continued after lamps had been lit Zhou Yu even gave an exhibition of sword play and sang this songWhen a man is in the world O He ought to do his bestAnd when hes done his best O He ought to have his restAnd when I have my rest O Ill quaff my wine with zestAnd when Im drunk as drunk can be O Ill sing the madmans litanyA burst of applause greeted the song By this time it was getting late and the guest begged to be excusedThe wine is too much for me said Jiang GanHis host bade them clear the table and as all the others left Zhou Yu said It has been many a day since I shared a couch with my friend but we will do so tonight Putting on the appearance of irresponsible intoxication he led Jiang Gan into the tent and they went to bedZhou Yu simply fell all dressed as he was and lay there emitting uncouth grunts and groans so that to the guest sleep was impossible Jiang Gan lay and listened to the various camp noises without and his hosts thunderous snores withinAbout the second watch he rose and looked at his friend by the dim light of the small lampHe also saw on the table a heap of papers and coming out and looking at them furtively he saw they were letters Among them he saw one marked as coming from Cai Mao and Zhang Yun Cao Caos Supreme Admiral and ViceAdmiral He read it and this is what it saidWe surrendered to Cao Cao not for the sake of pay but under stress of circumstancesNow we have been able to hold these northern soldiers into this naval camp but as soon as occasion offers we mean to have the rebels head to offer as a sacrifice to your bannerFrom time to time there will be reports as occasions serve but you may trust usThis is our humble reply to your letter Those two were connected with the South Land in the beginning thought Jiang Gan so he secreted the letter in his dress and began to examine the othersBut at that moment Zhou Yu turned over and so Jiang Gan hastily blew out the light and went to his couchZhou Yu was muttering as he lay there as if dreaming saying Friend I am going to let you see Cao Caos head in a day or two Jiang Gan hastily made some reply to load on his host to say moreThen came Wait a few days you will see Cao Caos headThe old wretch Jiang Gan tried to question him as to what he meant but Zhou Yu was fast asleep and seemed to hear nothingJiang Gan lay there on his couch wide awake till the fourth watch was beatingThen some one came in saying General are you awake At that moment as if suddenly awakened from the deepest slumber Zhou Yu started up and said Who is this on the couch The voice replied Do you not remember GeneralYou asked your old friend to stay the night with you it is he of course I drank too much last night said Zhou Yu in a regretful tone and I forgot I seldom indulge to excess and am not used to it Perhaps I said many things I ought not The voice went on A man has arrived from the north Speak lower said Zhou Yu and turning toward the sleeper he called him by nameBut Jiang Gan affected to be sound asleep and made no signZhou Yu crept out of the tent while Jiang Gan listened with all his earsHe heard the man say Cai Mao and Zhang Yun the two commanders have come But listening as he did with straining ears he could not make out what followedSoon after Zhou Yu reentered and again called out his companions nameBut no reply came for Jiang Gan was pretending to be in the deepest slumber and to hear nothingThen Zhou Yu undressed and went to bedAs Jiang Gan lay awake he remembered that Zhou Yu was known to be meticulously careful in affairs and if in the morning Zhou Yu found that a letter had disappeared he would certainly slay the offenderSo Jiang Gan lay there till near daylight and then called out to his hostGetting no reply he rose dressed and stole out of the tent Then he called his servant and made for the camp gateWhither are you going Sir said the watchmen at the gateI fear I am in the way here replied Jiang Gan and so I have taken leave of the CommanderinChief for a time So do not stop me He found his way to the river bank and reembarkedThen with flying oars he hastened back to Cao Caos campWhen he arrived Cao Cao asked at once how he had sped and he had to acknowledge failureZhou Yu is very clever and perfectly highminded said Jiang GanNothing that I could say moved him in the least Your failure makes me look ridiculous said Cao CaoWell if I did not win over Zhou Yu I found out something for youSend away these people and I will tell you said Jiang GanThe servants were dismissed and then Jiang Gan produced the letter he had stolen from Zhou Yus tent He gave it to Cao Cao Cao Cao was very angry and sent for Cai Mao and Zhang Yun at onceAs soon as they appeared he said I want you two to attack Cai Mao replied But the soldiers are not yet sufficiently trained The soldiers will be well enough trained when you have sent my head to Zhou Yu eh Both commanders were dumbfounded having not the least idea what this meant They remained silent for they had nothing to sayCao Cao bade the executioners lead them away to instant death In a short time their heads were producedBy this time Cao Cao had thought over the matter and it dawned upon him that he had been tricked A poem saysNo one could stand against Cao Cao Of sin he had full share But Zhou Yu was more treacherous And caught him in a snare Two commanders to save their lives Betrayed a former lord Soon after as was very met Both fell beneath the swordThe death of these two naval commanders caused much consternation in the camp and all their colleagues asked the reason for their sudden execution Though Cao Cao knew they had been victimized he would not acknowledge itSo he said These two had been remiss and so had been put to death The others were aghast but nothing could be doneTwo other officers Mao Jie and Yu Jin were put in command of the naval camp Spies took the news to Zhou Yu who was delighted at the success of his ruseThose two Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were my only source of anxiety said heNow they are gone I am quite happy Lu Su said General if you can continue like this you need not fear Cao Cao I do not think any of them saw my game said Zhou Yu except Zhuge LiangHe beats me and I do not think this ruse was hidden from him You go and sound himSee if he knew Zhou Yus treacherous plot succeeded well Dissension sown his rivals fellDrunk with success was he but sought To know what cynic Zhuge Liang thought What passed between Lu Su and Zhuge Liang will next be related CHAPTER Using Strategy Zhuge Liang Borrows Arrows Joining A Ruse Huang Gai Accepts PunishmentLu Su departed on his mission and found Zhuge Liang seated in his little craftThere has been so much to do that I have not been able to come to listen to your instructions said Lu SuThat is truly so said Zhuge Liang and I have not yet congratulated the CommanderinChief What have you wished to congratulate him upon Why Sir the matter upon which he sent you to find out whether I knew about it or notIndeed I can congratulate him on that Lu Su turned pale and gasped saying But how did you know Master The ruse succeeded well thus played off on Jiang GanCao Cao has been taken in this once but he will soon rise to it Only he will not confess his mistakeHowever the two men are gone and your country is freed from a grave anxiety Do you not think that is a matter for congratulationI hear Mao Jie and Yu Jin are the new admirals and in their hands lie both good and evil for the fate of the northern fleet Lu Su was quite dumbfounded he stayed a little time longer passing the time in making empty remarks and then took his leaveAs he was going away Zhuge Liang cautioned him saying Do not let Zhou Yu know that I know his ruseIf you let him know he will seek some chance to do me harm Lu Su promised nevertheless he went straight to his chief and related the whole thing just as it happenedReally he must be got rid of said Zhou Yu I have quite decided to put the man out of the way If you slay him will not Cao Cao laugh at you Oh no I will find a legitimate way of getting rid of him so that he shall go to his death without resentment But how can you find a legitimate way of assassinating him Do not ask too much you will see presently Soon after all the officers were summoned to the main tent and Zhuge Liangs presence was desired He went contentedly enoughWhen all were seated Zhou Yu suddenly addressed Zhuge Liang saying I am going to fight a battle with the enemy soon on the waterwhat weapons are the best On a great river arrows are the best said Zhuge Liang Your opinion and mine agreeBut at the moment we are short of them I wish you would undertake to supply about a hundred thousand arrows for the naval fightAs it is for the public service you will not decline I hope Whatever task the CommanderinChief lays upon me I must certainly try to perform replied Zhuge LiangMay I inquire by what date you require the hundred thousand arrows Could you have them ready in ten days The enemy will be here very soon ten days will be too late said Zhuge LiangIn how many days do you estimate the arrows can be ready Let me have three days then you may send for your hundred thousand No joking remember said Zhou Yu There is no joking in war time Dare I joke with the CommanderinChiefGive me a formal military order and if I have not completed the task in three days I will take my punishment Zhou Yu secretly delighted sent for the secretaries and prepared the commission then and thereThen he drank to the success of the undertaking and said I shall have to congratulate you most heartily when this is accomplished This day is too late to count said Zhuge LiangOn the third from tomorrow morning send five hundred small boats to the river side to convey the arrows They drank a few more cups together and then Zhuge Liang took his leaveAfter he had gone Lu Su said Do you not think there is some deceit about this Clearly it is not IIt is he who has signed his own death warrant said Zhou Yu Without being pressed in the least he asked for a formal order in the face of the whole assemblyEven if he grew a pair of wings he could not escapeOnly I will just order the workers to delay him as much as they can and not supply him with materials so that he is sure to failAnd then when the certain penalty is incurred who can criticizeYou can go and inquire about it all and keep me informed So off went Lu Su to seek Zhuge Liang who at once reproached him with having blabbed about the former businessZhuge Liang said He wants to hurt me as you know and I did not think you could not keep my secretAnd now there is what you saw today and how do you think I can get a hundred thousand arrows made in three daysYou will simply have to rescue me You brought the misfortune on yourself and how can I rescue you said Lu SuI look to you for the loan of twenty vessels manned each by thirty people I want blue cotton screens and bundles of straw lashed to the sides of the boatsI have good use for themOn the third day I have undertaken to deliver the fixed number of arrowsBut on no account must you let Zhou Yu know or my scheme will be wrecked Lu Su consented and this time he kept his wordHe went to report to his chief as usual but he said nothing about the boats He only said Zhuge Liang is not using bamboo or feathers or glue or varnish but has some other way of getting arrows Let us await the three days limit said Zhou Yu puzzled though confidentOn his side Lu Su quietly prepared a score of light swift boats each with its crew and the blue screens and bundles of grass complete and when these were ready he placed them at Zhuge Liangs disposalZhuge Liang did nothing on the first day nor on the secondOn the third day at the middle of the fourth watch Zhuge Liang sent a private message asking Lu Su to come to his boatWhy have you sent for me Sir asked Lu SuI want you to go with me to get those arrows Whither are you going Do not ask you will see Then the twenty boats were fastened together by long ropes and moved over to the north bankThe night proved very foggy and the mist was very dense along the river so that one person could scarcely see anotherIn spite of the fog Zhuge Liang urged the boats forward as if into the vast fairy kingdomThere is a poem on these river fogs Mighty indeed is the Great RiverRising far in the west in the Omei and Min Mountains Plowing its way through Wu east flowing resistless Swelled by its nine tributary streams rolling down from the far north Aided and helped by a hundred rivulets swirling and foaming Ocean receives it at last welcoming joyful its watersTherein abide sea nymphs and water gods Enormous whales a thousand fathoms long Nineheaded monstrous beasts reptiles and octopi Demons and uncouth creatures wondrous strangeIn faith it is the home and safe retreat Of devils and sprites and wondrous growths And eke the battle ground of valiant humansAt times occur strange strife of elements When darkness strives on lights domains that encroach Whereat arises in the vaulted dome of blue White wreaths of fog that toward the center roll Then darkness falls too dense for any torch Illumine only clanging sounds can passThe fog at first appears a vaporous wreath Scarce visibleBut thickening fast it veils The southern hills the painted leopards homeAnd spreads afar until the northern sea Leviathans are amazed and lose their courseAnd denser yet it touches on the sky And spreads a heavy mantle over the earthThen wide as is the high pitched arch of heaven Therein appears no single rift of blueNow mighty whales lead up their spouses to sport Upon the waves the sinuous dragons dive Deep down and breathing swell the heaving sea The earth is moist as with the early rains And springs creative energy is chilledBoth far and wide and high the damp fog spreads Great cities on the eastern bank are hid Wide ports and mountains in the south are lost Whole fleets of battle ships a thousand keels Hide in the misty depths frail fishing boats High riding on a wave are seenand lostThe gloom increases and the domed sky Grows dark and darker as the suns light failsThe daylight dies dim twilights reign begins The ruddy hills dissolve and lose their hueThe skill of matchless King Yu would fail to sound The depth and height and Li Lous eye though keen Could never pierce this gloom Now is the time O sea and river gods to use your powersThe gliding fish and creeping water folk Are lost there is no track for bird or beastFair Penglai Isles are hidden from our sight The lofty gates of heaven have disappearedNature is blurred and indistinct as when A driving rain storm hurries over the earthAnd then perhaps within the heavy haze A noisome serpent vents his venom foul And plagues descend or impish demons work Their wicked willsIlls fall on humans but do not stay Heavens cleansing breath sweeps them sway But while they last the mean ones cry The nobler suffer silentlyThe greatest turmoil is a sign Of quick return to state benignThe little fleet reached Cao Caos naval camp about the fifth watch and Zhuge Liang gave orders to form line lying prows west and then to beat the drums and shout But what shall we do if they attack us exclaimed Lu SuZhuge Liang replied with a smile I think their fleet will not venture out in this fog go on with your wine and let us be happyWe will go back when the fog lifts As soon as the shouting from the river was heard by those in the camp the two admirals Mao Jie and Yu Jin ran off to report to Cao Cao who said Coming up in a fog like this means that they have prepared an ambush for us Do not go out but get all the force together and shoot at them He also sent orders to the ground camps to dispatch six thousand of archers and crossbowmen to aid the marinesThe naval forces were then lined up shooting on the bank to prevent a landingPresently the soldiers arrived and ten thousand and more soldiers were shooting down into the river where the arrows fell like rainBy and bye Zhuge Liang ordered the boats to turn round so that their prows pointed east and to go closer in so that many arrows might hit themZhuge Liang ordered the drums to be kept beating till the sun was high and the fog began to disperse when the boats got under way and sailed down streamThe whole twenty boats were bristling with arrows on both sidesAs they left Zhuge Liang asked all the crews to shout derisively We thank you Sir Prime Minister for the arrows They told Cao Cao but by the time he came the light boats helped by the swift current were seven miles long down the river and pursuit was impossibleCao Cao saw that he had been duped and was very sorry but there was no help for itOn the way down Zhuge Liang said to his companion Every boat must have five or six thousand arrows and so without the expenditure of an ounce of energy we must have more than ten myriad arrows which tomorrow can be shot back again at Cao Caos army to his great inconvenience You are really superhuman said Lu SuBut how did you know there would be a thick fog today One cannot be a leader without knowing the workings of heaven and the ways of earth One must understand the secret gates and the interdependence of the elements the mysteries of tactics and the value of forcesIt is but an ordinary talent I calculated three days ago that there would be a fog today and so I set the limit at three daysZhou Yu would give me ten days but neither artificers nor material so that he might find occasion to put me to death as I knew but my fate lies with the Supreme and how could Zhou Yu harm me Lu Su could not but agreeWhen the boats arrived five hundred soldiers were in readiness on the bank to carry away the arrowsZhuge Liang bade them go on board the boats collect them and bear them to the tent of the CommanderinChiefLu Su went to report that the arrows had been obtained and told Zhou Yu by what meansZhou Yu was amazed and sighed sadly saying He is better than I his methods are more than human Thick lies the fog on the river Nature is shrouded in white Distant and near are confounded Banks are no longer in sightFast fly the pattering arrows Stick in the boats of the fleet Now can full tale be delivered Zhuge Liang is victor completeWhen shortly after his return Zhuge Liang went to the tent of the CommanderinChief he was welcomed by Zhou Yu who came forward to greet him saying Your superhuman predictions compel ones esteem There is nothing remarkable in that trifling trick replied heZhou Yu led him within and wine was broughtThen Zhou Yu said My lord sent yesterday to urge me to advance but I have no master plan ready I wish you would assist me Master But where should I a man of poor everyday ability find such a plan as you desire I saw the enemys naval camp just lately and it looked very complete and well organized It is not an ordinary place to attackI have thought of a plan but I am not sure it will answerI should be happy if you would decide for me General replied Zhuge Liang do not say what your plan is but each of us will write in the palm of his hand and see whether our opinions agree So brush and ink were sent for and Zhou Yu first wrote on his own palm and then passed the pen to Zhuge Liang who also wroteThen getting close together on the same bench each showed his hand to the other and both burst out laughing for both had written the same word Fire Since we are of the same opinion said Zhou Yu there is no longer any doubt But our intentions must be kept secret Both of us are public servants and what would be the sense of telling our plansI do not think Cao Cao will be on his guard against this although he has had two experiencesYou may put your scheme into force They finished their wine and separatedNot an officer knew a word of the generals plansNow Cao Cao had expended a myriad arrows in vain and was much irritated in consequence He deeply desired revengeThen Xun You proposed a ruse saying The two strategists on the side of the enemy are Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang two men most difficult to get the better ofLet us send some one who shall pretend to surrender to them but really be a spy on our behalf and a helper in our schemes When we know what is doing we can plan to meet it I had thought of that myself replied Cao CaoWhom do you think the best person to send Cai Mao has been put to death but all his clan and family are in the army and his two younger brothers are junior generalsYou have them most securely in your power and may send them to surrenderThe ruler of the South Land will never suspect deceit there Cao Cao decided to act on this plan and in the evening summoned Cai Zhong and Cai He to his tent where he told them saying I want you two pretend to surrender to the South Land so that you can gather intelligence and sent it back When all done you will be richly rewardedBut do not betray me Our families are in Jingzhou and that place is yours replied they Should we dare betray You need have no doubts SirYou will soon see the heads of both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang at your feet Cao Cao gave them generous gifts and soon after the two men each with his five hundred soldiers set sail with a fair wind for the opposite bankNow as Zhou Yu was preparing for the attack the arrival of some northern ships was announced They bore the two younger brothers of Cai Mao who had come as desertersThey were led in and bowing before the general said weeping Our innocent brother has been put to death and we desire vengeanceSo we have come to offer allegiance to youWe pray you appoint us to the vanguard Zhou Yu appeared very pleased and made them presentsThen he ordered them to join Gan Ning in leading the vanThey thanked him and regarded their scheme as already a successBut Zhou Yu gave Gan Ning secret orders saying They have come without their families and so I know their desertion is only pretense They have been sent as spies and I am going to meet their ruse with one of my ownThey shall have some information to sendYou will treat them well but keep a careful guard over themOn the day our soldiers start the offense they shall be sacrificed to the flagBut be very careful that nothing goes wrong Gan Ning went away and Lu Su came to tell Zhou Yu saying Every one agrees in thinking the surrender of Cai Zhong and Cai He feigned and they should be rejected But they wish to revenge the death of their brother said the General Where is the pretenseIf you are so suspicious you will receive nobody at all Lu Su left much piqued and went to see Zhuge Liang to whom he told the storyZhuge Liang only smiledWhy do you smile said Lu Su I smile at your simplicity The General is playing a game Spies cannot easily come and go so these two have been sent to feign desertion that they may act as spies The General is meeting one ruse with another He wants them to give false informationDeceit is not to be despised in war and his scheme is the correct one to employ Then Lu Su understoodThat night as Zhou Yu was sitting in his tent Huang Gai came to see him privatelyZhou Yu said You have surely some wise plan to propose that you come at night like this Huang Gai replied The enemy are more numerous than we and it is wrong to delayWhy not burn them out Who suggested that to you I thought of it myself nobody suggested it replied Huang GaiI just wanted something like this and that is why I kept those two pretended deserters I want them to give some false newsThe pity is that I have no one to feign desertion to the other side and work my plan But I will carry out your plan said Huang Gai But if you cannot show some injury you will not be believed said Zhou YuThe Sun family have been very generous to me and I would not resent being crushed to death to repay them said Huang GaiThe General thanked him saying If you would not object to some bodily suffering then our country would indeed be happy Kill me I do not mind repeated Huang Gai as he took his leaveNext day the drums called all the officers together to the Generals tent and Zhuge Liang came with the othersZhou Yu said The enemys camps extend about one hundred miles so that the campaign will be a long oneEach leader is to prepare supplies for three months Scarcely had he spoken when Huang Gai started up crying Say not three months be ready for thirty months and even then it will not be endedIf you can destroy them this month then all is wellIf you cannot then it were better to take Zhang Zhaos advice throw down your weapons turn to the north and surrender Zhou Yus anger flared up and he flushed crying Our lords orders were to destroy Cao Cao and whoever mentioned the word surrender should be put to deathNow the very moment when the two armies are to engage you dare talk of surrender and damp the ardor of my army If I do not slay you how can I support the others He ordered the lictors to remove Huang Gai and execute him without delayHuang Gai then flamed up in turn saying This is the third generation since I went with General Sun Jian and we overran the southeast whence have you sprung up This made Zhou Yu perfectly furious and Huang Gai was ordered to instant deathBut Gan Ning interfered Said he He is a veteran officer of the South Land pray pardon him What are you prating about cried Zhou YuDare you come between me and my duty Turning to the lictors Zhou Yu ordered them to drive Gan Ning forth with blows The other officials fell on their knees entreating pity for Huang GaiHe is indeed most worthy of death but it would be a loss to the army we pray you forgive himRecord his fault for the moment and after the enemy shall have been defeated then put him to death But Zhou Yu was implacableThe officers pleaded with tearsAt length he seemed moved saying Had you not interceded he should certainly have suffered deathBut now I will mitigate the punishment to a beating He shall not die Zhou Yu turned to the lictors and bade them deal the culprit one hundred blowsAgain his colleagues prayed for remission but Zhou Yu angrily pushed over the table in front of him and roared to the officers to get out of the way and let the sentence be executedSo Huang Gai was stripped thrown to the ground and fifty blows were givenAt this point the officers again prayed that he be let offZhou Yu sprang from his chair and pointing his finger at Huang Gai said If you dare flout me again you shall have the other fifty If you are guilty of any disrespect you shall be punished for both faults With this he turned into the inner part of the tent growling as he went while the officers helped their beaten colleague to his feetHe was in a pitiable stateHis back was cut in many places and the blood was flowing in streams They led him to his own quarters and on the way he swooned several times His case seemed most pitiable Lu Su went to see the suffering officer and then called on Zhuge Liang in his boat Lu Su related the story of the beating and said Though the other officers have been cowed into silence I think thought you Sir might have intercededYou are a guest and not under Zhou Yus ordersWhy did you stand by with your hands up your sleeves and say never a word You insult me said Zhuge Liang smilingWhy do you say thatI have never insulted you never since the day we came here together Do you not know that terrible beating was but a ruseHow could I try to dissuade Zhou Yu Then Lu Su began to perceive and Zhuge Liang continued saying Cao Cao would not be taken in unless there was some real bodily sufferingZhou Yu is going to send Huang Gai over as a deserter and Zhou Yu will see to it that the two Cao Caos spies duly tell the tale But when you see the General you must not tell him that I saw through the ruseYou say that I am very angry like the others Lu Su went to see Zhou Yu and asked Why have you so cruelly beaten a proved and trusty officer Do the officers resent it asked Zhou YuThey are all upset about it And what does your friend think Zhuge Liang also resents it in his heart and thinks you have made a mistake Then I have deceived him for once said Zhou Yu gleefullyWhat mean you cried Lu SuThat beating that Huang Gai got is part of my ruse I am sending him to Cao Cao as a deserter and so I have supplied a reason for desertionThen I am going to use fire against the enemy Lu Su kept silence but he recognized that Zhuge Liang was again rightMeanwhile Huang Gai lay in his tent whither all his colleague officers went to condole with him and inquire after his healthBut Huang Gai would say never a word he only lay sighing deeply from time to timeBut when the Strategist Kan Ze came Huang Gai told them to bring him to the room where he layThen he bade the servants go away and Kan Ze said Surely you must have some serious quarrel with the General I have none said Huang GaiThen this beating is just part of a ruse How did you guess said Huang GaiBecause I watched the General and I guessed about nine tenths of the truth Huang Gai said You see I have been very generously treated by the Sun family all three of them and have no means of showing my gratitude except by offering to help in this ruseTrue I suffer but I do not regret thatAmong all those I know in the army there is not one I am intimate with except yourselfYou are true and I can talk with you as a friend I suppose you wish me to present your surrender letter to Cao Cao is that it Just that will you do it said Huang GaiKan Ze consented joyfullyEven the warriors body is but a stake in the game The friend so ready to help him proves that their hearts are the sameKan Zes reply will be read in the next chapterCHAPTER  Kan Ze Presents The Treacherous Letter Pang Tong Suggests Chaining The Ship Together Kan Ze was from Shanyin a son of a humble familyHe loved books but as he was too poor to buy he used to borrowHe had a wonderfully tenacious memory was very eloquent and no cowardSun Quan had employed him among his advisers and he and Huang Gai were excellent friendsNow Huang Gai had thought of Kan Ze to present the treacherous letter to Cao Cao as Kan Zes gifts made him most suitableKan Ze accepted with enthusiasm saying When you my friend have suffered so much for our lord could I spare myselfNo while a person lives he must go on fulfilling his mission or he is no better than the herbs that rot in the field Huang Gai slipped off the couch and came over to salute himHowever this matter must speed continued Kan Ze there is no time to lose The letter is already written said Huang Gai Kan Ze received it and leftThat night he disguised himself as an old fisherman and started in a small punt for the north shore under the cold glittering light of the starsSoon he drew near the enemys camp and was captured by the patrolWithout waiting for day they informed Cao Cao who said at once Is he not just a spy No said they he is alone just an old fisherman and he says he is an adviser in the service of the South Land named Kan Ze and he has come on secret business Bring him said Cao Cao and Kan Ze was led inCao Cao was seated in a brilliantly lighted tent He was leaning on a small table and as soon as he saw the prisoner he said harshly You are an adviser of East Wu what then are you doing here People say that you greedily welcome people of ability I do not think your question a very proper oneO Friend Huang Gai you made a mistake said Kan ZeYou know I am fighting against East Wu and you come here privatelyWhy should I not question you Huang Gai is an old servant of Wu one who has served three successive rulers Now he has been cruelly beaten for no fault before the face of all the officers in Zhou Yus campHe is grievously angry about this and wishes to desert to your side that he may be revengedHe discussed it with me and as we are inseparable I have come to give you his letter asking whether you would receive him Where is the letter said Cao CaoThe missive was produced and presented Cao Cao opened it and readI Huang Gai have been generously treated by the Sun family and have served them singleheartedlyLately they have been discussing an attack with our forces on the enormous army of the central governmentEvery one knows our few are no match for such a multitude and every officer of the South Land wise or foolish recognizes that quite wellHowever Zhou Yu who after all is but a youth and a shallow minded simpleton maintains that success is possible and rashly desires to smash stones with an eggBeside he is arbitrary and tyrannical punishing for no crime and leaving meritorious service unrewardedI am an old servant and for no reason have been shamed in the sight of humans Wherefore I hate him in my heartYou O Prime Minister treat people with sincerity and are ready to welcome ability and so I and those under my leadership desire to enter your service whereby to acquire reputation and remove the shameful stigmaThe commissariat weapons and the supply ships that I am commanding will also come over to youIn perfect sincerity I state these matters I pray you not to doubt me Leaning there on the low table by his side Cao Cao turned this letter over and over and read it again and againThen he smacked the table opened his eyes wide with anger saying Huang Gai is trying to play the personal injury trick on me is heAnd you are in it as the intermediary to present the letterHow dare you come to sport with me Cao Cao ordered the lictors to thrust forth the messenger and take off his headKan Ze was hustled out his face untroubled On the contrary he laughed aloudAt this Cao Cao told them to bring him back and harshly said to him What do you find to laugh at now that I have foiled you and your ruse has failed I was not laughing at you I was laughing at my friends simplicity What do you mean by his simplicity If you want to slay slay do not trouble me with a multitude of questions I have read all the books on the art of war and I am well versed in all ways of misleading the enemyThis ruse of yours might have succeeded with many but it will not do for me And so you say that the letter is a vicious trick said Kan ZeWhat I say is that your little slip has sent you to the death you risked If the thing was real and you were sincere why does not the letter name a time of coming overWhat have you to say to that Kan Ze waited to the end and then laughed louder than ever saying I am so glad you are not frightened but can still boast of your knowledge of the books of warNow you will not lead away your soldiersIf you fight Zhou Yu will certainly capture youBut how sad to think I die at the hand of such an ignorant fellow What mean youI ignorant You are ignorant of any strategy and a victim of unreason is not that sufficient Well then tell me where is any fault You treat wise people too badly for me to talk to youYou can finish me and let there be an end of it If you can speak with any show of reason I will treat you differently Do you not know that when one is going to desert ones master and become a renegade one cannot say exactly when the chance will occurIf one binds ones self to a fixed moment and the thing cannot be done just then the secret will be discovered One must watch for an opportunity and take it when it comes is it possible to know exactly whenBut you know nothing of common sense all you know is how to put good humans to deathSo you really are an ignorant fellow At this Cao Cao changed his manner got up and came over to the prisoner bowing I did not see clearly that is quite trueI offended you and I hope you will forget it The fact is that Huang Gai and I are both inclined to desert to you we even yearn for it as a child desires its parentsIs it possible that we should play you false If you two could render me so great a service you shall certainly be richly rewarded We do not desire rank or riches we come because it is the will of Heaven and the plain way of duty Then wine was set out and Kan Ze was treated as an honored guestWhile they were drinking some one came in and whispered in Cao Caos earHe replied Let me see the letter Whereupon the man pulled out and gave him a letter which evidently pleased him That is from the two Cai brothers thought Kan ZeThey are reporting the punishment of my friend and that will be a proof of the sincerity of his letter Turning toward Kan Ze Cao Cao said I must ask you to return to settle the date with your friend as soon as I know I will have a force waiting I cannot return pray Sir send some other one you can trust If some one else should go the secret would be discovered Kan Ze refused again and again but at last gave way saying If I am to go I must not wait here I must be off at once Cao Cao offered him gold and silks which were refusedKan Ze started left the camp and reembarked for the south bank where he related all that had happened to Huang GaiIf it had not been for your persuasive tongue then had I undergone this suffering in vain said Huang Gai I will now go to get news of the two Cai brothers said Kan ZeExcellent said Huang GaiKan Ze went to the camp commanded by Gan Ning and when they were seated Kan Ze said to his host I was much distressed when I saw how disgracefully you were treated for your intercession on behalf of Huang Gai Gan Ning smiledJust then the two Cai brothers came and host and guest exchanged glancesGan Ning said The truth is Zhou Yu is over confident and he reckons us as nobody We count for nothingEvery one is talking of the way I was insulted And he shouted and gritted his teeth and smacked the table in his wrathKan Ze leaned over toward his host and said something in a very low voice at which Gan Ning bent his head and sighedCai He and Cai Zhong gathered from this scene that both Gan Ning and Kan Ze were ripe for desertion and determined to probe them Why Sir do you anger him Why not be silent about your injuries said theyWhat know you of our bitterness said Kan ZeWe think you seem much inclined to go over to Cao Cao said theyKan Ze at this lost color Gan Ning started up and drew his sword crying They have found out they must die to keep their mouths shut No no cried the two in a flurryLet us tell you something quite secret Quick then cried Gan NingSo Cai He said The truth is that we are only pretended deserters and if you two gentlemen are of our way of thinking we can manage things for you But are you speaking the truth said Gan NingIs it likely we should say such a thing if it were untrue cried both at the same momentGan Ning put on a pleased look and said Then this is the very heavengiven chance You know we have already told Cao Cao of the Huang Gai affair and how you were insulted The fact is I have given the Prime Minister a letter on behalf of Huang Gai and he sent me back again to settle the date of Huang Gais desertion said Kan ZeWhen an honest person happens upon an enlightened master his heart will always be drawn toward him said Gan NingThe four then drank together and opened their hearts to each otherThe two Cai Zhong and Cai He wrote a private letter to their master saying Gan Ning has agreed to join in our plot and play the traitor and Kan Ze also wrote and they sent the letters secretly to Cao Cao Kan Zes letter said Huang Gai has found no opportunity so farHowever when he comes his boat can be recognized by a black indented flagThat shall mean he is on board However when Cao Cao got these two letters he was still doubtful and called together his advisers to talk over the matter Said he On the other side Gan Ning has been put to shame by the CommanderinChief whom he is prepared to betray for the sake of revengeHuang Gai has been punished and sent Kan Ze to propose that he should come over to our side Only I still distrust the whole thingWho will go over to the camp to find out the real truth Then Jiang Gan spoke up saying I failed in my mission the other day and am greatly mortifiedI will risk my life again and this time I shall surely bring good news Cao Cao approved of him as messenger and bade him startJiang Gan set out in a small craft and speedily arrived in the Three Gorges landing near the naval campThen he sent to inform Zhou Yu who hearing who it was chuckled saying Success depends upon this man Then Zhou Yu called Lu Su and told him to call Pang Tong to come and do certain things for himThis Pang Tong was from Xiangyang And he had gone to the east of the river to get away from the strife Lu Su had recommended him to Zhou Yu but he had not yet presented himselfWhen Zhou Yu sent Lu Su to ask what scheme of attack he would recommend against Cao Cao Pang Tong had said to Lu Su You must use fire against himBut the river is wide and if one ship is set on fire the others will scatter unless they are fastened together so that they must remain in one placeThat is the one road to success Lu Su took this message to the General who pondered over it and then said The only person who can manage this is Pang Tong himself Cao Cao is very wily said Lu Su how can Pang Tong go So Zhou Yu was sad and undecidedHe could think of no method till suddenly the means presented itself in the arrival of Jiang GanZhou Yu at once sent instructions to Pang Tong how to act and then sat himself in his tent to await his visitor Jiang GanBut the visitor became ill at ease and suspicious when he saw that his old student friend did not come to welcome him and he took the precaution of sending his boat into a retired spot to be made fast before he went to the Generals tentWhen Zhou Yu saw Jiang Gan Zhou Yu put on an angry face and said My friend why did you treat me so badly Jiang Gan laughed and said I remembered the old days when we were as brothers and I came expressly to pour out my heart to youWhy do you say I treated you badly You came to persuade me to betray my master which I would never do unless the sea dried up and the rocks perishedRemembering the old times I filled you with wine and kept you to sleep with meAnd you you plundered my private letters and stole away with never a word of farewell You betrayed me to Cao Cao and caused the death of my two friends on the other side and so caused all my plans to miscarry Now what have you come forCertainly it is not out of kindness to meI would cut you in two but I still care for our old friendshipI would send you back again but within a day or two I shall attack that rebel and if I let you stay in my camp my plans will leak outSo I am going to tell my attendants to conduct you to a certain retired hut in the Western Hills and keep you there till I shall have won the victoryThen I will send you back again Jiang Gan tried to say something but Zhou Yu would not listenHe turned his back and went into the recesses of his tent The attendants led the visitor off set him on a horse and took him away over the hills to the small hut leaving two soldiers to look after himWhen Jiang Gan found himself in the lonely hut he was very depressed and had no desire to eat or sleepBut one night when the stars were very brilliant he strolled out to enjoy them Presently he came to the rear of his lonely habitation and heard near by some one crooning over a bookApproaching with stealthy steps he saw a tiny cabin half hidden in a cliff whence a slender beam or two of light stole out between the raftersHe went nearer and peeping in saw a man reading by the light of a lamp near which hung a sword And the book was Sun Zis classic The Art of War This is no common person thought Jiang Gan and so he knocked at the doorThe door was opened by the reader who bade him welcome with cultivated and refined ceremonyJiang Gan inquired his nameThe host replied I am Pang Tong Then you are surely the Master known as BloomingPhoenix are you not Yes I am he How often have I heard you talked aboutYou are famousBut why are you hidden away in this spot That fellow Zhou Yu is too conceited to allow that any one else has any talent and so I live here quietlyBut who are you Sir I am Jiang Gan Then Pang Tong made him welcome and led him in and the two sat down to talkWith your gifts you would succeed anywhere said Jiang GanIf you would enter Cao Caos service I would recommend you to him I have long desired to get away from here and if you Sir will present me there is no time like the presentIf Zhou Yu heard of my wish he would kill me I am sure So without more ado they made their way down the hill to the waters edge to seek the boat in which Jiang Gan had come They embarked and rowing swiftly they soon reached the northern shoreAt the central camp Jiang Gan landed and went to seek Cao Cao to whom he related the story of the discovery of his new acquaintanceWhen Cao Cao heard that the newcomer was Master BloomingPhoenix Cao Cao went to meet him personally made him very welcome and soon they sat down to talk on friendly termsCao Cao said And so Zhou Yu in his youth is conceited and annoys his officers and rejects all their advice I know thatBut your fame has been long known to me and now that you have been gracious enough to turn my way I pray you not to be thrifty of your advice I too know well that you are a model of military strategy said Pang Tong but I should like to have one look at your disposition So horses were brought and the two rode out to the lines host and visitor on equal terms side by sideThey ascended a hill whence they had a wide view of the land base After looking all round Pang Tong remarked Wu Qi the Great General came to life again could not do better nor Sun Zi the Famed Strategist if he reappeared All accords with the precepts The camp is beside the hills and is flanked by a forest The front and rear are within sight of each otherGates of egress and ingress are provided and the roads of advance and retirement are bent and broken Master I entreat you not to overpraise me but to advise me where I can make further improvements said Cao CaoThen the two men rode down to the naval camp where twenty four gates were arranged facing south The cruisers and the battleships were all lined up so as to protect the lighter crafts which lay inside There were channels to pass to and fro and fixed anchorages and stations Pang Tong surveying all this smiled saying Sir Prime Minister if this is your method of warfare you enjoy no empty reputation Then pointing to the southern shore he went on Zhou Yu Zhou YuYou are finished you will have to die Cao Cao was mightily pleasedThey rode back to the chief tent and wine was brought They discussed military matters and Pang Tong held forth at lengthRemarks and comments flowed freely between the two and Cao Cao formed an exalted opinion of his new adherents abilities and treated him with the greatest honorBy and bye the guest seemed to have succumbed to the influence of many cups and said Have you any capable medical people in your army What are they for Master said Cao CaoThere is a lot of illness among the marines and you ought to find some remedy The fact was that at this time Cao Caos men were suffering from the climate many were vomiting and not a few had died It was a source of great anxiety to him and when the newcomer suddenly mentioned it of course he had to ask advicePang Tong said Your marine force is excellent but there is just one defect it is not quite perfect Cao Cao pressed him to say where the imperfection layI have a plan to overcome the ailment of the soldiers so that no one shall be sick and all fit for service What is this excellent scheme said Cao CaoThe river is wide and the tides ebb and flow The winds and waves are never at restYour troops from the north are unused to ships and the motion makes them illIf your ships large and small were classed and divided into thirties or fifties and joined up stem to stem by iron chains and boards spread across them to say nothing of soldiers being able to pass from one to the next even horses could move about on themIf this were done then there would be no fear of the wind and the waves and the rising and falling tides Coming down from his seat Cao Cao thanked his guest saying I could never defeat the land of the south without this scheme of yours That is my idea said Pang Tong it is for you to decide about it Orders were then issued to call up all the blacksmiths and set them to work night and day forging iron chains and great bolts to lock together the shipsAnd the soldiers rejoiced when they heard of the planIn the Red Cliffs fight they used the flame The weapon here will be the same By Pang Tongs advice the ships were chained Else Zhou Yu had not that battle gainedPang Tong further told Cao Cao saying I know many bold humans on the other side who hate Zhou YuIf I may use my little tongue in your service I can induce them to come over to you and if Zhou Yu be left alone you can certainly take him captiveAnd Liu Bei is of no account Certainly if you could render me so great a service I would memorialize the Throne and obtain for you one of the highest offices said Cao CaoI am not doing this for the sake of wealth or honors but from a desire to succor humankindIf you cross the river I pray you be merciful I am Heavens means of doing right and could not bear to slay the people Pang Tong thanked him and begged for a document that would protect his own familyCao Cao asked Where do they live All are near the river bank And Cao Cao ordered a protection declaration to be preparedHaving sealed it he gave it to Pang Tong who said You should attack as soon as I have gone but do not let Zhou Yu doubt anything Cao Cao promised secrecy and the wily traitor took his leaveJust as he was about to embark he met a man in a Taoist robe with a bamboo comb in his hair who stopped him saying You are very boldHuang Gai is planning to use the personal injury ruse and Kan Ze has presented the letter of pretended desertion You have proffered the fatal scheme of chaining the ships together lest the flames may not completely destroy themThis sort of mischievous work may have been enough to blind Cao Cao but I saw it all Pang Tong become helpless with fear his viscera flown away his spirit scattered By guileful means one may succeed The victims too find friends in needThe next chapter will tell who the stranger was CHAPTER Banquet On The Great River Cao Cao Sings A Song Battle On Open Water The Northern Soldiers Fight With The Chained Ships In the last chapter Pang Tong was brought up with a sudden shock when some one seized him and said of his schemeUpon turning to look at the man Pang Tong saw it was Xu Shu an old friend and his heart revivedLooking around and seeing no one near Pang Tong said It would be a pity if you upset my plan the fate of the people of all the eightyone southern counties is in your hands Xu Shu smiled saying And what of the fate of these eight hundred thirty thousand soldiers and horse of the north Do you intend to wreck my scheme Xu Shu I have never forgotten the kindness of Uncle Liu Bei nor my oath to avenge the death of my mother at Cao Caos handsI have said I would never think out a plan for him So am I likely to wreck yours now BrotherBut I have followed Cao Caos army thus far and after they shall have been defeated good and bad will suffer alike and how can I escapeTell me how I can secure safety and I sew up my lips and go away Pang Tong smiled If you are as highminded as that there is no great difficulty Still I wish you would instruct me So Pang Tong whispered something in his ear which seemed to please Xu Shu greatly for he thanked him most cordially and took his leaveThen Pang Tong betook himself to his boat and left for the southern shoreHis friend gone Xu Shu mischievously spread certain rumors in the camp and next day were to be seen everywhere soldiers in small groups some talking others listening heads together and ears stretched out till the camps seemed to buzzSome of the officers went to Cao Cao and told him saying A rumor is running around the camps that Han Sui and Ma Teng are marching from Xiliang to attack the capital This troubled Cao Cao who called together his advisers to council Said he The only anxiety I have felt in this expedition was about the possible doings of Han Sui and Ma TengNow there is a rumor running among the soldiers and though I know not whether it be true or false it is necessary to be on ones guard At this point Xu Shu said You have been kind enough to give me an office Sir and I have really done nothing in returnIf I may have three thousand troops I will march at once to San Pass and guard this entranceIf there be any pressing matter I will report at once If you would do this I should be quite at my easeThere are already troops beyond the Pass who will be under your command and now I will give you three thousand of horse and foot and Zang Ba shall lead the van and march quickly Xu Shu took leave of the Prime Minister and left in company with Zang BaThis was Pang Tongs scheme to secure the safety of Xu Shu A poem saysCao Cao marched south but at his back There rode the fear of rear attackPang Tongs good counsel Xu Shu took And thus the fish escaped the hook Cao Caos anxiety diminished after he had thus sent away Xu Shu Then he rode round all the camps first the land forces and then the navalHe boarded one of the large ships and thereon set up his standard The naval camps were arranged along two lines and every ship carried a thousand bows and crossbowsWhile Cao Cao remained with the fleet it occurred the full moon of the eleventh month of the thirteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  The sky was clear there was no wind and the river lay unruffledHe prepared a great banquet with music and thereto invited all his leadersAs evening drew on the moon rose over the eastern hills in its immaculate beauty and beneath it lay the broad belt of the river like a band of pure silkIt was a great assembly and all the guests were clad in gorgeous silks and embroidered robes and the arms of the fighting soldiers glittered in the moonlightThe officers civil and military were seated in their proper order of precedence The setting too was exquisiteThe Nanping Mountains were outlined as in a picture the boundaries of Chaisang lay in the east the river showed west as far as Xiakou on the south lay the Fan Mountains on the north was the Black Forest The view stretched wide on every side Cao Caos heart was jubilant and he harangued the assembly saying My one aim since I enlisted my first small band of volunteers has been the removal of evil from the state and I have sworn to cleanse the country and restore tranquillity Now there is only left this land of the south to withstand meI am at the head of a hundred legions I depend upon you gentlemen and have no doubt of my final successAfter I have subdued the South Land there will be no trouble in all the countryThen we shall enjoy wealth and honor and revel in peace They rose in a body and expressed their appreciation saying We trust that you may soon report complete victory and we shall all repose in the shade of your good fortune In his elation Cao Cao bade the servants bring more wine and they drank till late at nightWarmed and mellowed the host pointed to the south bank saying Zhou Yu and Lu Su know not the appointed timeHeaven is aiding me bringing upon them the misfortune of the desertion of their most trusted friends O Prime Minister say nothing of these things lest they become known to the enemy said Xun You But the Prime Minister only laughedYou are all my trusty friends said he both officers and humble attendantsWhy should I refrain Pointing to Xiakou he continued You do not reckon for much with your puny force Liu Bei and Zhuge LiangHow foolish of you to attempt to shake the Taishan Mountains Then turning to his officers he said I am now fiftyfour and if I get the South Land I shall have the wherewithal to rejoiceIn the days of long ago the Patriarch Duke Qiao in the south and I were great friends and we came to an agreement on certain matters for I knew his two daughtersElder Qiao and Younger Qiaowere lovely beyond wordsThen by some means they became wives to Sun Ce and Zhou YuBut now my palace of rest is built on the River Zhang and victory over the South Land will mean that I marry these two fair women I will put them in the Bronze Bird Tower and they shall rejoice my declining yearsMy desires will then be completely attained He smiled at the anticipationDu Mu a famous poet of the Tang Dynasty in one poem says A broken halberd buried in the sand With deep rust eaten Loud tells of ancient battles on the strand When Cao Cao was beatenHad eastern winds Zhou Yus plan refused to aid And fan the blaze the two fair Qiaos in the Bronze Birds shade Would have been locked at spring ageBut suddenly amid the merriment was heard the hoarse cry of a raven flying toward the southWhy does the raven thus cry in the night said Cao Cao to those about himThe moon is so bright that it thinks it is day said they and so it leaves its tree Cao Cao laughed by this time he was quite intoxicatedHe set up his spear in the prow of the ship and poured a libation into the river and then drank three brimming goblets As he lowered the spear he said This is the spear that broke up the Yellow Scarves captured Lu Bu destroyed Yuan Shao and subdued Yuan Shu whose armies are now mine In the north it reached to Liaodong and it stretched out over the whole south It has never failed in its taskThe present scene moves me to the depths and I will sing a song in which you shall accompany me And so he sangWhen goblets are brimming then sang is near birth But life is full short and has few days of mirth Life goes as the dew drops fly swiftly away Beneath the glance of the glowing hot ruler of dayHumans life may be spent in the noblest enterprise But sorrowful thoughts in his heart oft arise Let us wash clean away the sad thoughts that intrude With bumpers of wine such as Du Kang once brewedGone is my day of youthful fire And still ungained is my desireThe deer feed on the level plain And joyful call then feed againMy noble guests are gathered round The air is trilled with joyful sound Bright my future lies before me As the moonlight on this plain But I strive in vain to reach itWhen shall I my wish attainNone can answer and so sadness Grips my inmost heart again Far north and south Wide east and west We safety seek Vain is the questHumans heart oft yearns For converse sweetAnd my heart burns When old friends greetThe stars are paled by the full moons light The raven wings his southward flightAnd thrice he circles round a tree No place thereon to rest finds heThey weary not the mountains of great height The waters deep of depth do not complain Duke Zhou  no leisure found by day or night Stern toil is his who would the empire gain The song made they sang it with him and were all exceedingly merry save one guest who suddenly said When the great army is on the point of battle and lives are about to be risked why do you O Prime Minister speak such ill words Cao Cao turned quickly toward the speaker who was Liu Fu Imperial Protector of Yangzhou This Liu Fu sprang from Hefei When first appointed to his post he had gathered in the terrified and frightened people and restored order He had founded schools and encouraged the people to till the land He had long served under Cao Cao and rendered valuable serviceWhen Liu Fu spoke Cao Cao dropped his spear to the level and said What illomened words did I use You spoke of the moon paling the stars and the raven flying southward without finding a resting placeThese are illomened words How dare you try to belittle my endeavor cried Cao Cao very wrathful and with that he smote Liu Fu with his spear and slew himThe assembly broke up and the guests dispersed in fear and confusionNext day when Cao Cao had recovered from his drunken bout he was very grieved at what he had doneWhen the murdered mans son Liu Xi came to crave the body of his father for burial Cao Cao wept and expressed his sorrowI am guilty of your fathers death I was drunk yesterday I regret the deed exceedinglyYour father shall be interred with the honors of a minister of the highest rank Cao Cao sent an escort of soldiers to take the body to the homeland for burialA few days after the two leaders of the naval force Mao Jie and Yu Jin came to say the ships were all connected together by chains as had been ordered and all was now readyThey asked for the command to start Thereupon the leaders of both land and naval forces were assembled on board a large ship in the center of the squadron to receive ordersThe various armies and squadrons were distinguished by different flags Mao Jie and Yu Jin led the central naval squadron with yellow flag Zhang He the leading squadron red flag Lu Qian the rear squadron black flag Wen Ping the left squadron blue flag and Li Tong the right squadron white flagOn shore Xu Huang commanded the horsemen with red flag Li Dian the vanguard black flag Yue Jin the left wing blue flag and Xiahou Yuan the right wing white flagXiahou Dun and Cao Hong were in reserve and the general staff was under the leadership of Xu Chu and Zhang LiaoThe other leaders were ordered to remain in camps but ready for actionAll being ready the squadron drums beat the roll thrice and the ships sailed out under a strong northwest wind on a trial cruise When they got among the waves they were found to be as steady and immovable as the dry land itselfThe northern soldiers showed their delight at the absence of motion by capering and flourishing their weaponsThe ships moved on the squadrons keeping quite distinct Fifty light cruisers sailed to and fro keeping order and urging progressCao Cao watched his navy from the Generals Terrace and was delighted with their evolutions and maneuvers Surely this meant complete victoryHe ordered the recall and the squadrons returned in perfect order to their baseThen Cao Cao went to his tent and summoned his advisers He said If Heaven had not been on my side should I have got this excellent plan from the BloomingPhoenixNow that the ships are attached firmly to each other one may traverse the river as easily as walking on firm earth The ships are firmly attached to each other said Cheng Yu but you should be prepared for an attack by fire so that they can scatter to avoid it The General laughedYou look a long way ahead said he but you see what cannot happen Cheng Yu speaks much to the point said Xun You why do you laugh at him Cao Cao said Any one using fire depends upon the windThis is now winter and only west winds blow You will get neither east nor south windsI am on the northwest and the enemy is on the southeast bank If they use fire they will destroy themselves I have nothing to fearIf it was the tenth moon or early spring I would provide against fire The Prime Minister is indeed wise said the others in chorusNone can equal him With northern troops unused to shipboard I could never have crossed the river but for this chaining plan said Cao CaoThen he saw two of the secondary leaders stand up and they said We are from the north but we are also sailorsPray give us a small squadron and we will seize some of the enemys flags and drums for you that we may prove ourselves adepts on the water The speakers were two men who had served under Yuan Shao named Jiao Chu and Zhang NanI do not think naval work would suit you two born and brought up in the north said Cao CaoThe southern soldiers are thoroughly accustomed to shipsYou should not regard your lives as a childs plaything They cried If we fail treat us according to army laws The fighting ships are all chained together there are only small twentymen boats freeThey are unsuitable for fighting If we took large ships where would be the wonderful in what we will doNo give us a score of the small ships and we will take half each and go straight to the enemys naval portWe will just seize a flag slay a leader and come home I will let you have the twenty ships and five hundred of good vigorous troops with long spears and stiff crossbowsEarly tomorrow the main fleet shall make a demonstration on the river and I will also tell Wen Ping to support you with thirty ships The two men retired greatly elatedNext morning very early food was prepared and at the fifth watch all was ready for a startThen from the naval camp rolled out the drums and the gongs clanged as the ships moved out and took up their positions the various flags fluttering in the morning breeze And the two intrepid leaders with their squadron of small scouting boats went down the lines and out into the streamNow a few days before the sound of Cao Caos drums had been heard on the southern bank Zhou Yu had watched the maneuvers of the northern fleet on the open river from the top of a hill till the fleet had gone in againSo when the sound of drums was again heard all the southern army went up the hills to watch the northern fleet All they saw was a squadron of small ships bounding over the wavesAs the northern fleet came nearer the news was taken to Zhou Yu who called for volunteers to go out against themHan Dang and Zhou Tai offered themselvesThey were accepted and orders were issued to the camps to remain ready for action but not to move till toldHan Dang and Zhou Tai sailed out each with a small squadron of five ships in line The two braggarts from the north Jiao Chu and Zhang Nan really only trusted to their boldness and luckTheir ships came down under the powerful strokes of the oars and as they neared the two leaders put on their heartprotectors gripped their spears and each took his station in the prow of the leading ship of his divisionJiao Chus ship led and as soon as he came near enough his troops began to shoot at Han Dang who fended off the arrows with his buckler Jiao Chu twirled his long spear as he engaged his opponentBut at the first thrust he was killedHis comrade Zhang Nan with the other ships was coming up with great shouts when Zhou Tai sailed up at an angle and these two squadrons began shooting arrows at each other in cloudsZhou Tai fended off the arrows with his shield and stood gripping his sword firmly till his ships came within a few spans of the enemys ships when he leaped across and cut down Zhang Nan Zhang Nans dead body fell into the waterThen the battle became confused and the attacking ships rowed hard to get awayThe southerners pursued but soon came in sight of Wen Pings supporting fleetOnce more the ships engaged and the forces fought with each otherZhou Yu with his officers stood on the summit of a mountain and watched his own and the enemy ships out on the river The flags and the ensigns were all in perfect orderThen he saw Wen Ping and his own fleets engaged in battle and soon it was evident that the former was not a match for his own sailors Wen Ping turned about to retire Han Dang and Zhou Tai pursuedZhou Yu fearing lest his sailors should go too far then hoisted the white flag of recallTo his officers Zhou Yu said The masts of the northern ships stand thick as reeds Cao Cao himself is full of wiles how can we destroy him No one replied for just then the great yellow flag that flapped in the breeze in the middle of Cao Caos fleet suddenly fell over into the riverZhou Yu laughedThat is a bad omen said he Then an extra violent blast of wind came by and the waves rose high and beat upon the bankA corner of his own flag flicked Zhou Yu on the cheek and suddenly a thought flashed through his mindZhou Yu uttered a loud cry staggered and fell backward They picked him up there was blood upon his lips and he was unconscious Presently however he revivedAnd once he laughed then gave a cry This is hard to ensure a victoryZhou Yus fate will appear as the story unfolds CHAPTER On The Seven Stars Altar Zhuge Liang Sacrifices To The Winds At Three Gorges Zhou Yu Liberates The Fire In the last chapter Zhou Yu was seized with sudden illness as he watched the fleets of his enemyHe was borne to his tent and his officers came in multitudes to inquire after himThey looked at each other saying What a pity our general should be taken ill when Cao Caos legions threaten so terriblyWhat would happen if Cao Cao attacked Messengers with the evil tidings were sent to Sun Quan while the physicians did their best for the invalidLu Su was particularly sad at the illness of his patron and went to see Zhuge Liang to talk it overWhat do you make of it said Zhuge LiangGood luck for Cao Cao bad for us said Lu SuI could cure him said Zhuge Liang laughing If you could Wu would be very fortunate said Lu SuLu Su prayed Zhuge Liang to go to see the sick manThey went and Lu Su entered firstZhou Yu lay in bed his head covered by a quiltHow are you General said Lu SuMy heart pains me every now and again I feel faint and dizzy Have you taken any remedies My gorge rises at the thought I could not I saw Zhuge Liang just now and he says he could heal youHe is just outside and I will call him if you like Ask him to come in Zhou Yu bade his servants help him to a sitting position and Zhuge Liang enteredI have not seen you for days said Zhuge LiangHow could I guess that you were unwell How can any one feel secure We are constantly the playthings of luck good or bad Yes Heavens winds and clouds are not to be measuredNo one can reckon their comings and goings can they Zhou Yu turned pale and a low groan escaped him while his visitor went on You feel depressed do you notAs though troubles were piling up in your heart That is exactly how I feel You need cooling medicine to dissipate this sense of oppression I have taken a cooling draught but it has done no good You must get the humors into good order before the drugs will have any effect Zhou Yu began to think Zhuge Liang knew what was really the matter and resolved to test himWhat should be taken to produce a favorable temper said Zhou Yu I know one means of producing a favorable temper replied Zhuge Liang I wish you would tell me Zhuge Liang got out writing materials sent away the servants and then wrote a few wordsTo burn out the fleet Of Cao Cao All are in your wish Except winds from the east This he gave to the sick general saying That is the origin of your illness Zhou Yu read the words with great surprise and it confirmed his secret opinion that Zhuge Liang really was rather more than humanHe decided that the only course was to be open and tell him allSo he said Since you know the cause of the disease what do you recommend as treatmentThe need of a remedy is very urgent I have no great talent said Zhuge Liang but I have had to do with humans of no ordinary gifts from whom I have received certain magical books called Concealing Method I can call the winds and summon the rainsSince you need a southeast breeze General you must build an altar on the Nanping Mountains the Altar of the Seven Stars It must be nine spans high with three steps surrounded by a guard of one hundred and twenty humans bearing flagsOn this altar I will work a spell to procure a strong southeast gale for three days and three nightsDo you approve Never mind three whole days said Zhou Yu one day of strong wind will serve my purposeBut it must be done at once and without delay I will sacrifice for a wind for three days from the twentieth day of the moon will that suit you Zhou Yu was delighted and hastily rose from his couch to give the necessary ordersHe commanded that five hundred men should be sent to the mountains to build the altar and he told off the guard of one hundred and twenty to bear the flags and be at the orders of Zhuge LiangZhuge Liang took his leave went forth and rode off with Lu Su to the mountains where they measured out the ground He bade the soldiers build the altar of red earth from the southeast quarterIt was two hundred and forty spans in circuit square in shape and of three tiers each of three spans in all nine spans highOn the lowest tier he placed the flags of the twentyeight houses of the heavens and four constellations on the east seven with blue flags on the north seven with black flags on the west seven with white flags and on the south seven with red flagsAround the second tier he placed sixtyfour yellow flags corresponding to the number of the diagrams of the Book of Divination in eight groups of eightFour men were stationed on the highest platform each wearing a Taoist headdress and a black silk robe embroidered with the phoenix and confined with wide sashes They wore scarlet boots and squarecut skirtsOn the left front stood a man supporting a tall pole bearing at its top a plume of light feathers to show by their least movement the winds first breathingOn the right front was a man holding a tall pole whereon was a flag with the symbol of the seven stars to show the direction and force of the windOn the left rear stood a man with a sword and on the right rear a man with a censerBelow the altar were fortyfour men holding flags umbrellas spears lances yellow banners white axes red banderoles and black ensigns And these were spaced about the altar On the appointed day Zhuge Liang having chosen a propitious moment bathed his body and purified himself Then he robed himself as a Taoist loosened his locks and approached the altarHe bade Lu Su retire saying Return to the camp and assist the General in setting out his forcesShould my prayers avail not do not wonder So Lu Su left himThen Zhuge Liang commanded the guards on no account to absent themselves to maintain strict silence and to be reverent death would be the penalty of disobedienceNext with solemn steps he ascended the altar faced the proper quarter lighted the incense and sprinkled the water in the basins This done he gazed into the heavens and prayed silentlyThe prayer ended he descended and returned to his tent After a brief rest he allowed the soldiers by turns to go away to eatThrice that day he ascended the altar and thrice descended but there was no sign of the windDuring that time Zhou Yu with Cheng Pu and Lu Su and other military officials on duty sat waiting in the tent till the wishedfor wind should blow and the attack could be launchedMessengers were also sent to Sun Quan to prepare to support the forward movementHuang Gai had his fire ships ready twenty of themThe fore parts of the ships were thickly studded with large nails and they were loaded with dry reeds wood soaked in fish oil and covered with sulfur saltpeter and other inflammables The ships were covered in with black oiled clothIn the prow of each was a black dragon flag with indentations A fighting ship was attached to the stern of each to propel it forward All were ready and awaited orders to moveMeanwhile Cao Caos two spies Cai He and Cai Zhong were being guarded carefully in an outer camp far from the river bank and daily entertained with feasting They were not allowed to know of the preparationsThe watch was so close that not a trickle of information reached the prisonersPresently while Zhou Yu was anxiously awaiting in his tent for the desired wind a messenger came to say that Sun Quan had anchored at a place thirty miles from the camp where he awaited news from the CommanderinChiefLu Su was sent to warn all the various commanders to be ready the ships and their weapons sails and oars all for instant use and to impress upon them the penalties of being caught unpreparedThe soldiers were indeed ready for the fight and yearning for the frayBut the sky remained obstinately clear and as night drew nigh no breath of air stirredWe have been cajoled said Zhou YuIndeed what possibility is there of a southeast wind in midwinter Zhuge Liang would not use vain and deceitful words replied Lu SuTowards the third watch the sound of a movement arose in the air Soon the flags fluttered outAnd when the CommanderinChief went out to make sure he saw they were flowing toward the northwestIn a very short time the southeast wind was in full force Zhou Yu was however frightened at the power of the man whose help he had invoked He said Really the man has power over the heavens and authority over the earth his methods are incalculable beyond the ken of god or devilHe cannot be allowed to live to be a danger to our land of the southWe must slay him soon to fend off later evils So Zhou Yu resolved to commit a crime to remove his dangerous rivalHe called two of the generals of his guard Ding Feng and Xu Sheng and said to them Each of you take a party of one hundred troops one along the river the other along the road to the altar on the mountains As soon as you get there without asking questions or giving reasons you are to seize and behead Zhuge LiangRich reward will be given when you bring his head back Xu Sheng and Ding Feng went off on their errand the former leading dagger and axmen going as fast as oars could propel them along the river the latter at the head of archers and bowmen on horsebackThe southeast wind buffeted them as they went on their wayHigh was raised the Seven Stars Altar On it prayed the SleepingDragon For an eastern wind and straightway Blew the windHad not the wizard Exercised his mighty magic Nought had Zhou Yus skill availedDing Feng first arrived He saw the guards with their flags dropped off his steed and marched to the altar sword in hand But he found no Zhuge LiangHe asked the guards they told him saying He has just gone down Ding Feng ran down the hill to searchThere he met his fellow Xu Sheng and they joined forcesPresently a simple soldier told them saying The evening before a small fast boat anchored there near a sand spit and Zhuge Liang was seen to go on boardThen the boat went up river So Xu Sheng and Ding Feng divided their party into two one to go by water the other by landXu Sheng bade his boatmen put on all sail and take every advantage of the windBefore very long he saw the fugitives boat ahead and when near enough stood in the prow of his own and shouted Do not flee O Instructor of the ArmyThe General requests your presence Zhuge Liang who was seated in the stern of his boat just laughed aloud saying Return and tell the General to make good use of his soldiersTell him I am going up river for a spell and will see him again another day Pray wait a little while cried Xu ShengI have something most important to tell you I knew all about it that Zhou Yu would not let me go and that he wanted to kill me That is why Zhao Yun was waiting for meYou would better not approach nearer Seeing the other ship had no sail Xu Sheng thought he would assuredly come up with it and so maintained the pursuitThen when he got too close Zhao Yun fitted an arrow to the bowstring and standing up in the stern of his boat cried You know who I am and I came expressly to escort the Directing InstructorWhy are you pursuing himOne arrow would kill you only that would cause a breach of the peace between two housesI will shoot and just give you a specimen of my skill With that he shot and the arrow whizzed overhead cutting the rope that held up the sailDown came the sail trailing in the water and the boat swung roundThen Zhao Yuns boat hoisted its sail and the fair wind speedily carried it out of sightOn the bank stood Ding Feng He bade his comrade come to the shore and said Zhuge Liang is too clever for any one and Zhao Yun is bravest of the braveYou remember what he did at Dangyang at the Long Slope BridgeAll we can do is to return and report So they returned to camp and told their master about the preparations that Zhuge Liang had made to ensure safetyZhou Yu was indeed puzzled at the depth of his rivals insight I shall have no peace day or night while he lives said Zhou YuAt least wait till Cao Cao is done with said Lu Su And Zhou Yu knew Lu Su spoke wiselyHaving summoned the leaders to receive orders first Zhou Yu gave orders to Gan NingTake with you the false deserter Cai Zhong and his soldiers and go along the south bank showing the flags of Cao Cao till you reach the Black Forest just opposite the enemys main store of grain and forage Then you are to penetrate as deeply as possible into the enemys lines and light a torch as a signal Cai He is to be kept in camp for another purpose The next order wasTaishi Ci is to lead two thousand troops as quickly as possible to Huangzhou and cut the enemys communications with HefeiWhen near the enemy he is to give a signal and if he sees a red flag he will know that our lord Sun Quan is at hand with reinforcements Gan Ning and Taishi Ci had the farthest to go and started firstThen Lu Meng was sent into the Black Forest with three thousand troops as a support to Gan Ning who was ordered to set fire to Cao Caos depot A fourth party of three thousand troops was led by Ling Tong to the borders of Yiling and attack as soon as the signal from the forest was seenA fifth party of three thousand under Dong Xi went to Hanyang to fall upon the enemy along the River HanTheir signal was a white flag and a sixth division of three thousand commanded by Pan Zhang would support themWhen these six parties had gone offHuang Gai got ready his fire ships and sent a soldier with a note to tell Cao Cao that he was coming over that eveningFour naval squadrons were told off to support Huang GaiThe four squadrons each of three hundred ships were placed under four commanders Han Dang Zhou Tai Jiang Qin and Chen Wu Twenty fire ships preceded each fleet Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu went on board one of the large ships to direct the battleTheir guards were Ding Feng and Xu Sheng Lu Su Kan Ze and the advisers were left to guard the campCheng Pu was greatly impressed with Zhou Yus ordering of the grand attackThen came a messenger bearing a mandate from Sun Quan making Lu Xun Leader of the Van He was ordered to go to Qichun Sun Quan himself would support Lu XunZhou Yu also sent a unit to the Western Hills to make signals and to hoist flags on the Nanping MountainsSo all being prepared they waited for dusk Liu Bei was at Xiakou anxiously awaiting the return of his adviserThen appeared a fleet led by Liu Qi who had come to find out how matters were progressingLiu Bei sent to call him to the battle tower and said The southeast wind had begun to blow and that Zhao Yun had gone to meet Zhuge Liang Not long after a single sail was seen coming up before the wind and Liu Bei knew it was Zhuge Liang the Directing Instructor of the ArmySo Liu Bei and Liu Qi went down to meet the boatSoon the vessel reached the shore and Zhuge Liang and Zhao Yun disembarkedLiu Bei was very glad and after they had inquired after each others wellbeing Zhuge Liang said There is no time to tell of any other things nowAre the soldiers and ships ready They have long been ready replied Liu Bei They only await you to direct how they are to be used The three then went to the tent and took their seats Zhuge Liang at once began to issue ordersZhao Yun with three thousand troops is to cross the river and go to the Black Forest by the minor road He will choose a dense jungle and prepare an ambushTonight after the fourth watch Cao Cao will hurry along that wayWhen half his troops have passed the jungle is to be firedCao Cao will not be wholly destroyed but many will perish There are two roads said Zhao Yun One leads to the southern regions and the other to JingzhouI do not know by which he will come The south road is too dangerous Cao Cao will certainly pass along the Jingzhou road so that he may get away to Xuchang Then Zhao Yun went awayNext Zhuge Liang said to Zhang Fei You will take three thousand troops over the river to cut the road to Yiling You will ambush in the Hulu ValleyCao Cao not daring to go to South Yiling will go to North YilingTomorrow after the rain he will halt to refresh his troopsAs soon as the smoke is seen to rise from their cooking fires you will fire the hill sideYou will not capture Cao Cao but you will render excellent service So Zhang Fei leftNext was called Mi Zhu Mi Fang and Liu Feng They were to take command of three squadrons and go along the river to collect beaten soldiers and their weaponsThe three leftThen Zhuge Liang said to Liu Qi The country around Wuchang is very important and I wish you to take command of your own troops and station them at strategic pointsCao Cao being defeated will flee thither and you will capture him But you are not to leave the city without the best of reasons And Liu Qi took leaveThen Zhuge Liang said to Liu Bei I wish you to remain quietly and calmly in Fankou in a high tower to watch Zhou Yu work out his great scheme this night All this time Guan Yu has been silently waiting his turn but Zhuge Liang said no word to himWhen Guan Yu could bear this no longer he cried Since I first followed my brother to battle many years ago I have never been left behindNow that great things are afoot is there no work for me What is meant by it You should not be surprisedI wanted you for service at a most important point only that there was a something standing in the way that prevented me from sending you said Zhuge Liang What could stand in the wayI wish you would tell me You see Cao Cao was once very kind to you and you cannot help feeling gratefulNow when his soldiers have been beaten he will have to flee along the Huarong Road and if I sent you to guard it you would have to let him pass So I will not send you You are most considerate InstructorBut though it is true that he treated me well yet I slew two of his most redoubtable opponents Yan Liang and Wen Chou by way of repayment beside raising a siegeIf I happened upon him on this occasion I should hardly let him go But what if you did You could deal with me by military rules Then put that in writing So Guan Yu wrote a formal undertaking and gave the document to Zhuge LiangWhat happens if Cao Cao does not pass that way said Guan YuI will give you a written engagement that he will pass Then Zhuge Liang continued On the hills by the Huarong Valley you are to raise a heap of wood and grass to make a great column of smoke and mislead Cao Cao into coming If Cao Cao sees a smoke he will suspect an ambush and will not come said Guan Yu You are very simple said Zhuge LiangDo you not know more of wars ruses than that Cao Cao is an able leader but you can deceive him this timeWhen he sees the smoke he will take it as a subterfuge and risk going that wayBut do not let your kindness of heart rule your conduct Thus was his duty assigned Guan Yu and he left taking his adopted son Guan Ping his general Zhou Cang and five hundred swordsmenSaid Liu Bei His sense of rectitude is very profound I fear if Cao Cao should come that way my brother will let him pass I have consulted the stars lately and the rebel Cao Cao is not fated to come to his end yetI have purposely designed this manifestation of kindly feeling for Guan Yu to accomplish and so act handsomely Indeed there are few such farseeing humans as you are said Liu BeiThe two then went to Fankou whence they might watch Zhou Yus evolutions Sun Qian and Jian Yong were left on guard of XiakouCao Cao was in his great camp in conference with his advisers and awaiting the arrival of Huang GaiThe southeast wind was very strong that day and Cheng Yu was insisting on the necessity for precautionBut Cao Cao laughed saying The Winter Solstice depends upon the sun and nothing else there is sure to be a southeast wind at some one or other of its recurrencesI see nothing to wonder at Just then they announced the arrival of a small boat from the other shore with a letter from Huang GaiThe bearer of the letter was brought in and presented it Cao Cao read itZhou Yu has kept such strict watch that there has been no chance of escapeBut now some grain is coming down river and I Huang Gai have been named as escort commander which will give me the opportunity I desireI will slay one of the known generals and bring his head as an offering when I comeThis evening at the third watch if boats are seen with dragon toothed flags they will be the grain boats This letter delighted Cao Cao who with his officers went to the naval camp and boarded a great ship to watch for the arrival of Huang GaiIn the South Land when evening fell Zhou Yu sent for Cai He and bade the soldiers bind himThe unhappy man protested saying I have committed no crime But Zhou Yu said What sort of a fellow are you think you to come and pretend to desert to my sideI need a small sacrifice for my flag and your head will serve my purposeSo I am going to use it Cai He being at the end of his tether unable to deny the charge suddenly cried Two of your own side Kan Ze and Gan Ning are also in the plot Under my directions said Zhou YuCai He was exceedingly repentant and sad but Zhou Yu bade them take Cai He to the river bank where the black standard had been set up and there after the pouring of a libation and the burning of paper Cai He was beheaded his blood being a sacrifice to the flagThis ceremony over the ships started and Huang Gai took his place on the third ship He merely wore breast armor and carried a keen blade On his flag were written four large characters Van Leader Huang GaiWith a fair wind his fleet sailed toward the Red CliffsThe wind was strong and the waves ran highCao Cao in the midst of the central squadron eagerly scanned the river which rolled down under the bright moon like a silver serpent writhing in innumerable foldsLetting the wind blow full in his face Cao Cao laughed aloud for he was now to obtain his desireThen a soldier pointing to the river said The whole south is one mass of sails and they are coming up on the wind Cao Cao went to a higher point and gazed at the sails intently and his officers told him that the flags were black and dragon shaped and indented and among them there flew one very large banner on which was a name Huang GaiThat is my friend the deserter said he joyfullyHeaven is on my side today As the ships drew closer Cheng Yu said Those ships are treacherousDo not let them approach the camp How know you that asked Cao CaoAnd Cheng Yu replied If they were laden with grain they would lie deep in the waterBut these are light and float easilyThe southeast wind is very strong and if they intend treachery how can we defend ourselves Cao Cao began to understandThen he asked who would go out to stop the approaching fleet and Wen Ping volunteered saying I am well used to the waters Thereupon Wen Ping sprang into a small light craft and sailed out followed by ten cruisers which came at his signalStanding in the prow of his ship Wen Ping called out to those advancing toward them You southern ships are not to approach such are the orders of the Prime MinisterStop there in mid stream The soldiers all yelled to them to lower their sailsThe shout had not died away when a bowstring twanged and Wen Ping rolled down into the ship with an arrow in the left armConfusion reigned on his ship and all the others hurried back to their campWhen the ships were about a mile of distant Huang Gai waved his sword and the leading ships broke forth into fire which under the force of the strong wind soon gained strength and the ships became as fiery arrowsSoon the whole twenty dashed into the naval campAll Cao Caos ships were gathered there and as they were firmly chained together not one could escape from the others and fleeThere was a roar of bombs and fireships came on from all sides at once The face of the three rivers was speedily covered with fire which flew before the wind from one ship to another It seemed as if the universe was filled with flameCao Cao hastened toward the shoreHuang Gai with a few troops at his back leaped into a small boat dashed through the fire and sought Cao CaoCao Cao seeing the imminence of the danger was making for the land Zhang Liao got hold of a small boat into which he helped his master none too soon for the ship was burning They got Cao Cao out of the thick of the fire and dashed for the bankHuang Gai seeing a handsomely robed person get into a small boat guessed it must be Cao Cao and pursued He drew very near and he held his keen blade ready to strike crying out You rebel Do not flee I am Huang Gai Cao Cao howled in the bitterness of his distressZhang Liao fitted an arrow to his bow and aimed at the pursuer shooting at short rangeThe roaring of the gale and the flames kept Huang Gai from hearing the twang of the string and he was wounded in the shoulderHe fell and rolled over into the waterHe fell in peril of water When flames were high Ere cudgel bruises had faded An arrow struckHuang Gais fate will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER Zhuge Liang Foresees The Huarong Valley Episode Guan Yu Lifts His Saber To Release Cao Cao The last chapter closed with Huang Gai in the water wounded Cao Cao rescued from immediate danger and confusion rampant among the soldiersPressing forward to attack the naval camp Han Dang was told by his soldiers that some one was clinging to the rudder of his boat and shouting to him by his familiar nameHan Dang listened carefully and in the voice at once he recognized that Huang Gai was calling to him for helpThat is my friend Huang Gai cried he and they quickly pulled the wounded leader out of the waterThen they saw Huang Gai was wounded for the arrow still stuck Han Dang bit out the shaft of the arrow but the point was deeply buried in the fleshThey hastily pulled off his wet garments and cut out the metal arrowhead with a dagger tore up one of the flags and bound up the wound Then Han Dang gave Huang Gai his own fighting robe to put on and sent him off in a small boat back to campHuang Gais escape from drowning must be taken as proof of his natural affinity for or sympathy with water Although it was the period of great cold and he was heavy with armor when he fell into the river yet he escaped with lifeIn this great battle at the junction of the three rivers the Three Gorges when fire seemed to spread wide over all the wide surface of the water when the earth quaked with the roar of battle when land forces closed in on both wings and four battle squadrons advanced on the front when the ferocity of fire answered the clash of weapons and weapons were aided by fire under the thrusts of spears and the flights of arrows burnt by fire and drowned by water Cao Cao lost an incalculable number of troopsAnd a poet wrote When Wei and Wu together strove For the mastery In the Red Cliffs fight the towering ships Vanished from the sea For there the fierce flames leaping high Burned them utterly So Zhou Yu for his liege lord Got the victoryAnd another poem runs The hills are high the moon shines faintThe waters stretch afar I sigh to think how oft this land Has suffered stress of war And I recall how southerners Shrank from the northern armys might And how a favoring eastern gale Helped them to win the fightWhile fire was consuming the naval base of Cao Cao Gan Ning made Cai Zhong guide him into the innermost recesses of Cao Caos camp Then Gan Ning slew Cai Zhong with one slash of his swordAfter this Gan Ning set fire to the jungle and at this signal Lu Meng put fire to the grass in ten places near to each otherThen other fires were started and the noise of battle was on all sidesCao Cao and Zhang Liao with a small party of horsemen fled through the burning forest They could see no road in front all seemed on firePresently Mao Jie and Wen Ping with a few more horsemen joined themCao Cao bade the soldiers seek a way throughZhang Liao pointed out saying The only suitable road is through the Black Forest And they took itThey had gone but a short distance when they were overtaken by a small party of the enemy and a voice cried Cao Cao stop It was Lu Meng whose ensign soon appeared against the fiery backgroundCao Cao urged his small party of fugitives forward bidding Zhang Liao defend him from Lu MengSoon after Cao Cao saw the light of torches in front and from a gorge there rushed out another forceAnd the leader cried Ling Tong is here Cao Cao was scared his liver and gall both seemed torn from withinBut just then on his half right he saw another company approach and heard a cry Fear not O Prime Minister I am here to rescue you The speaker was Xu Huang and he attacked the pursuers and held them offA move to the north seemed to promise escape but soon they saw a camp on a hill topXu Huang went ahead to reconnoiter and found the officers in command were Cao Caos Generals Ma Yan and Zhang Yi who had once been in the service of Yuan Shao They had three thousand of northern soldiers in campThey had seen the sky redden with the flames but knew not what was afoot so dared make no move This turned out lucky for Cao Cao who now found himself with a fresh forceHe sent Ma Yan and Zhang Yi with a thousand troops to clear the road ahead while the others remained as guard And he felt much more secureThe two went forward but before they had gone very far they heard a shouting and a party of soldiers came out the leader of them shouting I am Gan Ning of Wu Nothing daunted the two leaders but the redoubtable Gan Ning cut down Ma Yan and when his brother warrior Zhang Yi set his spear and dashed forward he too fell beneath a stroke from the fearsome sword of Gan NingBoth leaders dead the soldiers fled to give Cao Cao the bad newsAt this time Cao Cao expected aid from Hefei for he knew not that Sun Quan was barring the roadBut when Sun Quan saw the fires and so knew that his soldiers had won the day he ordered Lu Xun to give the answering signal Taishi Ci seeing this came down and his force joined up with that of Lu Xun and they went against Cao CaoAs for Cao Cao he could only get away toward YilingOn the road Cao Cao fell in with Zhang He and ordered him to protect the retreat Cao Cao pressed on as quickly as possible At the fifth watch he was a long way from the glare and he felt saferHe asked What is this place They told him It is west of the Black Forest and north of Yidu Seeing the thickly crowded trees all about him and the steep hills and narrow passes Cao Cao threw up his head and laughedThose about him asked Why are you Sir so merry And he said I am only laughing at the stupidity of Zhou Yu and the ignorance of Zhuge LiangIf they have only set an ambush there as I would have done why there is no escape Cao Cao had scarcely finished his explanation when from both sides came a deafening roll of drums and flames sprang up to heaven Cao Cao nearly fell off his horsehe was so startledAnd from the side dashed in a troop with Zhao Yun leading who cried I am Zhao Yun and long have I been waiting here Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang and Zhang He to engage this new opponent and he himself rode off into the smoke and fireZhao Yun did not pursue he only captured the banners and Cao Cao escapedThe faint light of dawn showed a great black cloud all around for the southeast wind had not ceasedSuddenly began a heavy downpour of rain wetting every one to the skin but still Cao Cao maintained his headlong flight till the starved faces of the soldiers made a halt imperativeHe told the men to forage in the villages about for grain and the means of making a fireBut when these had been found and they began to cook a meal another pursuing party came along and Cao Cao again was terrifiedHowever these proved to be Li Dian and Xu Chu escorting some of his advisers whom he saw with joyWhen giving the order to advance again Cao Cao asked What places lay ahead They told him There are two roads one was the highway to South Yiling and the other a mountain road to North Yiling Which is the shorter way to Jiangling asked Cao CaoThe best way is to take the south road through Hulu Valley was the reply So Cao Cao gave orders to march that wayBy the time Hulu Valley was reached the soldiers were almost starving and could march no more horses too were worn out Many had fallen by the roadsideA halt was then made food was taken by force from the villagers and as there were still some boilers left they found a dry spot beside the hills where they could rest and cook And there they began to prepare a meal boiling grain and roasting strips of horse fleshThen they took off their wet clothes and spread them to dryThe beasts too were unsaddled and turned out to grazeSeated comfortably in a somewhat open spot Cao Cao suddenly looked up and began to laugh loud and longHis companions remembering the sequel of his last laugh said Not long since Sir you laughed at Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang that resulted in the arrival of Zhao Yun and great loss of troops to usWhy do you now laugh I am laughing again at the ignorance of the same two menIf I were in their place and conducting their campaign I should have had an ambush here just to meet us when we were tired outThen even if we escaped with our lives we should suffer very severelyThey did not see this and therefore I am laughing at them Even at that moment behind them rose a great yell Thoroughly startled Cao Cao threw aside his breastplate and leaped upon his horseMost of the soldiers failed to catch theirs and then fires sprang up on every side and filled the mouth of the valley A force was arrayed before them and at the head was the man of ancient Yan Zhang Fei seated on his steed with his great spear leveled Whither would you flee O rebel shouted heThe soldiers grew cold within at the sight of the terrible warriorXu Chu mounted on a barebacked horse rode up to engage him and Zhang Liao and Xu Huang galloped up to his aidThe three gathered about Zhang Fei and a melee began while Cao Cao made off at top speed The other leaders set off after him and Zhang Fei pursuedHowever Cao Cao by dint of hard riding got away and gradually the pursuers were outdistanced But many had received woundsAs they were going the soldiers said There are two roads before us which shall we take Which is the shorter asked Cao CaoThe high road is the more level but it is fifteen miles longer than the bye road which goes to Huarong ValleyOnly the latter road is narrow and dangerous full of pits and difficult Cao Cao sent men up to the hill tops to look aroundThey returned saying There are several columns of smoke rising from the hills along the bye roadThe high road seems quiet Then Cao Cao bade them lead the way along the bye roadWhere smoke arises there are surely soldiers remarked the officersWhy go this way Because the Book of War says that the hollow is to be regarded as solid and the solid as hollowThat fellow Zhuge Liang is very subtle and has sent people to make those fires so that we should not go that way He has laid an ambush on the high roadI have made up my mind and I will not fall a victim to his wiles O Prime Minister your conclusions are most admirableNone other can equal you said the officersAnd the soldiers were sent along the bye roadThey were very hungry and many almost too weak to travel The horses too were spentSome had been scorched by the flames and they rode forward resting their heads on their whips the wounded struggled on to the last of their strengthAll were soaking wet and all were feebleTheir arms and accouterments were in a deplorable state and more than half had been left upon the road they had traversed Few of the horses had saddles or bridles for in the confusion of pursuit they had been left behindIt was the time of greatest winter cold and the suffering was indescribableNoticing that the leading party had stopped Cao Cao sent to ask the reasonThe messenger returned saying The rain water collected in the pits makes the ground a mire and the horses cannot not move Cao Cao ragedHe said When soldiers come to hills they cut a road when they happen upon streams they bridge them such a thing as mud cannot stay an army So he ordered the weak and wounded to go to the rear and come on as they could while the robust and able were to cut down trees and gather herbage and reeds to fill up the holesAnd it was to be done without delay or death would be the punishment of the disobedient or remissSo the soldiers dismounted and felled trees and cut bamboos and they leveled the roadAnd because of the imminence and fear of pursuit a party of one hundred under Zhang Liao Xu Chu and Xu Huang was told off to hasten the workers and slay any that idledThe soldiers made their way along the shallower parts but many fell and cries of misery were heard the whole length of the wayWhat are you howling for cried Cao Cao The number of your days is fixed by fateAny one who howls shall be put to death The remnant of the army now divided into three one to march slowly a second to fill up the waterways and hollows and a third to escort Cao Cao gradually made its way over the precipitous roadWhen the going improved a little and the path was moderately level Cao Cao turned to look at his following and saw he had barely three hundred soldiers And these lacked clothing and armor and were tattered and disorderedBut he pressed on and when the officers told him the horses were quite spent and must rest he replied Press on to Jingzhou and there we shall find repose So they pressed onBut they had gone only one or two miles when Cao Cao flourished his whip and broke once again into loud laughterWhat is there to laugh at asked the officersPeople say those two Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang are able and crafty I do not see it They are a couple of incapablesIf an ambush had been placed here we should all be prisoners Cao Cao had not finished this speech when the explosion of a bomb broke the silence and a company of five hundred troops with swords in their hands appeared and barred the way The leader was Guan Yu holding his greendragon saber bestriding the RedHareAt this sight the spirits of Cao Caos soldiers left them and they gazed into each others faces in panicNow we have but one course said Cao Cao we must fight to the death How can we said the officersThough the leaders are not scared the horses are spent Cheng Yu said I have always heard that Guan Yu is haughty to the proud but kindly to the humble he despises the strong but is gentle with the weakHe discriminates between love and hate and is always righteous and trueYou O Prime Minister have shown him kindness in the past and if you will remind him of that we shall escape this evil Cao Cao agreed to tryHe rode out to the front bowed low and said General I trust you have enjoyed good health I had orders to await you O Prime Minister replied Guan Yu bowing in return and I have been expecting you these many days You see before you Cao Cao defeated and weakI have reached a sad pass and I trust you O General will not forget the kindness of former days Though indeed you were kind to me in those days yet I slew your enemies for you and relieved the siege of BaimaAs to the business of today I cannot allow private feelings to outweigh public duty Do you remember my six generals slain at the five passesThe noble person values righteousnessYou are well versed in the histories and must recall the action of Yu Gong the archer when he released his master Zi Zhuo for he determined not to use Zis teaching to kill Zi Guan Yu was indeed a very mountain of goodness and could not forget the great kindness he had received at Cao Caos hands and the magnanimity Cao Cao had shown over the deeds at the five passesHe saw the desperate straits to which his benefactor was reduced and tears were very near to the eyes of both He could not press Cao Cao hardHe pulled at the bridle of his steed and turned away saying to his followers Break up the formation From this it was evident that his design was to release Cao Cao who then went on with his officers and when Guan Yu turned to look back they had all passedHe uttered a great shout and Cao Caos soldiers jumped off their horses and knelt on the ground crying for mercy But he also had pity for themThen Zhang Liao whom he knew well came along and was allowed to go free alsoCao Cao his army lost fled to the Huarong Valley There in the throat of the gorge met he Guan YuGrateful was Guan Yu and mindful of former kindness Wherefore slipped he the bolt and freed the imprisoned dragonHaving escaped this danger Cao Cao hastened to get out of the valleyAs the throat opened out he glanced behind him and saw only fortyseven horsemenAs evening fell they reached Jiangling and they came upon an army that they took to be more enemiesCao Cao thought the end had surely come but to his delight they were his own soldiers and he regained all his confidenceCao Ren who was the leader said I heard of your misfortunes my lord but I was afraid to venture far from my charge else I would have met you before I thought I would never see you again said Cao CaoThe fugitives found repose in the city where Zhang Liao soon joined themHe also praised the magnanimity of Guan YuWhen Cao Cao mustered the miserable remnant of his officers he found nearly all were wounded and he bade them restCao Ren poured the wine of consolation whereby his master might forget his sorrowsAnd as Cao Cao drank among his familiars he became exceedingly sadWherefore they said O Prime Minister when you were in the cave of the tiger and trying to escape you showed no sign of sorrow now that you are safe in a city where you have food and the horses have forage where all you have to do is to prepare for revenge suddenly you lose heart and grieve why thus Replied Cao Cao I am thinking of my friend Guo Jia had he been alive he would not have let me suffer this loss He beat his breast and wept saying Alas for Guo JiaI grieve for Guo Jia I sorrow for Guo Jia The reproach shamed the advisersNext day Cao Cao called Cao Ren and said I am going to the capital to prepare another army for revengeYou are to guard this region and in case of necessity I leave with you a sealed plan You are only to open the cover when hardpressed and then you are to act as directedThe South Land will not dare to look this way Who is to guard Hefei and Xiangyang Jingzhou is particularly your care and Xiahou Dun is to hold XiangyangAs Hefei is most important I am sending Zhang Liao thither with good aids of Li Dian and Yue JinIf you get into difficulties send at once to tell me Having made these dispositions Cao Cao set off at once with a few followersHe took with him the officers who had come over to his side when Jingzhou fell into his handsCao Ren placed Cao Hong in charge of YilingAfter having allowed the escape of Cao Cao Guan Yu found his way back to headquartersBy this time the other detachments had returned bringing spoil of horses and weapons and supplies of all kindsOnly Guan Yu came back emptyhanded When he arrived Zhuge Liang was with his brother congratulating him on his successWhen Guan Yu was announced Zhuge Liang got up and went to welcome him bearing a cup of wineO General said Zhuge Liang You have done a deed that overtops the worldYou have removed the empires worst foe and ought to have been met at a distance and felicitated Guan Yu muttered inaudibly and Zhuge Liang continued I hope it is not because we have omitted to welcome you on the road that you seem sad Turning to those about him Zhuge Liang said Why did you not tell us Guan Yu was coming I am here to ask for death said Guan Yu Surely Cao Cao came through the valley Yes he came that way and I could not help it I let him go Then whom have you captured No one Then you remembered the old kindness of Cao Cao and so allowed him to escapeBut your acceptance of the task with its conditions is hereYou will have to suffer the penalty Zhuge Liang called in the lictors and told them to take away Guan Yu and put him to deathGuan Yu risked life when he spared Cao Cao in direst need And agelong admiration gained For kindly deedWhat actually befell will he seen in the next chapter CHAPTER  Cao Ren Fights The South Lands Troops Zhuge Liang Angers Zhou YuGuan Yu would have died there but for his elder brother who said to Zhuge Liang We three pledged ourselves to live and die togetherAlthough my brother Guan Yu has offended I cannot bear to break our oathI hope you will only record this against him and let him atone later for the fault by some specially meritorious service So the sentence was remittedIn the meantime Zhou Yu mustered his officers and called over his soldiers noted the special services of each and sent full reports to his masterThe soldiers who had surrendered were all transported across the river All this done they spread the feast of victory The next step was to attack and capture Nanjun The van of the army camped on the river bankThere were five camps and the CommanderinChiefs tent was in the center He summoned his officers to a councilAt this moment Sun Qian arrived with congratulations from Liu BeiZhou Yu received him and having saluted in proper form Sun Qian said My lord sent me on this special mission to felicitate the General on his great virtue and offer some unworthy gifts Where is Liu Bei asked Zhou YuHe is now encamped at Youkou the mouth of River You Is Zhuge Liang there asked Zhou Yu taken abackBoth are there said Sun QianThen return quickly and I will come in person to thank them The presents handed over Sun Qian was sent back forthwith to his own camp Then Lu Su asked Zhou Yu why he had started when he heard where Liu Bei was campedBecause replied Zhou Yu camping at the mouth of River You means that he has the intention of taking NanjunHaving spent much military energy and spared no expenditure we thought the territory should fall to us easily Those others are opposed to us and they wish to get the advantage of what we have already accomplishedHowever they must remember that I am not dead yet How can you prevent them asked Lu SuI will go myself and speak with themIf all goes well then let it be so in case it does not then I shall immediately settle up with Liu Bei without waiting for Nanjun to be taken I should like to accompany you said Lu SuThe General and his friend started taking with them a guard of three thousand light horseHaving arrived at Youkou they sought out Sun Qian who in turn went in to see Liu Bei and told him Zhou Yu had come to render thanksWhy has he come asked Liu Bei of his Directing Instructor He is not likely to come out of simple politenessSurely he has come in connection with Nanjun But if he brings an army can we stand against it asked Liu BeiWhen he comes you may reply thus and thus Then they drew up the warships in the river and ranged the soldiers upon the bank and when the arrival of Zhou Yu was formally announced Zhao Yun with some horsemen went to welcome himWhen Zhou Yu saw what bold soldiers they looked he began to feel uncomfortable but he went on his wayBeing met at the camp gates by Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang he was taken in to the chief tent where the ceremonies were performed and preparations for a banquet had been madePresently Liu Bei raised his cup in felicitation on the recent victory gained by his guestThe banquet proceeded and after a few more courses Zhou Yu said Of course you are camped here with no other idea than to take Nanjun Liu Bei said We heard you were going to take the place and came to assistShould you not take it then we will occupy it Zhou Yu laughed saying We of the South Land have long wished for this territory Now that it is within our grasp we naturally shall take it Liu Bei said There is always some uncertaintyCao Cao left Cao Ren to guard the region and you may be certain that there is good strategy behind Cao Ren to say nothing of his boldness as a warriorI fear you may not get it Well if we do not take it then Sir you may have it said Zhou YuHere are witnesses to your words said Liu Bei naming Lu Su Zhuge Liang and those at tableI hope you will never repent what you have just said Lu Su stammered and seemed unwilling to be cited as one of the witnesses but Zhou Yu said When the word of a noble person has gone forth it is ended he never regrets This speech of yours Sir is very generous interjected Zhuge LiangThe South Land shall try first but if the place does not fall there is no reason why my lord should not capture it The two visitors then took their leave and rode awayAs soon as they had left Liu Bei turned to Zhuge Liang and said O Master you bade me thus reply to Zhou Yu but though I did so I have turned it over and over in my mind without finding any reason in what I saidI am alone and weak without a single foot of land to call my ownI desired to get possession of Nanjun that I might have at least a temporary shelter yet I have said that Zhou Yu may attack it first and if it falls to the South Land how can I get possession Zhuge Liang laughed and replied First I advised you to attack Jingzhou but you would not listen do you remember But it belonged to Liu Biao and I could not bear to attack it thenNow it belongs to Cao Cao I might do so Do not be anxious replied the adviserLet Zhou Yu go and attack it some day my lord I shall make you sit in the high place thereof But what design have you So and so said Zhuge Liang whisperingLiu Bei was satisfied with the reply and only strengthened his position at YoukouIn the meantime Zhou Yu and Lu Su returned to their own camp and the latter said Why did you tell Liu Bei that he might attack Nanjun I can take it with a flick of my finger replied Zhou Yu but I just manifested a little pretended kindliness Then he inquired among his officers for a volunteer to attack the cityJiang Qin offered himself and was put in command of the vanguard with Xu Sheng and Ding Feng as helpers He was given five thousand of veterans and they moved across the riverZhou Yu promised to follow with supportsOn the other side Cao Ren ordered Cao Hong to guard Yiling and so hold one corner of an oxhorn defenseWhen the news came that the South Lands force had crossed the River Han Cao Ren said We will defend and not offer battle But General Niu Jin said impetuously To let the enemy approach the walls and not offer battle is timidityOur troops lately worsted need heartening and must show their mettleLet me have five hundred of veterans and I will fight to a finish Cao Ren could not withstand this offer and so the five hundred went out of the city At once Ding Feng came to challenge the leader and they fought a few boutsThen Ding Feng pretended to be defeated gave up the fight and retreated into his own linesNiu Jin followed him hardWhen he had got within the South Lands formation at a signal from Ding Feng the army closed round and Niu Jin was surroundedHe pushed right and left but could find no way outSeeing Niu Jin in the toils Cao Ren who had watched the fight from the wall donned his armor and came out of the city at the head of his own bold company of horsemen and burst in among the forces of the South Land to try to rescue his colleagueBeating back Xu Sheng Cao Ren fought his way in and presently rescued Niu JinHowever having got out Cao Ren saw several score of horsemen still in the middle unable to make their way out whereupon he turned again to the battle and dashed in to their rescueThis time he met Jiang Qin on whom Cao Ren and Niu Jin made a violent attackThen the brother Cao Chun came up with supports and the great battle ended in a defeat for the troops of the South LandSo Cao Ren went back victor while the unhappy Jiang Qin returned to report his failureZhou Yu was very angry and would have put to death his hapless subordinate but for the intervention of the other officersThen Zhou Yu prepared for another attack where he himself would leadBut Gan Ning said General do not be in too great hurry let me go first and attack Yiling the supporting angle of the oxhorn formationAfter that the conquest of Nanjun will be easy Zhou Yu accepted the plan and Gan Ning with three thousand troops went to attack YilingWhen news of the approaching army reached him Cao Ren called to his side Chen Jiao who said If Yiling be lost then Nanjun is lost tooSo help must be sent quickly Thereupon Cao Chun and Niu Jin were sent by secret ways to the aid of Cao HongCao Chun sent a messenger to the city to ask that they should cause a diversion by a sortie at the time the reinforcements should arriveSo when Gan Ning drew near Cao Hong went out to meet and engage himThey fought a score of rounds but Cao Hong was overcome at last and Gan Ning took the cityHowever as evening fell the reinforcements under Cao Chun and Niu Jin came up and the captor was surrounded in the city he had taken The scouts went off immediately to tell Zhou Yu of this sudden change of affairs which greatly alarmed himLet us hasten to his rescue said Cheng PuOur place is of the greatest importance said Zhou Yu and I am afraid to leave it undefended lest Cao Ren should attack But Gan Ning is one of our first leaders and must be rescued said Lu MengI should like to go myself to his aid but whom can I leave here in my place said Zhou YuLeave Ling Tong here said Lu Meng I will push on ahead and you can protect my advanceIn less than ten days we shall be singing the paean of victory Are you willing said Zhou Yu to the man who was to act for himLing Tong said If the tenday period is not exceeded I may be able to carry on for that time I am unequal to more than that Ling Tongs consent pleased Zhou Yu who started at once leaving ten thousand troops for the defense of the campLu Meng said to his chief South of Yiling is a littleused road that may prove very useful in an attack on NanjunLet us send a party to fell trees and barricade this road so that horses cannot passIn case of defeat the defeated will take this road and will be compelled to abandon their horses which we shall capture Zhou Yu approved and the men set outWhen the main army drew near Yiling Zhou Yu asked who would try to break through the besiegers and Zhou Tai offered himselfHe girded on his sword mounted his steed and burst straight into the Cao Hongs army He got through to the city wallFrom the city wall Gan Ning saw the approach of his friend Zhou Tai and went out to welcome himZhou Tai told him the CommanderinChief was on the way to his relief and Gan Ning at once bade the defenders prepare from within to support the attack of the rescuersWhen the news of the approach of Zhou Yu had reached Yiling Cao Hong Cao Chun and Niu Jin had sent to tell Cao Ren who was at Nanjun and at the same time they prepared to repel the assailants When the army of the South Land came near they at once attackedSimultaneously Gan Ning and Zhou Tai went out to attack on two sides and the troops of Cao Hong were thrown into confusion The soldiers of the South Land fell on lustily and the three leaders all fled by a bye road but finding the way barred with felled trees and other obstacles they had to abandon their horses and go afootIn this way the troops of the South Land gained some five hundred steedsZhou Yu pressing on as quickly as possible toward Nanjun came upon Cao Ren and his army marching to save YilingThe two armies engaged and fought a battle which lasted till late in the eveningThen both drew off and Cao Ren withdrew into the city During the night he called his officers to a councilThen said Cao Hong The loss of Yiling has brought us to a dangerous pass now it seems the time to open the guideletter of the Prime Minister and see what plans he arranged for our salvation in this peril You but say what I think replied Cao RenWhereupon he tore open the guideletter and read it His face lighted up with joy and he at once issued orders to have the morning meal prepared at the fifth watchAt daylight the whole army moved out of the city through three gates but they left a semblance of occupation in the shape of banners on the wallsZhou Yu went up to the tower of observation and looked over the cityHe saw that the flags along the battlements had no guards behind them and he noticed that all troops carried bundles at their waists behind so that they were ready for a long marchThought Zhou Yu to himself Cao Ren must be prepared for a long march So Zhou Yu went down from the tower of observation and sent out an order for two wings of the army to be readyOne of these was to attack and in case of its success the other was to pursue at full speed till the clanging of the gongs should call them to returnHe took command of the leading force in person and Cheng Pu commanded the other Thus they advanced to attack the city The armies being arrayed facing each other the drums rolled out across the plainCao Hong rode forth and challenged and Zhou Yu from his place by the standard bade Han Dang respondThe two champions fought near two score bouts and then Cao Hong fledThereupon Cao Ren came out to help him and Zhou Tai rode out at full speed to meet himThese two exchanged a half score passes and then Cao Ren tiedCao Rens army fell into confusionThereupon Zhou Yu gave the signal for the advance of both his wings and the forces of Cao Ren were sore smitten and defeatedZhou Yu pursued to the city wall but Cao Rens troops did not enter the city Instead they went away northwestHan Dang and Zhou Tai pressed them hardZhou Yu seeing the city gates standing wide open and no guards upon the walls ordered the raiding of the cityA few score horsemen rode in first Zhou Yu followed and whipping his steedAs he galloped into the enclosure around the gate Chen Jiao stood on the defense tower When he saw Zhou Yu enter in his heart he applauded the godlike perspicacity of the Prime Minister Cao Cao Then was heard the clapclap of a watchmans rattleAt this signal the archers and crossbowmen let fly and the arrows and bolts flew forth in a sudden fierce shower while those who had won their way to the van of the inrush went headlong into a deep trenchZhou Yu managed to pull up in time but turning to escape he was wounded in the left side and fell to the groundNiu Jin rushed out from the city to capture the chief but Xu Sheng and Ding Feng at the risk of their lives got him away safeThen the troops of Cao Ren dashed out of the city and wrought confusion among the troops of the South Land who trampled each other down and many more fell into the trenchesCheng Pu tried to draw off but Cao Ren and Cao Hong came toward him from different directions and the battle went hardly against the soldiers of Zhou Yu till help came from Ling Tong who bore back their assailantsSatisfied with their success Cao Ren led his forces into the city while the losers marched back to their own campZhou Yu sorely wounded was taken to his own tent and the army physician called in With iron forceps he extracted the sharp bolt and dressed the wound with a lotion designed to counteract the poison of the metal But the pain was intense and the patient rejected all nourishmentThe physician said The missile had been poisoned and the wound will require a long time to heal You General must be kept quiet and especially free from any irritation which will cause the wound to reopen Thereupon Cheng Pu gave orders that each division was to remain in campThree days later Niu Jin came within sight and challenged the men of the South Land to battle but they did not stir The enemy hurled at them taunts and insults till the sun had fallen low in the sky but it was of no avail and Niu Jin withdrewNext day Niu Jin returned and repeated his insulting abuseCheng Pu dared not tell the wounded generalThe third day waxing bolder the enemy came to the very gates of the stockade the leader shouting that he had come for the purpose of capturing Zhou Yu Then Cheng Pu called together his officers and they discussed the feasibility of retirement into the South Land that they might seek the opinion of Sun QuanIll as he was Zhou Yu still retained control of the expeditionHe knew that the enemy came daily to the gates of his camp and reviled him although none of his officers told himOne day Cao Ren came in person and there was much rolling of drums and shoutingCheng Pu however steadily refused to accept the challenge and would not let any one go outThen Zhou Yu summoned the officers to his bedside and said What mean the drums and the shouting The soldiers are drilling was the replyWhy do you deceive me said Zhou Yu angrilyDo I not know that our enemies come day by day to our gates and insult usYet Cheng Pu suffers this in silence and makes no use of his powers and authority He sent for Cheng Pu and when he arrived asked him why he acted thusBecause you are ill and the physician said you were on no account to be provoked to angerWherefore although the enemy challenged us to battle I kept it from you And if you do not fight what think you should be done said Zhou YuAnd they all said they desired to return to the South Land till he had recovered from his wound when they would make another expeditionZhou Yu lay and listened Suddenly he sprang up crying The noble person who has eaten of his lords bounty should die in his lords battles to return to ones home dead and wrapped in a horses hide is a happy fateAm I the sort of people to bring to nought the grand designs of my country So speaking he proceeded to gird on his armor and he mounted his horseThe wonder of the officers only redoubled when their General placed himself at the head of some hundreds of horsemen and went out of the camp gates toward the enemy then fully arrayedCao Ren their general stood beneath the great standard At sight of the opponents Cao Ren flourished his whip and began to hurl abuse at them Zhou Yu you babe I think your fate has met you You dare not face my army The stream of insult never ceased Presently Zhou Yu could stand it no longerRiding out to the front he cried Here I am base churl look at me The whole Cao Rens army were taken abackBut Cao Ren turned to those about him and said Let us all revile him And the whole army yelled insultsZhou Yu grew angry and sent Pan Zhang out to fightBut before he had delivered his first blow Zhou Yu suddenly uttered a loud cry and he fell to the ground with blood gushing from his mouth At this Cao Rens army rushed to the battle and the army of the South Land pressed forward to meet them A fierce struggle waged around the Generals body but he was borne off safely and taken to his tentDo you feel better asked Cheng Pu anxiouslyIt was a ruse of mine whispered Zhou Yu in replyBut what avails it I am not suffering but I did that to make our enemies think I was very ill and so oppose them by deceitI will send a few trusty men to pretend desertion and tell them I am deadThat will cause them to try a night raid on the camp and we shall have an ambush ready for them We shall get Cao Ren easily The plan seems excellent said Cheng PuSoon from the tent there arose the sound of wailing as for the deadThe soldiers around took up the cry and said one to another The General is dead of his wound and they all put on the symbols of mourning Meanwhile Cao Ren was consulting with his officers Said he Zhou Yu lost his temper and that has caused his wound to reopen and brought on that flow of bloodYou saw him fall to the ground and he will assuredly die soon Just then there came in one who said that a few men had come over from the enemy asking to be allowed to join the army of Cao Ren among them were two of Cao Caos men who had been made prisonersCao Ren sent for the deserters and questioned themThey told him saying Zhou Yus wound reopened at his anger and he died in the camp that day The leaders are all clothing in white and in mourningWe desert because we have been put to shame by the second in command Pleased at this news Cao Ren at once began to arrange to make a night attack on the camp and if possible get the head of the dead general to send to the capitalSuccess depends upon promptitude so act without delay said Chen JiaoNiu Jin was told off as Van Leader Cao Ren himself led the center while the rear was commanded by Cao Hong and Cao Chun Chen Jiao and a small force were left to guard NanjunAt the first watch they left the city and took the way toward Zhou Yus campWhen they drew near not a soldier was visible in the camp but flags and banners and spears were all there evidently to keep up an appearance of preparationFeeling at once that they had been tricked they turned to retreatBut a bomb exploded and this was the signal for an attack on all four sides Han Dang and Jiang Qin pressed in from the east Zhou Tai and Pan Zhang from the west Chen Wu and Lu Meng from the north and Xu Sheng and Ding Feng from the southThe result was a severe defeat for the raiders and the army of Cao Ren was entirely broken and scattered abroad so that no one part of the beaten army could aid the otherCao Ren with a few horsemen got out of the press and presently met Cao Hong The two leaders ran away together and by the fifth watch they had got near Nanjun Then they heard a beating of drums and Ling Tong appeared barring the wayThere was a small skirmish and Cao Ren went off at an angle But he fell in with Gan Ning who attacked him vigorouslyCao Ren dared not go back to Nanjun but he made for Xiangyang along the main road The forces of the South Land pursued him for a time and then desistedZhou Yu and Cheng Pu then made their way to Nanjun where they were startled to see flags on the walls and every sign of occupationBefore they had recovered from their surprise there appeared one who cried Pardon General I had orders from the Directing Instructor to take this cityI am Zhao Yun of Changshan Zhou Yu was fiercely angry and gave orders to assault the city but the defenders sent down flights and flights of arrows and his troops could not stay near the rampart So he withdrew and took counselIn the meantime he decided to send Gan Ning with a force of several thousand to capture Jingzhou City and Ling Tong with another army to take XiangyangNanjun could be taken laterBut even as these orders were being given the scouts came in hurriedly to report saying After Nanjun fell Zhuge Liang suddenly forging a military commission induced the guards of Jingzhou to leave it and go to the rescue of Cao RenWhereupon Zhang Fei occupied the town Soon after another messenger came saying Xiahou Dun at Xiangyang received from Zhuge Liang dispatches supported by a commission in due form saying that Cao Ren was in danger and needed help whereupon Xiahou Dun marched off and Guan Yu seized that city Thus the two cities that Zhou Yu wanted had fallen without the least effort into the hands of his rival Liu BeiHow did Zhuge Liang get this military commission with which he has imposed on the generals asked Zhou YuCheng Pu replied He seized that of Chen Jiao and so has got all this region into his power Zhou Yu uttered a great cry for at that moment his wound had suddenly burst openA city falls but not to us the gain The guerdon is anothers ours the painThe next chapter will say what befell Zhou Yu CHAPTER Zhuge Liang Negotiates With Lu Su Zhao Yun Captures Guiyang Zhou Yus anger at seeing that his rival Zhuge Liang had surprised Nanjun and at hearing the same news of Jingzhou and Xiangyang was but naturalAnd this sudden fit of rage caused his wound to reopen However he soon recoveredAll his officers besought him to accept the situation but he said What but the death of that bumpkin Zhuge Liang will assuage my angerIf Cheng Pu can but aid me in an attack on Nanjun I can certainly restore it to my country Soon Lu Su came in to whom Zhou Yu said I simply must fight Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang till it is decided which shall have the upper hand I must also recapture the cityPerhaps you can assist me It cannot be done replied Lu SuWe are now at grips with Cao Cao and victory or defeat is undecidedOur lord has not been successful in overcoming HefeiDo not fight near home or it will be like people of the same household destroying each other and should Cao Cao take advantage of this position to make a sudden descent we should be in a parlous conditionFurther you must remember that Liu Bei and Cao Cao are united by the bonds of old friendship if the pressure becomes too great Liu Bei may relinquish these cities offer them to Cao Cao and join forces with him to attack our countryThat would be a real misfortune I cannot help being angry said Zhou Yu to think that we should have used our resources for their benefitThey get all the advantage Well let me go and see Liu Bei and talk reason to himIf I can arrive at no understanding then attack at once Excellent proposal cried all presentSo Lu Su with his escort went away to Nanjun to carry out his proposal and try to arrange matters He reached the city wall and summoned the gate whereat Zhao Yun came out to speak with himI have something to say to Liu Bei said he I wish to see him My lord and Zhuge Liang are in Jingzhou was the replyLu Su turned away and hasted to Jingzhou He found the walls bedecked with flags and everything in excellent orderIn his heart he admired the sight and thought what an able person was the commander of that armyThe guards reported his arrival and Zhuge Liang ordered them to throw wide the gateLu Su was led to the government house and after the usual exchange of salutes Zhuge Liang and his visitor took their respective seatsHaving finished the tea Lu Su said My master Marquis Sun Quan and the commander of his army Zhou Yu have sent me to lay before the Imperial Uncle their views When Cao Cao led his huge host southward he gave out that it was for the conquest of the South Land really his intention was to destroy Liu BeiHappily our army was able to repulse that mighty host and so saved himWherefore Jingzhou with its nine territories of fortyone counties ought to belong to usBut by a treacherous move your master has occupied Jingzhou and Xiangyang so that we have spent our treasure in vain and our armies have fought to no purpose The Imperial Uncle has reaped the benefits to the fullThis is not as it should be Zhuge Liang replied Lu Su you are a man of high intelligence why do you hold such languageYou know the saying that all things turn to their ownerThese places have never belonged to the South Land but were of the patrimony of Liu Biao and though he is dead his son remainsShould not the uncle assist the nephew to recover his ownCould my master have refrained  If the nephew Liu Qi the rightful heir had occupied these cities there would have been something to sayBut he is at Jiangxia and not here Would you like to see him said Zhuge LiangAt the same time he ordered the servants to request Liu Qi to comeThereupon Liu Qi at once appeared supported by two attendantsAddressing Lu Su he said I am too weak to perform the correct ceremonies I pray you pardon me Lu Su Lu Su said not a word he was too much taken abackHowever he recovered himself presently and said But if the heir had not been here what then The heir is living but from day to day should he go thenthere will be something to talk about Should he die then you ought to return these cities to us You state the exact facts said Zhuge LiangThen a banquet was prepared and that over Lu Su took his leave He hastened back to his own camp and gave Zhou Yu an account of his missionBut what is there for us in the chance of Liu Qis death said Zhou Yu He is in his very first youthWhen will these places fall to us Rest content General let me guarantee the return of these places But how can you asked Zhou YuLiu Qi has indulged too freely in wine and women he is a wreck and rotten to the core miserably emaciated and panting for breath I will not give him half a years lifeThen I will go to Liu Bei and he will be unable to deny the request But Zhou Yu was still unmollifiedSuddenly came a messenger from Sun Quan who said Our lord is laying siege to Hefei but in several battles has had no victoryHe now orders you to withdraw from here and go to Hefei to help him Thereupon Zhou Yu marched back to Chaisang Having reached home he began to give attention to the recovery of his healthHe sent Cheng Pu with the marine and land forces to Hefei ready for Sun Quans call Liu Bei was exceedingly well satisfied with the possession of his new region and his thoughts turned to more ambitious schemesThen a certain man came to him to suggest a planThis man was Yi Ji and remembering the kindly feeling of other days Liu Bei received him most graciouslyWhen Yi Ji was seated and his host had asked what he proposed he said You wish for a plan to accomplish yet greater deeds why not seek wise people and ask them Where are these wise people to be found asked Liu BeiYi Ji replied In this region there is a certain family named Ma five brothers all of whom are known as men of ability The youngest is called Ma SuThe ablest is Ma Liang who has white hairs in his eyebrows and the villagers have a little rhyming couplet that means There are five sons in the family Ma but white eyebrows is the best of them You should get this man to draw up a plan for you So Liu Bei told them to request his presenceMa Liang came and was received with great respectHe was asked to suggest a plan for the security of the newly acquired region and he said Attacked as it is on all sides this region is not one in which one is permanently secureYou should let Liu Qi remain here till he is recovered from his present illness the actual protection of the place being left in the hands of trusty friends Obtain an edict appointing him Imperial Protector of Jingzhou and the people will be contentThen conquer Wuling Changsha Guiyang and Lingling and with the resources you will thus acquire you will have the means for further plansThat should be your policy Which of the four territories should be first taken asked Liu BeiThe nearest Lingling which lies in the west of River XiangThe next is Wuling and after these the other two Ma Liang was given an appointment as Imperial Protector Assistant with Yi Ji as his secondThen Liu Bei consulted Zhuge Liang about sending Liu Qi to Xiangyang so that Guan Yu could be free to return Next they made preparations to attack Lingling and Zhang Fei was to lead the vanZhao Yun was to guard the rear while Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were to command the main bodyA fifteen thousand troops were left to hold JingzhouMi Zhu and Liu Feng were left to guard JianglingThe Governor of Lingling was Liu Du When danger thus threatened he called in his son Liu Xian and they discussed the caseThe son was very selfconfident and said to his father Have no anxietyThey may have the known and famous warriors Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun but we have our leader Xing Darong who is match for any number of menHe can withstand them So Liu Xian with the famous leader was entrusted with the defense At the head of a full ten thousand troops they made a camp about ten miles from the city with the shelter of hills and a riverTheir scouts brought news that Zhuge Liang was close at hand with one armyXing Darong decided to check his advance and went forth to oppose him When both sides were arrayed Xing Darong rode to the front In his hand he held a battleax called Cleaver of MountainsIn a mighty voice he cried Rebels how comes it that you have dared to enter our territory From the center of the opposing army where appeared a cluster of yellow flags there came out a small fourwheeled carriage in which sat very erect a certain man dressed in white with a turban on his head In one hand he held a feather fan with which he signed to the warrior to approachAt the same time he said I am Zhuge Liang of Nanyang whose plans broke up the countless legions of Cao Cao so that nothing of them returned whence they startedHow then can you hope to oppose meI now offer you peace and it will be well for you to surrender Xing Darong laughed derisively saying Their defeat was owing to the plan of Zhou Yu you had nothing to do with itHow dare you try to deceive me So saying he swung up his battleax and came running toward Zhuge LiangBut Zhuge Liang turned his carriage and retired within the lines which closed up behind him Xing Darong came rushing onAs he reached the array the troops fell away on both sides and let him enter Well within he looked round for his chief opponentSeeing a yellow flag moving along quietly he concluded that Zhuge Liang was with it and so followed itWhen the flag had gone over the shoulder of a hill it stopped Then suddenly as if the earth had opened and swallowed it up the fourwheeled carriage disappeared while in its place came a ferocious warrior with a long octaneserpent halberd in his hand and mounted on a curvetting steed It was Zhang Fei who dashed at Xing Darong with a tremendous roarNothing daunted Xing Darong whirled up his battleax and went to meet Zhang FeiBut after four or five bouts Xing Darong saw that there was no chance of victory for him so he turned his horse and ran Zhang Fei pursued the air shaking with the thunder of his voice Then the ambushing troops appearedXing Darong nothing daunted rushed into their midst But in front appeared another warrior barring the way who called out Do you know me I am Zhao Yun of Changshan Xing Darong knew that all was over he could neither fight nor fly So he dismounted and gave in He was fettered and taken to camp where were Liu Bei and Zhuge LiangLiu Bei ordered him out to execution but Zhuge Liang hastily checked himWe will accept your submission if you capture Liu Xian for us said Zhuge LiangThe captive accepted the offer without the least hesitation and when Zhuge Liang asked how he intended to do it he replied If you will set me free I shall be cunning of speechIf you raid the camp this evening you will find me your helper on the insideI will make Liu Xian a prisoner and will hand him over to you He being captured his father will surrender at once Liu Bei doubted the good faith of the man but Zhuge Liang said Xing Darong is not deceiving Wherefore Xing Darong was set free and went back to camp where he related all that had occurred What can we do asked Liu XianWe can meet trick with trickPut soldiers in ambush tonight outside our camp while within everything will appear as usual When Zhuge Liang comes we shall capture him The ambush was preparedAt the second watch an army came out of the darkness and appeared in the gate Each carried a torch and they began to set fire to all about themOut dashed Liu Xian and Xing Darong and the incendiaries forthwith fledThe two warriors pursued them but the fugitives ran and then suddenly disappeared at about three miles from the camp Much surprised the two turned to wend their way back to their own camp It was still burning for no one had extinguished the flames Soon from behind them came out Zhang FeiLiu Xian called out to his companion saying Do not enter the burning camp but to go to attack Zhuge Liangs stockade Thereupon they turned again but at a distance of three miles Zhao Yun and an army suddenly debouched upon their roadZhao Yun attacked and slew Xing Darong by a spear thrustLiu Xian turned to flee but Zhang Fei was close upon him and made him prisoner He was thrown across a horse bound and taken to campWhen he saw Zhuge Liang Liu Xian said The ruse was Xing Darongs evil counsel I was forced to follow Zhuge Liang ordered them to loose his bonds had him properly dressed and gave him wine to cheer him and help him forget his troubles When he was recovered he was told to go to his father and persuade him to yieldAnd if he does not the city shall be destroyed and every one put to death said Zhuge Liang as Liu Xian left The son returned to the city and told his father these thingsLiu Du at once decided to yield and forthwith hoisted the flag of surrender opened the gates and went out taking his seal of office with himHe was reappointed to his governorship but his son was sent to Jingzhou for service with the armyThe people of Lingling all rejoiced greatly at the change of rulersLiu Bei entered the city calmed and reassured the people and rewarded his army But he at once began to think of the next move and asked for an officer to volunteer to take GuiyangZhao Yun offered but Zhang Fei vehemently proposed himself for the command of the expeditionSo they wrangled and contendedThen said Zhuge Liang Undoubtedly Zhao Yun was first to volunteer wherefore he is to go Still Zhang Fei opposed and insisted on goingThey were told to decide the dispute by drawing lots and Zhao Yun drew the winning lot Zhang Fei was still very angry and grumbled I would not have wanted any helpersjust three thousand soldiers and I would have done it I also only want three thousand soldiers said Zhao YunAnd if I fail I am willing to suffer the penalties Zhuge Liang was pleased that Zhao Yun recognized his responsibility so fully and with the commission gave Zhao Yun three thousand of veteransThough the matter was thus settled Zhang Fei was discontented and pressed his claim till Liu Bei bade him desist and retireWith his three thousand troops Zhao Yun took the road to GuiyangThe Governor Zhao Fan soon heard of his approach and hastily called his officers to take counselTwo of them Chen Ying and Bao Long offered to meet the invaders and turn them backThese two warriors belonged to Guiyang and had made themselves famous as hunters Chen Ying used a Flying Fork and Bao Long could draw a bow with such force that he had been known to send an arrow through two tigers So strong were they as well as boldThey stood before Zhao Fan and said We will lead the way against Liu Bei The Governor replied I know that Liu Bei is of the imperial family and Zhuge Liang is exceedingly resourceful Guan Yu and Zhang Fei are very boldBut the commander of this force is Zhao Yun who on one occasion faced a hundred legions of Cao Cao and never blenchedOur small force here cannot stand against such peopleWe shall have to yield Let me go out to fight said Chen YingIf I cannot capture Zhao Yun then you can yield The Governor could not resist him and gave his consentThen Chen Ying with three thousand troops went forth and soon the two armies came within sight of each otherWhen Chen Yings army was drawn up he girded on his flying fork and rode to the front Zhao Yun gripped his spear and rode to meet himZhao Yun began to rail at Chen Ying saying My master is the brother of Liu Biao to whom belonged this land Now he is supporting his nephew the heir and son of Liu Biao Having taken Jingzhou I am come to soothe and comfort the people hereWhy then do you oppose me We are supporters of the Prime Minister Cao Cao and are no followers of your master was the replyZhao Yun waxing angry firmly grasped his spear and rode forward His opponent twirled the flying fork and advancedThe horses met but after four or five encounters Chen Ying realizing that there was no hope of victory turned and fledZhao Yun followedSuddenly turning Chen Ying got close to Zhao Yun and flung the fork Zhao Yun deftly caught it and threw it backChen Ying dodged away but Zhao Yun soon caught him up seized dragged him out of the saddle and threw him to the ground Then Zhao Yun called up his soldiers and they bound the prisonerChen Ying was taken to the camp while his troops scattered and fledI thought you would not dare a combat with me said Zhao Yun to the prisoner when they had returned to campHowever I am not going to put you to death You are freeBut persuade your master to yield Chen Ying asked pardon put his hands over his head and fled like a frightened rat When he reached his city he told the Governor all these thingsMy original desire was to yield but you insisted on fighting and this is what it has brought you to So spoke the Governor He bade Chen Ying begone and then prepared his letter of submission and put up his sealWith a small party Zhao Fan went out of the city and wended his way to Zhao Yuns camp Zhao Yun received him graciously offered him wine and then accepted the seal of office After the wine had gone round several times Zhao Fan became talkative saying General your surname is the same as mine and five centuries ago we were one family You are from Changshan and so am I Moreover we are from the same villageIf you do not mind we might swear brotherhoodI should be very happy Zhao Yun was pleased and they compared agesThey were of the same yearHowever Zhao Yun was the elder by four months and so Zhao Fan made his bow as younger brotherThe two men having so many things in common were very pleased with each other and seemed fitted to be close friendsAt eventide the feast broke up and the late Governor returned to his dwellingNext day Zhao Fan requested Zhao Yun to enter the city where after Zhao Yun had assured the people of their safety he went to a banquet at the state residenceWhen they had become mellow with wine the Governor invited Zhao Yun into the inner quarters where wine was again servedWhen Zhao Yun was a little intoxicated his host bade a woman come forth and offer a cup of wine to the guestThe woman was dressed entirely in white silk and her beauty was such as to overthrow cities and ruin states Who is she asked Zhao YunMy sisterinlaw she is of the Fan family Zhao Yun at once changed his look and treated her with deferenceWhen she had offered the cup the host told her to be seated and join the party but Zhao Yun declined this addition to the evening and the lady withdrewWhy did you trouble your sisterinlaw to present wine to me Brother asked Zhao YunThere is a reason said the host smiling I pray you let me tell you My brother died three years ago and left her a widow But this cannot be regarded as the end of the storyI have often advised her to marry again but she said she would only do so if three conditions were satisfied in one mans personThe suitor must be famous for literary grace and warlike exploits secondly handsome and highly esteemed and thirdly of the same name as our ownNow where in all the world was such a combination likely to be foundYet here are you Brother dignified handsome and prepossessing a man whose name is known all over the wide world and of the desired name You exactly fulfill my sisters ambitionsIf you do not find her too plain I should like her to marry you and I will provide a dowryWhat think you of such an alliance such a bond of relationship But Zhao Yun rose in anger shouting As I have just sworn brotherhood with you is not your sisterinlaw my sisterinlawHow could you think of bringing such confusion into the relationship Shame suffused Zhao Fans face and he said I only thought of being kind to you why are you so very rude to me Zhao Fan looked right and left to his attendants with murder in his eyeZhao Yun raised his fist and knocked him down Then he strode out of the place mounted and rode out of the city Zhao Fan at once called in his two generalsChen Ying said He has gone away in a rage which means that we shall have to fight him I greatly fear you will lose said Zhao Fan We will pretend to be deserters said Bao Long and so get among his soldiersWhen you challenge him we will suddenly catch him We shall have to take some others with us said Chen YingFive hundred troops will be ample said Bao LongSo in the night the two men and their followers ran over to Zhao Yuns camp to desertZhao Yun understood the trick they would play but he called them in and they said When Zhao Fan tempted you with that fair lady he wanted to make you drunk and get you into the private apartments so that he might murder you and send your head to Cao Cao Yes he was as wicked as that evenWe saw you go away in anger and we thought that would mean grave trouble for us and so we have deserted Zhao Yun listened with simulated joy and he had wine served to the two men and pressed them to drink so that they were quite overcomeWhen this was done he had both bound with cords called up their followers and asked them whether this was real or pretended desertion and they told him the truthThen he gave the soldiers wine and said Those who wanted to harm me are your leaders and not youIf you do as I tell you you shall be well rewarded The soldiers threw themselves to the ground and promised obedienceThereupon the two leadersChen Ying and Bao Longwere beheadedTheir five hundred troops were made to lead the way and act as screen for a whole thousand of horsemen and the party set out at full speed for GuiyangWhen they got there they summoned the gate and said that they had slain Zhao Yun and had got back And they wished to speak with the GovernorThose on the wall lighted flares and inspected those at the gate Surely enough they wore the uniforms of their own people and Zhao Fan went out to them He was immediately seized and made prisonerThen Zhao Yun entered the city restored order and sent off swift messengers to Liu Bei who at once with his adviser came to GuiyangWhen they had taken their seats the late Governor was brought in and placed at the foot of the stepsIn response to Zhuge Liangs questions Zhao Fan related the history of the proposed marriageSaid Zhuge Liang to Zhao Yun But this seems a fine project why did you receive the proposal so roughly Zhao Yun said Zhao Fan and I had just sworn brotherhood and so marriage with his sisterinlaw would have called down on my head universal blame That is one reasonAnother is that I should have made his sister fail to keep her dutiful chastityAnd thirdly I did not know whether I might trust such a proposal from one who had just yielded to forceMy lord your position as a recent victor was one of danger and could I risk the failure of your plans for the sake of a woman Liu Bei said But now that the plan has been carried out and we are victors would you care to marry her There are other women in the world All my fear is for the building of a reputation What is a family to me You are indeed right honorable said Liu BeiZhao Fan was released and restored to the governorship Zhao Yun was conspicuously rewarded But Zhang Fei was angry and disappointedSo Zhao Yun gets all the praise and I am worth nothing cried heJust give me three thousand soldiers and I will take Wuling and bring you the Governor This pleased Zhuge Liang who said There is no reason why you should not go but I will only require one condition of you Wondrous the plans of the general so doth he conquer in battle Soldiers keenly competing gain renown in the fightingThe condition that Zhuge Liang made will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER Guan Yu Releases Huang Zhong Sun Quan Fights With Zhang Liao What Zhuge Liang required from Zhang Fei was a formal recognition of responsibility for successSaid Zhuge Liang When Zhao Yun went on his expedition he gave written guarantee of being responsible for success and you ought to do the same now that you are starting for WulingIn that case you may have men and start So Zhang Fei gave the required document and received joyfully the three thousand of soldiers he had demanded He set out at once and traveled without rest till he reached WulingWhen the Governor of Wuling Jin Xuan by name heard that an expedition against him was afoot he mustered his officers and recruited brave soldiers and put his weapons in order ready for the struggle And his army moved out of the cityA certain secretary Gong Zhi remonstrated with his chief for opposing a scion of the imperial house saying Liu Bei is of the Hans and recognized as an uncle of the Emperor All the world knows he is kindly and righteousAdded to that his brother Zhang Fei is extraordinarily boldWe cannot face them in battle with hope of successOur best course is to give in But his master angrily replied Do you want to play the traitor and take the side of the rebels and help them Jin Xuan called in the lictors and told them to put Gong Zhi to deathThe other officers interceded for Gong Zhi saying It augers ill to start an expedition by slaying your own officer So the Governor merely sent Gong Zhi sway He himself led the army out of the city After marching seven miles he met with Zhang Feis army Zhang Fei at once rode to the front spear ready to thrust and opened with a shoutJin Xuan turned to his officers and asked who would go out to fight him but no one replied they were too afraidSo the Governor himself galloped out flourishing his sword Seeing him advance Zhang Fei shouted in a voice of thunder Poor Jin Xuan was seized with panic turned pale and could not go on He turned his steed and fled Then Zhang Fei and his army went in pursuit and smote the fugitives chasing them to the city wallHere the fugitives were greeted by a flight of arrows from their own wall Greatly frightened Jin Xuan looked up to see what this meant and there was Gong Zhi who had opposed him standing on the wall You brought defeat upon yourself because you opposed the will of God cried the traitor I and the people with me are determined to yield to Liu Bei Just as Gong Zhi finished speaking an arrow wounded Jin Xuan in the face and he fell to the groundThereupon his own troops cut off his head which they forthwith presented to Zhang FeiGong Zhi then went out and made formal submission and Zhang Fei bade him take his letter and the seal to Guiyang to Liu Bei who was pleased to hear of Zhang Feis success and gave the governorship to Gong Zhi Soon after Liu Bei came to Wuling in person and soothed the peopleThis done he wrote to Guan Yu telling him Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei had gained a territory eachGuan Yu at once wrote back and said Changsha is yet to be taken and if I am not thought too feeble I would like to be sent to attack it Liu Bei agreed and sent Zhang Fei to relieved his brother whom Liu Bei ordered to return and prepare for an expedition to ChangshaGuan Yu came and went in to see his elder brother and Zhuge LiangAt this interview Zhuge Liang said Zhao Yun has taken Guiyang and Zhang Fei Wuling Both successful warriors have done their work with three thousand troopsThe Governor of Changsha Han Xuan was not worth mentioning but there was a certain general with him named Huang Zhong who had to be reckoned with Huang Zhong is a native of NanyangHe used to be in the service of Liu Biao and was a colleague Liu Biaos nephew Liu Pan when he was in command of Changsha After Liu Biaos death he joined Han Xuan when he took command of the cityNow although he is nearly sixty he is a man to be feared and a warrior of a thousandYou ought to take a larger number of troops Guan Yu replied Instructor what makes you damp another mans ardor to fight and do away with your own dignity I do not think the old leader need be discussed and I do not think I require three companies of soldiersGive me my own five hundred of swordsmen and I will have the heads of both Han Xuan and Huang Zhong to sacrifice to our standard Liu Bei resisted this decision of Guan Yu but Guan Yu would not give wayHe just took his five hundred and set out If he is not careful how he attacks Huang Zhong there will be a mishap said Zhuge LiangYou must go to support him Liu Bei accordingly at the head of another and larger party set out toward ChangshaGovernor Han Xuan of Changsha was of hasty temperament with small compunction in matters of life and death and was universally hatedWhen he heard of the army coming against him he called his veteran leader Huang Zhong to ask adviceThe latter said Do not be distressed this sword of mine and my bow are equal to the slaughter of all who may come Huang Zhong had been very strong and could bend the threehundredpound bow and was a most perfect archerWhen Huang Zhong referred to his prowess a certain man spoke up and said Let not the veteran General go out to battleTrust to my right arm and you shall have this Guan Yu a prisoner in your hands The speaker was General Yang LingThe Governor accepted his offer and told off a thousand troops to go with him and they quickly rode out of the cityAbout fifteen miles from the city they observed a great cloud of dust approaching and soon distinguished the invadersYang Ling set his spear and rode to the front to abuse and fightGuan Yu made no reply to the abuse but rode forward flourishing his swordThe warriors soon met and in the third encounter Yang Ling was cut downGuan Yus army dashed forward and pursued the defeated force to the city wallWhen the Governor heard of this reverse he ordered the veteran Huang Zhong to go out while he went up on the city wall to watch the fightHuang Zhong took his sword and crossed the drawbridge of Changsha at the head of his forceGuan Yu seeing an old leader riding out knew it must be Huang Zhong Guan Yu halted his troops and placed them in line with their swords at the point Then sitting there on horseback he said He who comes is surely Huang Zhong eh Since you know me how dare you come within my boundaries replied the veteranI have come expressly to get your head Then the combat beganThey fought a hundred and more bouts and neither seemed nearer victoryAt this point the Governor fearing some mishap to his veteran general beat the gong to retreat and the battle ceased one side going into the city of Changsha and the other camping three miles away to the rear Guan Yu thought in his heart that the fame of the veteran opposed to him was well merited He had fought a hundred bouts and discovered never a weak spotHe determined that in the next encounter he would use a swinginghorse stab and so overcome Huang ZhongNext day the early meal eaten Guan Yu came to the city wall and offered his challengeThe Governor seated himself on the city wall and bade his veteran warrior go out to accept itAt the head of a few horsemen Huang Zhong dashed across the drawbridgeThe two champions engaged and at the end of half a hundred bouts neither had the advantage On both sides the soldiers cheered lustilyWhen the drums were beating most furiously suddenly Guan Yu wheeled round his horse and fledOf course Huang Zhong followedJust as the moment for the feint arrived Guan Yu heard behind him a tremendous crash and turned to see his pursuer lying prone upon the groundHuang Zhongs steed had stumbled and thrown himGuan Yu turned raised his sword in both hands and cried in a fierce tone I spare your life but quickGet another horse and come again to battle Huang Zhong pulled his horse to its feet hastily leapt upon its back and went into the city at full speedThe Governor was astonished and asked for an account of the accident The horse is too old replied Huang ZhongWhy did you not shoot since your aim is so perfect asked the Governor I will try again tomorrow said Huang ZhongThen I will run away as if overcome and so tempt him to the drawbridge and then shoot him Han Xuan gave the veteran a gray horse that he usually rode himself Huang Zhong thanked him and retiredBut Huang Zhong could not forget Guan Yus generous conduct nor could he understand it He could not make up his mind to shoot the man who had spared his lifeYet if he did not shoot he betrayed his duty as a soldierIt was very perplexing and the whole night spent in thinking it over found him still undecidedAt daybreak a man came in saying that Guan Yu was near the wall and challenging them againSo Huang Zhong gave order to go outNow Guan Yu having fought for two days and not having overcome Huang Zhong was very ill at easeSo he called up all his dignity when he went forth to fight that day When they had got to the thirtieth bout Huang Zhong fled as if he was overcome Guan Yu pursuedAs he rode away Huang Zhong thought in his heart He spared me only yesterday and I cannot bear to shoot him today Putting up his sword Huang Zhong took his bow and twanged the string only no arrow flew Guan Yu dodged but seeing no arrow in the air he retook the pursuitAgain Huang Zhong twanged an arrowless bowstring and again Guan Yu dodged but no arrow cameThen Guan Yu said to himself He cannot shoot and pressed on in pursuitAs they neared the city wall the veteran stopped on the drawbridge fitted an arrow pulled the bow and sent an arrow flying that just hit the base of the plume on Guan Yus helmetThe soldiers shouted at the display of marksmanship Guan Yu was taken aback and set off for camp with the arrow still stickingThen he heard that Huang Zhongs skill was said to be equal to piercing a willow leaf at a hundred paces and Guan Yu understood that he owed this warning in the shape of an arrow in his plume to gratitude for sparing the veteran the preceding day Both withdrewBut when the veteran leader went up on the wall to see the Governor he was at once seizedWhat have I done cried Huang ZhongI have seen these last three days that you were fooling me you were slack the day before yesterday which proved you had some sinister intentionYesterday when your horse stumbled and he spared you it showed that you were in league with himAnd today you twice twanged a vain bowstring while at the third shot you only hit your opponents helmet Dare you say there is no secret understanding in all thisIf I do not put you to death it will assuredly redound to my own hurt Han Xuan ordered Huang Zhong to be executed outside the city gateHan Xuan also met the intercession of the officers by saying Any one who pleads for the condemned shall be regarded as in the plot The executioners had hustled the old man out of the city and the sword was in the air and on the point of descending when a man suddenly dashed in cut down the lictor and rescued Huang Zhong Huang Zhong is our bulwark shouted he to destroy him is to destroy the Changsha peopleThis Governor is too fierce and cruel too lightly values good people and is too arrogant toward his officersWe ought rather to kill him and those who will let them follow me All eyes turned toward this bold speaker who was bronzed and had eyes like the Cowherds star Some of them knew him as Wei Yan a native of YiyangHe would have followed Liu Bei from Xiangyang but unable to come up with him had gone into the service of Han XuanHan Xuan took exception to his arrogant carriage and lack of polish and neglected him And so Wei Yan had remained in the city without officeAfter the rescue of Huang Zhong Wei Yan called upon the people to make an end of the Governor He waved his arm and shouted to the people Soon he had a following of several hundredsHuang Zhong could not stop them In a very short time Wei Yan had dashed up on the wall and Han Xuan lay deadTaking his head Wei Yan rode off out of the city to lay the bloodstained trophy at the feet of Guan Yu who forthwith went into the city to restore confidenceWhen the people were all quiet Guan Yu sent to request Huang Zhong to come to see him but the old general pleaded illnessNext Guan Yu sent the good news to his brother and to Zhuge Liang and asked them to comeSoon after Guan Yu had left to capture Changsha Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang had followed him up with supports in case of needWhile on the march a black flag was furled backwards and a crow flew over from north to south croaking thrice as it passedWhat good or evil things do these omens presage asked Liu BeiWith hands hidden within his long sleeves Zhuge Liang performed a rapid calculation on his fingers of the auspices and replied Changsha is taken and a great leader mastered We shall know soon after noon Sure enough a simple soldier presently came galloping along with the welcome tidings of the capture of the city and saying that the two city warriors who had aided them were near waiting the arrival of Liu BeiSoon after they arrived Liu Bei entered the city where he was escorted to the magistracy and heard the recital of Huang Zhongs deedsLiu Bei went in person to Huang Zhongs house and inquired for him whereupon Huang Zhong came forth and yielded formallyHuang Zhong requested to be permitted to bury the remains of the late Governor on the east of the cityLofty as is heaven above earth was the spirit of the general Who even in his old age suffered sorrows in the south Cheerfully had he approached death with no thought of resentment But bowing before the conqueror he hung his head and was ashamedPraise the sword gleaming snowwhite and the glory of superhuman bravery Consider the mailclad steed snuffing the wind and rejoicing in the battle That warriors name shall stand high and its brightness be undiminished While the cold moon sheds her light on the waters of River XiangLiu Bei was generous toward the veteran leader who had come under his bannerBut when Wei Yan was introduced Zhuge Liang suddenly ordered him to be thrust forth and put to death He has merit he has committed no fault exclaimed Liu BeiWhy slay him But Zhuge Liang replied Ingratitude to eat a mans bread and slay him is most disloyal to live on his land and offer his territory to another is most wrongHe will certainly turn against his new masterWherefore it is well to put him to death and prevent him from doing harm If we slay this man others who may wish to surrender will be deterred by the dangerI pray you forgive him Zhuge Liang pointed his finger at Wei Yan and said You are pardonedYou would do well to be perfectly faithful to your lord as well as grateful Do not let a single thought stray elsewhere or I will have your head by fair means or foul Wei Yan made a low obeisanceHaving given in with good grace Huang Zhong introduced a nephew of Liu Biao named Liu Pan then living in Yuxian near by Liu Bei gave Liu Pan the governorship of ChangshaAll being tranquil at the four territories Liu Bei and his army returned to Jingzhou City The name of Youkou was changed to Gongan and soon all was prosperousAble people from all sides came to assist in the administration Guards were placed at strategic pointsWhen Zhou Yu went to Chaisang to recover from his wound he left Gan Ning in command at Baling and Ling Tong at Hanyang The fleet was shared between these two places to be ready to move when requiredThe remainder of the force was under Cheng Pu and he went to Hefei where Sun Quan had been since the fight at the Red Cliffs Sun Quan was still fighting the northern army and in half a score encounters small and great neither had gained a decided advantageSun Quan could not approach the city but entrenched himself about fifteen miles awayWhen Sun Quan heard of the coming of reinforcements of Cheng Pu he was very pleased and went in person to meet and welcome the leadersLu Su was in advance of the main body and Sun Quan dismounted and stood by the roadside to greet himAs soon as he saw this Lu Su slid out of the saddle and made his obeisanceBut the officers were amazed at the attitude of Sun Quan and still more so when Sun Quan asked Lu Su to remount and ride by his sidePresently Sun Quan said secretly to Lu Su I the Lone One dismounted to greet you as you saw was that manifestation enough for you No replied Lu SuThen what further can I do I want to see your authority and virtue spread over the four seas and enfold the nine regions and you yourself playing your part as emperorThen will my name be inscribed in the annals and I shall indeed be known Sun Quan clapped his hands and laughed gleefullyWhen they reached the camp a banquet was prepared and the services of the new arrivals were praised and glorifiedThe destruction of Hefei was one day under discussion when one came in to say that Zhang Liao had sent a written challenge to battle Sun Quan tore open the cover and what he read therein made him very wrathThis Zhang Liao has insulted me grossly said heHe hears that Cheng Pu has arrived and sends a challengeTomorrow O newlycome warriors you shall see me fight with himYou shall have no share in the battle Orders were given that next morning the army would move out of camp and advance on HefeiEarly in the morning when they had advanced about halfway they met the army of Cao Cao and prepared for battleSun Quan with helmet of gold and breastplate of silver rode to the front with Song Qian and Jia Hua each armed with a halberd to support him and guard him one on each sideWhen the third roll of the drum ceased the center of Cao Caos army opened to allow the exit of three warriors all fully armed They were Zhang Liao supported by Li Dian and Yue JinZhang Liao the central figure especially designated Sun Quan as the object of his challengeSun Quan took his spear and was about to accept the challenge from when the ranks behind him came out Taishi Ci who galloped forth with his spear ready to thrustZhang Liao whirled up his sword to strike the newcomer and the two fought near a hundred bouts without a decisive blowThen said Li Dian to Yue Jin He there opposite us with the golden helm is Sun Quan could we but capture him the loss of our eight hundred thirty thousand soldiers at the Red Cliffs would be amply avenged So speaking Yue Jin rode out alone just one man and one sword and went sidelong toward the two combatants Then suddenly swift as a flash of lightning he ran forward and slashed at Sun Quan But Sun Quans two guards were too quick for himUp went the two halberds of Song Qian and Jia Hua guarding their lords headThe blow fell but on the crossed halberds which were shorn through near the head and in another moment they were hammering away on the head of Yue Jins steed with the shafts of their broken weapons and forcing it backSong Qian snatched a spear from a soldier near and went in pursuit of Yue Jin but Li Dian on the other side fitted an arrow to his bow and aimed at Song Qians heart from behindAnd Song Qian fell as the bowstring twangedThen Taishi Ci seeing his colleague fell left off the fight with Zhang Liao and returned to his own lineAt this Zhang Liao fell on in a swift attack and the army of Sun Quan thrown into confusion scattered and fledZhang Liao having distinguished Sun Quan in the distance galloped in pursuit and had nearly come up with him when Cheng Pu happily rushed in from one side of the line of fight stayed the pursuit and saved his masterZhang Liao withdrew to HefeiSun Quan was escorted back to his main camp where his beaten soldiers gradually rejoined him and their ranks were reformedWhen Sun Quan knew of the death of Song Qian he was greatly pained and wept aloudBut Zhang Hong the adviser reproached him saying My lord you relied too much upon your martial prowess and lightly engaged in battle with a formidable enemy Every person in the army was chilled with fear and you lost a general and some of your bannersIt is not for you to exhibit prowess on the actual battlefield and encroach upon the duties of a generalRather curb and repress such physical feats as those ancient Xia Yu and Meng Ben and contemplate schemes of exercising princely virtues with the hegemony of all the feudal statesIt is because of your illregulated action in engaging in battle that Song Qian perished at the hands of your enemiesHereafter you should regard as most important your personal safety Yes it is indeed a fault said Sun QuanI will reform Soon after Taishi Ci entered the tent and said In my command there is a certain Ge Ding brother of a groom in the army of Zhang Liao This servant is deeply resentful on account of a punishment inflicted upon him and is anxious to be revenged He has sent over to say that he will show a signal tonight when he has assassinated Zhang Liao in revenge for the death of your late leader Song QianI wish to take some troops over to await this signal to attack Where is Ge Ding asked Sun QuanGe Ding has mingled with the enemy and gone into the cityLet me have five thousand soldiers Zhuge Jin said Zhang Liao is full of guile I think you will find him prepared for your comingBe careful As Taishi Ci urged his chief to let him go and Sun Quan was deeply hurt by the death of his leader the permission was given and the force startedNow here it must be said that Taishi Ci and this Ge Ding were natives of the same placeGe Ding had made his way into the city without detection found his brother and the two had arranged their plotGe Ding also told him saying Taishi Ci will come over tonight to help us what need to be done now His brother the groom said As the troops of Sun Quan are far away I fear they cannot be here tonight so we will make a huge bonfire of straw and then you can rush out and cry treachery That will throw all into confusion and will give a chance to kill Zhang Liao This is an excellent plan said Ge DingNow after the victory Zhang Liao returned to the city and rewarded his soldiers but he issued orders that no one was to doff his armor or sleepHis attendants said You have gained a great victory today and the enemy are far awayYou might doff your armor and get some repose But Zhang Liao replied That is not the way of a leaderA victory is no reason for rejoicing nor should a defeat cause sadnessIf those of the South Land suspect that I am unprepared they will attack and we must be ready to repel themBe ready tonight and be doubly careful Scarcely had he said this than a fire started and cries of Treachery aroseMany rushed to tell the leader who went out and called together his guard of about half a score They took up a commanding position in the wayThose about him said The shouts are insistent you ought to go and see what it means A whole city cannot be traitors said Zhang LiaoSome discontented person has frightened the soldiersIf I see any one doing so I will slay him Soon after this Li Dian dragged up Ge Ding and his fellow traitorAfter a few brief questions they were beheadedThen arose a great noise shouting and the rolling of drums was heard outside the gate That means the troops of South Land are there to help said Zhang LiaoBut we will destroy them by a simple ruse He bade them light torches and yell Treachery Rebellion and throw open the city gates and let down the drawbridgeWhen Taishi Ci saw the gates swing open he thought his scheme was going well and in full confidence rode in at the gateBut just at the entrance a signal bomb suddenly exploded and the enemy arrows came down on him like pelting rain Then he knew he had fallen into a snare and turned to ride out But he was wounded in many places And in the pursuit that followed more than half the troops under Taishi Ci were cut offAs he drew near his own lines a rescue force led by Lu Xun and Dong Xi came to his aid and the Cao Caos soldiers ceased from pursuitSun Quan was exceedingly sad when he learned that his faithful general had been grievously wounded and when Zhang Zhao prayed him to cease from war Sun Quan was contentThey gathered in their soldiers to their ships and sailed to Nanxu and Runzhou where they camped Meanwhile Taishi Ci was dyingWhen his lord went to ask how he fared he cried When a worthy person is born into a turbulent world he has to be a soldier and gird on a threespan sword to step on the mountains to mend the sky I have not rendered great serviceWhy must I die before I have attained my desire These were his last words he was fortyone years of ageSingle minded and perfectly loyal Such was Taishi Ci in Donglai Far distant frontiers rang with his exploits Riding or archery all humans he excelled One in Bohai who admired his valor Cared for his mother while he was fighting How he roared in the battle at ShentingDying he spoke as a hero All through the ages people sigh for his fateSun Quan was exceedingly grieved when this second of his leaders died He gave orders to bury his remains most honorably outside the north wall of Nanxu on Beigu Hill and took his son Taishi Heng into his own palace to be brought upIn Jingzhou when Liu Bei heard of the series of misfortunes that had befallen Sun Quan and of his retirement to Nanxu he and Zhuge Liang discussed their plansSaid Zhuge Liang I was studying the sky and saw a falling star in the northwestThe imperial family is to suffer a loss Zhuge Liang had scarcely said this when they brought news of the death of Liu Qi son of Liu Biao Liu Bei at once began to wail bitterlyBut his adviser said to him Life and death are beyond our control wherefore weep not my lord for grief harms the body Rather consider what is necessary to be doneSend some one to assume control and make arrangements for the interment Who can go asked Liu BeiNo other than Guan Yu So they sent Guan Yu to guard the city of Xiangyang Liu Bei at once began to feel troubled about his promise to surrender Jingzhou on the death of Liu Qi Zhuge Liang did not consider this a matter of momentZhuge Liang said I will have somewhat to say to any one who comes to ask fulfillment of the promise In half a month it was announced that Lu Su would come to mourn at the funeralTo claim the promise one will come But they will send him empty homeWhat reply Zhuge Liang made may be read in the next chapter CHAPTER  The Dowager Marchioness Sees Her SonInLaw At A Temple The Imperial Uncle Takes A Worthy ConsortLiu Bei and Zhuge Liang went out of the city to welcome the envoy of the South Land and led him to the guesthouseAfter the usual greetings Lu Su said Hearing of the death of your nephew my lord Sun Quan has prepared some gifts and sent me to take his place at the funeral sacrificesGeneral Zhou Yu also sends regards to the Imperial Uncle and to you Master Zhuge Liang Both rose at once and thanked him for the courtesyThen the gifts were handed over and a banquet prepared and while it was in progress the guest brought up the real object of his visitYou said Sir that Jingzhou should be returned to us after the death of Liu QiNow that that event has happened rendition becomes due and I should be glad to know when the transfer can take place We will discuss that later in the meantime let us go on with our wine said Liu Bei So the feasting continued Some time later Lu Su returned to the subject but this time his host remained silentHowever Zhuge Liang changing color said Lu Su you are unreasonable You could not wait till some other has to explain this matter to youFrom the very foundation of the empire by our illustrious ancestor the great heritage has descended in due course till today when unhappily evil doers have risen among the powerful and they have seized upon such portions as they couldBut with Gods favor and help unity is nearly restoredMy lord is a scion of the Imperial House a great great grandson of Emperor Myers Now as the Emperors Uncle should he not have a share of the empireMoreover Liu Biao was my lords elder brother and there is certainly nothing extraordinary in one brothers succession to anothers estate What is your masterThe son of a petty official on the banks of the River Qiantang absolutely without merit so far as the state is concernedJust because he is powerful he holds actual possession of six territories and eightyone counties which has whetted his insatiable appetite till he now desires to swallow the whole empireThe land is the estate of the Liu family and my lord who is of that name has no share thereof while your master whose name is Sun would dispute with and even fight himBeside at the battle at the Red Cliffs my lord did good service and acquired great merit while his commanders risked their lives Was it solely the strength of your southern soldiers that won that fightHad I not brought that southeast wind that meant so much for Zhou Yu could he have done anythingHad the South Land been conquered it is needless to say that the two paramount beauties would now be gracing the Bronze Bird Palace and as for yourself and other officers insignificant though your families be could you have been sure to surviveJust now my lord did not reply because he was willing to believe rather that a scholar of your abilities would understand without a detailed explanation and I trust now that you will This speech absolutely shut the guests mouth for a time and he said no word in replyBut after an interval he said What you say Zhuge Liang I think is devoid of reason and means much unpleasantness for me What unpleasantness asked Zhuge LiangThe guest replied When Liu Bei was in serious straits at Dangyang I conducted you across the river and introduced you to my lordI opposed Zhou Yu when he was going to capture Jingzhou and then it came to agreement that the place was to be ours when the young man died And I pledged myself to thatNow how can I go back and say you break your promiseBoth my lord and Zhou Yu will hold me guiltyI would not mind death so much but I fear that my master will be very wrathful and make war on the Imperial Uncle who will have no place of refuge and he will look ridiculous in the eyes of the world for no reason Replied Zhuge Liang I care not for Cao Cao with his million troops and the Emperor in name at his back and do you think I fear such a youngster as Zhou YuHowever as it may cause you some loss of consideration I will try to persuade my master to put the matter in writing and give you a paper to the effect that he is temporarily occupying Jingzhou as a base and when he can obtain possession of some other city this shall be returned to you What think you the South Land would say to this Wait till what other place was obtained said Lu SuMy master can scarcely think of attacking the Middle Land yet but Liu Zhang in Yiazhou is ignorant and weak and my master will attack himIf he gets the western region then this place will be given up to you Lu Su had no alternative and accepted the offerLiu Bei with his own hand wrote the pledge and sealed itZhuge Liang being named as guarantor also signed the documentSince I belong to this side of the compact and one can hardly have a guarantor of the same party I would trouble you Lu Su also to sign It will look better when you reach the South Land again said Zhuge LiangLu Su said I know that your master is perfectly honorable and will adhere to the bargain And so Lu Su signedThen he received the document in formal style and took his departureHe was sent off with every mark of great respect both Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang attending him to his boatThere the Directing Instructor delivered him a last exhortation When you see your master speak discreetly and explain fully so as not to create a bad impressionIf he rejects our document we may get angry and we will take his whole countryThe one thing now is for our two houses to live in harmony and not give our common enemy Cao Cao an opportunity against us Lu Su went down into his shipHe reached Chaisang and there saw Zhou Yu who said Well how did you speed with your demand for Jingzhou Here is the document said Lu Su giving it to Zhou Yu to readYou have been victimized by Zhuge Liang said Zhou Yu stamping his foot with irritationIn name it may be temporary occupation but in fact it is humbugThey say the place is to be returned when they get the west Who knows when that will beSuppose ten years then it will be ten years before they give us JingzhouWhat is the use of such a document as this And you are a guarantor of its due performanceIf they do not give us the city you get into trouble Suppose our lord finds you in the wrong what then Lu Su was dumbfoundedWhen he had somewhat recovered his selfpossession he said I think Liu Bei will be true to me You my friend are simple and sincere Liu Bei is a scoundrel adventurer and Zhuge Liang is a slippery customer They and you are utterly different What then is to be done cried Lu Su distressfullyYou are my dear friend and your kindness in freely offering your store of grain to relieve my army is still fresh in my memory Of course I will save youDo not be anxious but wait a few days till we get news of what is doing on the north of the river and then we can decide upon a plan Lu Su passed some very uneasy daysThen the scouts came back saying that in Jingzhou everything seemed in excellent order and the white flags were flying everywhere while outside the city they were building a magnificent mausoleum for Lady Gan wife of Liu Bei All the soldiers were in mourning When Zhou Yu knew who was dead he said to Lu Su My scheme is madeYou will see Liu Bei just stand still to be bound and we shall get Jingzhou like turning a hand What is the main spring of your plan said Lu SuLiu Bei will want to remarry and our lord has a sister Princess Sun RenShe is a veritable amazon whose women guards number many hundreds all armed with weapons of war Her apartments also are full of such thingsI will write to our lord to send an intermediary to arrange that the lady shall wed Liu Bei at her family home and thus we shall entice Liu Bei to NanxuBut instead of marrying a wife Liu Bei will find himself a prisoner and then we will demand Jingzhou as ransomWhen they have handed over the region I shall find something else to say and nothing will fall on your head Lu Su was very gratefulThen Zhou Yu wrote letters to his master and a swift boat was chosen to take Lu Su to see the Marquis of Wu After the lending of Jingzhou had been discussed Lu Su presented the document given him by Liu Bei What is the use of such nonsense as this said Sun Quan when he had read itThere is another letter from General Zhou Yu and he says that if you will employ his scheme you can recover Jingzhou replied Lu SuHaving read that letter Sun Quan was more pleased and began to consider who was the best person to sendSuddenly he cried I have it Lu Fan is the man to send Sun Quan called Lu Fan and said to him I have just heard that Liu Bei has lost his wifeI have a sister whom I should like to marry to him and so make a bond of union between our two houses Thus we should be united against Cao Cao and in support of the House of HanYou are the one man to be intermediary and I hope you will go to Jingzhou and see to this Under these orders Lu Fan at once began to prepare his ships for the voyage and soon startedLiu Bei was greatly distressed at the death of Lady Gan fretting for her day and nightOne day when he was talking with his adviser they announced the arrival of Lu Fan who had come on a mission from the South LandOne of Zhou Yus devices said Zhuge Liang smiling and it is all on account of this regionI will just retire behind the screen and listenBut you my lord agree to whatever the messenger proposesThen let the messenger be taken to the guesthouse while we arrange what is to be done So the envoy was introducedBows having been exchanged host and guest being seated in due order and the tea drunk Liu Bei opened the interviewYou must have some commands for me Sir since you come thus News has just been received that you O Imperial Uncle have just been bereaved of your consort I venture to hope you would not object to an advantageous match and I have come to propose oneAre you disposed to listen To lose ones wife in middle age is truly a great misfortune said Liu BeiWhile her body is still warm I cannot listen to proposals for another marriage Lu Fan said A man without a wife is like a house without a ridge pole At your age one should not live an incomplete lifeI am come on the part of Marquis Sun Quan who has a sister beautiful as she is accomplished and well fitted to be a mate for youShould the two families become allied as formerly were Qin and Jin then that ruffian Cao Cao would never dare so much as look this waySuch an alliance would be to the benefit of both our houses and of the state I hope O Imperial Uncle that you will fairly consider the proposalHowever since the young girls mother is dotingly fond of her the mother does not wish her to go far away and so I must ask you to come into our country for the wedding Does the Marquis know of your coming How dare I come without his knowledge I am no longer young said Liu Bei I am fifty and grizzledThis fair damsel the sister of the Marquis is now in the flower of her youth and no mate for me Although the damsel is a woman yet in mind she surpasses many a man and she has said she will never wed any one who is unknown to fameNow Sir you are renowned throughout the four seas Marriage with you would be the chaste maiden mating with the born gentlemanOf what consequence is the difference in age Sir stay here awhile and I will give you a reply tomorrow said Liu BeiSo that day the envoy was entertained at a banquet and then conducted to the guesthouse to repose while late as it was Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang discussed their plansI knew what he had come about said the adviserWhile he was talking I consulted the oracle and obtained an excellent sign Wherefore you may accept the proposal and send Sun Qian back with this envoy to arrange the details When the promise has been ratified we will choose a day and you shall go to complete the ceremony How can I thus go into enemy territoryZhou Yu has wanted to slay me for a long time Let Zhou Yu employ all his ruses think you he can get beyond meLet me act for you and his calculations will always fail halfwayOnce Sun Quans sister is in your power there will be no fear for Jingzhou Still Liu Bei doubted in his mindHowever Sun Qian was sent to the South Land with definite instructions and traveled thither with Lu FanAt the interview Sun Quan said I wish my sister could induce Liu Bei to live here with usHe would come to no harm Sun Qian took his leave and returning to Jingzhou he told the bridegroom elect saying Sun Quans sole desire is for our lord to go over and complete the marriage However Liu Bei feared and would not goZhuge Liang said I have prepared three plans but I need Zhao Yun to carry them outHe will be sent as your guard So Zhuge Liang called in Zhao Yun gave him three silken bags and whispered in his ear saying Here are three schemes enclosed in three bagsWhen you escort our lord to the South Land you will take these with you and act as they direct Zhao Yun hid the three silken bags in his breast so that they should be at hand when required Zhuge Liang next sent the wedding gifts and when these had been received the preliminaries were settledIt was then the early winter of the fourteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  and the bridegroom elect his escort and the intermediary left the city of Jingzhou with a fleet of ten fast ships to sail down the river to Nanxu Zhuge Liang remained to guard and rule the region But Liu Bei was far from feeling comfortable They arrived and the ships were made fastThis done the time had come for the first of the silken bags to be openedAnd so it was and thereupon Zhao Yun gave each of his five hundred guards his instructions and they went their several ways Next Zhao Yun told Liu Bei what he was to do to pay his visit first to the State Patriarch Qiao who was the fatherinlaw of Sun Ce and of Zhou Yu The State Patriarch Qiao resided in Nanxu and to his house leading sheep and bearing wine jars went the bridegroom electHaving made his obeisance Liu Bei explained that as Lu Fan had arranged he had come to marry a wifeIn the meantime the five hundred guards all in gala dress had scattered over the city place buying all sorts of things as they said for the wedding of Liu Bei with the daughter of the Sun House They spread the news far and wide and the whole town talked about itWhen Sun Quan heard of Liu Beis arrival he bade Lu Fan wait upon him and take him to the guesthouseMeanwhile the State Patriarch Qiao went to the Dowager Marchioness mother of Sun Quan to congratulate her on the happy eventWhat happy event ejaculated the old lady The betrothal of your beloved daughter to Liu BeiAnd he has arrived too as surely you know My poor old self does not know said the Dowager I have heard nothing of all this She at once summoned her son and also sent her servants out into the town to see what was going about They quickly returned to say The whole city know of the coming wedding and the bridegroom is now at the guesthouseMoreover he has come with a large escort and they are spending freely buying pork and mutton and fruits all in readiness for the wedding feastingLu Fan and Sun Qian are the intermediaries on each side and they are in the guesthouse too The Dowager Marchioness was terribly taken aback and upset so that when Sun Quan arrived he found his mother beating her breast and weeping bitterlyWhat has disturbed you Mother asked he What you have just done said sheYou have treated me as a nonentityWhen my elder sister lay dying what did she tell you Sun Quan began to be frightened but he said boldly Please speak out plainly Mother what is this great sorrow When a son is grown he takes a wife and when a girl is old enough she goes to her husband And that is right and properBut I am the mother and you ought to have told me that your sister was to become the wife of Liu Bei Why did you keep me in the darkIt was my place to promise her in marriage Whence comes this story said the Marquis really much frightenedDo you pretend ignoranceThere is not a soul in the city who does not knowBut you have succeeded in keeping me in the dark I heard it several days ago said the State Patriarch Qiao And I came just now to offer my felicitations There is no such thing said Sun QuanIt is just one of the ruses of Zhou Yu to get hold of Jingzhou He has used this means to inveigle Liu Bei here and hold him captive till Jingzhou is restored to usAnd if they will not give it back then Liu Bei will be put to deathThat is the plotThere is no real marriage But the Dowager was in a rage and vented her wrath in abusing Zhou Yu She said Zhou Yu is a pretty sort of governor over the six territories and eightyone counties if he cannot find any means of recovering one region except making use of my child as a decoyTruly this is a fine deed to spoil the whole of my childs life and condemn her to perpetual widowhood because he wants to use the fair damsel ruse to slay a manWho will ever come to talk of marriage with her after this Said the State Patriarch Qiao By this means you may indeed recover Jingzhou but you will be a shameful laughing stock to all the worldWhat can be done Sun Quan had nothing to say he could only hang his head while the Dowager abused his generalThe State Patriarch Qiao tried to soothe her saying After all Liu Bei the Imperial Uncle is a scion of the reigning family You can do nothing better now than to welcome him as a soninlaw and not let this ugly story get abroad I am afraid their ages do not match interposed Sun QuanLiu Bei is a very famous man said the State Patriarch QiaoThere can be no shame in having such a soninlaw I have never seen him said the DowagerArrange that I may get a look at him tomorrow at the Sweet Dew Temple If he displeases me you may work your will on himBut if I am satisfied with him then I shall simply let the girl marry him Now Sun Quan was above all things filial and at once agreed to what his mother saidHe went out called in Lu Fan and told him to arrange a banquet for the morrow at the temple so that the Dowager Marchioness might see the bridegroomWhy not order Jia Hua to station some men in the wings of the templeThen if the Dowager be not pleased we can call them out and fall upon him said Lu Fan Accordingly the ambush was prepared and five hundred ruffians posted to act as the Dowagers attitude might determineWhen the State Patriarch Qiao took his leave and had reached his house he sent to tell Liu Bei saying Tomorrow the Marquis and the Dowager Marchioness wished to see you So be careful Liu Bei and his faithful henchman discussed their plansZhao Yun said The morrow bodes rather ill than wellHowever your escort shall be there Next day the Dowager Marchioness and the State Patriarch Qiao went to the Temple of Sweet Dew as had been arrangedSun Quan came with a number of his strategists and when all were assembled Lu Fan was sent to the guesthouse to request Liu Bei to comeHe obeyed the summons but as a precaution he put on a light coat of mail under his brocaded robe His followers too took their swords upon their backs and followed closeHe mounted his steed and the cavalcade set out for the templeAt the door of the temple he met Sun Quan on whom the visitors brave demeanor was not lostAfter they had exchanged salutations Sun Quan led Liu Bei into the presence of his mother Just the soninlaw for me said the Dowager delighted with the appearance of Liu BeiHe has the air of an emperor and a look like the sun remarked the State Patriarch QiaoWhen one remembers also that his fair fame has spread over the whole earth you may well be congratulated on getting such a noble soninlaw Liu Bei bowed in acknowledgment of his receptionSoon after they were all seated at the banquet in the temple Zhao Yun entered and took his place beside Liu BeiWho is this asked the DowagerThis is Zhao Yun of Changshan Then he must be the hero of Dangyang who saved the little Liu Shan Yes this is he replied Liu BeiA fine general said the Dowager and she gave him winePresently Zhao Yun said to his master I have seen a lot of armed ruffians hidden away in the purlieus of the templeThey can be there for no good and you should ask the Dowager to get them sent away Thereupon Liu Bei knelt at the feet of the Dowager and weeping said If you would slay me let it be here Why do you say this asked sheBecause there are assassins in hiding in the wings of the temple what are they there for if not to kill me The Dowager wrathfully turned on Sun Quan What are armed men doing there today when Liu Bei is to become my soninlaw and the pair are my son and daughter Sun Quan said he did not know and sent Lu Fan to inquireLu Fan put the blame on Jia HuaThe Dowager summoned him and upbraided him severely He had nothing to say and she told them to put him to deathBut Liu Bei interceded saying The generals death will do me harm and make it hard for me to stay at your side The State Patriarch Qiao also interceded and she only ordered the general out of her presenceHis subordinates also scattered and ran like frightened ratsBy and bye strolling out of the banquet room into the temple grounds Liu Bei came to a boulderDrawing his sword he looked up to heaven and prayed saying If I am to return to Jingzhou and achieve my intent to become a chief ruler then may I cleave this boulder asunder with my sword but if I am to meet my doom in this place then may the sword fail to cut this stone Raising his sword he smote the boulderSparks flew in all directions and the boulder lay split in twainIt happened that Sun Quan had seen the blow and he said Why do you thus hate that stone Liu Bei replied I am near my fifth decade and have so far failed to rid the state of evil I greatly regret my failureNow I have been accepted by the Dowager as her soninlaw and this is a critical moment in my lifeSo I implored of Heaven a portent that I might destroy Cao Cao as I would that boulder and restore the dynasty You saw what happened That is only to blind me thought Sun QuanDrawing his own sword he said And I also ask of Heaven an omen that if I am to destroy Cao Cao I may also cut this rock So he spokeBut in his secret heart he prayed If I am to recover Jingzhou and extend my borders may the stone be cut in twain He smote the stone and it split in twainAnd to this day there are cross cuts in the stone which is still preserved One who saw this relic wrote a poemThe shining blades fell and the rock was shorn through The metal rang clear and the sparks widely flewThus fate then declared for the dynasties two And the tripartite rule there beganBoth put up their swords and returned hand in hand to the banquet hallAfter some more courses Sun Qian gave his master a warning look and Liu Bei said I pray you excuse me as my drinking powers are very small Wherefore Sun Quan escorted him to the gateAs they walked down looking at high land and rolling river spreading in glorious panorama before their eyes Liu Bei exclaimed Really this is the finest scene in the whole world  These words are recorded on a tablet in the Temple of the Sweet Dew and one who read them wrote a poemFrom the riverside hills the rain clears off And the black clouds roll away And this is the place of joy and mirth And never can sorrow stayAnd here two heroes of ages past Decided their parts to play And the lofty heights flung back wind and wave Then as they do todayYes they stood both entranced by the beautiful scene And gradually along the vast river the wind whipped the waves into snowy foam and raised them high toward heavenAnd in the midst of the waves appeared a tiny leaf of a boat riding over the waves as if all was perfect calmThe northern people are riders and the southern people sailors it is said quite true sighed Liu BeiSun Quan hearing this remark took it as a reproach to his horsemanshipBidding his servants lead up his steed Sun Quan leaped into the saddle and set off full gallop down the hill Then wheeling he came up again at the same speed So the southerners cannot ride eh said Sun Quan laughingNot to be outdone Liu Bei lifted the skirts of his robe jumped upon his horse and repeated the featThe two steeds stood side by side on the declivity the riders flourishing their whips and laughingThence forward that hillside was known as the Slope Where the Horses Stood and a poem was written about itTheir galloping steeds were of noble breed And both of spirit high And the riders twain from the hillcrest gazed At the river rolling by One of them mastered the western mountainsOne ruled by the eastern sea And the hill to this very day Still is the Slope Where the Horses StoodWhen they rode side by side into Nanxu the people met them with acclamationsLiu Bei made his way to the guesthouse and there sought advice from Sun Qian as to the date of the weddingSun Qian advised It should be fixed as early as possible so that no further complications could arise So next day Liu Bei went to the State Patriarch Qiao and told him in plain words Many the people of the place mean harm to me and I cannot stay here longI must return soon Do not be anxious said the State Patriarch QiaoI will tell the Dowager Marchioness and she will protect you Liu Bei bowed to express his thanksThe State Patriarch Qiao saw the Dowager and she was very angry when she heard the reason for Liu Beis desire to leaveWho would dare harm my soninlaw cried sheBut she made Liu Bei move into the library of the Palace as a precaution and she chose a day for the celebration of the wedding But his soldiers could not keep guard at the library and were removed from his commandsLiu Bei explained to his hostess and when she understood this she gave her soninlaw and his people rooms in her own Palace so that he might be quite safe Liu Bei was very happy and there were fine banquets and the bride and bridegroom duly plighted their trothAnd when it grew late and the guests had gone the newly wedded pair walked through the two lines of red torches to the nuptial apartmentTo his extreme surprise Liu Bei found the chambers furnished with spears and swords and banners and flags while every waitingmaid had girded on a swordWalls hung with spears the bridegroom saw And armed waitingmaids His heart fell back on all its fears Of welllaid ambuscadesWhat happened will be related in the next chapter CHAPTER Liu Bei Rouses The Spirit Of Lady Sun Zhuge Liang A Second Time Angers Zhou YuThe bridegroom turned pale bridal apartments lined with weapons of war and waiting maids armed But the housekeeper of the princess said Do not be frightened O Honorable One My lady has always had a taste for warlike things and her maids have all been taught fencing as a pastimeThat is all it is Not the sort of thing a wife should ever look at said Liu BeiIt makes me feel cold and you may have them removed for a time The housekeeper went to her mistress and said The weapons in your chamber displease the handsome one may we remove them Lady Sun laughed saying Afraid of a few weapons after half a life time spent in slaughter But she ordered their removal and bade the maids take off their swords while they were at workThat night Liu Bei and his wife conversed under the moonlight and the night passed happily enough Next day Liu Bei distributed gifts among the maids to secure their good willHe also sent Sun Qian to Jingzhou with news of the wedding while he gave himself up to feasting and enjoymentThe Dowager loved him more every day The results of the plot to destroy Liu Bei were thus very different from the originators intention Sun Quan sent to his generalMy mother had insisted upon marrying her daughter to Liu Bei and so by juggling with the fictitious we had made it realWhat is to be done The news troubled Zhou Yu day and night but eventually he thought but another scheme which he embodied in a letter sent to his masterHere is the outline of the missiveContrary to expectation the plot that I Zhou Yu contrived has turned the wrong wayHowever since by juggling with deceit we have ended in a solid truth our future plans must start from the actual present factsTo the boldness of the adventurer Liu Bei is added the aid of such great leaders as Guan Yu Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun not to mention that he has a strategist like Zhuge Liang He is not the man to remain long in a lowly position Wherefore I can think of no better plan than to enervate him by surrounding him with softness and keeping him in the South Land a prisoner of luxuryTherefore build for him a fine palace to blunt the edge of his determination and surround him with sensuous luxury In this way the affection of his brothers will be alienated and Zhuge Liang will be driven awayWhen this result has been attained we can smite him and so end a great matterIf we be at all careless I fear the recumbent dragon may fly to the skies it is no beast to be kept in a pondMy lord I pray you consider this thoroughly The letter was shown to Zhang Zhao who said My idea is identical with hisLiu Bei began life in a humble position and for years has been a wanderer He has never tasted the delights of wealthGive him the means of luxury a beautiful dwelling fair women gold and silken attire and as he enjoys them the thoughts of Zhuge Liang and his brothers will fade away and they on their side will be filled with rancorThus can we lay our plans for recovering JingzhouI recommend action as Zhou Yu says and quickly Sun Quan then set about redecorating the Eastern Palace and laying out the grounds He filled the rooms with beautiful furniture for his sister and her husbandHe also sent fair damsels and musicians by the score and many and beautiful vessels in gold and silver and silken stuffsAnd his mother was delighted at his kindness to her soninlawIndeed Liu Bei was soon so immersed in sensuous pleasure that he gave no thought to returnZhao Yun and the company under him led an idle life in the front portion of the Eastern Palace save that at times they went outside the city for archery and horseracingAnd thus passed the yearSuddenly Zhao Yun remembered the orders he had received and the three bags with the plans in themIt was time to open the second one for the end of the year was nighHis orders were only to open the third when danger was very near and there appeared no way outAs already remarked the year was drawing to a close and Zhao Yun saw his lord daily becoming more and more the slave of pleasure Liu Bei never appeared among his guards nowSo the bag was opened and in pursuance of the wonderful scheme thereby discovered Zhao Yun went to the hall of the Palace and asked to see his masterThe maid in attendance went within and said Zhao Yun has some important matter on which to see the master Liu Bei called him in and asked what the business wasZhao Yun assumed an attitude of great concern and said My lord you are living happily secluded in these beautiful apartments do you never think of Jingzhou But what is the matter that you seem so disturbed asked Liu BeiToday early Zhuge Liang sent a messenger to say that Cao Cao was trying to avenge his last defeat and was leading five hundred thousand troops to attack Jingzhou which was in great danger And he wished you to return I must speak to my wife said Liu BeiIf you consult her she will be unwilling for you to returnIt would be better to say nothing but to start this evening Delay may do great damage Retire for a time I must act discreetly said Liu BeiZhao Yun urged the need to return several times more but finally went away Liu Bei went into his wifes rooms and began to weep silentlySeeing his tears Lady Sun said Why are you so sad my husband Liu Bei replied I have been driven hither and thither all my lifeI was never able to do my duty to my parents nor have I been able to sacrifice to my ancestors I have been very unfilialThe new year is at hand and its approach disquiets me greatly Do not try to deceive me said Lady Sun I heard and I know allJust now Zhao Yun came to tell you Jingzhou was threatened and you wish to return homeThat is why you put forward this excuse Then Liu Bei fell on his knees and said Why should I dissemble O Wife since you knowI do not wish to go but if Jingzhou be lost I shall be an object of ridicule to everyone I do desire to go but I cannot leave youNow you know why I am grieved She replied I am your handmaid and whithersoever you go it is my duty to follow Yes your heart is right but the difficulty is your mother and the Marquis they will be unwillingIf you would have pity on me and let me go for a time And again the tears gushed forthDo not be so sad my husband said Lady SunI will implore my mother to let us go and she will surely allow it Even supposing the Dowager permits I am sure the Marquis will hinder Lady Sun said nothing for a long time while she weighed the matter thoroughlyPresently she spoke On New Years Day you and I will go to court and present our congratulations Then we will give the excuse of a sacrifice on the river bank and go away without formal leave Will that suit you Liu Bei knelt at her feet and expressed his gratitudeI should be never so grateful said he Dead or alive I would remember your loveBut this must be a perfect secret This having been decided and the arrangements made Liu Bei gave Zhao Yun secret orders saying Lead your company out of the city and be on the road on New Years mornWe are going away Sun Quan held a grand court on the New Years Day of the fifteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity Liu Bei and his bride went into the Dowager Marchioness presence and Lady Sun said My husband has been thinking of his ancestors who lie in the county of Zhuo and grieves that he cannot do his duty by themToday we wish to go to the river side and offer sacrifice toward the northIt is our duty to inform you A very filial proceeding said the Dowager I should not think of stopping youAlthough you have never known your husbands parents yet you may go with him to sacrifice as it is proper for a wife to do Both thanked the Dowager Marchioness and went out rejoicing at having so far hoodwinked Sun QuanLady Sun got into her carriage taking only a little clothing with her while Liu Bei followed with a small escortThey went out of the city of Nanxu and met Zhao Yun at the place arrangedThen with a guard in front and rear they left the precincts of the city traveling as quickly as they couldThat day at the new year banquet Sun Quan drank freely so that he had to be helped to his chamber and the guests leftBefore very long the escape of the fugitives became known but it was then dark and when they tried to tell Sun Quan they could not rouse himHe slept heavily until the fifth watchThe next morning when Sun Quan heard the story he asked advice of his counselorsZhang Zhao said They have got away today but trouble will surely come of it therefore pursue after them without loss of time So Chen Wu and Pan Zhang with five hundred of veterans were sent out with orders to use all speed both by day and by night and bring back the fugitivesThey leftSun Quans anger burned hot against Liu Bei In his wrath he seized his jade inkstone and dashed it to the ground where it shivered to piecesSaid Cheng Pu My lord your wrath is in vain for I do not think your generals will catch the runaways Will they dare to disobey my order said Sun Quan Our young lady had always delighted to look upon war and is very fierce and determined All the officers fear herNow she has gone with her husband of her own free will and those sent in pursuit if once they look upon her countenance will not dare to lay hands on her Sun Quans wrath burned the more fiercely at these wordsHe drew the sword girded at his side and called up Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai saying You two take this sword and bring back the heads of my sister and Liu BeiAnd if you do not I will put you to death With this order they set out in pursuit leading a whole thousand troops Meanwhile Liu Bei and his wife were pressing forward with all speedWhen night fell they rested for a time by the roadside but not for longJust as they reached the confines of Chaisang they turned and saw a great cloud of dust and the soldiers said that a force was coming in pursuitWhat shall we do if they come up with us said Liu Bei excitedly to Zhao YunMy lord you go on in front and I will prevent pursuit As they turned the foot of a hill they saw a troop of soldiers blocking their road in frontTwo generals were there and they bellowed Liu Bei dismount and yield yourself captiveWe are here by order of Commander Zhou Yu and you have kept us waiting long Now the thought had come to Zhou Yu that Liu Bei would try to flee and so he had sent Xu Sheng and Ding Feng with three thousand troops to intercept him at this critical spot They had made a camp there and kept a lookout from the hilltops for Zhou Yu had calculated that Liu Bei would certainly pass that way So when Liu Bei and his cavalcade appeared they all buckled on their arms and barred the wayGreatly fearing Liu Bei rode back to consult Zhao Yun to whom he said In front a force barring the road in rear pursuers There is no escapeWhat can we do Do not be alarmed my lordThe Directing Instructor gave me three plans enclosed in three silken bagsTwo have been used and have answered admirablyThere is yet the third and my orders were to open the bag in such a strait as thisThis is a day of great danger such as calls me to open the bag Thereupon Zhao Yun opened the bag and handed it to Liu BeiAs soon as Liu Bei had seen the contents he hastened to Lady Suns carriage and began to weep saying I have something private to say and I must tell you What have you to tell me my husbandTell me the whole truth replied sheYour brother and Zhou Yu formerly made a plot for you to marry me not for your sake but to get me into their power and hold me so that they might recover JingzhouThey were set on my murder and you were the bait with which to hook meCareless of consequences I came for I knew that the spirit of a heroine dwelt in your bosom and you would pity meLately I heard that harm was intended me and so I made danger to Jingzhou the excuse to escapeHappily for me you have remained true and come with meBut now the Marquis is pursuing us and Zhou Yus soldiers are in frontOnly you my wife can extricate us from this danger and if you refuse then slay me where I stand that I may thus show my gratitude for your kindness Lady Sun grew angry and said Then does my brother forget that I am his sister How will he ever look me in the face I can extricate us from this danger Thereupon she bade her people push the carriage to the frontShe rolled up the curtains and herself called out Xu Sheng Ding Feng are you turned traitors then The two generals slid out of their saddles dropped their arms and stood meekly in front of the carriage We are no traitors said theyWe have the CommanderinChiefs orders to camp here and await Liu Bei Zhou Yu is an interfering scoundrel cried sheWe of the land of the south have never harmed you and Liu Bei the Uncle of the Great Family is my husbandI have already told my mother and my brother of our journey and now I find you with an army at the foot of these hills preventing our passageIs it that you would plunder us of our valuables The two generals mumbled dissent they would not dare such a thingWe pray you O Lady stay your angerThis is no plan of ours we do but obey our Generals orders So you fear Zhou Yu and not me cried she scornfullyThink you that if he slays you I will not slay him She broke into a torrent of abuse of Zhou YuThen she bade them push her carriage forwardThe two leaders thought within themselves We are but men of lowly rank we dare not dispute with Lady Sun Beside they saw Zhao Yun was bursting with wrath So they ordered their troops to stand aside and leave the road clear The cavalcade had only gone a few miles when up came the pursuersThe two generals told the newcomers what had happened You were wrong to let them pass said Chen Wu and Pan ZhangWe have orders from the Marquis himself to arrest them Thereupon all four went in pursuitWhen the noise of the approaching force reached the ears of Liu Bei he said to his wife They are again pursuing us what now Husband go on in frontZhao Yun and I will keep them off So Liu Bei and a small company went on toward the river bank while Zhao Yun reined up beside the ladys carriage and set out his troops ready for battleAnd when the four generals came up they dismounted and stood with folded armsWhat are you doing here Generals asked Lady SunWe have orders from our lord to request you and Liu Bei to return Calmly but bitterly she said So this is the sort of fools you are You would make dissension between brother and sisterBut I am a wife on my way to my husbands homeNor am I leaving clandestinely for I had my mothers gracious permission Now we husband and wife are going to Jingzhou and if even my brother were here himself he would let us pass in all politenessBut you because you have weapons in your hands would slay us She abused the four men to their faces so that they looked from one to another in shame And each in his heart thought Say what one will after all they two are brother and sister and the Dowager Marchioness is the controlling powerSun Quan is most obedient and would never dare oppose his mothers decision When the reaction comes then indeed we shall certainly be found in the wrong We would better be kind Another thing was that one of the two they sought Liu Bei was not there and Zhao Yun looked angry and dangerous Finally muttering to themselves they gave way and with one accord retired and left the road openLady Sun passed throughWe four will go to see the CommanderinChief and report said Xu Sheng But that did not please them all and they stood irresolutePresently they saw a column of troops sweeping down on them like a hurricane These were Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai with their companyHave you fellows seen Liu Bei  they cried as they rushed upHe has just passed along Why did you not arrest him Because of what Lady Sun said That is just as the Marquis feared and so he gave us this sword and told us first to slay his sister and then Liu Bei And if we disobey he will put us to death What can be doneThey are far away by now Jiang Qin said After all they are but a few and on foot they cannot travel very fastLet Xu Sheng and Ding Feng go to Zhou Yu to tell him and he can send fast boats to pursue them on the river while we follow up on the bankWe must get them either on water or land and we must not listen to what they say Whereupon two went back to report and four to the river bankMeanwhile Liu Bei had got a long way from Chaisang and reached Butterfly Shore He now felt calmerHe went along the bank of the river seeking a boat but there was no craft on the broad bosom of the streamHe bowed his head in deep sorrowZhao Yun bade him be of good courage saying My lord you have just escaped from the tigers jaws and had not far to go Moreover I suspect Zhuge Liang has something prepared for us But his master was despondentHis thoughts were back to the pleasures he had enjoyed but a few hours since in the house of his wife and the tears rolled down his cheeks A poem has been written on this episode By the bank of the deep flowing Great River Once was a wedding And the ruling houses of two states yet to be Were allied by marriageSee the beautiful maiden stepping slowly To the golden bridal chamber Yet was the marriage but a ruse Its author vainly imagined that a hero Sinking in amorous toils Would forget his high intentLiu Bei bade Zhao Yun go along the bank to seek some boats Then the soldiers told him there was a huge cloud of dust on the roadAscending one of the hills he looked back whence they had come and saw the whole earth as it were covered with an advancing host He sighed and said We have fled before them now for days worn out our soldiers and jaded our horses and all to die in a strange place He watched the enemy coming nearer and nearerThen as things began to look most desperate he saw a line of some twenty boats all in the act of setting their sailsBy good luck here are some ships said Zhao YunLet us get on board row to the further bank and see what can be done Liu Bei and his bride hastened down the bank and went into a ship The soldiers were embarkedThen they saw in the hold of the ship some one in Taoist dress who came up with a smile saying My lord again you see Zhuge LiangHe has waited a long time All the soldiers on board were from Jingzhou and Liu Bei rejoiced at the sudden happy turn of affairsBefore long the four pursuer leaders reached the bankZhuge Liang pointed to them and laughed saying I foresaw this a long time agoYou may return and tell Zhou Yu not to use the Fair Damsel Trick again Those on the bank sent a flight of arrows at the ships but they were already too far awayThe four generals on the bank looked very foolish As the boats were sailing along a great noise was heard on the river behind them and there appeared a huge fleet of war ships sailing under the flag of Zhou YuHe also was there in command of the fleet and he was supported by Huang Gai and Han Dang They seemed like a drove of horses and came along swift as a falling star They gained on the fugitives rapidlyZhuge Liang ordered the boats to row over to the north bank and the party landedThey had started off away from the shore before Zhou Yu could landZhou Yus marines except the leaders were all afoot but they kept up the pursuit following as quickly as they couldZhou Yu led the pursuit closely followed by Huang Gai Han Dang Xu Sheng and Ding FengWhen Zhou Yus force reached the borders of Huangzhou Liu Bei and his party were not far away and so they pressed the pursuitBut there were only horses for a few leaders in front and suddenly the rolling of drums struck Zhou Yus ears and from out a gully dashed a troop of swordsmen led by Guan YuZhou Yu was too surprised and unprepared to do anything but fleeZhou Yu fled for his life and Guan Yu pursuedAt different points Liu Beis generals Huang Zhong and Wei Yan came out and attacked so that the troops of the South Land suffered a great defeat and Zhou Yu barely escapedAs he came to the river and was going down into his ship the soldiers of Liu Bei on the bank jeered at him on account of the miscarriage of his scheme shouting General Zhou Yu has given Uncle Liu Bei a wife and has lost his soldiers Zhou Yu was so annoyed that he would have gone up the bank to fight again but his generals restrained himHe uttered My schemes are a failure and a defeat and how can I face my master again All at once he cried aloud and fell back in a swoon His wound had reopened The generals came to his help but it was long before he recovered consciousnessTwice had he played his trick And twice had he lost the game His heart was full of resentment He was overwhelmed with shameThe fate of Zhou Yu will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER Cao Cao Feasts In The Bronze Bird Tower Zhuge Liang Provokes Zhou Yu A Third Time The ambuscade into which Zhou Yu had fallen had been prepared by the orders of Zhuge Liang and was tripleHowever Huang Gai and Han Dang contrived to get clear and found refuge in the ships though with the loss of many troopsWhen Zhou Yu was in safety and looked about him he saw Liu Bei and Lady Sun safely resting on a hilltop How could such a sight fail to put him in a rageAnd with the access of rage his wound not yet healed burst open once again He swooned and fellThey raised him and his ship set sailZhuge Liang ordered no pursuit the southern fleet departed undisturbed and Liu Bei proceeded to Jingzhou City where were great rejoicings in honor of his recent marriageMeanwhile Zhou Yu had gone to Chaisang while Jiang Qin and those with him bore to Nanxu the sad tidings to Sun QuanHe was angry beyond words and his first thought was to send an army under Cheng Pu to take JingzhouZhou Yu also wrote from his sick bed urging his lord to take vengeanceBut Zhang Zhao knew better and said it could not be doneSaid he Cao Cao has never forgotten his defeat at the Red Cliffs but he dares not attempt to avenge himself while the Sun family are friendly with Liu BeiIf in any moment of anger you two fall upon each other Cao Cao will certainly seize the opportunity and your position will be dangerous Gu Yong supported Zhang Zhao saying Beyond all doubt Cao Cao has his spies hereAs soon as he hears of any rift in the friendship between the Sun and Liu families he will desire to come to an understanding with the latter and Liu Bei who fears your power will accept his offer and take his sideSuch an alliance will be a continual menace to the land south of the riverNo the plan for the occasion is to secure the friendship of Liu Bei by memorializing that he be made Imperial Protector of JingzhouThis will make Cao Cao afraid to send any army against the South LandAt the same time it will raise kindly feelings in the heart of Liu Bei and win his supportYou will be able to find some one who will provoke a quarrel between Cao Cao and Liu Bei and set them at each other and that will be your opportunityIn this way you will succeed These are good words said Sun Quan but have I a messenger who can accomplish such a mission There is such a man one whom Cao Cao respects and loves Who is he What prevents you from employing Hua XinHe is ready to hand Wherefore Hua Xin was given letters and bidden go to the capital Xuchang whither he proceeded at once and sought to see Cao CaoThey told him that Cao Cao and all his friends were at Yejun celebrating the completion of the Bronze Bird Tower So thither he wentCao Cao had indeed never forgotten his great defeat at the Red Cliffs and nourished schemes to avenge it but he feared the combination of his two chief enemies and that fear restrained himIn the spring of the fifteenth year  the great Tower was completed and Cao Cao invited a vast assembly to celebrate its inauguration with banquets and rejoicingsThe feast was on the bank of River Zhang The Bronze Bird Terrace stood in the center flanked by two others named the Terrace of the Jade Dragon and the Terrace of the Golden Phoenix Each tower was a hundred spans high and two bridges connected them Gold and jade vied with each other in the many apartmentsAt the opening ceremony Cao Cao wore a golden headdress inlaid with jewels and a robe of green brocaded silk girded with a belt of jade On his feet were pearlencrusted shoesSo clad he took his seat as host while his officers civil and military were drawn up below the terraceFor the military officers was arranged an archery competition and one of his attendants brought forth a robe of red crimson Xichuan silk as a prize This was suspended from one of the drooping branches of a willow tree beneath which was the target The distance was a hundred pacesThe competitors were divided into two bands those of Cao Caos own family being dressed in red and the others in greenThey all had carved bows and long arrows and were mounted They stood holding in their steeds till the signal should be given for the games to beginEach was to shoot one arrow and the robe was the guerdon for hitting the target in the red misses were to pay a forfeit of drinking a cup of cold waterAs soon as the signal was given a redrobed youth rode quickly forth He was Cao XiuSwiftly he galloped to and fro thrice Then he adjusted the notch of his arrow to the string pulled the bow to its full and the arrow flew straight to the bulls eyeThe clang of the gongs and the roll of the drums announced the feat which astonished them allAnd Cao Cao as he sat on the terrace was delighted A very promising colt of my own said he to those about him and he sent a messenger for the red robe that the winner might receive it from his own handsBut suddenly from the green side rode out one who cried It were more fitting to let outsiders compete for the Prime Ministers silken robe it is not right that members of the family monopolize the contest Cao Cao looked at the speaker who was Wen PingAnd some of the officers cried Let us see what his shooting is like So Wen Ping fitted an arrow to the string and fired also from horseback while gallopingTo the surprise of the onlookers he also made a bulls eye which was honored by another salute from gongs and drumsQuickly bring me the robe cried Wen PingBut at once from the ranks of the redrobed another competitor dashed forward shouting fiercely How can you win what has been already wonBut let me show you how I can shoot an arrow that shall overcome both your shots He drew his bow to the full and the arrow flew straight to the heart of the redThe surprised onlookers saw that this new competitor was Cao Hong who now became also a claimant for the robeHowever yet another archer came forth from the greenrobed ranks playing with his bow and crying What is there amazing in your shooting you threeSee how I can shoot This man was Zhang HeHe put his horse to the gallop then turned his back and shooting backwards also hit the center of the redThus four arrows were now sticking in the bulls eye and all agreed that it was marvelous archeryI think the robe should be mine said Zhang HeBefore he could finish speaking a fifth competitor came out from the red robes and shouted You shot backwards but that is commonplace enoughLook while I shoot better than you all The speaker was Xiahou Yuan He galloped off to the very limit and then bending his body over backwards he sent his arrow right in among the other fourAs the gongs and drums broke out Xiahou Yuan put aside his bow and rode up saying Is not that a better shot than any of its predecessors Then came out another from the greens who cried Leave the robe there for me Xu Huang to win What can you do that is better than my shot said Xiahou Yuan That you hit the bulls eye is no great featYou will see me win the silken robe after all So speaking Xu Huang fitted an arrow to his bowThen looking around he aimed at the willow twig from which the robe hung down and shot thereat so true that his arrow cut it through and the robe fluttered to the groundAt once Xu Huang dashed along picked up the robe and slipped it on Then riding swiftly to the terrace he thanked the Prime MinisterNo one present could withhold unstinted praise and Xu Huang was turning to ride away when another green clad general leaped out saying Where would you go with that robeQuickly leave it for me All eyes turned to this man who was Xu ChuXu Huang cried The robe has already been adjudged to me would you dare take it by forces Xu Chu made no reply but galloped up to snatch the robeAs Xu Chus horse drew near Xu Huang struck at his rival a blow with his bowBut Xu Chu seized the bow with one hand while with the other he simply lifted his opponent out of his seat Wherefore Xu Huang let go the bow and the next moment lay sprawling on the groundXu Chu slipped out of the saddle too and they began to pommel each other with their fistsCao Cao sent one to separate them but in the struggle the robe had been torn and soiledCao Cao called the angry rivals before him and they came one darting fierce looks of hate the other grinding his teeth with rageNever mind the robe I see only your magnificent courage said Cao Cao smilingWhat does a robe more or less matter Whereupon Cao Cao called the generals to him one by one and to each he presented a robe of Xichuan silkThey thanked him for the generous gifts and he then commanded them to take their seats in due orderThen to the strains of a band of music wherein each performer vied with all the others the naval and military officers took their placesCivil officers of repute and generals of renown drank one to another and hearty felicitations were exchangedCao Cao looked around to those about him saying Since the military officers have competed in mounted archery for our enjoyment and displayed their boldness and their skill you Gentlemen Scholars stuffed full of learning as you are can surely mount the terrace and present some complimentary odes to make the occasion a perfect success We are most willing to obey your commands they replied all bowing lowAt that time there was a band of four scholars named Wang Lang Zhong Yao Wang Can and Chen Lin and each of them presented a poemEvery poem sang the praises of Cao Caos valuable services and great merits and said he was worthy to receive the highest trust of allWhen Cao Cao had read them he laughed saying You gentlemen are really too flatteringAs a fact I am but an ignoramus who began life with a simple bachelors degree and recommendations for filial devotionAnd when the troubles began I built for myself a little cottage in the country near Qiao where I could study in spring and summer and spend the rest of the year in hunting till the empire was once more tranquil and I could emerge and take officeTo my surprise I was chosen for a small military office which changed my intentions and I determined to repress the rebellion and so make a name for myself I thought that I might win an inscription on my tomb to the effect that it covered the remains of the Lord Cao Cao Who Restores Order in the West That would have been ample for a lifes workI recall now how I destroyed Dong Zhuo and smote the Yellow Scarves then I made away with Yuan Shu and broke the power of Lu Bu next I exterminated Yuan Shao and at the death of Liu Biao I had subdued the whole empireAs a minister of state I have attained the topmost pinnacle of honor and I have no more to hope forWere it not for poor me I know not how many there would be styling themselves emperors and dubbing themselves princesCertain there be who seeing my great authority think I have some ulterior aimBut they are quite wrong I ever bear in mind what Confucius said of King Wen of Zhou that he was perfectly virtuous and this saying is ever engraved on my mind If I could I would do away with my armies and retire to my fief with my simple title of Lord of Wuping I cannotI am afraid to lay down my military powers lest I should come to harmShould I be defeated the state would totter and so I may not risk real misfortune for the sake of an empty reputation for kindnessThere be some of you who do not know my heart As he closed they all rose and bowed their heads saying None are your equals O Prime Minister not even Duke Zhou or the great Minister Yi Yin A poem has been written referring to thisHad Duke Zhou the virtuous died while foulmouthed slander was spreading vile rumors Or Wang Mang the treacherous while he was noted for the deference paid to learned men None would have known their real charactersAfter this oration Cao Cao drank many cups of wine in quick succession till he became very intoxicated He bade his servants bring him brush and inkstone that he might compose a poemBut as he was beginning to write they announced The Marquis of Wu has sent Hua Xin as an envoy and presented a memorial to appoint Liu Bei Imperial Protector of Jingzhou Sun Quans sister is now Liu Beis wife while on the River Han the greater part of the nine territories is under Liu Beis rule Cao Cao was seized with quaking fear at the news and threw the pen on the floorCheng Yu said to him O Prime Minister you have been among fighting soldiers by myriads and in danger from stones and arrows many a time and never quailedNow the news that Liu Bei has got possession of a small tract of country throws you into a panicWhy is it thus Cao Cao replied Liu Bei is a dragon among humansAll his life hitherto he has never found his element but now that he has obtained Jingzhou it is as if the dragon once captive had escaped to the mighty deepThere is good reason for me to quake with fear Do you know the reason of the coming of Hua Xin said Cheng YuNo I know not said the Prime MinisterLiu Bei is Sun Quans one terror and Sun Quan would attack Liu Bei were it not for you O Prime Minister Sun Quan feels you would fall upon him while he was smiting his enemyWherefore he has taken this means of calming Liu Beis suspicions and fears and at the same time directing your enmity toward Liu Bei and from himself Cao Cao nodded Yes he saidCheng Yu continued Now this is my plan to set Sun Quan and Liu Bei at one another and give you the opportunity to destroy both it can be done easily What is your plan asked Cao CaoThe one prop of the South Land is Zhou Yu remove it by memorializing that Zhou Yu be appointed Governor of Nanjun Then get Cheng Pu made Governor of Jiangxia and cause the Emperor to retain this Hua Xin in the capital to await some important postZhou Yu will assuredly attack Liu Bei and that will be our chanceIs not the scheme good Friend Cheng Yu you are a man after my own heart Wherefore Cao Cao summoned the emissary from the South Land and overwhelmed him with giftsThat day was the last of the feastings and merrymakings and Cao Cao with all the company returned to the capital where he forthwith presented a memorial assigning Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu to the governorships of Nanjun and Jiangxia and Hua Xin was retained at the capital with a post of ministryThe messenger bearing the commissions for their new offices went down to the South Land and both Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu accepted the appointments Having taken over his command the former thought all the more of the revenge he contemplated and to bring matters to a head he wrote to Sun Quan asking him to send Lu Su and renew the demand for the rendition of Jingzhou Wherefore Lu Su was summoned and his master said to him You are the guarantor in the loan of Jingzhou to Liu BeiHe still delays to return it and how long am I to wait The writing said plainly that the rendition would follow the occupation of Yiazhou Sun Quan shouted back Yes it said soBut so far they have not moved a soldier to the attackI will not wait till old age has come to us all I will go and inquire said Lu SuSo he went down into a ship and sailed to JingzhouMeanwhile Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were at Jingzhou gathering in supplies from all sides drilling their troops and training their armies From all quarters people of learning flocked to their sideIn the midst of this they heard of Lu Sus coming and Liu Bei asked Zhuge Liang what he thoughtZhuge Liang replied Just lately Sun Quan concerned himself with getting you appointed Imperial Protector of Jingzhou that was calculated to inspire Cao Cao with fearCao Cao obtained for Zhou Yu the governorship of Nanjun that was designed to stir up strife between our two houses and set us fighting so that he might accomplish his own endsThis visit of Lu Su means that Zhou Yu having taken over his new governorship wishes to force us out of this place Then how shall we reply If Lu Su introduces the subject you will at once set up loud lamentationsWhen the sound of lamentation is at its height I will appear and talk over your visitor Thus they planned and Lu Su was duly received with all honorWhen the salutations were over and host and guest were about to be seated Lu Su said Sir now that you are the husband of a daughter of Wu you have become my lord and I dare not sit in your presence Liu Bei laughed You are an old friend said heWhy this excessive humility So Lu Su took his seatAnd when tea had been served the guest said I have come at the order of my master to discuss the subject of JingzhouYou O Imperial Uncle have had the use of the place for a long timeNow that your two houses are allied by marriage there should be the most friendly relations between you two and you should hand it back to my master At this Liu Bei covered his face and began to cry What is the matter asked the guestLiu Bei only wept the more bitterlyThen Zhuge Liang came in from behind a screen saying I have been listeningDo you know why my lord weeps so bitterly Really I know not But it is easy to seeWhen my lord got the temporary occupation of Jingzhou he gave the promise to return it when he had got the Western Land of Rivers But reflectLiu Zhang of Yiazhou is my lords younger brother and both of them are blood relations of the ruling family If my lord were to move an army to capture another region he fears the blame of the ignorantAnd if he yields this place before he has another where could he restYet while he retains this place it seems to shame youThe thing is hard on both sides and that is why he weeps so bitterly The close of Zhuge Liangs speech seemed to move Liu Bei to greater grief for he beat his breast and stamped his feet and wept yet more bitterlyLu Su attempted to console him saying Be not so distressed O Uncle let us hear what Zhuge Liang can propose Zhuge Liang said I would beg you to return to your master and tell him allTell him of this great trouble and entreat him to let us stay here a little longer But suppose he refuses what then said Lu SuHow can he refuse since he is related by marriage to my master  said Zhuge LiangI shall expect to hear glad tidings through you Lu Su was really the first of generous people and seeing Liu Bei in such distress he could do no other than consent and say he would do soLiu Bei and Zhuge Liang both thanked him most cordially and after a banquet the emissary went down into his ship to returnOn the way Lu Su called in to see Zhou Yu at Chaisang and told himBut Zhou Yu stamped his foot with rage and said My friend you have been fooled againLong ago when Liu Bei was dependent on Liu Biao he always cherished the intention to supplant him think you that he really pities Liu ZhangThis sort of evasive policy will certainly cause you much troubleHowever I have a scheme which I think Zhuge Liang will not be able to get the better ofOnly you will have to make another journey I should be pleased to hear your fine scheme said Lu Su Do not go to see our masterReturn to Jingzhou and say to Liu Bei that since his family and the Suns are related by marriage they really form but one house and since he has qualms about attacking the west we will do it for himThus the South Land will march an army under this pretext but really go to Jingzhou and we shall take him unpreparedThe road to the west runs through his city and we will call upon him for suppliesHe will come out to thank the army and we will assassinate him whereby we shall revenge ourselves and at the same time remove a source of future evil This seemed an excellent plan to Lu Su and he returned at once to Jingzhou Before receiving him Liu Bei talked over the matter with his adviserSaid Zhuge Liang Lu Su has not seen the Marquis of Wu he has called in at Chaisang and he and Zhou Yu have decided upon some scheme which he is to talk you into acceptingHowever let him talk you my lord only watch me and when I nod my head then you agree to whatever he may propose Lu Su was then admitted and said The Marquis of Wu praises the noble virtue of the Imperial Uncle and after consultation with his officers he has determined to take the western country on the Imperial Uncles behalf and that done Jingzhou can be exchanged for it without further delay However when the army marches through it will be expected of you to contribute some necessary supplies Zhuge Liang here nodded his head rapidly at the same time saying We could hardly have hoped for such kindness And Liu Bei saluted with joined hands and said This is due to your friendly efforts on our behalf When the brave army arrives we shall certainly come out to meet it and entertain the soldiers said Zhuge LiangLu Su felt great satisfaction and was quite happy at his success he took his leave and went homeward But Liu Bei as yet did not understandWhat is their intention said heHis adviser smiled saying Zhou Yus end is very nearThe ruse he is now trying would not take in a child Why This is the ruse known as Borrow a Road to Exterminate the Host Under the pretense of taking the west they intend to capture this place and when you go out to compliment the army you will be seized and they will dash into the city which they hope to find unprepared And what are we to do Have no anxiety all we have to do is to prepare a hidden bow to get the fierce tiger to spread the enticing bait to hook the great leviathanWait till Zhou Yu comes if he is not killed he will be ninetenths a corpseWe will call in Zhao Yun for orders and give him secret instructions and I will dispose the others And Liu Bei was gladLet Zhou Yu lay what plans he will Zhuge Liang anticipates his skill That land of rivers fair bait did look But he forgot the hidden hookLu Su hastened back to Zhou Yu to tell him that all was going as he desired and Liu Bei would come out to welcome the armyZhou Yu laughed with glee saying At lastNow they will fall into my trap Zhou Yu bade Lu Su prepare a petition for the information of the Marquis and he ordered Cheng Pu to bring up reinforcementsHe himself had nearly recovered from the arrow wound and felt well He made his dispositions for the advance appointing Gan Ning Van Leader Xu Sheng and Ding Feng the Commanders of the body and Ling Tong and Lu Meng Rear Guards The army numbered fifty thousand troops and Zhou Yu marched with the second divisionWhile voyaging in his ship he was always smiling to think how he was to have Zhuge Liang at lastAt Xiakou he inquired Is there any one to welcome the brave army They told him The Imperial Uncle has sent Mi Zhu to greet us And Mi Zhu was calledWhat of the preparations for the army asked Zhou Yu as soon as Mi Zhu cameMy master has seen to that all is prepared said Mi ZhuWhere is the Imperial Uncle asked Zhou YuHe is at the city of Jingzhou waiting outside the walls to offer you the cup of greeting This expedition is on your account said Zhou YuWhen one undertakes so long a march and such a task the rewards for the army must be very substantial Having got this idea of what Zhou Yu expected Mi Zhu returned to his own city while the southern battle ships in close order sailed up the river and took their places along the bank As they went on the most perfect tranquillity seemed to reign on all sides Not a ship was visible anywhere and no one hinderedZhou Yu pressed forward till he came quite near Jingzhou and still the wide river lay calmBut the spies who came back reported two white flags flying on the city walls Still not a person was seen and Zhou Yu began to feel suspiciousHe had his ship navigated in shore and he himself landed on the bank where he mounted a horse and with a small army of three thousand veterans under Gan Ning Xu Sheng and Ding Feng traveled along the land roadBy and bye he came to the city wall There was no sign of lifeReining in his steed he bade them challenge the gateThen some one from the wall asked Who is there The soldiers of the South Land replied The CommanderinChief of the South Land Zhou Yu in person Immediately was heard the thud of a club and the wall became alive with troops all armedAnd from the tower came out Zhao Yun who said Why are you here General I am going to take the west for you replied Zhou Yu do you not know The Directing Instructor knows that you want to try the ruse of Borrowing a Road to Destroy the Host And so he stationed me hereAnd my master bade me say that he and the ruler of the Western Land of Rivers are both members of the reigning family so that he could not think of such baseness as attacking YiazhouIf you people of the South Land do so he will be forced to go away into the mountains and become a recluse He could not bear to lose the confidence of humankind At this Zhou Yu turned his horse as if to returnJust then his scouts came up to report Armed bands are moving toward us from all four sides led by Guan Yu Zhang Fei Huang Zhong and Wei YanTheir number is unknown but the sound of their tramping shakes the heavensThey say they want to capture the CommanderinChief At these tidings Zhou Yus excitement became so intense that he fell to the ground with a great cry and the old wound reopenedThe game was now too deep in vain he sought A countermove his efforts came to noughtLater chapters will show what was Zhou Yus fate CHAPTER  SleepingDragon Mourns At Chaisang BloomingPhoenix Intervenes At Leiyang In the last chapter it was said that a sudden rage filled the bosom of Zhou Yu and he fell to the ground Then he was carried to his boatIt only added to his rage and mortification to be told that Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang could be seen on the top of one of the hills apparently feasting and enjoying some musicHe lay grinding his teeth with vexation They say I shall never be able to get YiazhouBut I will I swear I will Soon after Sun Quans brother Sun Shao arrived and Zhou Yu told him his vexations My brother sent me to assist you said Sun ShaoZhou Yu ordered Sun Shao to press the army forward for Yiazhou and they got to BaqiuThere they stopped for the scouts reported large forces under Liu Beis generalsLiu Feng and Guan Pingbarring the water route in the Great River This failure did not make the CommanderinChief any calmerAbout this time a letter from Zhuge Liang arrived which ran like this Since our parting at Chaisang I have thought of you oftenNow comes to me a report that you desire to take the Western Land of Rivers which I regret to say I consider impossibleThe people there are strong and the country is precipitous and defensible Imperial Protector Liu Zhang may be weak within but he is strong enough to defend himself Now indeed General you would go far and you would render great services yet can any one foretell the final resultNo not even Wu Qi the Great General could say for certain nor could Sun Zi the Famed Strategist be sure of a successful issueCao Cao suffered severe defeat at the Red Cliffs think you he will ever cease to hope for revengeNow if you undertake a long expedition will he not seize the occasion to fall upon the South Land and grind it to powderSuch a deed would be more than I could bear and I venture to warn you of the possible danger if haply you may condescend to regard it The letter made Zhou Yu feel very sorrowful and he sighed deeplyHe called for paper and ink and wrote to the Marquis of Wu and having done this he said to his assembled officers I have honestly tried to do my best for my country but my end is at hand The number of my days is accomplishedYou must continue to aid our master till his end shall be achieved He stopped for he had swoonedSlowly he regained consciousness and as he looked up to heaven he sighed heavily O God since thou made Zhou Yu why did thou also create Zhuge Liang Soon after he passed away he was only thirtysixThe battle at the Red Cliffs made him famous Though young in years he gained a veterans reputationDeep feeling his music declared its intensity Subtle with excess hospitality he foiled a plot Persuasive he obtained a large gift of grain from Lu Su Capable he led an army of millionsBaqiu was his deathbed there his fate met him Sadly indeed they mourned himAfter his death his generals sent his dying memorial to the Marquis of Wu who was most deeply affected and wept aloud at the sad tidings of his deathWhen Sun Quan opened the letters he saw that Lu Su was named as the dead generals successor This is the letterPossessing but ordinary abilities there was no reason why I should have been the recipient of your confidence and high office but I have not spared myself in the leadership of the great army under my command that thereby I might prove my gratitudeYet none can measure life and the number of our days is ordained by fateBefore I could achieve even my poor intentions my feeble body has failed me I regret it without measureI die with Cao Cao threatening and our northern borders disturbed and with Liu Bei in your family as though you were feeding a fierce tigerNone can foretell the fate of the empire in these nervous days of stress and of peculiar anxiety for youLu Su is most loyal careful in all matters and a fitting man to succeed to my officeWhen a person is near death his words are wise and if I may haply retain your regard I may die but I shall not decay Zhou Yu should have been a kings counselor cried Sun Quan amid his tearsHe has left me alas too soon and whom have I to lean uponBut he recommends Lu Su and I can do nothing better than take that advice Whereupon Sun Quan appointed Lu Su to the vacant command CommandershipinChiefSun Quan also saw that the coffin of his beloved general was sent to Chaisang ready for the funeral sacrificesThe night of Zhou Yus death Zhuge Liang was gazing up at the heavens when he saw a star of a general fall to the earth Zhou Yu is dead said he with a smileAt dawn he sent to tell Liu Bei who sent people to find out and they came back to say it was true Zhou Yu had died Now that this has come to pass what should we do said Liu BeiLu Su will succeed said Zhuge LiangAnd I see in the heavens signs of an assembly of generals in the southeast so I shall go thereThe mourning for Zhou Yu will serve as a pretextI may find some able leaders there to be of help to you I am afraid lest the generals of the South Land harm you said Liu Bei While Zhou Yu lived I did not fear is there anything to dread now that he is gone However Zhuge Liang took Zhao Yun as commander of his escort when he embarked for Baqiu and on the road he heard of Lu Sus succession to the late generals postAs the coffin of Zhou Yu had been sent to Chaisang Zhuge Liang continued his journey thither and on landing was kindly received by Lu Su The officers of the South Land did not conceal their enmity but the sight of the redoubtable Zhao Yun always close at hand kept them from trying to hurt Zhuge LiangThe officers brought by Zhuge Liang were arranged in order before the bier and he himself poured the libation Then he knelt and read this threnody Alas Zhou Yu Hapless are you in your early deathLength of days is in the hands of God yet do humans suffer and my heart is deeply grieved for youI pour this libation that your spirit may enjoy its fragrance I lament youI lament your younger days passed in the companionship of Sun Ce when preferring eternal principles to material wealth you abode in a humble cottageI lament your ripe strength when you guarded distant Baqiu putting fear into the heart of Liu Biao destroying rebels and ensuring safetyI lament the grace of your manhoodMarried to a fair maid of the Qiao family soninlaw of a great minister you were such as would add luster to the Han Court I lament your resolute purpose when you opposed the pledgegiving to Cao CaoAs in the beginning your wings drooped not so in the end your pinions spread wideI lament your abandon when your false friend Jiang Gan came to you at Poyang LakeThere you manifested your lofty idealsI lament your magnificent talents proved in civil administration as in military scienceWith fire attacking the fierce enemy at the Red Cliffs you brought his strength to weaknessI recall you as you were but yesterday bold and successful and I weep your untimely deathProstrate I weep tears of sorrowLoyal and upright in heart noble and spiritual by nature your life has been but three decades but your fame will endure for ages I mourn for your affection My bowels writhe with sorrow and my deepseated sadness will never ceaseThe very heavens are darkenedThe army is sad your lord sheds tears your friends weep floodsScanty of ability am I yet even of me you begged plans and sought schemes to aid the South Land to repulse Cao Cao to restore the Hans and comfort the LiusBut with you as the firm corner stone and your perfect dispositions could the final result cause any anxietyAlas my friend The quick and the dead are ever separate they mingle neverIf in the deep shades spirits have understanding you now read my inmost heart yet hereafter there will be none on earth to comprehendAlas the painDeign to accept this my sacrifice The sacrifice finished Zhuge Liang bowed to the ground and keened while his tears gushed forth in floods He was deeply movedThose who stood on guard by the bier said one to another People lied when they said these two were enemies look at the sincerity shown in sacrifice And Lu Su was particularly affected by the display of feeling and thought Plainly Zhuge Liang loved Zhou Yu much but Zhou Yu was not broadminded enough and would have done Zhuge Liang to death Before SleepingDragon emerged from his Nanyang retreat A brilliant man had descended upon this earth Since O Azure Heaven ye made Zhou Yu Why needed Yellow Earth produce an Zhuge LiangLu Su gave a banquet for Zhuge Liang after which the guest leftJust as Zhuge Liang was embarking his arm was clutched by a person in Taoist dress who said with a smile You exasperated literally to death the man whose body lies up there to come here as a mourner is an open insult to the South LandIt is as good as to say they have no other left At first Zhuge Liang did not recognize the speaker but very soon he saw it was no other than Pang Tong or the BloomingPhoenixThen Zhuge Liang laughed in his turn and they two hand in hand went down into the ship where they talked heart to heart for a long timeBefore leaving Zhuge Liang gave his friend a letter and said I do not think that Sun Quan will use you as you meritIf you find life here distasteful then you may come to Jingzhou and help to support my masterHe is liberal and virtuous and will not disdain what you have spent your life in learning Then they parted and Zhuge Liang went alone to JingzhouLu Su had the coffin of Zhou Yu taken to Wuhu where Sun Quan received it with sacrifices and lamentations The dead leader was buried in his native placeZhou Yus family consisted of two sons and a daughter the children being named Zhou Xun Zhou Yin and Zhou Ying Sun Quan treated them with generosity and tendernessLu Su was not satisfied that he was the fittest successor to his late chief and said Zhou Yu was not right in recommending me for I have not the requisite ability and am unfitted for this postBut I can commend to you a certain able man conversant with all knowledge and a most capable strategist not inferior to the old Guan Zhong or Yue Yi one whose plans are as good as those of Sun Zi and Wu Qi the most famous masters of the Art of WarZhou Yu often took his advice and Zhuge Liang believes in himAnd he is at hand This was good news for Sun Quan who asked the mans name and when he heard it was Pang Tong or BloomingPhoenix he replied Yes I know him by reputation let him come Whereupon Pang Tong was invited to the Palace and introducedThe formal salutations over Sun Quan was disappointed with the mans appearance which was indeed extraordinary Pang Tong had bushy eyebrows a turnedup nose a dark face and a stubby beard So Sun Quan was prejudiced against Pang TongWhat have you studied asked Sun Quan and what are you master of Pang Tong replied One must not be narrow and obstinate one must change with circumstances How does your learning compare with that of Zhou Yu asked Sun QuanMy learning is not to be compared with his in the least mine is far greater Now Sun Quan had always loved his late general and he could not bear to hear him disparaged This speech of Pang Tong only increased his dislikeSo he said You may retire Sir I will send for you when I can employ you Pang Tong uttered one long sigh and went awayWhen he had gone Lu Su said My lord why not employ him What good would result he is just one of those mad fellows He did good service at the Red Cliffs fight however for it was he who got Cao Cao to chain his ships together It was simply that Cao Cao wished to chain his ships together No credit was due to this fellowIn any case I give you my word that I will not employ himThat much is certain Lu Su went out and explained to Pang Tong that the failure was not due to lack of recommendation but simply a whim of Sun Quan and he must put up with itThe disappointed suitor hung his head and sighed many times without speaking I fear you are doomed to constant disappointment here said Lu Su There is nothing you can hope for eh But still Pang Tong was silentWith your wonderful gifts of course you will be successful whithersoever you may goYou may take my word for that But to whom will you go I think I will join Cao Cao said Pang Tong suddenly That would be hinging a gleaming pearl into darkness Rather go to Liu Bei who would appreciate you and employ you fittingly The truth is that I have been thinking of this for a long time said Pang Tong I was only joking just now I will give you a letter to Liu Bei and if you go to him you must try to maintain peace between him and my lord and get them to act together against Cao Cao That has been the one desire of my life Pang Tong took the letter offered by Lu Su and soon made his way to Jingzhou CityHe arrived at a moment that Zhuge Liang was absent on an inspection journey but the doorkeeper announced him and said he had come to throw in his lot with Liu BeiHe was received for he was no stranger in nameWhen Pang Tong was admitted he made the ordinary salutation but did not make an obeisance and this coupled with his ugly face did not please his host You have come a long and arduous journey said Liu BeiAt this point the suitor should have produced his letters from Zhuge Liang and Lu Su but did not Instead he replied I hear O Imperial Uncle that you are welcoming the wise and receiving scholars wherefore I have come to join your service The country is decently peaceful now and unfortunately there is no office vacantBut away to the northeast there is a small magistracy Leiyang which needs a chiefI can offer you that post until there should be something more fitting Pang Tong thought this rather poor welcome for a person of his talent But his friend was absent so he could do nothing but control his annoyance and accept He took his leave and startedBut when he arrived at his post he paid no attention to business at all he gave himself up entirely to dissipation The taxes were not collected nor were lawsuits decidedNews of this reaching Liu Bei who was angry and said Here is this stiffnecked pedant throwing my administration into disorder So Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei to the county with orders to make a general inspection of the whole county and look into any irregularities and disordersBut as Liu Bei thought there might be some tact needed Sun Qian was also sent as coadjutorIn due course the inquisitors arrived at Leiyang where they were received by the officials and welcomed by the people at the boundary But the Magistrate did not appearWhere is the Magistrate asked Zhang FeiEver since his arrival a hundred days ago and more he has attended to no business but spends his days from morn to night in winebobbing and is always intoxicatedJust now he is sleeping off a debauch and is not yet risen This raised Zhang Feis choler and he would have dismissed the offender forthwith had not his colleague said Pang Tong is a man of great ability and it would be wrong to deal with him thus summarilyLet us inquire into itIf he is really so guilty we will punish his offense So they went to the magistracy took their seats in the hail of justice and summoned the Magistrate before themHe came with dress all disordered and still under the influence of wine My brother took you for a decent person said Zhang Fei angrily and sent you here as magistrateHow dare you throw the affairs of the county into disorder Do you think I have done as you say General said Pang TongWhat affairs have I disordered You have been here over a hundred days and spent the whole time in dissipation Is not that disorderly Where would be the difficulty in dealing with the business of a trifling county like thisI pray you General sit down for a while till I have settled the cases Thereupon Pang Tong bade the clerks bring in all the arrears and he would settle them at onceSo they brought in the piles of papers and ordered the suitors to appear They came and knelt in the hall while the magistrate brush in hand noted this and minuted that all the while listening to the pleadings Soon all the difficulties and disputes were adjusted and never a mistake was made as the satisfied bows of the people provedBy midday the whole of the cases were disposed of and the arrears of the hundred days settled and decided This done the Magistrate threw aside his pen and turned to the inquisitors saying Where is the disorderWhen I can take on Cao Cao and Sun Quan as easily as I can read this paper what attention from me is needed for the business of this paltry place Zhang Fei was astonished at the mans ability rose from his seat and crossed over saying You are indeed a marvel MasterI have not treated you respectfully enough but now I shall commend you to my brother with all my might Then Pang Tong drew forth Lu Sus letter and showed it to Zhang FeiWhy did you not show this to my brother when you first saw him asked Zhang Fei If I had had a chance I would have done soBut is it likely that one would just take advantage of a letter of commendation to make a visit Zhang Fei turned to his colleague and said You just saved a wise man for us Sun Qian and Zhang Fei left the magistracy and returned to Liu Bei to whom they related what had happenedLiu Bei then seemed to be conscious of his error and said I have been wrong I have behaved unjustly to a sage Zhang Fei then gave his brother the letter in which Lu Su had recommended Pang Tong Opening it he readPang Tong is not the sort of person to be met with in any days marchEmploy him in some capacity where extra ordinary talent is required and his powers will declare themselvesBeware of judging him by his looks or you may lose the advantage of his abilities and some other will gain himThis would be a misfortune While Liu Bei was feeling cast down at the mistake he had made as shown by the letter they announced the return of Zhuge Liang Soon Zhuge Liang entered the hall and the first question he put after the formal salutations wasIs DirectingInstructor Pang Tong quite well He is in charge of Leiyang replied Liu Bei where he is given to wine and neglects his business Zhuge Liang laughed saying My friend Pang Tong has extraordinary abilities and ten times my knowledgeI gave him a letter for you my lord Did he present it This very day I have received a letter but from Lu SuI have had no letter written by you When a person of transcendent abilities is sent to a paltry post he always turns to wine out of simple ennui said Zhuge LiangIf it had not been for what my brother said I should have lost a great person said Liu BeiThen he lost no time but sent Zhang Fei off to the northeast to request Pang Tong to come to Jingzhou CityWhen he arrived Liu Bei went out to meet him and at the foot of the steps asked pardon for his mistakeThen Pang Tong produced the letter that Zhuge Liang had given him What Liu Bei read therein was thisAs soon as the BloomingPhoenix shall arrive he should be given an important post Liu Bei rejoiced indeed as he read it and he said WaterMirror said of the two men SleepingDragon and BloomingPhoenix that any man who obtained the help of either of them could restore the empire when he wouldAs I now have them both surely the Hans will rise again Then he appointed Pang Tong as Vice Directing Instructor and General and the two strategists began training the army for its work of subjugation News of these doings came to the capital Xuchang and Cao Cao was told of Liu Beis two strategists and of the army in training and the stores accumulating and the league between his two chief enemies And he knew that he had to expect an attack sooner or laterSo he summoned his strategists to a council for a new campaignSaid Xun Yu Sun Quan should be first attacked because of the recent death of their ablest general Zhou YuLiu Bei will follow Cao Cao replied If I go on such a distant expedition Ma Teng will fall upon the capitalWhile I was at the Red Cliffs there were sinister rumors of this and I must guard against it Xun Yu said The best thing that occurs to stupid me is to obtain for Ma Teng the title of General Who Subdues the South and send him against the South Land Thus he can be enticed to the capital and got rid ofThen you can have no fear of marching southward Cao Cao approved and soon Ma Teng was summoned from Xiliang a frontier territory in the westMa Teng was a descendant of the famous leader Ma Yuan General Who Quells the Waves His fathers name was Ma SuMa Su had held a minor magistracy in Tianshui in the reign of Emperor Huan but had lost it and drifted west into Longxi where he got amongst the Qiang Peoples one of whose women he took to wife She bore him a son Ma TengMa Teng was rather over the common height and boldlooking He was of a mild disposition and very popularBut in the reign of Emperor Ling these Qiangs made trouble and then Ma Teng raised a force and put it downFor his services he received the tile of General Who Corrects the West He and Han Sui who was known as Commander Who Guards the West were pledged brothers On receipt of the summons to the capital Ma Teng took his eldest son Ma Chao into his confidence and told him some of his former life When Dong Cheng got the Girdle Edict from the Emperor we formed a society of which Liu Bei was one pledged to put down rebellionHowever we accomplished nothing for Dong Cheng was put to death and Liu Bei was unfortunate while I escaped to the westHowever I hear that Liu Bei now holds Jingzhou and I am inclined to carry out the plan we made so long agoBut here I am summoned by Cao Cao and what is to be done Ma Chao replied Cao Cao has the command of the Emperor to call you and if you do not go that will mean disobeying an imperial command and you will be punishedObey the summons in so far as to go to the capital where you may be able to arrange to carry out your original intention But Ma Tengs nephew Ma Dai held other opinions and opposed thisSaid he Cao Caos designs are unfathomable and if you go Uncle I fear you will suffer Let me lead the army against the capital said Ma ChaoCan we not purge the empire of evil But his father said You must take command of the Qiang troops for the defense of our territory here I will take with me your two brothers and your cousinWhen Cao Cao knows that you have the Qiangs at your call and that Han Sui is prepared to assist he will hardly dare to work any harm to me Father if you must go be careful not to enter the city till you know exactly what plots and machinations are afoot I will certainly take great care so do not be too anxious said the father The order of march was preparedThe governor took five thousand troops with his two sonsMa Xiu and Ma Tieas Leaders of the Van and his nephew Ma Dai bringing up the rear These set out along the tortuous road to the capitalAt seven miles distance from Xuchang they campedWhen Cao Cao heard of Ma Tengs arrival he called to him Minister Huang Kui and said to him Ma Teng is to be sent against the south and I shall send you as Adviser You are first to go to his camp and express my congratulations on his arrival and say that as Xiliang is so distant and transport very difficult he is not to take too large an army of his ownI will send a large forceAlso tell him to come in soon for audience of the EmperorI will send him supplies With these instructions Huang Kui went to Ma Teng who brought out wine and entertained him wellIn his cups the messenger grew confidential and said My father perished at the hands of Li Jue and Guo Si and I have always nourished resentmentNow there is another rebel in power wronging our Prince Who is that asked Ma TengThe wrong doer is that rebel Cao Cao of courseDo you mean to say you do not know However Ma Teng was carefulHe thought it very likely that these words were but a trap for him so he pretended to be greatly shocked and begged his guest to be careful lest he be overheardBut Huang Kui cared not shouting Then you have quite forgotten the Girdle Edict eh Ma Teng began to see Huang Kui was sincere and presently became confidential in turn and told his guest all his schemesCao Cao wants you to go in to audience there is no good intention thereDo not go said Huang KuiYou lead your army up close to the city and get Cao Cao to come and review them and when he comes assassinate him They two settled how this plan could be worked out and the messenger still hot with anger and excitement returned to his homeSeeing Huang Kui so disturbed in mind his wife Lady Zhi asked him what was wrongBut he would tell her nothing However he had a concubine Li Chunxiang And it happened that she had an intrigue with the wifes younger brother Miao Ze who much desired to marry her The concubine who also saw her lords displeasure spoke of it to her paramour and he told her she could probably draw from him what was wrong by a leading question Ask him what is the truth about two men Liu Bei and Cao CaoWho is the wicked one That evening Huang Kui went to the apartments of his concubine and she presently put the question proposed by her loverHer lord still rather intoxicated said You are a woman still you know right from wrong as well as IMy enemy and the man I would slay if I could is Cao Cao But whyAnd if you wish to slay him why do you not do something said she I have done somethingI have settled with General Ma Teng to assassinate Cao Cao at the review Li Chunxiang of course told her paramour who told Cao Cao and Cao Cao made his arrangements to defeat the schemeHe called up his trusty generals and gave them orders for the morrow and this done he arrested Huang Kui and all his householdNext day as arranged Ma Teng and his western troops came close up to the wall and among the flags and banners he discerned that of the Prime Minister himself whereby he knew that Cao Cao would hold the review in personSo Ma Teng rode forwardSuddenly a bomb exploded and at this signal there appeared bodies of armed troops in four directionsright and left front and rear led by Xu Chu Xiahou Yuan Cao Hong and Xu Huang The western forces were quite hemmed inMa Teng then saw the mistake he had made and he and his two sons fought valiantly to free themselves from the trapThe youngest sonMa Tiesoon fell in the volleys of arrows Father and son rode this way and that seeking a way out but failed on every sideBoth were sorely wounded and when their steeds fell from their many arrow wounds both were capturedMa Teng Ma Xiu and the miserable Huang Kui who could not keep his counsel were brought before Cao CaoHuang Kui loudly protested his innocenceCao Cao then called in the witness Miao ZeThat worthless scoundrel has spoiled all my plans cried Ma TengNow I cannot slay the rebel and purge my country But it is the will of God Father and son were dragged forth the father uttering volleys of abuse all the time And so three men were executed in this adventureThe sons and father share one niche of fame For purest loyalty their praise the same To their own hurt the rebels they withstood Content to die to make their pledges goodIn blood the solemn oath they did indite To slay the wicked and preserve the rightA worthy fathers worthy sons by western bride Old Waves Quellers name his grandson glorifiedI desire no other reward than Li Chunxiang as wife said the betrayer Miao ZeCao Cao smiled and said For the sake of a woman then you have brought a whole household to death What advantage would there be in preserving such a miscreant So Cao Cao bade the executioners put both the traitor and the woman to death with Huang Kuis householdThose who saw the fearful vengeance sighed at its crueltyThrough passion base a loyal man was slain And she who shared his passion shared his fate The man they served was pitiless in hate And thus a mean mans treachery was vainCao Cao did not desire to rouse the rancor of the army of Xiliang wherefore he proclaimed to them The intended treachery of your leaders was theirs alone However he sent to secure the passes so that Ma Dai should not escapeAs has been said Ma Dai led the rearguardBefore long the fugitives from the main army came and told him what had occurred at the capitalThis frightened him so much that he abandoned his army and escaped disguised as a traderHaving slain Ma Teng Cao Cao decided to set out on his expedition to the southBut then came the disquieting news of the military preparations of Liu Bei whose objective was said to be the westThis caused him alarm for as he said The birds wings will be fully grown if he obtains possession of the Western Land of Rivers Cao Cao recognized the difficulty but from among his counselors there arose one who said I know how to prevent Liu Bei and Sun Quan from helping each other and both the south and the west will be yours Chill death struck down the heroes of the west Calamity approached the bold leaders of the southThe next chapter will unfold the scheme CHAPTER Ma Chao Launches An Expedition For Revenge Cao Cao Flees The Field In DisguiseWhat is this good plan of yours friend Chen Qun asked Cao Cao of the speaker who was a civilian in his serviceChen Qun replied Your two principal enemiesLiu Bei and Sun Quan are now firm allies close as lips and teeth But Liu Bei wants the Western Land of Rivers and if you O Prime Minister send a mighty host against Sun Quan Sun Quan must ask help from his friend Liu Bei who having his heart set on the west will refuse itSun Quan without this aid cannot stand and will become so weak that the South Land will be yours for the taking and Jingzhou will follow in a tap of the drumThe west will follow and the whole empire is yours Those are my thoughts put into words replied Cao CaoThe expeditionary force of three hundred thousand troops set out for the south Zhang Liao of Hefei was in command of the supply departmentSun Quan speedily heard of the move and called in his advisersAt the council Zhang Zhao said Let us send to Lu Su to tell him to write at once to Liu Bei that he may help usThey are good friends and Liu Bei will certainly respond favorablyBeside since Liu Bei and our lord are now connected by marriage there is no risk of refusalWith the support of Liu Bei there is no danger to our country Sun Quan listened to this advice and sent to Lu Su bidding him to ask help from Liu BeiAccordingly on receipt of this command a letter was written to Liu Bei who after reading it retained the messenger at the guesthouse till Zhuge Liang could arrive from NanjunAs soon as he arrived Liu Bei showed him the letterThe adviser said It is not necessary for the South Lands troops to move nor need we send ours I can prevent Cao Cao from even daring to look in the southeast direction So Zhuge Liang wrote a reply telling Lu Su You can lay aside all anxiety and rest content for if the northern army approach they will be forced backward at once The letter was given to the messenger and then Liu Bei asked his adviser How could the Instructor hope to roll back the huge army of three hundred thousand troops that Cao Cao is preparing to bring south Zhuge Liang replied Cao Caos chief fear is XiliangNow just lately he has slain Ma Teng and his sons as well and the people of Xiliang are grinding their teeth with rageNow you must write and ask Ma Chao to march through the pass and Cao Cao will have no leisure to think of any expedition to the south The letter was written sent by a trusty hand and duly deliveredNow Ma Chao was in Xiliang One night he had a vision In his dream he saw himself lying out on a snowy plain and many tigers were coming up and biting himHe awoke in a fright and began to wonder what the dream portended Failing to explain it he told the dream to his officersOne of them ventured to say the portent was evil This was General Pang DeWhat is your interpretation asked Ma ChaoMeeting with tigers on a snowy plain is a very inauspicious subject to dream aboutAssuredly our old General is in trouble at the capital And at that moment one entered in hot haste and cast himself on the earth weeping and crying The Uncle and his sons are dead It was Ma Dai the nephew of Ma Teng And he told the story of the evil Uncle Ma Teng and Huang Kui had planned to assassinate Cao Cao but the plot had miscarried and become known Ma Tie fell in the battlefield Uncle Ma Teng and Ma Xiu were put to death in the market place and I escaped in disguise Ma Chao fell to the ground and wept bitterly grinding his teeth with rage at his enemy Cao CaoThey lifted him to his feet and led him away to reposeSoon after arrived a messenger with a letter from Liu Bei which read like thisIn these latter days of the hapless Hans when the rebellious and tyrannical Cao Cao monopolizes all power to the injury of the Emperor and the wretchedness of the people I Liu Bei recall that I and your father were recipients of an edict and we swore to exterminate the recreant Now your father has suffered death at the hands of the tyrant and you must avenge himAs the holy books say you cannot let the same sky cover you nor the same sunshine upon you and your fathers murdererIf you can lead your army to attack Cao Cao on one side I will march my armies to prevent his retreat and he will be taken and all his evil crew can be exterminated Then and thus will your father be avenged and the Hans can be restoredI might add more but I will await your reply Wiping his tears Ma Chao wrote a reply which was returned by the bearer The Xiliang army was then mustered horse and foot were assembledJust before the day that had been fixed for the start the Imperial Protector of Xizhou Han Sui sent for Ma Chao to whom he showed a letter from Cao Cao promising the Lordship of Xiliang as a reward for sending Ma Chao a prisoner to the capitalBind us both Uncle and send us thither you need not move a single spear said the younger man prostrating himselfBut Han Sui raised him saying Your father and I were sworn brothers think you I would harm youRather will I help if you are going to fight Ma Chao expressed his gratitude The unhappy bearer of Cao Caos letter was dragged forth and beheaded This done the two took count of their armiesHan Sui had eight divisions under eight commandersYang Qiu Cheng Yin Hou Xuan Liang Xing Cheng Yi Li Kan Ma Wan and Zhang Hengall to be relied upon to follow Han SuiMa Chao had two leaders Pang De and Ma Dai The total force was two hundred thousand troops with which the commanders march to ChanganThe Governor of that city was Zhong Yao As soon as he heard what was afoot he sent a fleet messenger to Cao Cao and prepared for defenseHe led his force out into the open plain and arrayed it for battleMa Dai with fifteen thousand came on first pouring over the countryside like a floodZhong Yao would parley with him but Ma Dai came forward sword in hand to attackHowever the defender did not take the challenge but turned and fledMa Dai followed in pursuitSoon the main body of the invaders arrived and they surrounded the city which Zhong Yao set about defendingChangan had been the capital of the Western Hans and so was well fortified with a solid wall and a deep moat safe against the most terrific attacksThe new armies besieged the city for ten days without successThen Pang De proposed a plan Said he Since the land about the city is barren and the water bitter the people must have communication with the country around in order to live Further they have no fuelTen days of siege must have exhausted the supplies in the city wherefore if we relax for a timewell you will seeWe shall capture the city without moving a finger Your plan seems excellent said Ma Chao when he heard what it wasThereupon they sent orders to each division to retire and Ma Chao covered the retreatNext day Zhong Yao went up on the walls to look around and saw that the besiegers had goneHowever suspecting a ruse he sent out spies who returned to say the soldiers had really moved away to a distanceWherefore he felt much relieved and allowed both soldiers and people to go out into the country to cut the much needed firewood and bring in water The city gates thrown wide open were thronged with those passing in and outThis continued for five days and then they heard that Ma Chaos army was returning A panic ensued The people rushed into the city and the gates were once more barred The General of the west gate was Zhong Jin brother of Zhong YaoAbout the third watch of the night a torch was seen moving just inside the gate and when the General went to see what was wrong and was passing the gateway a man suddenly galloped up and slashed at him with a sword At the same time the attacker shouted Here is Pang De Zhong Jin was taken aback could not defend himself and was cut down The gate guard was soon disposed of the gates were shattered and the soldiers of Ma Chao and Han Sui came pouring inZhong Yao escaped by the opposite gate and left the city in the hands of his enemiesHe reached Tong Pass where he fortified himself and sent news of the misfortune to Cao CaoCao Cao threw aside all plans for his expedition to the south when Changan was lost He at once gave orders Cao Hong and Xu Huang are to march your ten thousand troops to Tong Pass to support Zhong YaoYou are to hold the Pass at all costs for ten days or you will pay for its loss with your headsAfter ten days the Pass will be no concern of yours for I will be there with the main army Cao Ren said Cao Hong short of temper is unfitted to hold the PassEverything could happen Cao Cao replied You will go to reinforce him Cao Hong and Xu Huang made all haste to Tong Pass and took over the command from Zhong YaoThey confined themselves to defense and though Ma Chao appeared every day and reviled and shouted shameful things of the three generations of Cao Caos family the guardians of the Pass remained quietBut Cao Hong fretted at the daily insults and would have led the defenders out to fight had not his colleague restrained him Ma Chao only wishes to provoke you to come out but remember our orders and go notThe Prime Minister has some master plan So spoke Xu HuangBut the advice was hard to follow for Ma Chaos soldiers took turns in reviling the defenders of the Pass resting neither day nor nightAnd Xu Huang found it hard to curb his colleagues impatienceThus it continued till the ninth day Then the defenders saw that their enemies had turned all their horses loose and were lolling about on the grass and sleeping as if quite fatiguedThereupon Cao Hong bade them saddle his horse told off three thousand troops and soon this small force was dashing down to catch the besiegers unpreparedThe soldiers of Ma Chao at once fled leaving their steeds and throwing aside their weaponsCao Hong could not resist pursuit and chased themAt this time Xu Huang was higher up the road taking in cartloads of grain and forage but when he heard what his impulsive colleague had done he hastily got a force together and went to his rescue He shouted to Cao Hong to returnSuddenly a great shouting arose near Xu Huang and out dashed Ma Dai to attackBoth Cao Hong and Xu Huang turned to flee but the drums rolled and two bodies of troops led by Ma Chao and Pang De came out from behind the hills Then a battle began which went against Cao Caos troops from the first They fell fast but some of them cut an arterial alley through the press and made for the PassTheir enemies flooded into the Pass in close pursuit and they had to abandon their post and flee whither they could find a wayPang De pursued after Cao Hong but Cao Ren came to his rescue and they both fledMa Chao and Pang De took the PassCao Hong made all haste to his master to give him the evil tidingsWhen I gave you the limit of ten days why did you leave the Pass on the ninth Those soldiers from Xiliang hurled every sort of insult at us replied Cao Hong And when I thought I had them unprepared I took the opportunity But I fell victim to their cunning You are young and impetuousBut Xu Huang you ought to have known Xu Huang said He would not listen though I told him many timesAnd that day I was taking in stores in another part of the PassAs soon as they told me I felt sure there would be some misfortune and so I hastened after him but it was too late Cao Cao was annoyed and ordered Cao Hong to be put to deathBut his brother officers begged that he might be pardoned and as he had confessed his fault he was allowed to go free and unpunishedCao Cao advanced to Tong PassCao Ren said We should establish a strong stockade before attacking So trees were felled and a strong stockade builtThey made three camps Cao Ren was in the left Xiahou Yuan the right and Cao Cao himself was in the center oneSoon after Cao Cao and all his officers in a body rushed to attack the PassThey ran against the Xiliang troops posted on two sides halted and formed their array This done Cao Cao rode to the center standard whence he looked at his opponentsHe saw before him a body of fine troops every one with the bearing of a heroAnd the leader Ma Chao was worthy of them with his vivid face as if powdered and red lips as if colored his supple hips and broad shoulders his deep voice and fierce strength He was wearing silver helmet and armor and gripping a long spear as he sat there on his chargerPang De and Ma Dai supported him and Cao Cao admired Ma Chao in his secret heartHowever Cao Cao urged forward his steed and shouted to Ma Chao Why are you arrayed against the Hans whom your father and grandfather served faithfully Ma Chao ground his teeth and cursed Cao Cao Rebel Betrayer of both prince and peopleMurderer of my father and brothers My hate for you is to the deaththe same sky shall not continue to cover us for I will take you captive and satiate my appetite on your living flesh With this he set his spear and rode over toward Cao Cao as if to slay him But Yu Jin came out from behind and engaged Ma Chao in battleThese two fought some half score bouts and then Yu Jin had to fleeZhang He however took his place and the two warriors exchanged twenty passes Then Zhang He too ran away Next to come forth was Li TongMa Chaos martial prowess was now at its height and he made short work of Li Tong who went out of the saddle at the first blowThen Ma Chao flourished his spear at the troops behind him as a signal for them to come on which they did like a floodThey overwhelmed Cao Caos forces and Ma Chao Pang De and Ma Dai rode forward to try to capture Cao Cao They came closeCao Cao heard one of his pursuers shout to another Cao Cao is he in the red dress So he hastily tore off his red robe and threw it awayHe also heard one say Cao Cao is he with the long beard At once Cao Cao took the sword that he wore at his side and sawed off some of the beardYet again a soldier recognized him and told Ma Chao that Cao Cao had now cut his beard whereupon the order went forth to capture short beardsAnd then Cao Cao wrapped the corner of a flag about neck and jowl and fledPanic seized upon the soldiers at Tong Pass Frightened Cao Cao flung off his brocade robe And terrorstricken sawed his beard off with a sword The fame of Ma Chao rose even to the skyCao Cao had got clear of the battle and was getting calmer Then again the sound of hoofs fell upon his ears and on looking round he perceived Ma Chao quite closeHe and those near were panicstricken and all scattered for their lives careless of the fate of their generalCao Cao do not flee cried Ma Chao coming nearerThe whip dropped from Cao Caos nerveless hand as he saw his enemy coming closer and closerBut just as Ma Chao had leveled his spear for a thrust Cao Cao slipped behind a tree changed the direction of his flight and so escaped while Ma Chao struck the treeHe quickly pulled out his spear but the delay gave the fugitive an advantage although it did not quite free him from pursuit for Ma Chao was soon again galloping on his trackAs they drew near the slope of some hills a bold general suddenly appeared who cried Do not hurt my lord This was Cao Hong and he went toward Ma Chao whirling his swordMa Chao was stopped and this saved Cao Caos lifeCao Hong and Ma Chao fought half a hundred bouts till Cao Hong began to grow weary and become uncertain of his strokesAnd when shortly after Xiahou Yuan appeared with some thirty horsemen Ma Chao found it prudent to retireThen Cao Cao was escorted to his camp defended by Cao Ren He found the camps were still unharmed and the losses had not been greatAs he sat in his tent Cao Cao said Had I not spared Cao Hong I should have fallen at the hands of Ma Chao today So he called in his rescuer and rewarded him wellAnd they got together the scattered troops and strengthened the camp deepening the moat and raising the rampartMa Chao came daily and challenged any one to combat and abused them all shamefully but by the order of the Prime Minister these insults were treated with silent contemptOur enemies use long spears said the officersWe will meet them with bows and crossbows They may have long spears replied Cao Cao but whether I give battle or not depends on my decision How can they thrust at us if we do not go outAll you have to do is to take no notice of them and they will speedily retire The officers wonderedThey said one to another The Prime Minister came out on this expedition of his own will and was foremost in the fight why does he accept defeat so easily After some days the spies reportedMa Chao has been reinforced by twenty thousand Qiangs the tribespeople beyond the frontier Cao Cao took the news gleefullyHis officers asked him why the news pleased him and he replied Wait till I have defeated them and I will explain Three days later there was a report of further reinforcements and Cao Cao not only smiled but gave a banquetHis officers ridiculed him in secretThen said Cao Cao You gentlemen laugh because I cannot destroy Ma ChaoWell then can any one of you propose a plan Then rose Xu Huang and said O Prime Minister you have a large force here and the enemy are strongly posted beyond the Pass This means that on the west side of River Wei they are unpreparedIf you can get an army secretly across the river and block the ferry you will cut off their retreat and if you can smite them on the north side of the river they can get no reinforcements and must fail What you propose is just what I think said Cao CaoSo Xu Huang was placed over four thousand troops and with Zhu Ling marched to the west of River Wei and hid in the gullies They were to wait till Cao Cao crossed the river to the north so that both could strike togetherThen Cao Cao ordered Cao Hong to prepare boats and rafts at the Reed Ferry Cao Ren was left in command of the campsCao Cao himself crossed River Wei and when Ma Chao heard of the new military movements he said I understandThe Pass is left rafts are being prepared that means that he is going to cross to the north side and cut off my retreatI must coast along the river and keep him off If I can do that his food will run short within twenty days and that will cause a mutiny I will travel along the south bank and attack Han Sui did not approve this planHe quoted the military maxim to strike when troops were half over the river Attack from the south bank when his army is in the act of crossing and his army will be drowned in the river said heUncle your words are good replied Ma ChaoAnd the spies went forth to find out the time of crossing the riverWhen Cao Caos preparations were complete and all was ready he sent three parties of soldiers over the river firstThey reached the ferry at the first sign of dawn and the veterans were sent over first and lay out a campCao Cao and his guard took up station on the south bank to watch the crossingVery soon the sentinels reported A general dressed all in white is approaching Everyone knew it must be Ma Chao This terrified them and they made a rush to get into the boatsThe river bank became a scene of shouting men struggling who could first embarkCao Cao sat watching and never stirred He only issued orders to stop the confusion Meanwhile the yelling of the troops and the neighing of the horses of the approaching army came nearer and nearerSuddenly a general jumped out of one of the boats and shouted to Cao Cao The rebels are closeGet into a boat O Prime Minister The rebels are near why not replied Cao Cao simply to the speaker who was Xu ChuAnd he turned round to look at them As a fact Ma Chao was very close not a hundred paces away and Xu Chu laid hold of Cao Cao and dragged him down the bank The boat had already pushed off and was ten spans from the bank but Xu Chu took Cao Cao on his back and leaped on boardThe boat was small and in danger of being overturned wherefore Xu Chu drew his sword and chopped away at the hands clinging to the side so that the soldiers fell back into the waterThe boat went down stream Xu Chu standing in the prow poling as hard as he couldHis master crouched out of sight at his feetWhen Ma Chao saw tile boat in midstream drifting down with the current he took his bow and arrows and began to shoot He also ordered his brave generals to go along the river and shoot so that a shower of arrows fell about the boatXu Chu fearing Cao Cao would be wounded protected him with a saddle which he held over him with his left hand for Ma Chaos shooting was not in vainMany of the soldiers working the boat were wounded Some had fallen overboard while more lay in the bottom of the boatThe boat itself got out of control and was whirled hither and thither by the currentXu Chu straddled over the tiller and tried thus to guide the boat while he poled with one hand and with the other held the protecting saddle over Cao Caos headThen the Magistrate of Weinan Ding Fei who from a hill top saw that Cao Cao was very closely pressed even in danger of his life drove out from his camp all the cattle and horses there so that they scattered over the hillside This was too much for the born Qiang herdsmen of the plains At sight of the beasts they left the river and ran off to secure the cattle Nor had they any inclination to pursue their enemyAnd so Cao Cao escapedAs soon as they reached the northern shore the boat was scuttledThe rumor had spread that Cao Cao was on the river and in danger so all his officers came to his aid But he was now safe on shoreXu Chus double armor was stuck full of arrowsThe officers escorted Cao Cao to the camp where they made their obeisance and expressed the hope that he had not suffered seriouslyThe rebels very nearly caught me today said he smilingThey would have got across the river had they not been enticed away by the freeing of the cattle and horses said Xu ChuWho was it that drew them off said Cao CaoSome one who knew told himBefore long Magistrate Ding Fei came in to pay his respects and Cao Cao thanked himI should have been a prisoner but for your happy thought said heAnd the Magistrate received a rank of Commander in the army Though they have gone yet they will assuredly return tomorrow said Ding FeiYou must prepare to repel them My preparations are all made was the replyCao Cao ordered his generals to spread themselves along the river bank and throw up mounds as shelters for camps If they saw the enemy approaching the soldiers were to be withdrawn from behind the mounds leaving the ensigns all flying so as to give the impression that each camp contained a garrisonAlong the river they were to dig ditches and put up sheds thus to entice the enemy there and their army would stumble into the pits and fall easy victimsMa Chao returned to Han Sui and told him saying I would have captured Cao Cao but a certain bold general had taken him on his back and leaped with him into a boat Han Sui replied I have heard that Cao Cao had a body guard of the bravest and strongest soldiers under the command of Dian Wei and Xu Chu They are called the Tiger GuardsNow as Dian Wei is dead the man you saw must have been Xu ChuHe is both brave and powerful and goes by the name of TigerLustYou will do well to avoid him I know his name too said Ma Chao Cao Cao now means to attack our rear continued Han Sui let us attack first before he can establish camps and stockadesIf once he can do that it will be difficult to dislodge him My idea is that we should hold the north bank and prevent him from crossing Worthy nephew keep guard here while I go along the bank of the river and fight Cao Cao If you will take Pang De as your van leader I am content said Ma ChaoSo Han Sui and Pang De with fifty thousand troops went away down to the River Wei while Cao Cao again warned his generals to entice the enemyPang De was in advance with a goodly squadron of ironclad horsemen and they burst along at full speedThen there arose a confused shouting as they all went plunging into the ditches prepared for themPang De soon leaped out gained the level ground and laid about him with all his might He slew many Cao Caos soldiers and presently got out of the thick of the fightBut Han Sui had also been involved and Pang De went afoot to try to aid himOn the way he met Cao Yong a general of Cao Ren Pang De cut Cao Yong down Then mounting the dead mans steed he rode forward fiercely slaying as he passed He reached his leader whom he led away southeastThe troops of Cao Cao pursued him but Ma Chao came with reinforcements and drove them offHe rescued a great number and they continued fighting till evening when they withdrew and mustered their troopsTwo commanders Cheng Yin and Zhang Heng were missing and a couple of hundred soldiers had been killed when they fell into the pits Ma Chao and Han Sui discussed what should next be done If we give the enemy time he will make himself strong on the north bankI think we can do no better than to raid his camp tonight said Ma Chao We must have a force and supports for it said Han SuiSo it was decided that Ma Chao should lead the striking force with Pang De and Ma Dai as supports They would start at nightfallNow Cao Caos troops were on the north bank of the River Wei and he gave his generals orders saying The rebels will try to surprise us as they are deceived by my not having set up stockadesYou will place your soldiers in ambushAt the bomb signal you will rush out from four directions to capture them At nightfall Ma Chao sent out a small scouting party headed by Cheng Yi Seeing nothing Cheng Yi penetrated deep into the enemys lines Presently a bomb was explodedOut leapt the hidden troops and in a few moments the whole scouting party were killedCheng Yi was cut down by the blade of Xiahou YuanBut close at hand came the main army led by Ma Chao Ma Dai and Pang De that rushed into the ambush forces Wait for the foe all undismayed Place your men in ambuscadeGenerals striving to outvie Are not beaten easily Who got the advantage will presently be toldCHAPTER Xu Chu Strips For A Fight With Ma Chao Cao Cao Writes A Letter To Sow DissensionThe fight narrated in the last chapter lasted till morn when each side drew off Ma Chao camping on the River Wei whence he kept up harassing attacks both day and nightCao Cao also camped in the bed of the same river began to construct three floating bridges out of his rafts and boats so as to facilitate communication with the south bankCao Ren established a camp on the river which he barricaded with his carts and wagonsMa Chao determined to destroy this camp so his troops collected straw and each man marched with a bundle and took fire with him Han Suis forces were to fight While one party attacked the other party piled up the straw which they lit and soon there was a fierce fire all aroundThe defenders could do nothing against it so they abandoned the camp and ran awayAll the transport and bridges were destroyedIt was a great victory for the Xiliang army and gave them the command of the River WeiCao Cao was sad at the failure to make good his strong camp and fearful of his defenselessness Then Xun You proposed a mud wallSo three thousand soldiers were set to build a mud rampart The enemy seeing this harassed the workmen with perpetual attacks at different points so that the work went slowlyBeside the soil was very sandy and the wall would not stand but collapsed as fast as it was built Cao Cao felt helplessIt was the ninth month of the sixteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  and the fierce cold of winter was just coming on Ominous clouds covered the sky day after day with never a breakOne day as Cao Cao sat in his tent very disheartened a stranger was announced and was led inHe was an old man who said he had a suggestion to offerHe was tall as delicate as a crane and as refined as a pine treeHe gave his name as Lou Zibo and said he came from Jingzhao He was a recluse and a Taoist his religious name being PlumBlossom DreamerCao Cao received him with great courtesy and presently the venerable one began saying O Prime Minister you have long been striving to make a camp on the riverNow is your opportunity why not begin The soil is too sandy to stand said Cao CaoBut if you have some other plan to propose pray tell me what it is O Hermit You are more than human O Prime Minister in the art of war and you surely know the times and seasonsIt has been overcast for many days and these clouds foretell a north wind and intense coldWhen the wind begins to blow you should hurry your army to carry up the earth and sprinkle it with water By dawn your wall will be complete Cao Cao seized upon the suggestionHe offered his aged visitor a reward but the venerable one would receive nothingThat night the wind came down in full forceEvery man possible was set to earthcarrying and wettingAs they had no other means of carrying water they made stuff bags which they filled with water and let out the water over the earthAnd so as they piled the earth they froze it solid with water and by dawn the wall was finished and stood firmWhen his scouts told Ma Chao that the enemy had built a wall he rode out and saw itMa Chao was greatly perplexed and began to suspect help from the godsHowever very soon after he got his whole army together and sounded an attackCao Cao himself rode out of the camp with only the redoubtable Xu Chu in attendance and advanced toward the enemyFlourishing his whip he called out I Cao Cao am here alone and I beg Ma Chao to come out to parley with me Thereupon Ma Chao rode out his spear set ready to thrustYou despised me because I had no wall to my camp but lo in one single night God has made me a wallDo you not think it time to give in Ma Chao was so enraged that he almost rushed at Cao Cao but he was not too angry to notice the henchman behind him glaring in angry fashion who held a gleaming sword in his grip Ma Chao thought this man could be no other than Xu Chu so he determined to find outWith a flourish of his whip he said Where is the noble Marquis Tiger that I hear you have in your camp At this Xu Chu lifted his sword and roared I am Xu Chu of Qiao From Xu Chus eyes shot gleams of supernatural light and his attitude was so terrorstriking that Ma Chao dared not moveHe turned his steed and retiredCao Cao and his doughty follower returned to their camp and as they two passed between the armies not a man there but felt a quiver of fearThey know our friend Xu Chu over there as Marquis Tiger said Cao Cao when he returnedAnd thereafter the soldiers all called Xu Chu by that name I will capture that fellow Ma Chao tomorrow said Xu ChuMa Chao is very bold said his masterBe careful I swear to fight him to the death said Xu ChuThen Xu Chu sent a written challenge to his enemy saying that the Marquis Tiger challenged Ma Chao to a decisive duel on the morrow Ma Chao was very angry when he received the letterDare he insult me so cried heThen he wrote his pledge to slay TigerLust on the morrowNext day both armies moved out and arrayed in order of battleMa Chao gave Pang De and Ma Dai command of the two wings while Han Sui took the centerMa Chao took up his station in front of the center and shouted Where is the TigerLust Cao Cao who was on horseback by the standard turned and said Ma Chao is no less bold than Lu Bu As he spoke Xu Chu rode forth whirling his sword and the duel beganThey fought over a hundred bouts and neither had the advantageBut then their steeds being spent with galloping to and fro each retired within his own lines and obtained a fresh mountThe contest was renewed and a hundred more encounters took place still without victory to eitherSuddenly Xu Chu galloped back to his own side stripped off his armor showing his magnificent muscles and naked as he was leaped again into the saddle and rode out to continue the battle Again the champions engaged while both armies stood aghastThirty bouts more and Xu Chu summoning up all his force plunged toward Ma Chao with his sword held high to strikeBut Ma Chao avoided the stroke and rode in with his spear pointing directly at his opponents heartThrowing down his sword Xu Chu dashed aside the spear which passed underneath his armThen ensued a struggle for the spear and Xu Chu by a mighty effort snapped the shaft so that each held one half Then the duel was continued each be laboring the other with the pieces of the broken spearAt this point Cao Cao began to fear for his champion and so ordered two of his generals Xiahou Yuan and Cao Hong to go out and take a handAt this Pang De and Ma Dai gave the signal to their armored horsemen to attackThey rode in and a melee began in which Cao Caos troops were worsted and the great champion Xu Chu received two arrow wounds in the shoulderSo the troops of Cao Cao retreated to their stockade Ma Chao following them to the riverCao Caos army lost more than half their numberCao Cao barred his gates and allowed none to go outMa Chao went down to the river When he saw Han Sui he said I have seen some wicked fighters but none to match that Xu ChuHe is aptly nicknamed TigerLust Thinking that by strategy he might get the better of Ma Chao Cao Cao secretly sent two bodies of troops across the river to take up position so that he might attack in front and rearOne day from his ramparts Cao Cao saw Ma Chao and a few horsemen ride close up to the walls and then gallop to and fro like the windAfter gazing at them for a long time Cao Cao tore off his helmet and dashed it on the ground saying If that Ma Chao is not killed may I never know my place of burial Xiahou Yuan heard his master and his heart burned within himHe cried May I die here at once if I do not destroy that rebel Without more ado Xiahou Yuan flung open the gates and rode out with his companyCao Cao tried to stop this mad rush but it was no good so fearing Xiahou Yuan might come to grief Cao Cao rode out after himAt sight of the soldiers of Cao Cao Ma Chao faced his troops about extended them in line and as the enemy approached dashed forward to the attackThen noticing Cao Cao himself among them Ma Chao left Xiahou Yuan and rode straight for Cao CaoPanic seized Cao Cao and he rode for his life while his troops were thrown into confusion It was during the pursuit of this portion of the Cao Caos army that Ma Chao was told of a force of the enemy on the west of River Wei Realizing the danger he abandoned the pursuit called in his forces and went to his own camp there to consult with Han Sui What now Cao Cao has went to the west of the river and we can be attacked in the rear said Ma ChaoCommander Li Kan said Then you would better come to an agreement sacrifice some territory and make peace Then both can repose through the winter and await the changes and chances that may come with the spring warmth He is wise said Han Sui and I advise the same But Ma Chao hesitated Others exhorted him to make peace and at length he agreedSo Yang Qiu and Hou Xuan were sent as messengers of peace to the camp of Cao CaoYou may return I will send my reply said Cao Cao when they had declared the purport of their missionAnd they leftThen Jia Xu said to Cao Cao What is your opinion O Prime Minister What is yours asked Cao CaoWar allows deceit therefore pretend to agreeThen we can try some means of sowing suspicions between Han Sui and Ma Chao so that we may thereby destroy both Cao Cao clapped his hands for very joy saying That is the best idea of all Most suitableYou and I agree in our ideas I was just thinking of that So an answer was returnedLet me gradually withdraw my soldiers and I will give back the land belonging to you on the west of the river And at the same time Cao Cao ordered the construction of a floating bridge to help in the withdrawalWhen the reply arrived Ma Chao said to Han Sui Although he agrees to peace yet he is evil and craftyWe must remain prepared against his machinationsUncle you and I will take turns in watching Cao Cao and Xu Huang on alternate daysSo shall we be safe against his treachery They agreed and began the regular alternate watchSoon Cao Cao got to know what they were doing and he turned to Jia Xu saying I am succeeding Who keeps the lookout on this side tomorrow asked Cao CaoHan Sui replied some oneNext day Cao Cao at the head of a large party of his generals rode out of the camp and the officers presently spread out right and left he himself remaining a solitary rider visible in the centerHan Sui did not know that Cao Cao had come outPresently Cao Cao called out Do any of you soldiers want to see Cao Cao Here I am quite aloneI have not four eyes nor a couple of mouths but I am very knowing The soldiers turned pale with frightThen Cao Cao called up a man and told him to go and see Han Sui and say Sir the Prime Minister humbly asks you to come and confer with him Thereupon Han Sui went out and seeing Cao Cao wore no armor Han Sui also threw off his and rode out clad in a light robeEach rode up to the other till their horses heads nearly touched and there they stood talkingSaid Cao Cao Your father and I were granted filial degrees at the same time and I used to treat him as an uncleYou and I set out on our careers at the same time too and yet we have not met for yearsHow old may you be now I am forty replied Han SuiIn those old days in the capital we were both very young and never thought about middle ageIf we could only restore tranquillity to the state that would be a matter of rejoicing After that they chatted long about old times but neither said a word on military mattersThey gossiped for a couple of hours before they took leave of each otherIt was not long before some one told Ma Chao of this meeting and he went over to his ally to ask about itWhat was it Cao Cao came out to discuss today  said Ma Chao He just recalled the old days when we were together in the capital Did he say nothing about military matters Not a word and I could not talk about them alone Ma Chao went out without a word but he felt suspiciousWhen Cao Cao returned to his camp he said to Jia Xu Do you know why I talked with him thus publicly It may be an excellent idea said Jia Xu but it is not sufficient simply to estrange two peopleI can improve on it and we will make them quarrel and even kill each other What is your scheme Ma Chao is brave but not very astuteYou write a letter with your own hand to Han Sui himself and put in it some rambling statements about some harm that is going to happen Then blot it out and write something else Afterwards you will send it to Han Sui taking care that Ma Chao shall know all about it Ma Chao will demand to read the letter and when he sees that the important part of the letter has been changed he will think that Han Sui has made the changes lest his secrets should leak outThis will fit into the private talk you had with Han Sui the other day and the suspicion will grow until it has brought about troubleI can also secretly corrupt some of Han Suis subordinates and get them to widen the breach and we can settle Ma Chao The scheme looks excellent said Cao CaoAnd he wrote the letter as suggested and then erased and changed it after which he sealed it securely and sent it across to Han SuiSurely enough some one told Ma Chao about the letter which increased his doubts and he came to Han Suis quarters to ask to see itHan Sui gave it to him and the erasures and alterations struck Ma Chao at once Why are all these alterations here asked heIt came like that I do not know Does any one send a rough draft like thisIt seems to me Uncle that you are afraid I shall know something or other too well and so you have changed the wording It must be that Cao Cao has sealed up the rough draft by mistake I do not think soHe is a careful man and would not make such a mistakeYou and I Uncle have been allies in trying to slay the rebel why are you turning against me now  If you doubt my word I will tell you what you can doTomorrow in full view of the army I will get Cao Cao to come out and talkYou can hide in behind the ranks ready to kill me if I am false That being so I shall know that you are true Uncle This arrangement made next day Han Sui with five generals in his train Li Kan Ma Wan Yang Qiu Hou Xuan and Liang Xingrode to the front while Ma Chao concealed himself behind the great standardHan Sui sent over to say that he wished to speak to the Prime MinisterThereupon at his command Cao Hong with a train of ten horsemen rode out advanced straight to Han Sui leaned over to him and said loudly enough to be heard plainly Last night the Prime Minister quite understoodLet there be no mistake Then without another word on either side Cao Hong rode away Ma Chao had heardHe gripped his spear and started galloping out to slay his companion in armsBut the five generals checked him and begged him to go back to campWhen Han Sui saw him he said Nephew trust me really I have no evil intentions But Ma Chao burning with rage went awayThen Han Sui talked over the matter with his five generals How can this be cleared up Ma Chao trusts too much to his strength said Yang QiuHe is always inclined to despise you Sir If we overcome Cao Cao do you think he will give way to youI think you should rather take care of your own interests go over to the Prime Ministers side and you will surely get rank one day I was his fathers pledged brother and could not bear to desert him said Han Sui It seems to me that as things have come to this pass you simply have to now Who would act as gobetween asked Han SuiI will said Yang QiuThen Han Sui wrote a private letter which he confided to Yang Qiu who soon found his way over to the other campCao Cao was only too pleased and he promised that Han Sui should be made Lord of Xiliang and Yang Qiu its GovernorThe other confederates should be rewarded in other ways Then a plot was plannedwhen the preparations for the act of treachery were complete a bonfire was to be lighted in Han Suis camp and all would try to do away with Ma ChaoYang Qiu went back and related all this to his chief and Han Sui felt elated at the success of his overtures A lot of wood was collected in camp at the back of his tent ready for the signal blaze and the five generals got ready for the foul deed It was decided that Ma Chao should be persuaded into coming to a banquet and there they would slay him then All this was done but not without some hesitation and delay and some news of the plot reached Ma Chao He found out the careful preparations that had been made and resolved to act firstLeaving Ma Dai and Pang De in reserve he chose a few trusted leaders and with stealthy steps made his way into Han Suis tentThere he found Han Sui and his five confederates deep in conversation He just caught a word or two that Yang Qiu said We must not delay now is the time In burst Ma Chao raging and yelling You herd of rebelsWould you dare to plot against me They were taken aback Ma Chao sprang at Han Sui and slashed at his faceHan Sui put up his hand to ward off the blow and it was cut offThe five drew their swords and set on Ma Chao and his men who rushed outsideSoon Ma Chao was hemmed in by the five but he kept them at bay by wonderful swordsmanshipAnd as the swords flashed the red blood flowed Soon Ma Wan was down and Liang Xing disabled then the other three fledMa Chao ran back into the tent to finish Han Sui but the servants had removed himThen a torch was lit and soon there was commotion all through the campMa Chao mounted his horse for Pang De and Ma Dai had now arrived and the real fight beganCao Caos troops poured in from all sides and the Xiliang soldiers fought with each otherLosing sight of his companions Ma Chao and a few of his followers got to the head of the floating bridge over the River Wei just about dawnThere he fell across Li Kan coming over the bridge Ma Chao set his spear and rode at him full tiltLi Kan let go his spear and fledLucky for him it seemed at first that Yu Jin came up in pursuitBut unable to get near enough to seize Ma Chao Yu Jin sent an arrow flying after himMa Chaos ear caught the twang of the bowstring and he dodged the arrow which flew on and killed Li KanMa Chao turned to attack his pursuer who galloped away and then he returned and took possession of the bridgeQuickly Cao Caos troops gathered about him and the fiercest among them the Tiger Guards shot arrows at Ma Chao which he warded off with his spear shaft so that they fell harmless to the earth Ma Chao and his troops rode to and fro striking a blow wherever there was a chance but the enemy were very thick about him and he could not force his way out In desperation he cut an arterial alley northwards and got through but quite alone Of his followers everyone fellStill he kept on dashing this way and that till he was brought down by a crossbow boltHe lay upon the ground and his enemies were pressing inBut at the critical moment an army came in from the northwest and rescued himPang De and Ma Dai had come up in the very nick of time Thus Ma Chao was rescued and they set him on one of the soldiers horses and he again took up the battle Leaving a trail of blood in his rear he got away northwestHearing that his enemy had got away Cao Cao gave order to his generals Pursue him day and night and rich rewards are for him dead or aliveFor his head the rewards are a thousand ounces of gold and the lordship of a fief of ten thousand familiesIf any one captures Ma Chao the reward is the rank of general Consequently the pursuit was hot as every one was anxious to win renown and rewardMeanwhile careless of all but flight Ma Chao galloped on and one by one his followers dropped by the wayThe footmen who were unable to keep up were captured till very few remained and only some scores of riders were left They traveled toward Lintao a city in LongxiCao Cao in person joined the pursuit and got to Anding but there Ma Chao was still far in advance so he gave up and returned Gradually the generals did the same all coming back to ChanganPoor Han Sui with the loss of his left hand was an invalid but he was rewarded with the Lordship of XiliangYang Qiu and Hou Xuan were given noble ranks and offices in WeikouThen orders were given to lead the whole army back to the capitalYang Fu a military adviser from Liangzhou came to Changan to point out the danger of withdrawalMa Chao has the boldness of Lu Bu and the heart of a barbarianUnless you destroy him this time he will come again and he will be both bolder and stronger and the whole west will be lostWherefore you should not with draw your army Cao Cao said I would be quite willing to finish the subjugation but there is much to do in the capital and the south is still to conquer So I cannot remainBut you Sir might secure this country for me Do you consents Yang Fu did consentAnd he brought to Cao Caos notice Wei Kang who was made Imperial Protector of Liangzhou with joint military powersJust before Yang Fu left he said to Cao Cao A strong force ought to be left in Changan as a reserve in case they be required That has been already dealt with replied Cao CaoContentedly enough Yang Fu took leave and went away Cao Caos generals asked him to explain his recent policy saying Since the first outbreak at Tong Pass O Prime Minister the north bank of River Wei was undefended Why did you not cross to the north bank from the east of the riverBut instead you engaged in the attack of the Pass for many days before crossing to the north bank And he replied The rebels first held the Pass Had I forthwith taken the east of the river the rebels would have defended the camps one by one and mustered at all the ferries and I should never have got across the river to the north bankSo I massed troops against Tong Pass and made the rebels guard the south bank so that the west of the river was left open Thus Xu Huang and Zhu Ling could move there and I was able later to cross over to the northThen I made the raised road and the mud rampart to deceive the enemy and cause them to think I was weak and thus embolden them up to the point of attacking without proper preparationThen I used the clever device of causing dissension in their ranks and was able in one day to destroy the stored up energy of all their forcesIt was a thunder clap before you could cover your ears Yes indeed the mutations of the art of war can be called infinite But one thing more puzzled us said the officers and we ask you to explain itWhen you heard the enemy was reinforced you seemed to grow happierWhy was that Because Tong Pass is distant from Xuchang and if the rebels had taken advantage of all defensible points and held them they could not have been quelled in less than a couple of yearsWhen they came on altogether they made a multitude but they were not unanimous They easily quarreled and disunited were easily overcomeSo I had reason to rejoice that they came on altogether Indeed no one can equal you in strategy said his officers bowing low before himStill remember that I rely on you said Cao CaoThen he issued substantial rewards to the army and appointed Xiahou Yuan to the command at Changan The soldiers who had surrendered were distributed among the various troopsXiahou Yuan recommended Zhang Ji of Gaoling as his aidsSo the army returned to Capital Xuchang where it was welcomed by the Emperor in state chariotAs a reward for his service Cao Cao was given the court privileges of omitting his distinctive name when he was received in audience and of proceeding toward the court without assuming the appearance of frantic haste Further he might go to court armed and booted as did the Han Founding Minister Xiao He of oldWhence his prestige and importance waxed mightilyThe fame of these doings penetrated west into Hanzhong and one of the first to be moved to indignation was Zhang Lu Governor of HanningThis Zhang Lu was a native of Pei He was a grandson of Zhang Ling who retired to Mount Humming in the Eastern Land of Rivers where he had composed a work on Taoism for the purpose of deluding the multitudeYet all the people respected Zhang Ling and when he died his son Zhang Heng carried on his work and taught the same doctrinesDisciples had to pay a fee in rice five cartsThe people of his day called him the Rice ThiefZhang Lu his son styled himself Master Superior and his disciples were called Commonly Devil SoldiersA headman was called Libationer and those who made many converts were called Chief LibationersPerfect sincerity was the ruling tenet of the cult and no deceit was permittedWhen any one fell ill an altar was set up and the invalid was taken into the Room of Silence where he could reflect upon his sins and confess openly Then he was prayed forThe director of prayers was called Superintending LibationerWhen praying for a person they wrote his name on a slip and his confession and made three copies thereof called The writing of the Three Gods One copy was burned on the mountain top as a means of informing Heaven another was burned to inform Earth and the third was sunk in water to tell the Controller of the WatersIf the sick person recovered he paid as fee five carts of riceThey had Public Houses of Charity wherein the poor found rice and flesh and means of cooking Any wayfarer was allowed to take of these according to the measure of his appetiteThose who took in excess would invite punishment from on highOffenses were pardoned thrice afterwards offenders were punishedThey had no officials but all were subject to the control of the LibationersThis sort of cult had been spreading in Hanzhong for some thirty years and had escaped repression so far because of the remoteness of the regionAll the Government did was to give Zhang Lu the title of General Who Guards the South and the post of Governor of Hanning and take means to secure from him a full quota of local tributeWhen the reports of Cao Caos success against the west and his prestige and influence reached the Hanzhong people Zhang Lu met with his counselors saying Ma Teng has died and Ma Chao defeated thus the northwest has fallen Cao Caos next ambition will be the southwest and Hanzhong will be his first attackI should act first by assuming the title of Prince of Hanzhong and superintending the defense In reply one Yan Pu said The army of this region counts one hundred thousand and there are ample supplies of everything The Eastern Land of Rivers is a natural stronghold with its mountains and riversNow Ma Chaos soldiers are newly defeated and the fugitives from the Ziwu Valley are very numerous We can add them to our army by several tenthousands moreMy advice is that as Liu Zhang of Yiazhou is weak we should take possession of the fortyone counties of the Western Land of Rivers and then you may set up your sovereign as soon as you like This speech greatly pleased Zhang Lu who then began to concert measures with his brother Zhang Wei to raise an armyStories of the movement reached Yiazhou whose Imperial Protector was Liu Zhang A son of Liu Yan a descendant from Prince Gong of the Imperial HousePrince Gong had been moved out to Jingling several generations ago and the family had settled thereLater Liu Yan became an official and when he died in due course his son was recommended for the vacant Protectorship of YiazhouThere was enmity between Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu for Liu Zhang had put to death Zhang Lus mother and brotherWhen he knew of the danger Liu Zhang dispatched Pang Xi as Governor of Baxi to ward off Zhang LuBut Liu Zhang had always been feeble and when he received news from his commander of Zhang Lus movements his heart sank within him for fear and he hastily called in his advisersAt the council one haughtily said My Master be not alarmed I am no genius but I have a bit of a healthy tongue and with that I will make Zhang Lu afraid even to look this way When plots did grow about the west It suited Jingzhous plans the best The speakers name and lineage will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER Zhang Song Turns The Tables On Yang Xiu Pang Tong Proposes The Occupation Of ShuThe man who proposed the plan spoken of in the last chapter was Zhang Song who belonged to Yiazhou and held the small office of Supernumerary CharioteerHis appearance was grotesque He had a broad forehead protuberant at the temples like a countrymans hoe and a pointed head His nose was flat and his teeth protruded He was a dwarf in stature but had a deep voice like a great bellWhat proposal have you to offer that may avert this danger asked the Imperial ProtectorMy proposal is that we gain the support of Cao Cao As we know he has made a clean sweep of the empire Lu Bu went first and both the Yuans followed all exterminated Lately he has destroyed Ma Chao In short he is the one man against whom no one can standTherefore my lord prepare me worthy gifts to take to the capital and I will get Cao Cao to march an army against Hanzhong which will keep this Zhang Lu occupied so that we shall be left alone This met Liu Zhangs views and so he prepared gold and pearls and rich stuffs worthy presents for the man of power And when these were ready he appointed Zhang Song his emissaryZhang Song in the meantime occupied his leisure in secretly copying maps and plans of the west country When all was ready he started with a small escortThey heard this in Jingzhou and Zhuge Liang sent a trusty person to the capital to keep him informed as to all the doingsZhang Song arrived in Xuchang and after he had established himself in his lodging he made daily visits to the Prime Ministers palace to try to obtain an interviewBut the last success had filled Cao Cao with insufferable pride and he did nothing but give banquets He never appeared except for the most important affairs and even carried on the business of the state in his own residence So Zhang Song waited many daysBut when he got to know the persons who were nearest the Prime Minister he bribed them and obtained an audienceCao Cao was seated in the high place and after his visitor had finished his salutations he said Your master Liu Zhang has sent no tribute for several years why Because the roads are dangerous and thieves and robbers infest themIntercourse is restricted Cao Cao interrupted in a loud harsh voice saying What thieves and robbers are there when I have cleansed the empire How can you say the land is tranquil when one sees Sun Quan in the south Zhang Lu and Liu Bei in the west and every one of these with armies reckoned in legionsThe weakest of them has one hundred thousand troops The mean appearance of the emissary had prejudiced Cao Cao from the outset and when Cao Cao heard these blunt words he suddenly shook out his sleeves rose and left the hallThose in attendance were annoyed with Zhang Song and said How can you behave so rudely when you come on a mission Your whole attitude was blunt and discourteousHappily for you our lord remembered you had come from afar and did not take open notice of your faultThe best thing for you is to go home again as quickly as you can But Zhang Song smiled We have no plausible flatterers and glib talkers in our western country said heAt this one from below the steps called out So you call us plausible and glib then and you have none such in your country eh Zhang Song looked around and saw the speaker was a man with thin delicate eyebrows crossing narrow eyes set in a pale spiritual faceHe asked his name It was Yang Xiu son of the former Regent Marshal Yang Biao The young man was then employed as Chief of the Secretariat of the Prime MinisterHe was deeply read and had the reputation of being a clever controversialist as Zhang Song knewSo on one side was a desire to confound and on the other overweening pride in his own ability with contempt for other scholarsPerceiving the ridicule in Zhang Songs speech Yang Xiu invited him to go to the library where they could talk more freely There after they had got settled in their respective places Yang Xiu began to talk about the west Your roads are precipitous and wearisome said Yang XiuBut at our lords command we travel even through fire and water we never decline replied Zhang SongWhat sort of a country is this Yiazhou Yiazhou is a name for the group of western counties and territories known of old as the state of ShuThe roads are intersected by streams and the land bristles with steep mountainsThe circuit is over two hundred stations and marches and the area over one hundred thousand square milesThe population is dense villages being so close that the crowings of cocks in one waken the people in the next and the dogs barking in this excite the curs in thatThe soil is rich and well cultivated and droughts or famines are equally unknownProsperity is general and the music of pipes and strings can always be heardThe produce of the fields is piled mountain highThere is no place its equal But what of the people Our administrators are talented as Sima Xiangru our soldiers able as Ma Yuan our physicians are expert as Zhang Ji our diviners are profound as Yan ZunOur schools of philosophy and our culture stand forth as models and we have more remarkable people than I can enumerate How should I ever finish the tale of them And how many such as you Sir do you think there are at the orders of your Imperial Protector Our officers are all geniuses wise bold loyal righteous and magnanimousAs for poor simpletons like me they are counted by hundreds there are cartloads of them bushels of themNo one could count them What office may you hold then Zhang Song replied Mine can hardly be called an office I am a Supernumerary CharioteerBut Sir what state affairs may you control I am the First Secretary in the Palace of the Prime Minister replied Yang XiuThey say that members of your family held office for many generations and I do not understand why you are not in court service actually assisting the Emperor instead of filling the post of a mere clerk in the private palace of the Prime Minister Yang Xius face suffused with shame at this rebuke but he mastered himself and replied Though I am among the minor officials yet my duties are of great importance and I am gaining experience under the Prime Ministers guidanceI hold the office for the sake of the training Zhang Song smiled saying If what I have heard is true Cao Caos learning throws no gleaming light on the way of Confucius or Mencius nor does his military skill illumine the art of Sun Zi or Wu Qi He seems to understand the doctrine of brute force and holding on to what advantages he can seize but I see not how he can give you any valuable training or enlighten your understanding Ah Sir that comes of dwelling in outoftheway partsHow could you know of the magnificent talents of the great Prime MinisterBut I will show you something Yang Xiu called up an attendant and bade him bring a book from a certain caseHe showed this to his guest who read the title The New Book of Cao CaoThen Zhang Song opened it and read it through from the beginning the whole thirteen chapters They all dealt with the art of warWhat do you take this to be asked Zhang Song when he had finishedThis is the great Prime Ministers discussion of the art of ancient and modern war composed on the model of Sun Zis Treatise on the Art of WarYou may be disdainful of the Prime Ministers talents but will this not go down to posterity This book Every child in Yiazhou knows this by heart What do you mean by calling it a new bookIt was written by some obscure person of the time of the Warring States and Cao Cao has plagiarized itBut he has deceived no one but you Sir But what is the use of your sarcastic insult in saying that your school children know the book by rote It has never been given to the world although copies have been made It belongs to his private library Do you disbelieve me Why I know it and could repeat it Then Zhang Song repeated the whole book word for word from beginning to endYang Xiu said You remember it like this after only one readingReally you are marvelous He boasted not a handsome face Nor was his body blessed with graceHis words streamed like a waterfall He read a book and knew it allShus glories could he well rehearse His lore embraced the universeOr text or note of scholiast Once read his memory held fastAt leavetaking Yang Xiu said Remain a while in your lodgings till I can petition our Prime Minister to give you another interview Zhang Song thanked him and leftBy and bye Yang Xiu went to see Cao Cao on the matter of receiving the emissary from the west and said Sir why did you formerly treat Zhang Song so offhand He spoke very rudely that is why But you bore with Mi Heng why not with this man Mi Hengs reputation for scholarship stood highest of all and I could not bear to put him to deathBut what ability has this Zhang Song To say nothing about his speech being like the River of Heaven nothing daunts his talent for dialecticI happened to show him your new treatise he read it over once and could repeat it From this it is evident he is cultured and has a prodigious memory There are few like him in the worldBut he said the book was the work of an obscure person of a few hundred years back and every school child in his country knew it It only shows that the ancients and I are in secret sympathy replied Cao CaoHowever Cao Cao ordered the book to be torn up and burnedThen may I bring him to see you Sir that he may see the glory of our court Cao Cao grudgingly consented saying I am reviewing troops tomorrow on the western parade ground You may bring him there and let him see what my army looks like He will be able to talk about it when he goes homeWhen I have dealt with the south I shall take the west in hand Hence the very next day Yang Xiu took Zhang Song over to the west parade ground where a review of the Tiger Guard was to be heldThere were fifty thousand of them and when drawn up in order they made a very brave show with their gleaming helmets and bright new uniformsTheir drums rolled to shake the heavens and their weapons glittered in the sunTheir discipline and order were perfect their gay banners fluttered in the breeze They looked ready to fly even so alert and smart were theyZhang Song glanced at them contemptuouslyAfter a long time Cao Cao called up Zhang Song and pointing to his army said Have you ever seen such fine bold fellows in Yiazhou We never see this military parade in Yiazhou we govern the people by righteousness Cao Cao changed color and looked hard at the bold speaker who gazed back at him without the least sign of fearYang Xiu shot a quick glance at Zhang Song but Cao Cao went on saying I regard the ratclass of the world as of no more importance than so many weeds and for my army to reach a place is to overcome it to give battle is to conquer to besiege is to take Those who are with me live but those who oppose me dieDo you understand O Prime Minister I know well that when you march out your army you always conquerI knew it when you attacked Lu Bu at Puyang and when you fought Zhang Xiu at Wancheng and when you met Zhou Yu at the Red Cliffs and when in Huarong Valley encountered Guan Yu and on that day when you cut off your beard and threw away your robe at Tong Pass and when you hid in a boat to escape the arrows on the River WeiOn all these occasions no one could stand against you It made Cao Cao very angry to be thus twitted with his misfortunes and he said You stuckup pedantHow dare you thus bring up all my failures Cao Cao called to his attendants to eject the bold disputant and put him to deathYang Xiu ventured to argue with him saying You may behead him but he came from the west bearing tribute and his death would have a very evil effect on all distant peoples But Cao Cao was too angry to be reasonable and persistedHowever Xun Yu also remonstrated and Zhang Song was not put to deathBut he was beaten and ejectedHe returned to his lodging and left the city that night reflecting upon what he had intended and what he had accomplished Thought he I did not expect such arrogance when I came with the intention of giving him a regionWhen I get back Liu Zhang will expect great thingsNow I am returning empty handed and a failure to endure the laughter of my fellow country people I will not go backI have heard of the virtues of Liu Bei and I will go to him and see what manner of man he is Then I can decide what to do So with his little escort and following he made for JingzhouHe had reached the boundaries of Wuchang when he met a body of horsemen at the head of whom rode a general in simple undress who pulled up saying Surely you are the Charioteer Zhang Song I am he said Zhang SongThe general quickly dismounted and humbly said I have expected you these many daysI am Zhao Yun Zhang Song dismounted and returned the salutation saying Then you are no other than the Fine Man of Changshan No other was the replyAnd my lord Liu Bei bade me await you here and offer you refreshment after your long and toilsome journey At this some soldiers brought forward wine and food which they offered kneelingZhang Song said I am come because the world says Liu Bei is liberal and kindly disposed After a few cups of wine the two retook the road toward Jingzhou City which they neared next day at evening They went to the guesthouse Here they found a large number of people who received the visitor with the beating of drums and every sign of respectAnd the officer in command bowing low said My brother sent me to meet you after your long and dusty journey and prepare the guesthouse for your receptionMy name is Guan Yu So Zhang Song and Zhao Yun dismounted and entered the guesthouse where hosts and guest exchanged formal salutations and took their seatsIn a short time refreshments were served and both men were most diligent in their attention to the travelerThis roadside banquet was prolonged to the time of setting the watch when they prepared for restNext morning after the early meal they mounted and continued their journeyVery soon they met Liu Bei himself with an escort and his two chief advisers deferentially standing by the roadsideAs soon as he recognized them Zhang Song dismounted and walked toward them Liu Bei received him with extreme respectYour exalted name has been long known to me said Liu Bei it has reverberated through my earsMy one regret is that cloudy hills and long distances have hitherto prevented me from enjoying the advantage of your instructionHearing that you were passing through I have come to meet you and if you would be willing to notice me and condescend to rest for a time in my city thus allowing me to satisfy my long disappointed desire to see you I should indeed hold myself fortunate Naturally the travelers vanity was tickled and he joyfully remountedThey rode bridle to bridle into the cityWhen they reached the residence again they exchanged profound salutations and compliments before they took their various places as host and guest And then a banquet was servedBut all throughout Liu Bei refrained from saying a word about the west he only chatted on general and common things The visitor noted this steady avoidance and resolved to probe his hosts thoughtsHow many counties are there in Jingzhou where you are now O Imperial Uncle Zhuge Liang replied Jingzhou is only ours temporarily we have borrowed it from the South Land They are always sending messengers to demand its returnHowever now that our lord has married their daughter his position is more secureBut it is still temporary The South Land is large said Zhang Song yet their six territories and their eightyone counties do not satisfy themThe people are strong and the land is fruitful Said Pang Tong Our lord being of the dynastic family has never occupied a territory of the empireThose others thievish as they are may indeed seize upon as much territory as they are strong enough to hold but such deeds are not according to the wise persons heart Noble Sirs pray say no more what virtue have I that I should expect anything from the future said Liu BeiNot so indeed said Zhang SongIllustrious Sir you are of the lineage of Han your noble character is widely knownNo one could say that your fate excludes all thoughts of occupying territory where you might begin to set up authority and take an emperors position Liu Bei deprecated such a suggestion Sir you go too far this really is too much The next three days were spent in banquets and wine parties but all the time no mention was made of the Western Land of RiversAnd when at the end of that time Zhang Song took leave his host was at the threemile parting road to bid him farewell and offer refreshment When the moment came for the parting Liu Bei raised his winecup and said I am sincerely grateful that you deigned to come hereYou have prolonged your visit to three days but now the moment of parting has comeWho knows when I may have the privilege of receiving your instructions again As Liu Bei said this the tears flowed but he hid them while Zhang Song willing to believe that this emotion was on his account thought how wonderfully kind and noble his host must be to be thus affectedQuite overcome Zhang Song decided to speak about the westSo he said I have thought that I too would come to you one day but so far I have found no wayIn Jingzhou I see Sun Quan on the east always ready to pounce I see Cao Cao on the north greedy to swallow So this is not a wholly desirable place for you to remain in I know this but too well said Liu Bei but I have no secure place to go to Yiazhou is well protected has much fertile soil is populous and well governedIts scholars are attracted by your virtueIf you marched your armies westward you could easily become a real power there and restore the glory of the Hans But how dare I attempt thisThe ruler is also of the Imperial HouseThe whole region is devoted to him for his good deeds and no other person could attain such a hold I am no traitor said Zhang Song but in your presence I feel constrained to be perfectly open and plainLiu Zhang the Imperial Protector of Yiazhou is naturally weak and can neither use the wise nor employ the capable Then again Zhang Lu threatens the northPeople are distracted and would gladly welcome an appreciative rulerThe journey I have just made was to propose to support Cao Cao and place the region under him but I found him rebellious and set on evil proud and arrogant So I have turned aside to youIf you will take Yiazhou you will have a base from which to deal with Hanzhong when you will and the whole country beside You will continue the rightful line and your name will live in historyWould not that be real fame If then you think of taking our country I am willing to do what little I can as an ally withinBut do you contemplate such a step I am deeply grateful that you think so well of meBut the Imperial Protector being a member of the family I should lay myself open to general execration were I to attack him When a hero finds himself in the world his duty is to work out his destiny to exert himself and perform his task as best as he can to press forward among the foremostAt the moment the position is that if you fail to seize this opportunity some other will take possession of Yiazhou and you will regret when too late And I have heard much of the difficult nature of the country its many high mountains and numerous streams and its narrow roadsHow could such a country be invaded Then Zhang Song drew the map from his sleeve saying I am so deeply affected by your virtue that I offer you this map of the country whereby its roads and rivers may be known Liu Bei unrolled the map it was covered with notes on the lie of the land lengths and widths and such matters Strategic points on rivers and hills were shown and storehouses and granaries and treasuries Everything was plainly statedZhang Song went on Sir you can prepare your plans promptlyI have two friends who will certainly help you And when they come to see you you may be perfectly frank with themTheir names are Fa Zheng and Meng Da Liu Bei thanked him with joined hands Said he As the blue mountains grow not old and the green waters always remain so shall I never forgetAnd when I shall have accomplished my task you shall have no mean reward Replied Zhang Song I look for no rewardHaving met with an enlightened lord I felt compelled to unbosom myself to him Zhang Song left soon after and Guan Yu escorted him for several milesAfter arrival in Yiazhou Zhang Song lost no time in sending for his friends Fa Zheng and Meng DaThe former was the first to come and he was told of Cao Caos arrogance and haughtiness toward humans of parts As for the man himself said Zhang Song he is a man to grieve with but not a person to rejoice withI have promised Yiazhou to Liu Bei the Imperial Uncle and I want your especial advice and assistance I think Liu Zhang is incapable said Fa Zheng and I have felt drawn to Liu Bei for some time pastSo we are in sympathy here Shortly after Meng Da arrivedMeng Da and Fa Zheng were fellow townsmenWhen Meng Da entered the room and saw the other two in earnest and secret conversation he said I know what you two are about you are scheming to hand over Yiazhou to somebody It is really so you have guessed right said Zhang SongBut to whom ought it to go said Fa Zheng There is but oneLiu Bei said Meng DaAll three clapped their hands and laughedThen said Fa Zheng to Zhang Song You will see our lord tomorrow what about that I shall recommend that you two be sent to Jingzhou on a mission They thought that a suitable schemeAnd when the lately arrived messenger saw his master and was asked how he had fared Zhang Song said Cao Cao is a rebel who desires to get the whole empire into his hands I need hardly tell you thatBut he also hankers after this region Then what will become of us said Liu Zhang I have a plan to check both our enemiesLiu Bei the Imperial Uncle now in Jingzhou is a relative of yours and he is generous and well disposed This is a matter of common knowledgeCao Cao was simply overwhelmed at the result of the battle at the Red Cliffs and Zhang Lu more soNow my plan is that you ally yourself with your distinguished relative against Cao Cao and Zhang Lu I have been thinking thus for a longtime can you recommend a suitable emissary The only ones are Fa Zheng and Meng Da These two were summoned and meanwhile a letter was preparedFa Zheng was to proceed as emissary to open up friendly relations and Meng Da would follow in due course with an army to welcome Liu Bei into the Western Land of RiversWhile still discussing the details of the policy a person forced his way in his face all running with sweat and cried out My lord your land of fortyone counties will be lost to you and pass to another if you listen to Zhang Song Zhang Song turned a startled look on the intruder who was Huang Quan of Xiliang First Secretary in the Imperial Protectors palaceThe Imperial Protector said Why do you use such languageLiu Bei is of my family and so I am seeking his support Said Huang Quan I know all about him he is liberal minded to gain people to his side and his softness can overcome the hardest He is bolder than any otherHe gains humans hearts from afar off and those near him look up to him He also has the wisest advisers and the boldest warriorsBut if you call him here as a soldier think you that he will be content to remain in a lowly conditionAnd if you treat him as an honored guest can a state stand two rulersHear me my lord and you stand secure as Taishan Mountains be deaf to my words and your position is as precarious as a pile of eggsThis Zhang Song has lately come home through Jingzhou where he has certainly been plotting with Liu BeiSlay this man and make an end of Liu BeiThat will be for the happiness of this land But how else am I to fend off my two enemies Fortify your country dig out your moats and raise your rampartsThen you can wait on events If these rebels invade this land the position will be critical as when fire singes ones eyebrowsIt is idle talk to tell me to wait on events No notice was taken of Huang Quan and Fa Zheng was about to set out when another interfered crying No no This was a secretary Wang LeiWith bowed head Wang Lei stood and said My lord will bring misfortune upon himself if he listens to this Zhang Song Not so I make an alliance with Liu Bei in order to withstand Zhang Lu Zhang Lus invasion would be but a skin diseaseLiu Beis entry into this country would be a mortal maladyLiu Bei is an unscrupulous brave he was once in Cao Caos service and plotted against himThen he hung on to Sun Quan and seized JingzhouThis shows his character and his designs Think you that you two can dwell together If you invite him then Shu is lost No more wild talk cried Liu Zhang angrily Liu Bei is of my clan and family and will not ravish me of my possessions He bade the guards escort both men outside and ordered Fa Zheng to set outSo he did and before long came to JingzhouWhen the salutations were over Fa Zheng presented his letter which Liu Bei opened and read I Liu Zhang a younger brother of our family now write to General Liu Bei From my humble place long have I gazed in your direction but the roads of the Western Land of Rivers are precipitous and I have failed to send my tributeThis is to my shame The victims of misfortune aid each other and those in trouble support each other If friends act thus how much more should members of the same familyNow Zhang Lu is mustering an army of invasion on my northern frontier much to the injury of my tranquillityWherefore I send this letter that you may know of my distress and if you remember the kindly bonds of family and will play a brotherly part and lead your armies to destroy these ruffians you will be my eternal protector and I shall be ever gratefulThis letter leaves much unsaid but I await your coming This letter greatly pleased Liu BeiHe made a banquet for the bearer thereof and when they had mellowed themselves with wine he dismissed the attendants and spoke to Fa Zheng in confidence Friend I have long admired you and Zhang Song extolled your virtuesI shall always feel grateful for this opportunity of hearing you Fa Zheng bowed saying That is too great praise for a humble emissary from ShuBut they say that horses always neighed in recognition of Bo Le the supreme judge of horses and when a person has found his lord he dies for himHave you thought further of Zhang Songs proposals General I have always been a wanderer often in suffering and sorrowI have often thought of the wren for even that tiny bird has a twig to rest on and of the cunning hare that secures safety with three openings to its burrow Does not a person need at least a shelterYour land of the west is fertile and a temptation but its ruler is of my family and I cannot plot against him Yes Yiazhou is a very paradise But without a ruler it cannot existLiu Zhang knows not how to use the wise people and his heritage must speedily pass to anotherToday it is offered to your hands and you must not miss the opportunityYou know the saying that the leader in the hunt gets the quarry If you will only consent I will serve you to the death Liu Bei signified his gratitudeSaid he Let me reflect for a time and take advice The banquet terminated and the guest leftZhuge Liang conducted Fa Zheng to his lodging while his master sat thinkingThen Pang Tong said You must decide not to decide is foolishYou are of high intelligence my lord and why do you hesitate What should my reply be asked Liu Bei You know these surroundings and with them you cannot attain your endsNow before you lies a populous fertile and rich land a base with the greatest possibilitiesYou have the promise of assistance from two men within and it seems like a gift of providence Why hesitate Now there are two men in the world as mutually antagonistic as fire and waterMy opposite is Cao CaoHe is impetuous and I am long suffering he is cruel and I am humane he feigns while I am trueIn all particulars I act the direct contrary to himI refuse to risk the loss of the confidence and trust of the world for a trifling advantage Pang Tong smiled at these sentiments saying My lords words are quite in accord with abstract rectitude but such ideas scarcely suit the days of rebellionThere are other ways of fighting than with warlike weapons but to adhere too obstinately to the idea of abstract rectitude is to do nothingOne must be an opportunist annex the weak and attack the willfully deluded seize the recalcitrant and protect the docile These were the teachings of the great Kings Tang and WuIf after the settlement you reward with righteousness and make of the land a great country will you be guilty of a breach of trustRemember if you do not take it now another will Liu Bei a prey to confused emotions replied These words are as jewels they should be engraved on my very heart Thereupon he summoned Zhuge Liang to settle the details of an army to march westZhuge Liang said This is an important place and must be very well defended Liu Bei replied I Pang Tong and my two generals Huang Zhong and Wei Yan will go into the west you and our three best generalsGuan Yu Zhang Fei and Zhao Yuncan defend Jingzhou Guan Yu was told off for Xiangyang and the narrow pass at Qingni Zhang Fei commanded four cities along the river and Zhao Yun camped at JianglingFor the march westward Huang Zhong led the van Wei Yan had the rearguard while Liu Bei moved in the center with Liu Feng and Guan Ping as his aidsPang Tong was Commander of the whole army Just as the fifty thousand troops were starting there came Liao Hua to offer his service he and his troops were attached to Guan YuIt was in the winter that the expedition startedSoon they met the force under Meng Da five thousand soldiers to act as escort into YiazhouLiu Bei informed Liu Zhang that he had started and the latter sent orders to the counties along the road to entertain them well on the marchThe Imperial Protector proposed to go out in person to welcome Liu Bei and ordered carriages to be prepared and tents and banners All the escort were dressed in glittering armorAt this Secretary Huang Quan the sturdy opponent of the invitation to Liu Bei again remonstrated My lord if you go out you will be exposed to danger I have been in your service for many years and I would prevent you from being the victim of anothers wilesI pray you reflect Zhang Song said His words are those of one who would sow discord in a family and encourage the power of the robbers who threaten youAssuredly such action is to your detriment Liu Zhang then spoke angrily to Huang Quan saying I have decided and why do you oppose me The objector bowed his head and weptThen approaching nearer he seized hold of the Imperial Protectors robe with his teeth to hinder himLiu Zhang angrily shook his robe and rose from his seat but Huang Quan still held on till two of his teeth fell outThen the guards forced him away and he retired still cryingAs Liu Zhang was starting another man cried My lord do you neglect the loyal words of your faithful Huang Quan to go to your death And he threw himself prostrate at the steps in remonstranceHe was Li Hui of JianningThe prince may have ministers who remonstrate with him and the father may have children who oppose said Li HuiHuang Quan has spoken faithfully and you ought to listenTo let Liu Bei into this land is to welcome the tiger into your gates Liu Bei is my brother and will not harm me said the Imperial ProtectorAnd any other who shall oppose me shall suffer death So Li Hui was thrust outThe officers of Shu regard the safety of their families and no longer render you serviceThe generals are arrogant and each has some scheme of his own to furtherIf you do not get Liu Bei to oppose the enemy without and your own people oppose you within surely you are on the road to ruin So spoke Zhang Song and the Imperial Protector replied I know the plan is for my advantage Whereupon he mounted his horse to ride out to Elm Tree Bridge Then a messenger reported to himWang Lei has suspended himself head downwards at the city gate In one hand he holds a written remonstrance and in the other a knife And he says that if you heed him not he will cut the rope and die at your feet Liu Zhang went to the gate took the writing and readGood medicine is bitter in the mouth but good for the disease faithful words offend the ear but are good for the conductOf old King Huai of Chu listened not to Qu Yuan but attended the meeting at Wu Pass and was captured by the state of QinSir you are thoughtlessly leaving your place to go to welcome Liu Bei but I fear there is a way out and none inCould you but behead Zhang Song in the market place and have nothing to do with this league with Liu Bei it would be for the happiness of old and young and assure the safety of yourself Anger rose in Liu Zhangs breast as he readWhy do you insult me when I go to meet a kindly man I feel as if I were about to enjoy the delight of seeing brother At this Wang Lei gave a great cry severed the rope and fell to the ground battered and dead Head downwards at the city gate one hung A last remonstrance in his outstretched hand Resolved that were his words rejected he Would not survive defeatSincere was he Who desperate held to Liu Zhangs silken robe Until his broken teeth released their grip Sincere indeed but how can he compare With stern Wang Lei who went to awful deathLiu Zhang with thirty thousand troops went out to welcome his clansman and there followed one thousand wagons laden with supplies and rich stuffsLiu Beis advanced guard had arrived at River MoonstoneDuring the march the people had brought presents and Liu Bei had given an order to pay for everything under penalty of death for disobedienceThus no one suffered and the people came out in trusting crowds to watch the soldiers marching by and welcome them in every wayLiu Bei soothed them with very gracious wordsThen Fa Zheng secretly showed Pang Tong a letter from Zhang Song advocating the assassination of Liu Zhang near the place of welcomePang Tong said Say nothing about this after the two Lius have met there may be opportunities but this is too early to talkAny plot would leak out So nothing was saidFucheng where the meeting was to take place was one hundred twenty miles from Capital Chengdu Liu Zhang arrived first and sent messengers to welcome Liu BeiThe two armies camped on the bank of River FuLiu Bei went into the city to see the Imperial Protector and they met cordially as brothers shouldBoth shed a few tears and by and bye they began a hearttoheart talkThen followed a banquet and after this each returned to his own campThe Imperial Protector said How ridiculous have been proved the fears of Huang Quan and Wang Lei They do not understand the force of family affectionI see he is really a kindly and noble man and with him as a support I shall fear neither Cao Cao nor Zhang LuAnd I owe all this to Zhang Song To show his gratitude Liu Zhang took off the green silken robe he wore and sent it as a gift to Zhang Song together with five hundred ounces of gold However some of his officers were not so content and a group of them bade him bewareDo not rejoice too soon O Master said they for Liu Bei is hard enough within in spite of his mild exteriorYou have not sounded him yet and should be on your guard You are all too anxious said Liu Zhang laughing my brother is no doubledealer I am sure When Liu Bei had returned to his own tent Pang Tong came in to ask what impression he had of his host of that dayHe seems a very honest man said Liu Bei He is good enough but some of his servants are discontented at this turn of affairs and I would not guarantee there will be no murders If you took my advice you would have Liu Zhang assassinated at the return banquetA hundred ruffians behind the arras a signal from you and the deed would be accomplished All that would be needed then would be a rush on Capital ChengduNo sword need be drawn no arrow fitted to the string He is a brother of my house and has treated me with sincerityI am a newcomer and so far unknown in this landSuch a deed would be abhorrent to all the world and these people would resent itI will not establish myself by such means The scheme is not mine it originated in a private letter from Zhang Song who says it will have to be done some time At this moment Fa Zheng came in and said This is not for ourselves it is the will of heaven Liu Zhang and I are of the same house and I would shudder at harming him Sir you are wrongIf you act not as we propose then Zhang Lu will take Shu in revenge for the death of his mother What is there for you at the end of your long march Advance and success is yours retreat and you have nothingAnd delays are most dangerousAt any moment this scheme may leak out and another will reap the profit This is the day when Heaven smiles on you Act before Liu Zhang suspects you establish yourself So urged Fa Zheng and Pang Tong backed itTheir lord by argument they tried From rectitude to turn aside What Liu Bei hid in his heart will be explained in the next chapterCHAPTER  In The River Zhao Yun Recovers Liu Shan With One Letter Sun Quan Repulses Cao CaoIn spite of the persuasion of Pang Tong and Fa Zheng Liu Bei steadily refused to sanction the assassination of his host at the banquet Imperial Protector Liu Zhang even if thereby he was to gain possession of the Western Land of RiversThe next day there was another banquet this time in the city of Fucheng whereat host and guest unbosomed themselves freely to each other and became exceedingly friendly and affectionateAll were mellow with wine and Pang Tong talking with Fa Zheng said Since our master will have nothing to do with our scheme we would better set Wei Yans swordplay to work and take advantage of the confusion to kill Liu Zhang Wei Yan came in shortly afterward with his sword drawn and said There being no other entertainment at this banquet may I show you a little fencing to amuse you Thereupon Pang Tong called up some of the armed guards and ranged them along the lower part of the hall till Wei Yan should fall onAt these preparations the officers of Liu Zhang stared with questioning eyes toward the chief seats at the upper end and one of them Zhang Ren drew his sword saying An opponent is needed to make fencing a success so he and I will display our skill at the same time So they beganPresently at a glance from Wei Yan Liu Feng came up and took position at his side At once three of the commanders of the west followed suit saying And we three will come in too it may add to your amusement and help to raise a laugh But to Liu Bei matters began to take on a serious lookDrawing a sword of a servant he stood out in the banquet hall and cried We brothers have perhaps honored our meeting with a little too much wine there is nothing to say against that but this is no Hongmen Banquet where murder was donePut up your swords or I will slay you Why wear swords at all at a meeting of two brothers cried Liu Zhang at the same time telling his servants to surround his officers and take away their weaponsDisarmed they sulkily withdrew and then Liu Bei called all the generals of Liu Zhang to the upper end of the banquet hall gave them wine and said You need have no doubts we two brothers of the same bone and blood have talked over the great design and we are one in purpose The officers bowed and retiredLiu Zhang took his guest by the hand saying Brother I shall never forget your kindness They sat drinking till late both feeling very happyWhen at length Liu Bei reached his camp he blamed his strategist for having caused the confusion Why did you endeavor to force me into committing a great wrong said Liu BeiThere must be no repetition of this Pang Tong retired sighingWhen Liu Zhang reached his own camp his leaders waited on him and said Sir you saw the real meaning of that occurrence at the banquet we supposeWe think it prudent for you to retire at once into the city My brother is different from ordinary humans replied Liu Zhang He may not incline toward murder himself but those about him have but one desirethat is to exploit this land of ours to their own advantage Do not try to sow dissension between us and make us quarrel said their chief And Liu Zhang took no heed of their remonstranceOne day when he and Liu Bei were enjoying together relaxation from cares of state the news came that Zhang Lu was about to invade the Western Land of Rivers at the Jiameng Pass Thereupon the Imperial Protector begged Liu Bei to go and defend itLiu Bei consented and left immediately with his own especial bandAt once Liu Zhangs officers took advantage of the guests departure to urge the Imperial Protector to place his own trusty generals in command at various strategic points so as to guard against any attempts of the visitors to seize the landAt first Liu Zhang was unwilling and refused but as they prayed him most earnestly to do this he yielded and consented to take some steps to safeguard himself He sent Yang Huai Commander of Baishui and Gao Pei to garrison River Fu PassSo Liu Zhang returned to Chengdu and his guest Liu Bei went away to the point where invasion threatenedArrived there Liu Bei soon won the hearts of the people by the strict discipline he maintained over his army and by his gracious mannerNews of these doings in the west duly reached the south and Sun Quan summoned his counselors as to his countermoveThen Gu Yong spoke saying I have an infallible plan to propose Liu Bei and his army are now far away and separated from us by difficult country Therefore he cannot return quickly and my advice is to occupy the passes so that he cannot get through Then send all your force against Jingzhou and Xiangyang and they will surely fall to you The plan seems excellent said Sun QuanBut just then a voice was heard from behind the screen crying You may just put to death the man who proposed that scheme for trying to compass the death of my daughter Every one started with surprise It was the Dowager Marchioness voiceFurther Lady Wu looked very angry as she entered saying What is to become of my only daughter who is the wife of Liu Bei She turned her wrathful eyes to Sun Quan and said You were heir to your father and brother and obtained possession of all these lands without the least effortYet you are dissatisfied and would forget the claims of your own flesh and blood and sacrifice your sister for the sake of adding a little to your lands No no murmured Sun Quan ashamedI would never think of going contrary to my mothers wishes and orders He abruptly dismissed the assembly and when they had gone the old lady still nursing her wrath retired to her own apartments Left alone beneath the portico Sun Quan sighed sadly This chance missed When will Jingzhou be mine thought heWhile still deep in reverie Zhang Zhao came up saying What grieves my lord No great matter only this last failure to gain my ends The difficulty may be easily removed said Zhang ZhaoChoose some trusty man and charge him with a secret letter to Princess Sun Ren saying that her mother is dangerously illGive him five hundred men as escort and tell him to make his way privily into Jingzhou City and deliver the letter Hearing her mother wants her she will rush home at once and she might bring with her the only son of Liu Bei Liu Bei will be glad enough to exchange Jingzhou for his sonIf he will not you can still send the army That sounds like a good plan said Sun Quan Further I have the man to carry it out successfullyHe is that Zhou Shan who was a bold one He used to accompany my brother in his youthHe is the man to go Keep it a secret then said Zhang Zhao and let Zhou Shan start quickly It was decided that Zhou Shan should take with him about five hundred soldiers disguised as ordinary traders He had five vessels and distributed his men among them while weapons were hidden in the holdsPapers were was forged to look like veritable authority in case they were askedZhou Shan set out along the river route for the city of Jingzhou and was not long on the wayHe anchored his ships under the bank landed and went into the city to the residence where he bade the doorkeepers announce himHe was admitted and led into the presence of Lady Sun and presently gave her the secret letterWhen she read that her mother was in danger of death she began to weep bitterly and questioned the messenger closelyZhou Shan invented a story saying The Dowager Marchioness is really fretting for a sight of yours and if you do not go quickly it will be too lateThe Dowager Marchioness also wants to see little Liu Shan once before she dies Lady Sun replied You know that the Imperial Uncle is far away on military service and I ought to inform the chief of the army before returning home But what will you do if the chief says he must inform your husband and await his consent said Zhou ShanIf I went without asking permissionbut I fear that is impossible My ships are all ready in the river and you have only to drive through the city said Zhou ShanNaturally the news of her mothers illness greatly disturbed the young wife In a short time her carriage was ready and she mounted taking Liu Shan with herShe took an escort of thirty guards all armed and was soon at the river side and had embarked before the palace people could report what she was doingBut just as the ships were starting a voice was heard shouting Do not start yet let me bid my lady farewell The voice was Zhao Yuns he had just returned from an inspection trip and they had at once told him of Lady Suns sudden departureAs soon as he had recovered from his surprise he dashed down to the river bank like a whirlwind with only half a dozen followers He arrived only just in time the boat was starting and Zhou Shan stood in the prow a long spear in his handWho are you that you dare hinder the movements of your mistress cried Zhou ShanZhou Shan bade his soldiers cast off and get under way and also to prepare their weapons to fightThe ship moved off with a fair wind and a strong current beneath her keelBut Zhao Yun followed along the bankMy lady may go or not as she pleases cried he but I have one word to say to her Zhou Shan turned a deaf ear and only urged his soldiers to get greater speed on the shipZhao Yun followed down the bank for some three or more miles Then he saw a fishing boat made fast to the bankHe at once dismounted cast off the rope took his spear and leaped into the boatThen he made the two men row him toward the vessel in which sat Lady SunAs he approached the soldiers of the South Land threatened him with their spearsThereupon he threw his spear into the bottom of the boat drew the glittering steel blade he wore dashed aside the opposing spears and leaped upon the larger vessel The guards of the South Land fell back in surprise and fear and Zhao Yun went down into the body of the shipThere sat Lady Sun with little Liu Shan in her arms Why this rude intrusion said she angrilyThe warrior sheathed his sword and said humbly Whither may my mistress be going and why goes she privily My mother is ill and on the point of death I had no time to inform any person of my departure said Lady SunBut why take the young master if you are going merely to see a sick person said Zhao YunLiu Shan is my son and I would not leave him behind to be neglected Mistress you have acted wronglyMy lord has but this one son of his body and I rescued the child lord from among many thousand troops of Cao Cao in the great battle at Long Slope Bridge in DangyangThere is no reason for you to take him away Lady Sun took refuge in anger You leave my family affairs alone you common soldier cried sheMy lady if you will go then go but leave the young master behind You are a rebel jumping on board the ship like that cried Lady SunIf you will not leave the young lord behind I refuse to let you go come what may said Zhao YunLady Sun called in her maids to seize him but he just pushed them off Then he took the boy from her arms and ran out to the prow of the shipHe tried to get the vessel in to the bank but no one would aid him and he thought it would be wrong to begin to slay indiscriminately He knew not what to do in such a quandaryAnd Lady Sun was screaming to her maids to take the boy away from him But he kept too firm a grip on the child and the good sword in his other hand kept every one at bayZhou Shan was at the helm giving all his attention to getting the ship out into the current and away down the riverHe steered for the middle of the stream where the wind was strongZhao Yun one hand taken up with holding the boy was quite unable to get the vessel in toward the shoreJust as things looked most desperate Zhao Yun saw a string of ships filing out from a creek lower down the stream flags fluttering and drums beatingHe thought that certainly all was over and he was about to fall a victim to a stratagem of the South Land when he noticed a mighty warrior standing in the prow of the leading craft He was armed with a long spear and it was Zhang Fei Zhang Fei also shouted SisterinLawLeave the child lord Zhang Fei had been out scouting when he heard the news of his sisterinlaws sudden departure and he at once made for the River Yu with the intention of intercepting her flight He had arrived just in the nick of time to cut off the ships of the South Land Very soon sword in hand he had boarded the vesselAs Zhang Fei came on board Zhou Shan drew his sword and advanced toward him but one sweep of Zhang Feis blade laid him on the deck dead And the grim warrior hung his head at the feet of Lady SunWhy this very unseemly behavior cried Lady Sun now quite frightenedSister said Zhang Fei you thought very little of my brother when you set out on this mad journeyThat was behaving rudely My mother is very ill it is a matter of life and death cried she If I had waited for your brothers permission to go I should have been too lateIf you do not let me go now I will throw myself into the river Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei took counsel togetherThey said to each other It is hardly the correct thing for servants to force their lords wife into committing suicideSuppose we keep the child and let the vessel go Then they said O Lady we cannot allow the wife of our exalted brother to die a death of shame and so we will take our leaveWe trust you will not forget our brother and that you will return quickly Taking the child with them they left the vessel and the five ships of the South Land continued their voyage down stream One poet has praised the conduct of Zhao Yun Before Zhao Yun saved Liu Shan What time his mother died Again like service he performs Upon the Great Rivers tideThe soldiers of Wu all in the ship Were stricken down with fear Search all the world you never find Of bold Zhao Yun the peerAnother has eulogized Zhang Fei At Long Slope Bridge With rage Zhang Fei boiled Like wild beast roared And warriors recoiledFrom danger now His prince is saved On historys page His name is gravedQuite satisfied with their success the two warriors sailed homewardBefore they had gone far they met Zhuge Liang with a squadron of ships He was very pleased to find they had recovered the child and they three joyfully returned to Jingzhou whence an account of the whole adventure was written to Liu BeiWhen Lady Sun reached her home she related the story of the death of Zhou Shan and the carrying off of the child Naturally Sun Quan was very wrath at the miscarriage of his scheme and he resolved to attack Jingzhou in revenge for his messengers murderNow that my sister has returned home there is no longer any family tie to prevent the attack and I will take full measure of revenge for the death of my general said Sun Quan So he called the council to consider the expeditionBut before they could decide upon any plan their deliberations were suddenly cut short by the news that Cao Cao was coming down upon the South Land with four hundred thousand troops burning to avenge his defeat at the Red Cliffs All thoughts now turned toward repelling his attackAdviser Zhang Hong who had retired to his home ill had just died and his testament was sent to his lord to read Therein he advised Sun QuanMy lord the seat of government should be removed to the old land of Moling where the scenery seems to bear the impress of kingly dignity befitting a person who cherishes the ambition of founding an enduring dynasty Sun Quan read this document out to his councilors at this meeting not without many tears in memory of the writer He told them saying Zhang Hong was sincere till his deathI cannot withstand his last advice And Sun Quan at once gave orders to build a walled city named Shidou in Moling and changed the name of the land to Jianye Henceforth he intended to make his capital thereAs a protection against Cao Cao Admiral Lu Meng proposed building a rampart at River RuxuSome other officers opposed this saying When the enemy appears you will have to land in order to attack him and after that you will return to your shipsWhat is the use of a rampart Lu Meng replied One must prepare against possibilities Soldiers vary in keenness and sometimes lose battlesIf an urgent occasion arises the soldiers may be unable to reach the waters edge and how then are they to embarkThey will then need shelter Sun Quan said Provision against eventualities such as he proposes is goodAgainst a distant risk provide and sorrow walks not by your side So they sent soldiers to build ramparts at River Ruxu and as the work ceased not day or night the wall was soon completedIn the capital Cao Caos influence and glory waxed daily greaterHigh Counselor Dong Zhao proposed that the title of duke should be conferred upon him Dong Zhao said In all history no one has rendered such services as you have O Prime Minister not even Duke Zhou or Lu WangThese thirty years you have exposed yourself to all risks been combed by the wind and bathed by the rain and you have swept evil from the empire succored the distressed and restored the HansWho of all statesmen can rank with youIt would be fitting for you to become the Duke of Wei  and receive the Nine Dignities that your merit and virtue be known to all Now the Nine Dignities or signs of honor wereChariotsGilded chariots drawn by eight horses  Court dressesDragonembroidered robes headdresses and shoes  Music at banquetsBy royal bands Red doorsSymbols of wealth Inner staircase Protection for every step Imperial Tiger Guard Three hundred at the gates  Imperial axesCommanding and ceremonial symbols Bow and arrowsRedlacquered bow with a hundred arrows Libation vesselsJade tablets and libation cups However all the courtiers were not of one mindSaid High Adviser Xun Yu This should not be done O Prime MinisterYou raised a force by an appeal to the innate sense of righteousness of the people and with that force you restored the Han authority Now you should remain loyal and humbleThe virtuous person loves people with a virtuous love and would not act in this way Cao Cao did not take this opposition kindlyDong Zhao said How can we disappoint the hopes of many because of the words of one So a memorial went to the Throne and Cao Caos ambitions and desires were gratified with the title of Duke of Wei The Nine Dignities were addedI did not think to see this day said Xun Yu sighing This remark was repeated to the newly created Duke and angered himHe took it to mean that Xun Yu would no longer aid him or favor his designsIn the winter of the seventeenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  Cao Cao decided to send an army to conquer the South Land and he ordered Xun Yu to go with itXun Yu understood from this that Cao Cao wished his death so he declined the appointment on the plea of illnessWhile Xun Yu was at home he received one day a box such as one sent with presents of daintiesIt was addressed in Cao Caos own handwritingOpening it Xun Yu found therein nothingHe understood he took poison and diedHe was fiftytwo years of ageXun Yus talents were to all men known That was sad that at the door of power he trippedPosterity is wrong to class him with the noble Zhang Liang For nearing death he dared not face his lord of HanNews of Xun Yus death came to Cao Cao in the form of the ordinary letter of mourning by his son Xun YunThen Cao Cao was sorry and gave orders for an imposing funeral He also obtained for the dead man the posthumous title of lordshipThe northern army reached River Ruxu whence Cao Cao sent a reconnaissance of thirty thousand troops led by Cao Hong down to the river Soon Cao Hong reportedThe enemys fleet blankets the river but no sign of movements Feeling suspicious Cao Cao led his army to the river to watch the enemy and deploy his troopsOn the river he saw displayed a fleet of ships all arranged in admirable order the divisions being marked by distinctive flagsThe equipment glittered in the sunlightIn the center was a large ship whereon was a huge umbrella and beneath the shade sat Sun Quan in the midst of his staffThat is the sort of son to have said Cao Cao in admiration not such piglets and puppies as Liu Biao Suddenly at the explosion of a bomb the ships got under way and came flying toward him while a force moved out of River RuxuCao Caos soldiers at once retired in great hasteA company led by the greeneyed redbearded Sun Quan made straight for Cao Cao who hastily retreatedBut Cao Cao was sore pressed by other Sun Quans commanders Han Dang and Zhou Tai and it had gone hard with him but that Xu Chu came to his rescue and fought with the troops of the South Land till his master could escapeXu Chu fought some score bouts before he could draw off and return to his own aideWhen Cao Cao returned to camp he conferred rich rewards upon his henchman who had saved him and he reprimanded his other leaders for their too hasty retirementYou blunt the keen spirits of the army and if you do such a thing again I will put you to death said Cao CaoAbout midnight that night there arose great commotion at the gates of the camp and when Cao Cao went outside he found that the enemy had crept up secretly and started a conflagration The soldiers of the South Land forced their way into the stockade and went hither and thither slaying till morning brokeThen Cao Cao and his army retired Cao Cao was greatly distressed by this misfortuneHe was sitting in his tent poring over the Book of War when Cheng Yu came in to see himO Prime Minister said Cheng Yu you who know so thoroughly the art of war have you forgotten the maxim to strike quicklyYou had your army ready but you postponed action and allowed your enemies to build the ramparts at River RuxuNow you will find it hard to capture the place It would be better now to retreat on the capital and await a more propitious moment Cao Cao listened but said nothing after a time Cheng Yu went away Cao Cao remained seated in his tent leaning on a small table by his side And he fell asleepSuddenly he heard a sound as of a rushing stream or galloping squadrons of horse and out of the river in front of him arose a huge red sun so bright that his eyes were dazzled by itLooking up at the sky he saw two other suns as if reflections of this oneAnd as he wondered the first sun suddenly flew up and then dropped among the hills in front of his camp with a roar like thunder This woke himHe was in his tent and had been dreaming and the sentry at his tent door was just reporting noonSoon he had his horse saddled and rode out with a small escort toward the spot he had seen in his dreamAs he stood gazing around him an army of horse came along with Sun Quan at their head Sun Quan wore a glittering helmet and was clad in silver armor Seeing his chief enemy Sun Quan showed no sign of haste or dismay but reined in his steed on a rise and pointing with his whip at Cao Cao said Behold the allpowerful minister who holds the capital in the hollow of his handHe has reached the acme of wealth and good fortune and yet he is not content but must come to encroach upon our southern country Cao Cao replied You are disobedient and the command of the Emperor is to exterminate you What words cried Sun Quan with a laugh Are you not ashamedEveryone knows that you control every act of the Emperor and you tyrannize over the noblesI am no rebel against the dynasty but I do desire to capture you and reform the government Cao Cao grew angry at this speech and bade his generals go over and take Sun Quan prisonerBut before they could obey Han Dang and Zhou Tai Chen Wu and Pan Zhang led out two armies of soldiers from left and right at the sound of beating drums and arrows and crossbow bolts began to fall like raindrops around Cao CaoHe turned to retire and the archers and bowmen followed himHowever presently appeared Xu Chu with the Tiger Guard who rescued Cao Cao and took him back to his campThe army of the South Land had scored a victory and they marched back to River RuxuAlone in his camp Cao Cao thought This Sun Quan certainly is no ordinary man and by the presage of the sun in my dream he will become an emperor He began to think it would be well to retire from the expedition only that he feared the troops of the South Land would exult over himSo the two armies remained facing each other a whole month fighting occasional skirmishes and battles in which victory fell sometimes to the one and sometimes to the otherAnd so it went on till the new year and the spring rains filled the watercourses to overflowing and the soldiers were wading in deep mudTheir sufferings were extreme and Cao Cao became sad at heartAt the council board his officers were divided some being for retirement and others anxious to hold on till the warm weather Their chief could not make up his mindThen there came a messenger from the South Land bearing a letter of Sun Quan which readYou and I O Prime Minister are both servants of Han but you are careless for the tranquillity of the people and think only of battle thereby causing great sufferingIs this conduct worthy of a kindly personBut spring with its heavy rains is at hand and you would be wise to retire while you canIf not you may expect a repetition of the misfortune at the Red CliffsIt would be well to consider this And on the back of the letter was a note in two lines running thusNo tranquillity for me while you live Cao Cao read the letter and laughed Sun Quan speaks the truth said he He rewarded the messenger and issued orders to retreatThe Governor of Lujiang Zhu Guang was left to guard Huancheng the army marched for the capitalSun Quan returned to MolingAt a meeting of his advisers he said Cao Cao has marched north Liu Bei is at Jiameng Pass why should I not lead the army that has just repulsed the northern forces to take Jingzhou Thereupon Zhang Zhao offered another plan saying Do not move a soldier I know how to keep Liu Bei from returning to Jingzhou Cao Caos army march away Sun Quans thoughts then southward stray The scheme proposed by Zhang Zhao will be unfolded in the next chapterCHAPTER Taking Of River Virgo Pass Yang Huai and Gao Pei Are Slain Siege Of Luocheng Huang Zhong and Wei Yan Rival Zhang Zhao proceeded to unfold his deviceIf you undertake any expedition farther west Cao Cao will undoubtedly return to the attackRather write two letters one to Liu Zhang saying that Liu Bei has leagued himself with you against the west which will raise suspicions in the mind of Liu Zhang and cause him to attack his guest and another letter persuading Zhang Lu to march upon Jingzhou which will uproot Liu BeiBetween these two conflicting matters Liu Bei cannot give supports to all fronts and we can march against Jingzhou Sun Quan approved wrote the two letters and sent them by two messengersIn the meantime Liu Bei had been winning the hearts of the people about Jiameng Pass where his army layWhen he received the news of his wifes flight and of Cao Caos threatened attack he called in Pang Tong and laid the matter before him The victor whoever it is will assuredly possess himself of our region of Jingzhou said Liu Bei at the closeYou need not trouble about that region said Pang TongI do not think the South Land or the Middle Land will try to take it so long as Zhuge Liang is there But my lord write to Liu Zhang telling him you wish to return on account of this threatening danger It will be a plausible excuseYou may say that on account of Cao Caos attack Sun Quan has sent to you for help and that as his country and yours are neighbors and dependent upon each other for safety you cannot refuseFurther you will assure him that there is no danger of any invasion by Zhang LuHowever we have too few troops for our purpose and insufficient grain so you must also urge your relative to send you thirty or forty thousand of veterans and a plentiful supply of foodHe will not refuse and with more soldiers and provisions we can do as we please Liu Bei agreed to this and sent a messenger to ChengduWhen his messenger reached the River Fu Pass Yang Huai and Gao Pei who commanded the garrison already knew of the design and the former of the two generals went with him to the cityAfter reading the letter the Imperial Protector asked Yang Huai Why did you come with the messenger Only because of that letter Yang Huai repliedThis Liu Bei from the day he first entered Yiazhou has been trying to win over the hearts of your people by a display of kindness and virtueHe certainly intends no good and I think you should refuse both the troops and the supplies he asksTo help him is like adding fuel to a fire We are affectionate brothers and I must help him said the Imperial ProtectorLiu Bei is nothing but a vagabond swashbuckler some one cried and if you keep him here in the west you are loosing a tiger in your householdIf you give him the troops and supplies he asks you are adding wings to your tiger Turning whence the voice proceeded they recognized the speaker as one Liu Ba a native of Lingling His words threw the Imperial Protector into a state of doubt and hesitationHuang Quan also dissuaded him most earnestly and finally Liu Zhang actually decided to send only four thousand of wornout soldiers and a paltry supply of grain At the same time fresh orders enjoining a diligent watchfulness were sent to the guardians of the passesWhen Liu Bei read the letter that accompanied the Imperial Protectors miserable contribution to his strength he was furious and cried I have been spending myself in your defense and this is my rewardYou are mean and greedy enough to stint my suppliesHow can you expect generous service Liu Bei tore the letter to fragments and execrated the writer thereofThe bearer of the letter fled back to the capitalThen said Pang Tong You have hitherto laid too much stress on humanity and righteousness However that is all over now and all affection between you two is at an end now that you have torn up that letter YesAnd since that is so what next asked Liu BeiI have three schemes ready in my mindYou may choose which pleases you What are your three schemes The first and best is to send an army forthwith and seize Chengdu The second is to capture and put to death the two generals of the River Fu PassThey are the two most famous fighting men in this land If you give out that you are returning to Jingzhou they will assuredly come to say farewellSeize and put them to death and the Pass and Fucheng are both yours Chengdu will follow soonThe third plan is to drop this role you have been playing go back to Jingzhou and make a regular invasionBut if you ponder these schemes too long you will get into such straits that nothing can save you Liu Bei replied Of your three schemes O Instructor I find the first too summary and the last too slow I choose the second scheme which is neither So a letter was written to Liu Zhang saying that Cao Cao was sending an army against Qingni the generals there were unequal to the defense and Liu Bei had to go to helpAs the matter was pressing there could be no personal leavetakingI knew that the real desire of Liu Bei was to return to Jingzhou said Zhang Song when he heard of the letter to Liu Zhang Zhang Song then also composed a letter to Liu Bei While he was looking about for a trusty person to take it his brother Zhang Su who was the Governor of Guanghan came to see him Zhang Song hid the letter in his sleeve while he talked with his brotherZhang Su noticed his anxious inquietude which he could not explainWine was brought in and as the two brothers chatted over it the letter dropped to the floor unnoticed by Zhang SongOne of Zhang Sus servants saw it picked it up and gave it to his master who opened and read itThis is about how it ranWhat I said to you lately was not mere meaningless talk Why then postpone actionThe ancients valued the person who took by force and held by conciliation If you act at once the whole matter is in your handWhy abandon all and return to JingzhouSurely I do not hear arightWhen you get this letter attack without a moments delay and remember that I am your ally on the insideAbove all no delay This plot of my brothers will end in the destruction of the whole family said Zhang Su I must get in the first word So at once he went in and laid the whole matter before the Imperial ProtectorI have always treated your brother so well said Liu Zhang very angryLiu Zhang issued orders to arrest Zhang Song and behead him and all his household in the market place Zhang Song such as he have been but few Little thought he that a letter would betray When he plotted for another But success he never knew For himself there opened out a gory wayHaving thus learned of a real conspiracy to deprive him of his heritage Liu Zhang assembled his officers and asked their adviceHuang Quan spoke out saying Prompt action is neededSend to every strategic point telling them to increase the garrisons and keep careful guard and above all prevent the entrance of any person from Jingzhou Such orders were sent to all points of vantage where were garrisonsIn the meantime carrying out Pang Tongs scheme Liu Bei had marched down to Fucheng where he halted and sent in a messenger to invite the two generals to come forth and say farewell But they did not respond at once to this invitationWhat is the real meaning of this retirement said one to the otherThis Liu Bei ought to die said Gao PeiLet us hide daggers under our dress and stab him at the place of farewell That will end all our lords troubles A most excellent plan said Yang HuaiSo they two taking only a small escort of two hundred went down out of the Pass to say goodbye Most of their forces were left in the campOn the way down to River Fu Pang Tong had said to his master You have need to be on your guard against those two if they come to bid you farewellIf they do not come then the Pass must be attacked without delay Just as he said this a violent gust of wind overthrew the leading flag of the army and Liu Bei asked what this portendedThat means a surprise those two intend to assassinate you so be on your guard Accordingly Liu Bei put on double armor and girded on his sword in readinessWhen the two generals arrived the army halted while the generals should pay the farewell visitThen Pang Tong said to his two generals Wei Yan and Huang Zhong However many soldiers come down from the Pass see to it that none return The two generals of the Western Land of Rivers Yang Huai and Gao Pei armed with hidden daggers came up their escort bearing gifts of sheep and wineThey marked no precautions being taken against an attack and began to think their task of murder would be an easy oneThey were led in to where Liu Bei sat under a tent his adviser with himThey said We hear O Imperial Uncle that you contemplate a long march and therefore we come to offer a few poor gifts to speed you on your way The cups of farewell were duly filledThen Liu Bei replied You have a heavy responsibility to defend the Pass Generals I pray you drink first They drankThen Liu Bei said I have a secret matter to talk over with you So all the two hundred soldiers of the escort were sent away and led to the midst of the campAs soon as they had gone Liu Bei shouted My generals lay hands upon these two rebels Thereupon Liu Feng and Guan Ping rushed out from behind the tent The two generals of the Pass were taken aback but began to struggleHowever Liu Feng and Guan Ping each seized one man and held himYour lord and I are of the same house said Liu Bei why then have you plotted against me and conspired to sow enmity between us Pang Tong bade them search the captives and the hidden daggers were foundSo both were ordered to immediate execution However Liu Bei hesitated and was unwilling to confirm the sentence and put them to deathBut his adviser insisted that they were worthy of death for the assassination they had penned and bade the executioners fall on So the two men were beheaded Of their following not one had been allowed to slip away Liu Bei summoned the soldiers of the escort to his tent gave them wine to comfort them and said Your leaders conspired to sow dissension between brothers and were found with daggers hidden beneath their clothingThey were assassins in intent and have met the fate they meritedYou have committed no crime and need feel no alarm The soldiers thanked him for his clemency with low obeisanceThen said Pang Tong If you will now show the way so that our troops may capture the Pass you shall even be rewarded They consentedThat same night the army set out with the soldiers of the renegade escort leading the wayWhen they reached the Pass they hailed the gate saying Open the gate quickly the generals have returned earlier than they expected because of important business Hearing the voices of their comrades the gate guards had no suspicion of treachery and threw open the gatesIn rushed the enemy soldiers and so gained possession of River Fu Pass without shedding a drop of bloodThe defenders came over to the side of Liu Bei and were liberally rewarded This done the army was posted so as to guard the approaches and maintain what they had capturedThe next few days were spent in banquets and feasts in celebration of successAt one of these feasts Liu Bei turned to his adviser saying This is what one might call a joyful occasion To employ warlike weapons in making an attack upon the possession of another is not using them in the best way replied Pang TongNor is such attack the most proper occasion for rejoicing Liu Bei replied The success of King Wu of Zhou was celebrated with music I suppose weapons were not well used on that occasion eitherWhy do you talk so wide of reasonYou would better retire Pang Tong laughed and withdrew from the table while the attendants supported Liu Bei to his own chamber where he had a long sleepAbout midnight he awoke from his wine and then the servants told him that he had driven sway his adviser from the feastHe was at once filled with remorseNext day having dressed early in full costume of ceremony he took his seat in the great hall summoned his adviser and apologized handsomely for his rude behavior the night before I drank too much last night and spoke rudely pray forget it Pang Tong who had taken the whole episode in very good part from the first laughed and talked as usualBut Liu Bei went on Really I was the only one to blame yesterday We both slipped up it was not only you my lord said Pang TongThen Liu Bei laughed too and the two were as good friends again as everWhen Imperial Protector Liu Zhang heard of the doings of his relative and guest he said I did not think that such things would come to pass The officers of Yiazhou met to consider how to oppose the further advance of Liu Bei and Huang Quan said Let us send without delay a force to hold Luocheng which is the very throat of the road he must takeHe may have veteran soldiers and fiery generals but he will not be able to pass So the four ablest generalsDeng Xian Ling Bao Liu Gui and Zhang Renwere told off for this duty and they led fifty thousand troopsAs they marched Liu Gui said In the Silky Hills there is a wonderful Taoist who calls himself The Super Human of the Dark Void He has the gift of second sight so let us visit him as we pass and inquire what our fortunes are to be What should one seek of a hermit when one is out to repulse an enemy said his colleague Zhang Ren contemptuously Your view is wrong said Liu GuiThe Holy One  has said that it is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknowSo let us inquire of this man of high intelligence that we may know what to do and what to avoid Whereupon they went up into the hills and sought the hermits retreat They were a small party on horsebackMeeting a woodcutter they inquired the whereabouts of the dwelling of the wise man and he pointed to one of the highest hills saying that the Sage lived on the very summit They climbed up to the spot he had told them of and found a small hut At their summons a lad in Taoist garb came out to speak with themHe asked their names and led them into the presence of the Super Human who received them seated on a rush cushionThey made a low obeisance told him the reason of their coming and asked of the futureHow can a poor Taoist recluse know ought of fortunes good or evil said heHowever after a time as Liu Gui repeated his request again and again and comported himself most humbly the hermit bade the lad bring paper and ink and he wrote eight lines which he handed to his questioner Supported by dragon and phoenix So flies he westwardBut the phoenix shall fall to the earthAnd the dragon shall soar to the sky There shall be successes and failures For such is the eternal lawSee that ye act when occasion offers Lest ye descend to the Nine Golden Springs Having read the oracle they pressed the seer to reveal them their individual fortunes but he replied Why ask these thingsNone can escape his fate Liu Gui ventured to question the Sage further but his eyelids dropped as if he slumberedNor would he vouchsafe a word more and the four generals took leave and descended the hillOne must have faith in such as he says said Liu GuiWhat is to be gained by listening to the sayings of a daft old man replied Zhang RenSo they continued their road to LuochengWhen they arrived they said Luocheng is the throat of the road to ChengduWe must create a pincers defense for the cityTwo of us are to guard the ramparts while the other two are to station themselves in front of the city where is a point of vantage sheltered by some hills Thus Deng Xian and Ling Bao wanted to build the ramparts outside the cityTwenty thousand troops were told off the two generals went to establish two camps in two stockades twenty miles away hoping to be able to keep the foe away from the cityThe River Fu Pass being captured Liu Bei took counsel with his adviser as to the next point to be attempted This was Luocheng The scouts reportedLiu Zhang has sent four generals to the defense of that city and two camps has been established twenty miles away to form an ox horn Then Liu Bei assembled his officers and asked who would go to attack the campsThe veteran Huang Zhong offered himself Veteran General take your own troops and go said Liu BeiA goodly reward shall be yours if you capture the two camps Huang Zhong thanked his lord and was just leading away his troops when suddenly up spoke a youthful leader saying The General is too old to go on such an expedition I am of poor ability but I wish to take his place The speaker was Wei YanHuang Zhong replied I already have my commission why should you wish to supplant me Because the task is beyond an old mans strength said Wei YanThe two generals in those camps we know are the best and boldest in the countryThey are strong and veteran as you are I fear you will be unable to overcome them If you fail our lords great design will be hinderedTherefore I ask that I may replace you and my intent is kindly This reminder of his age angered the old manOld am I Dare you compete with me in the use of warlike weapons said Huang Zhong Yes I dare And our lord shall be the judgeThe winner shall undertake this expeditionDo you agree Huang Zhong ran down the steps and called to his soldiers to bring his small sword But Liu Bei would stop this contest and said I have need of both of you in the task that lies before meWhen two tigers fight one is sure to lose and the loss of either of you is more than I could bearBe reconciled and quarrel no more You two must not quarrel said Pang TongBut as there are two camps to be taken and two generals to fight take one each and let each lead his own troopsThe first to capture his camp shall be held to have rendered the greater service and to have acquired the greater merit This decision pacified them and it was settled that Huang Zhong the veteran should go against Ling Bao and Wei Yan the younger leader should attack Deng XianBut after they had marched away Pang Tong recommended You my lord should follow them lest they should quarrel on the way So leaving the city of Fucheng in care of his adviser Liu Bei also marched taking with him Liu Feng his adopted son and Guan Ping his nephew by adoption They took five thousand troopsAfter having received the command to take one of the camps Huang Zhong went to his own camp and issued orders for the morning meal to be ready very early and for every one to be in marching order by daybreak When the time arrived his army set out taking the road through a gully to the left of the hillsBut early as Huang Zhong started his rival had stolen a march on him Wei Yan had sent over the night before to find out the hour fixed for Huang Zhongs start and had arranged his own departure a watch earlier by which he would be able to reach his objective at dawnAfter Wei Yans troops had taken their early meal they removed the bells from the horses end put gags in their own mouths to prevent talking and allsilently the army stole out of the camp just as the other party were eating their breakfast The ensigns were furled and weapons covered lest the glint of steel should betray their movementThus far successful in getting the start of his rival Wei Yan thought as he rode along what a fine score he would make if he anticipated Huang Zhong also in his attack and captured the camp of Ling Bao before Huang Zhong could get thereWei Yan at once deviated from his own line and marched toward the camp defended by Ling Bao of which the capture had been assigned to Huang ZhongJust before arrival Wei Yan halted his troops and bade them prepare the drums and ensigns and their weaponsEarly as it was yet the camp commander was on the alert for the advancing force had been observed by his scouts At the first sign of attack the defenders poured out in full forceWei Yan galloped up and made straight for Ling BaoThese two fought twenty or so of bouts and then the troops of the Western Land of Rivers came up and joined in the battleThe troops of Jingzhou under Wei Yan having marched a long distance were fatigued and could not withstand this onslaught so they fell backWei Yan heard the confused sound of hoofs behind him and giving up all thought of finishing his encounter with Ling Bao turned his horse and fledThe troops of the Western Land of Rivers kept up the pursuit and the attackers were defeated and retiredThey had gone about two miles when another army of Yiazhou appeared from behind some hills They advanced with heating drumsTheir leader Deng Xian shouted to Wei Yan to surrender but Wei Yan heeded him not whipping up his steed he fled the faster However the tired horse tripped and fell on its knees throwing its rider to the groundDeng Xians forces came galloping up and he himself set his spear to thrust and slay Wei Yan Before the spear could get where it was supposed to be twang went a bowstring and Deng Xian lay prone upon the earthLing Bao Deng Xians colleague rode up quickly to his rescue but just then a body of horse came dashing down the hill and their leader shouted General Huang Zhong is here With uplifted sword Huang Zhong rode toward Ling Bao who turned his steed and galloped off to the rearHuang Zhong pursued and the army of Yiazhou were thrown into confusion So Huang Zhong was able to rescue his colleague Wei YanHuang Zhong had thus slain Deng Xian and forced his way up to the gate of the campOnce again Ling Bao came and engaged Huang ZhongThe two had fought some ten bouts when appeared another body of soldiers Thereupon Ling Bao fled again and this time he made for the other camp abandoning his own to the troops of JingzhouBut when he drew near his camp he saw no longer the familiar flags of his own side Instead alien banners fluttered in the breezeHe checked his steed and stared at the new force The leader was a general wearing a silver breastplate and clad in a silken robe no other than Liu Bei himself On his left was his son and on his right rode his nephew Whither would you come cried Liu Bei The camp is ours I have captured it Now Liu Bei had led his troops in the track of the other two armies ready to help either in case of need He had come across the empty and undefended camp and taken possessionLeft with no place of refuge Ling Bao set off along a byway to try to get back to LuochengHe had not gone far when he fell into an ambush and was taken prisoner Bound with cords he was taken to the camp of Liu BeiThe ambush had been prepared by Wei Yan who knowing he had committed a fault that could in no wise be explained away had collected as many of his soldiers as he could find and made some of the captured soldiers of Yiazhou guide him to a spot suitable for laying an ambushLiu Bei had hoisted the flag of amnesty for his enemies and whenever any soldier of the Western Land of Rivers laid down his weapons and stripped off his armor he was spared Also all the wounded were granted life Liu Bei told his enemies that they had liberty of choiceHe said You soldiers have parents and wives and little ones at home and those who wish to return to them are free to go If any wish to join my army they also will be received At this proof of generosity the sound of rejoicing filled the landHaving made his camp Huang Zhong came to Liu Bei and said Wei Yan should be put to death for disobedience The culprit was summoned and came bringing with him his prisonerLiu Bei decided that the merit of capturing an enemy should be set against his fault and bade him thank his rescuer enjoining upon them both to quarrel no moreWei Yan bowed his head and confessed his fault and Huang Zhong was handsomely rewarded The prisoner was then taken before Liu Bei to decide upon his fate Liu Bei loosened Ling Baos bonds by his own hands and gave Ling Bao the cup of consolation After he had drunk Liu Bei asked if he was willing to surrenderSince you give me my life I can do no other said heMoreover my two companions Liu Gui and Zhang Ren and I are sworn to live or die togetherIf you will release me I will return and bring them also to you and therewith you will get possession of Luocheng Liu Bei gladly accepted the offerHe gave Ling Bao clothing and a horse and bade him go to the city to carry out his planDo not let him go said Wei YanIf you do you will never see him again Liu Bei replied If I treat humans with kindness and justice they will not betray my trust So the prisoner was set freeWhen Ling Bao reached the city and saw his two friends he told them saying I slew many of the enemy and escaped by mounting the steed of one of them Ling Bao said no word of having been capturedMessengers were sent in haste to Chengdu for help The loss of his general Deng Xian disturbed the Imperial Protector greatly He called his advisers together to consultThen his eldest son Liu Xun said Father let me go to defend Luocheng You may go my son but who is there to go with you One Wu Yi at once offered himselfHe was brotherinlaw to Liu Zhang who said It is well that you go BrotherinLaw but who will second you Wu Yi at once recommended two men Wu Lan and Lei Tong who were appointed to assist in the command Twenty thousand troops were given them and they set out for LuochengLiu Gui and Zhang Ren came out to welcome them and told them what had happenedWu Yi said If the enemy draw near to the walls it will be hard to drive them off againWhat do you two think should be done Ling Bao replied The city lies along River Fu and the current is strongThe enemy camp lies low at the foot of the hills and with five thousand people I can cut the river banks flood their camp and drown Liu Bei and his army with him The plan was approved and Ling Bao went away to carry it outWu Lan and Lei Tong were told off to supervise the workersThey began to prepare the tools for cutting the bankLeaving Huang Zhong and Wei Yan in command of the two camps Liu Bei went away to Fucheng to consult with Pang Tong the armys instructorIntelligence had been received that Sun Quan had sent a messenger to seek to make a league with Zhang Lu to make a joint attack upon the Jiameng Pass and Liu Bei was alarmed lest it should come to passIf they do that I am taken in the rear and helpless in both advance and retreat said heWhat do you counsel O Instructor Pang Tong turned to Meng Da saying You are a native of Shu and well skilled in its topography what can be done to make the Pass secure Let me take a certain man with me and I will defend it myself and answer for its safety Who is he asked Liu Bei He was formerly an officer under Liu BiaoHis name is Huo Jun and he is a native of Nanjun in the south This offer was accepted and the two generals departedAfter the council when Pang Tong returned to his lodging the doorkeeper told him that a visitor had arrivedWhen Pang Tong went out to receive him he saw a huge tall fellow eight cubits in stature and of noble countenanceHis hair had been cut short and hung upon his neckHe was poorly dressedWho may you be Master asked Pang TongThe visitor made no reply but went at once straight up the room and lay upon the couchPang Tong felt very suspicious of the man and repeated his questionPressed again the visitor said Do let me rest a little then I will talk with you about everything in the world This answer only added to the mystery and increased the hosts suspicion but he had wine and food brought in of which the guest partook ravenouslyHaving eaten he lay down and fell asleepPang Tong wag greatly puzzled and thought the man must be a spyHe sent for Fa Zheng met him in the courtyard and told him about the strange visitorSurely it can be no other than Peng Yang said Fa ZhengFa Zheng went inside and lookedImmediately the visitor jumped up saying I hope you have been well since we parted last Because two old friends meet again A rivers fatal flood is checkedThe next chapter will explain who the stranger wasCHAPTER  Zhuge Liang Mourns For Pang Tong Zhang Fei Releases Yan Yan Fa Zheng and the new comer met with every sign of joy clapping their hands and laughing with pleasureThis is Peng Yang of Guanghan one of our heroesHis blunt speech however offended Imperial Protector Liu Zhang who put him to shame by shaving his head loading him with fetters and forcing him into a monasteryThat is why his hair is short The introduction made Pang Tong treated the stranger with all the courtesy due to a guest and asked why he had comeTo save a myriad of your soldiers lives I will explain fully when I see General Liu Bei A message was sent to Liu Bei who came over to see the visitorHow many troops have you General asked Peng Yang when Liu Bei arrived Liu Bei told himAs a leader you cannot be ignorant of the lie of the landYour camps over there are on River Fu if the river be diverted and the enemy hold your army in front and rear not a soul can escape Liu Bei realized that this was truePeng Yang continued In the heaven the bowl of the Dipper lies toward the west and Venus stands over against us The aspect is ominous of evil and some misfortune threatensIt must be warded off Liu Bei offered Peng Yang an appointment as an adviser Then he sent messages to the generals at the camps telling them to keep most vigilant lookout to guard against the cutting of the river bankWhen this message came Huang Zhong and Wei Yan agreed together to take duty day and night about and maintain the strict watch necessary in the presence of an enemy near at hand They arranged means of communication in case either met with a body of the enemyOne very stormy night Ling Bao ventured out with a strong reconnoitering party and went along the river bank to seek a suitable place for the breachBut a sudden shouting in his rear told him that the army of Jingzhou were on the alert and he at once retiredWei Yan came in pursuit and as he pressed nearer Ling Baos troops hurried forward trampling each other down in their hasteSuddenly Ling Bao and Wei Yan ran against each other and they engagedThe fight was very short for Wei Yan soon took his opponent prisonerWu Lan and Lei Tong who came to Ling Baos rescue were easily beaten off and Ling Bao was carried awayWhen Wei Yan reached the Pass Liu Bei saw Ling Bao and greatly blamed him for his base ingratitudeI treated you generously and set you free you repaid me with ingratitude I cannot forgive again So the prisoner was beheaded and his captor was rewardedA banquet was given in honor of Peng YangSoon after this came a letter from Zhuge Liang by the hand of Ma Liang who reported all calm in Jingzhou and told Liu Bei that he need feel no anxiety Opening the letter Liu Bei read I have been making some astrological calculationsThis is the last year of the cycle the bowl of the Dipper is in the western quarter and the planet Venus approaches LuochengThe configuration is inimical to leaders and the utmost caution is necessary Having read this and sent Ma Liang away Liu Bei said I will return myself to Jingzhou and discuss the matter But Pang Tong who thought in his heart that Zhuge Liangs warning was due to a jealous desire to prevent him from winning the glory of conducting a victorious campaign opposed this saying I also have made calculations and I read the signs to mean that the time is favorable for you to get possession of this land and no evil is foreshownTherefore be not of doubtful heart my lord but advance boldly Liu Bei was won over and decided to follow Pang Tongs adviceHe ordered Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to leadPang Tong asked of Fa Zheng what roads there were to follow and the latter drew a map which was found to agree exactly with that left by Zhang SongFa Zheng said North of the mountains is a high road leading to the east gateSouth of the mountains is another path leading to the west gateBoth these roads are suitable for the advance of an army So Pang Tong said to Liu Bei With Wei Yan to lead the way I will go along the southern road while you my lord will advance along the high road with Huang Zhong in the vanWe will attack Luocheng at the same time Liu Bei replied I was trained as a mounted archer and am accustomed to byroads wherefore O Instructor I think you should take the high road and let me take the other There will be opposition on the high road and you are the best to deal with it Let me take the byroad No this does not suit me replied Liu BeiA spirit bearing a massive iron club appeared to me in a dream and struck my right arm so that I suffered great painI feel sure this expedition will turn out badly Pang Tong replied When a soldier goes into battle he may be killed or he may be wounded he accepts whichever is his fateBut should one hesitate because of a dream The real reason of my hesitation is the letter from Zhuge Liang Wherefore I wish you to remain and guard River Fu PassDo you agree to that Pang Tong smiled saying Zhuge Liang has indeed filled your mind with doubts The real thing is that he is unwilling to let me have the merit of accomplishing a great undertaking alone That is why he has written thisAnd your doubts and hesitations have produced the dreamBut I see nothing illomened and I am prepared for any sacrifice and mean just what I sayPray my lord say no more but prepare to set forth So the order went forth that the morning meal was to be taken early and the army was to march at dawnHuang Zhong and Wei Yan were to take the lead one along each road These two set out first and in due time Liu Bei and Pang Tong mounted and followedSuddenly Pang Tongs horse shied and stumbled throwing him offLiu Bei jumped down and seized the horse by the bridle saying Why do you ride this wretched beast I have ridden him a long time and he has never done this before was the replyA shying steed risks a persons life said Liu BeiRide my horse which is thoroughly trained and will never fail youGive me yours They exchanged horsesI am deeply affected by your kindness said Pang Tong I could never repay you if I suffered death a thousand times Soon their ways divergedAfter his adviser had left Liu Bei felt ill at ease and rode gloomilyWhen the news of Ling Baos capture and death reached Luocheng Wu Yi and Liu Gui took counsel togetherTheir colleague Zhang Ren said I know a byroad on the east which is of great importance and I pray you let me guard it while you two hold the city So as soon as the news of the advancing armies came Zhang Ren led three thousand troops to this road and placed them in ambushThey remained hidden while Wei Yan passed and made no attack The main body under Pang Tong soon followedThe soldiers in ambush saw a rider on a fine white horse and pointed him out to one another saying That surely is Liu Bei on the white horse Their leader Zhang Ren rejoiced too and he gave certain orders Pang Tong hastened forwardBy and by the mountain road narrowed to a defile with dense thickets on either hand and as the season was when summer changes into autumn the foliage was thick and impenetrableHis heart alarmed him and presently he reined in his steed and asked if any knew the name of that placeOne of the soldiers of Yiazhou who had joined his army said This is called The Fallen Phoenix Slope Pang Tong shudderedAn evil omen for me since BloomingPhoenix is my Taoist nameThere is no luck for me here He decided to retireBut as he gave the order the roar of a bomb rent the air and arrows began to fly toward him thick as swarming locusts All the hidden men were shooting at the rider of the white horseAnd there wounded by many arrows poor Pang Tong died at the age of thirtysix A poem saysDeep in the blue recesses of Xian Hills Lay hid the modest cot of Pang TongBut now each village urchin knows his story And any village rustic tells his exploitsHe knew the empire must be triply rent And far he traveled lonely to and froNone knew that Heaven would cast down his star Forbidding his return in glory clad A song was also written referring to Pang TongThey were two the Phoenix and the Dragon And they would travel far to the west But on the road thither The Phoenix died on the mountain slopeThe wind drives off the rain The rain sends off the wind It was the day of the Han restoration When the west was attained But in the attainment The Dragon was aloneNot only was the leader of the expedition slain but more than half of his soldiers fell in the narrow road that fatal daySome of the troops in the van escaped and ran off to tell Wei Yan of the mishap to the army and he halted and turned back to helpHowever it was difficult to march back and he could not hack a way through for the road was held by Zhang Ren and archers and crossbowmen occupied all the heightsThen one of the renegades proposed that they should try to return along the high road and they started for Luocheng this way But in front of them arose a great cloud of dust betraying the approach of an enemyWu Lan and Lei Tong the defenders of the city were moving toward them and Wei Yan was between the two armies closed in like the kernel of a nutWei Yan fought hard to get through When his case seemed most desperate and hopeless he observed signs of confusion in the army that lay between him and the city Soon that army turned and faced the other wayHe pressed forward and presently saw troops of his own side led by the veteran Huang Zhong I will rescue you Wei Yan shouted Huang Zhong as he came near Now the defenders of Luocheng found themselves between two enemies and they were smitten heavily They could not check Wei Yan and Huang Zhong who got close to the very walls of LuochengSeeing them near Liu Gui who had been left to defend the city poured out against themThereupon Huang Zhong and Wei Yan in spite of the nearness of the army of Liu Bei refused battle and turned sway from the city Liu Beis army made a dash for two stockades but when Zhang Ren came along the byroad and the other three defenders of the city came on the stockades could not be held and Liu Beis army had to retireNow fighting and now marching the army of Liu Bei strove hard to reach River Fu Pass but Zhang Ren pressed closeHowever Liu Feng and Guan Ping came up and not only drove back the pursuers but chased them some seven miles Finally Liu Bei and his troops reached the Pass weary and dispirited His son and nephew returned from the pursuit with many horses they had captured from the flying enemyHowever nothing had been gained and the victory lay rather with the army of the Western Land of RiverOne of the fugitives from the army finally reached River Fu Pass and told Liu Bei of the sad news of Pang Tong man and horse wounded to deathLiu Bei turned his face to the west and mourned bitterly Although the body of the slain leader lay far away they instituted sacrifice to call the spirit and all the generals keened for himThen said Huang Zhong Now that our leader is no more certainly the enemy will return to attack the Pass What is to be doneI think we would better send to Jingzhou for Zhuge Liang and get him to lay plans for getting possession of the Western Land of Rivers And even then came in one to say that the enemy under Zhang Ren had come and were now offering a challenge at the rampartHuang Zhong and Wei Yan wished to go forth to fight but Liu Bei disapproved saying We have suffered a severe check and the soldiers are lowspiritedLet us rather remain on the defensive until the Directing Instructor can arrive Huang Zhong and Wei Yan made no objection but set themselves to guard the Pass most vigilantly while a letter was written to Zhuge Liang and sent by the hand of Guan Ping He set forth at once and Liu Bei gave himself up to holding the PassIn Jingzhou it was the seventh day of the seventh moon and in the evening Zhuge Liang invited his officers to a banquet Conversation turned toward the enterprise in the Western Land of RiversSuddenly a large and brilliant meteor appeared falling in the west illuminating the whole skyIt so disturbed the host that he dashed his wine cup to the ground covered his face and burst into tearsAlas The guests eagerly asked him why he weptZhuge Liang replied I knew by my calculations that the bowl of the Dipper would be in the west at this season and that the auspices would be unfavorable to leaders of armies and lothe Heavens have gone against our army When Venus was about to stand over Luocheng I wrote to our lord warning him to be very cautiousI never contemplated the falling of the star this eveningNow Pang Tong is no more Again he fell to weeping My lord has lost an arm moaned heThe guests were rather disturbed but they only half believed that such a misfortune had happened We shall hear the sad news in a very few days said Zhuge LiangThe banquet ended sadly enough and the guests went their waysA few days later while Zhuge Liang was sitting with Guan Yu and a few others they reported the arrival of Guan Ping with letters from the westWhen the letters were opened they knew that Pang Tong had fallen the same evening that the meteor had appearedZhuge Liang wailed and the others wept with himThen Zhuge Liang said I must go to help our lord he is hemmed in at the Pass and cannot move If you go away who will guard this region asked Guan YuIt is of very great importance Our lord has not written plainly but I know what was in his mind Then he showed the letter to the others and said Provision for the defense of this region is laid upon me and I am to find one equal to the taskI read the letter to mean that he desires Guan Yu to undertake the defense and I know that Guan Yu will do it for the sake of the pledge taken long ago in the Peach GardenThe task is no light one Guan Yu accepted without hesitation or thought of excuseA special banquet was prepared at which the seal was to be handed over to himAll the future rests with you General said Zhuge Liang as he raised the symbol of office to place it in the hands of the commanderWhen a person of honor accepts such a task he is only released by death replied Guan YuBut that illomened word death displeased Zhuge Liang and even then he would have retracted but that Guan Yus word had gone forth Zhuge Liang went onNow if Cao Cao attack what is to be done said Zhuge LiangRepel him with all my strength But if Cao Cao and Sun Quan attack you together what then Fight both half my force against each Zhuge Liang said In that case Jingzhou would be in dangerI will give you my advice in a few words and if you remember them the region is safe What are these few words asked Guan Yu North fight Cao Cao south ally with Sun Quan These words O Commander are engraved on my heart Thereupon the seal was placed in his handsZhuge Liang also appointed tried and worthy people to assist the new commander Guan Yus civil staff included Ma Liang Mi Zhu Yi Ji and Xiang Lang and on military side he was assisted by Mi Fang Liao Hua Guan Ping and Zhou Cang This done Zhuge Liang began to prepare for his departureZhang Fei with ten thousand troops was sent to fight his way into the country west of Bazhou and Luocheng and he was to go with all speed The earlier he got through the greater merit would be hisZhao Yun was to lead a force up the Great River and make a junction at LuochengZhuge Liang with his own body of fifteen thousand troops would follow Among those who followed Zhuge Liang was one Jiang Wan a noted scholar from Lingling Jiang Wan went as Secretary Zhuge Liang and Zhang Fei set out the same dayJust before leaving the Directing Instructor said to Zhang Fei Do not think lightly of the soldiers of Yiazhou for there are many mighty warriors among themOn the march restrain your soldiers from plunder and license lest the ordinary people be against usWherever you halt be compassionate and kindly and do not give way to anger and flog your soldiersI shall expect you to reach Luocheng very soon Zhang Fei joyously mounted and leftHe marched rapidly and on the way all places that surrendered suffered nothing whatever When they drew near the county of Bazhou the scouts of the Western Land of Rivers sent out by the Governor of that place informed their master Yan YanThis Yan Yan was one of the famous generals of Yiazhou and even then although he was rather old he had lost none of his boldness and could still pull the stiffest bow and wield the heaviest sword Being so famous Yan Yan was not the man to surrender at the first approach of an enemy So when Zhang Fei came near he cautiously encamped about three miles from the city Thence he sent a messenger to summon the Governor to surrenderZhang Fei said Tell the old fool to give in or I will trample down his walls and leave no soul alive Yan Yan had never favored inviting Liu Bei into YiazhouWhen he had first heard of the Imperial Protectors intention he said This is like calling a tiger to protect one when one is alone on a bare hill side When he heard of the seizure of River Fu Pass he was very angry and offered again and again to lead an army and drive out the aggressorsHe had feared that his city would be attacked along this very road so he had prepared his army and when Zhang Feis message came he mustered them five thousand or so to oppose himThen a certain person said to Yan Yan You must be careful how you oppose a man who by the mere sound of his voice scared the many legions of Cao Cao at Long Slope BridgeEven Cao Cao himself was careful to keep out of his wayYour safety is in defense lying behind your ramparts and within your deep moats till hunger shall have vanquished your enemiesThis Zhang Fei has a very violent temper and if he is provoked he vents his anger in flogging his soldiers If you avoid battle he will be irritated and his cruelty to his soldiers will cause them to mutinyThen you can attack and will succeed Yan Yan thought the advice good He therefore resolved only to defend and he set all his soldiers on the wallsWhen one of Zhang Feis soldiers came up to the gate and shouted for them to open Yan Yan gave orders to open the gate and admit the manWhen the soldier had come within he gave the message as has been related beforeBut the Governor was exceedingly angry and said Fool that you are How dare you speak thus to meThink you that I General Yan Yan will surrender to such as himBy your mouth indeed will I send a message Then Yan Yan bade the executioner cut off the mans ears and nose And thus mutilated he returned to Zhang FeiWhen Zhang Fei heard of it his wrath boiled up and he cursed the defender of the cityGrinding his teeth and glaring with rage he put on his armor mounted his steed and went up close to the walls with a few mounted followers and challenged those on the ramparts to fight him But the defenders on the walls only replied with shameful abuse and none accepted the challengeZhang Fei galloped again and again to the drawbridge only to be driven off each time with flights of arrowsBut not a man came outside the walls As the day closed in the warrior still fuming with wrath returned to his own campNext day Zhang Fei again led his troops to the foot of the wall and challenged again the challenge was refusedBut Yan Yan shot an arrow from the tower that struck Zhang Feis helmetThis angered him still more and pointing the finger of disdain at his enemy Zhang Fei cried I will capture you yet you old fool and then I will devour your flesh So again at eventide the troops of Jingzhou returned to camp bucking their desireOn the third day Zhang Fei and his troops made the circuit of the city along the edge of the moat hurling insults at their enemiesIt so happened that the city was set on a hill with rugged heights all round so that going around it the assailants were sometimes on hill tops and sometimes on the level While standing on one of the hills Zhang Fei noticed that he could see clear down into the cityThere stood the defenders in their ranks all ready for battle although none of them came outAnd the common people went to and fro carrying bricks and bringing stones to strengthen the defensesThen Zhang Fei ordered his horsemen to dismount and his footmen to sit down so that they could not be seen from the city He hoped thus to cheat the defenders into thinking that there were none to attack and so induce them to come outBut this also was vain for still the defenders declined battle and another day was lostThe army once more returned to camp That night Zhang Fei sat in his tent trying to think out some means to overcome an enemy that steadily refused to come out from behind the walls Presently however the brain behind the knitted brows conceived a planSo next day instead of sending all the troops to offer a challenge from the foot of the wall Zhang Fei kept most of them in camp and sent only a few to howl insults and hurl abuseHe hoped by this means to inveigle Yan Yan out to attack the small number of troopsBut this also failed and he was left all day rubbing hid hands with impatience Never a man appeared without the wallFoiled again another ruse grew up behind his bushy eyebrows He set his troops to cut firewood and seek out and explore the tracks that lay about the city No longer did they challenge the wall After some days of this Yan Yan began to wonder what mischief was brewing and he sent out spies dressed as were the firewood cutters to mingle with them and try to discover what was afootThat day when the troops returned to camp Zhang Fei sat in his tent stamping his foot with rage and execrating his enemy The old fool Assuredly I shall die of disappointed wrath cried heJust then he noticed three or four soldiers lurking about his tent door as if they wished to speak with him And one of them said General do not let your heart be hot within youThese last few days we have discovered a narrow road by which we can sneak past this city Why did you not come and tell me before cried heBecause we have only lately discovered it said they I will lose no time then said he This very night let food be ready at the second watch and we will break camp and steal away as silently as possibleI will lead the way and you shall go with me as guides The requisite orders were givenHaving made sure that the preparations for the march were really being made the spies of the Governor returned into the city I guessed right then said Yan Yan gleefully when the spies reported their success I cannot bear the foolHe will now try to sneak past with his commissariat following and I will cut off his rearHow can he get throughHe is very stupid to fall thus into my trapAll are to prepare for battle the food is to be ready at the second watch and the army is to move out at the third we will hide in the woods and thickets till the greater part of the enemys army has passed and Zhang Fei has arrived in the very throat of the roadThen the blow will be struck They waited till night had fallenIn due time the late meal was taken the soldiers donned their armor stole silently out of the city and hid as they had been told The Governor himself with a few of his generals went out also dismounted and hid in a woodThey waited till after the third watch Then Zhang Fei came along urging his troops to the top of their speed His spear lay ready to thrust He looked very handsome as he rode at the head of his armyThe carts were one or two miles in the rear When the soldiers had got well past Yan Yan gave the signal The drums rolled out up sprang the hidden troops and fell on the baggage train The western troops began to plunderBut suddenly a gong clanged and along came a company of soldiers Yan Yan had not seenAt the same time a voice was heard shouting Old rebel do not fleeI have been waiting for this chance a long time Yan Yan turned his head The leader of this band was a tall man with a leopardlike bullet head round eyes a sharp chin and bristling tiger mustache He was armed with a long octaneserpent halberd and rode a jetblack steed In a word it was Zhang Fei All around the gongs were clanging and many troops of Jingzhou were rushing toward Yan Yan already too frightened to be able to defend himself However the two leaders engaged Very soon Zhang Fei purposely gave his opponent an opening and Yan Yan rushed in to cut down his enemy with his sword But Zhang Fei evaded the blow made a sudden rush seized Yan Yan by the lace of his armor and flung him on the groundYan Yan was a prisoner and in a moment was fast bound with cordsThe handsome leader who had passed first had not been Zhang Fei at all but someone dressed and made up to resemble himTo add to the confusion Zhang Fei had exchanged the signals making the gong the signal for his troops to fall on instead of the usual drum As the gongs clanged more and more of the troops of Jingzhou came into the frayThe troops of Yiazhou could make no fight and most of them dropped their weapons and surrendered To reach the walls of the city was now easyAfter entering the gates the leader ordered his soldiers not to hurt the people and he put out proclamations to pacify the citizensBy and by a party of executioners brought in the prisoner Zhang Fei took his seat in the great hall and the late commander of the city was brought before him by a party of executionersYan Yan refused to kneel before his captorWhy did you not surrender at first cried Zhang Fei angrily grinding his teethHow dared you try to oppose me Because you are a lot of unrighteous and lawless invaders replied Yan Yan without the least sign of fearYou may behead me as you will but I will not surrender to you Zhang Fei angrily gave the order for his executionStrike if you want to fool why so angry said Yan Yan This bold defiance was not lost upon Zhang Fei Rising from his seat he went down the steps put aside the lictors and began to loosen the prisoners bonds Then he dressed Yan Yan in new garments and led him to the high placeWhen Yan Yan was seated Zhang Fei made a low bow saying I have always known you were a heroNow I pray you not remember against me the roughness of my speech Yan Yan was overcome with this kindness and forthwith surrenderedA graybeard ruled in western Shu Clear fame is his the whole world through As radiant sun his loyaltyUnmatched his souls nobilityWhen captive taken rather he Would suffer death than crook his kneeBazhou he ruled for many a year The world cannot produce his peer A poet has also written concerning Zhang FeiYan Yan made prisoner then the matchless one Exchanged the sword for reason and so won The place he holds among the sacred ones Of the west to whom they sacrifice todayThen Zhang Fei asked Yan Yan to suggest the means of overcoming the Western Land of Rivers Yan Yan replied I am but the defeated leader of a defeated force indebted to the victor for my lifeI have nothing but my humble services to offer but I can tell you how to get possession of Chengdu without drawing a bow or shooting an arrow Cities yield in quick succession Because of one old mans secessionThe proposal will be unfolded in the next chapter CHAPTER  Zhuge Liang Plans For The Capture Of Zhang Ren Yang Fu Borrows Soldiers To Destroy Ma Chao As stated in the last chapter Zhang Fei asked Yan Yan to tell him how he might conquer the whole of the Western Land of Rivers This was the replyAll the fortified posts between this and Luocheng are under my control and the commanders of all the garrisons owe to me their commissions The only way for me to prove my gratitude is to make them all yield as I myself have doneLet me lead the advance and I will summon them one by one to surrender Zhang Fei thanked him again and again and the march on this plan beganWhenever the army arrived at a post Yan Yan summoned the commander and there it endedOccasionally one would hesitate when Yan Yan would say You see I have submitted how much more ought you to do so These bloodless victories followed each other day after day supporters rallying to the invaders without question They simply came In the meantime Zhuge Liang was preparingHaving decided upon the date of departure he wrote to inform Liu Bei and he made Luocheng the rendezvous for the various armies On receipt of this letter Liu Bei assembled his officers and explained to them its purportHe bade them be ready to march on the twentysecond day of the seventh month Both river and land forces were to set out the same day But the fiery old man Huang Zhong was dissatisfied that there should be no local victory in the River Fu Pass He said Day after day the enemy has come to challenge us and day after day we have refused They must have grown lax and I propose a night raid on their camp We shall catch them unprepared and shall score a victory Liu Bei agreed to tryHe arranged for a night raid Huang Zhong on the right Wei Yan on the left and the center force under his own commandThey set out at the second watch and soon arrived They found Zhang Rens troops unprepared rushed the camp and set it on fireThe flames were very fierce and the troops of Yiazhou fled in confusion and sought shelter in Luocheng They were admitted After pursuing them for some distance Liu Bei made a campNext day Liu Bei marched right up to the city to besiege itZhang Ren kept quiet within and made no attempt to beat off the besiegersOn the fourth day Liu Bei led an attack on the west gate sending Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to attack the east The south gate was left to give the besieged a chance to escape if they wouldNow outside the south gate of Luocheng the country was rough and hilly while the swift River Fu ran past the north For this reason the city could not be surrounded From the city wall Zhang Ren watched the progress of the attack and saw Liu Bei the whole day indefatigably going to and fro directing the assaultHe also saw that as the sun dropped toward the west the attacking force showed signs of wearinessWherefore he sent his two generals Wu Lan and Lei Tong out of the city by the north gate with orders to make their way around and attack Huang Zhong and Wei YanZhang Ren said he himself would go out by the south gate and steal round to attack Liu BeiLest the withdrawal of troops from the ramparts should discover his plans he sent the populace up on the walls to make a show and bade them shout loudly to reinforce the rolling of the drumsAt sundown Liu Bei ordered the retirement of his army and the rearmost company turned about to march back to campAt this moment arose still louder shouting from the ramparts and out at the south gate burst Zhang Ren and his forceZhang Ren made straight for Liu Bei who was in the middle of his army Liu Beis soldiers were thrown into confusion As his two generals on the east side were also attacked they could render no help and Liu Bei fled to the hillsZhang Ren followed and soon got very nearThey were a whole company pursuing one solitary man and as Liu Bei plied his whip he felt that the odds were much against himJust then he saw another company of soldiers ahead emerging from a hill path An ambush in front pursuers in rearSurely Heaven wishes to destroy me cried Liu BeiBut all was not lost As they drew nearer he recognized his own troops and the leader who dashed to meet him was his brother Zhang FeiZhang Fei and Yan Yan had happened to take that road and Zhang Fei had hastened forward when he saw the dust of conflictZhang Fei and Zhang Ren soon came up with each other and they fought ten bouts By this time Yan Yan with the main body had come up and Zhang Ren turned and fledZhang Fei followed and chased him as far as the city wall The gate was opened to allow Zhang Ren to enter and at once shut The drawbridge was raised Then Zhang Fei returned to his elder brother to report his arrival and the incidents of the wayHearing that Zhuge Liang had not yet arrived Zhang Fei rejoiced saying So I have the credit of first arrival although he is traveling by river Liu Bei said But how is it you have come so quickly seeing the precipitous road you had to travelDid you meet no opposition Zhang Fei replied The fact is I have taken the fortyfive garrisons on the way by making use of General Yan Yan whom I captured It was not my own merit at allI have come all the way without the least effort Zhang Fei told the story of Yan Yans capture and services from beginning to end and then presented the man himselfLiu Bei said General my brothers speedy arrival is certainly owing to your help Whereupon Liu Bei took off the golden chain mantle he was wearing and gave it to his new allyOrders were given for a banquetWhile it was being prepared a messenger came to report saying Huang Zhong and Wei Yan had been fighting with Wu Lan and Lei Tong and had held their own till enemy reinforcements led by Wu Yi and Liu Gui arrived Huang Zhong and Wei Yan then fled eastward Zhang Fei at once asked his brother to go with him to rescue them Both wentWhen Wu Yi and Liu Gui saw the army of Jingzhou coming they retired into the cityWu Lan and Lei Tong continued the pursuitThe coming of Liu Bei and Zhang Fei threatened their rear and Huang Zhong and Wei Yan turned and recommenced the battleWu Lan and Lei Tong were thus between two fires and helplessThey offered to surrender and were received Liu Bei returned to his own camp near the cityThe loss of his two generals grieved Zhang Ren sorely He called his remaining two and asked adviceThey proposed to risk all in one desperate battle while they sent to Chengdu to tell their master of their sorry plight Zhang Ren agreedSaid he Tomorrow I will go and challenge them If they accept and come out to fight I will feign retreat and inveigle them round to the north side of the cityAs they follow me a sortie must be made when they pass the gate so as to cut their army in two We ought to overcome them in this way Let me lead the sortie said Wu YiGeneral Liu Gui can stay to help our lords son Liu Xun guard the city This also was agreed toNext morning Zhang Ren went out to offer the challenge his troops waving flags and shouting lustily At once Zhang Fei took up the challenge and rode outHe stayed not to parley but galloped up to Zhang Ren and engaged himAfter about ten bouts Zhang Ren seemed to be getting worsted so he turned and fled taking the way around the north of the cityZhang Fei pursued him with all speed Then as he passed the gate Wu Yi made a sortie so that Zhang Fei was between two forces and unable to get clear Zhang Ren turned back to attack Zhang Fei seemed in a parlous stateBut at this very moment a body of soldiers came up from the riverside and a fierce warrior rode straight for Wu Yi and in the first bout made him prisoner his troops were then forced back and Zhang Fei was freeIt was Zhao Yun who had so opportunely appearedWhere is the Directing Instructor asked Zhang FeiHe has arrived I think he has already seen our lord replied Zhao YunThe prisoner was carried to the camp where Zhuge Liang wasZhang Fei dismounted and went in to greet himZhuge Liang was surprised and said How comes it that you arrived before me Liu Bei told the story of Zhang Feis prudence and sagacity in dealing with Yan YanZhuge Liang congratulated Zhang Fei and said When Zhang Fei behaves with such skill my lords good fortune is indeed ample When the prisoner was taken in Liu Bei asked him if he would surrenderWu Yi replied Why not seeing I am a prisoner Thereupon Liu Bei himself loosed his bonds Zhuge Liang began to question him upon the defenseWu Yi told him the names of the officers saying The son of the Imperial Protector Liu Xun and his generals Liu Gui and Zhang Ren are the defendersLiu Gui does not count for much but Zhang Ren is a man to be avoided Then before we can get the city we must capture Zhang Ren said Zhuge LiangThere is a bridge on the east what is it called It is known as the Bridge of the Golden Goose Zhuge Liang rode over to the bridge and scrutinized the neighborhoodAfter his return to camp he summoned Huang Zhong and Wei Yan for orders To them he said On the east of the city is a bridge called the Bridge of the Golden Goose and about two miles south of this I saw a dense growth of reed and sedge which would afford excellent shelterWei Yan is to lead a thousand spearmen to the left and attack but only attack horsemenHuang Zhong will lead a thousand swordsmen who are to cut the horsesWhen Zhang Ren has lost most of his troops and horses he will flee by the hill road where he will fall into an ambush of Zhang Fei Next Zhao Yun was called and sent to lie in ambush close to the bridge which he was to destroy as soon as the enemy had crossed That done Zhao Yun was to take up a position beyond the bridge to prevent the enemy from getting away to the north Forced to the south their destruction would be inevitableThese arrangements made Zhuge Liang himself went to challenge the enemy and try to bring them to battleImperial Protector Liu Zhang had sent two generals Zhang Yi and Zhuo Ying to reinforce Zhang RenZhang Ren sent Zhang Yi to the help of Liu Gui in the city while Zhuo Ying was to march second with Zhang Ren himself to encounter the enemyZhuge Liang led across the bridge a mob of disorderly looking soldiers all in disarray whom he drew up as if they were a fighting force He himself dressed in a simple robe and toying with a fan took his seat in a small fourwheeled carriage A few horsemen caracoling gaily to and fro formed his escort Having crossed the bridge Zhuge Liang halted and pointed to Zhang Ren saying Dare you withstand me and not surrender when Cao Caos million troops fled at my name But the enemy leader was rather occupied with inspecting the disorderly lot of soldiers he saw in front all standing anyhow and not drawn up into formation at allWith a cynical smile Zhang Ren said People talk of Zhuge Liangs superhuman military genius I say his reputation is false With that Zhang Ren whirled his spear about his head and he dashed forward with all his troopsAs he came Zhuge Liang left his carriage mounted a horse and retired to the far side of the bridgeZhang Ren impetuously pursued and rushed over the Bridge of the Golden Goose It was only when he had reached the other side that he saw a body of soldiers on either hand Then he knew that he had been led into a trap As soon as he had got across the bridge the two bodies of soldiers under Liu Bei and Yan Yan came to the attackZhang Ren turned to get back to the bridge but Zhao Yun had done his work and the bridge was in ruinsZhang Ren made to turn sway north but Zhao Yuns troops stopped the way so he had to turn southward and followed the course of the riverHe presently reached the place where grew the reeds and sedgesOut came Wei Yan and his company of spearmen who stabbed at the horsemen fiercely while Huang Zhong with his swordsmen cut down the horsesSoldiers and horses were soon lying on the ground The few survivors were quickly made prisoners and bound with cords No footman escapedBut a few lucky horsemen followed Zhang Ren and got away to the hillsThere they met Zhang Fei who fell upon them with a mighty roar scattered the few followers and captured the leaderSeeing Zhang Ren a prisoner his second in command Zhuo Ying turned toward Zhao Yun and surrenderedVictorious they returned to campLiu Bei rewarded Zhuo Ying When the leader Zhang Ren was led in by Zhang Fei Zhuge Liang was seated beside his lordWhy have you held out so long after all the other generals of Yiazhou have yielded said Liu BeiCan a loyal servant take a second master cried Zhang Ren fiercely his eyes glaring with hateYou do not know the times submission means life I might submit today but it would not endure I should repent itYou would better slay me Liu Bei was inclined to mercy but the prisoner was irreconcilable and kept up a stream of furious abuseSo at last the order was given for his execution thus giving him a right to fame A poem saysNo second lord the heroic servant knows The way of death Zhang Ren contented goesClear shines his fame as doth the heavenly moon That nightly lights the ramparts of Luocheng Town Liu Bei grieved for Zhang Ren although Zhang Ren had been an enemy for he was a brave manZhang Ren was given honorable burial sepulture beside the Bridge of the Golden Goose where all the passersby would be reminded of his loyaltyNext day the army moved on to Luocheng Yan Yan and the other generals who had submitted leading the wayAt the gate they hailed the wardens and called upon them to surrender whereby the city should be saved from utter destructionFrom the wall Liu Gui abused the treacherous Yan Yan and took his bow to shootBut just as Liu Gui was fitting the arrow to the string another man cut him down Soon the gates were thrown open and the city had yieldedAs Liu Bei entered the city by one gate Liu Xun who had shared the command of the city escaped by another gate and set off for Chengdu Liu Bei put forth proclamations to allay the fears of the inhabitants of the cityHe inquired who had been on his side in cutting down Liu Gui and was told it was Zhang Yi of WuyangZhang Yi and all who had helped in the capture were amply rewarded Our next city is Chengdu said Zhuge LiangHowever in the meantime there may be some trouble in pacifying the outlying counties and hence it will be well for you to send Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun with Wu Yi Zhang Yi Yan Yan and Zhuo Ying leading the way into the country along the river and Changyang Deyang and Baxi to reassure the people and to repress any rising that may take placeThere will be no need for any especial precautions in the neighborhood of Chengdu The warriors went their ways and then Zhuge Liang began to make careful inquiries concerning the road to ChengduThose who had given in their allegiance to the invaders said The only place where you can expect any serious defense is MianzhuOnce you have passed this the capital lies at your mercy Then Fa Zheng was consulted Said he With the fall of Luocheng the Western Land of Rivers passed to youLet our lord only deal with the people kindly and justly and there will be no need of weaponsI can write such a letter to Imperial Protector Liu Zhang as shall make him surrender at call That would be most excellent said Zhuge LiangThe letter was written and sent by the hand of a messengerLiu Xun son of the Imperial Protector presently reached Chengdu and told his father of the loss of LuochengThe Imperial Protector at once called his counselors together and Adviser Zheng Du said Although Liu Bei has been successful and captured cities and towns yet his army is but small his hosts are not near him and he depends upon chance for his grain and has no proper suppliesTherefore our best plan is to remove the people of Baxi and Zitong to the farther side of River Fu burn all the granaries fortify the city and let starvation defeat himLet us reject all challenges to battle and in a hundred days his troops will go off of their own accordThen we can do with him as we will I like not the plan said Liu ZhangOppose invaders in order that tranquillity may prevail is a wellworn maxim but till now I have never heard of disturbing the people in order to oppose the march of an enemyYour words are not such as safety Just at the moment the letter from Fa Zheng arrivedIt was opened and the Imperial Protector readI was sent to Jingzhou to negotiate an alliance but the opposition of those about you to their lord has resulted in the present situationHowever the ruler of Jingzhou still remembers old friendship and is mindful of the ties of relationshipIf you my master could reverse your policy and lend your support to your relative I think you would be generously treatedI hope you will consider this carefully Liu Zhang flew into a passionHe tore the letter to fragments and began to abuse its writer crying That traitor ingrate and renegade How dares he talk thus to me And Liu Zhang drove the bearer of the letter from his presenceHe then sent an army under the leadership of Fei Guan his wifes brother to reinforce MianzhuFei Guan at once recommended as his assistant one Li Yan of Nanyang and the two mustered their troops thirty thousand and set out for the cityAt this juncture Dong He the Governor of Yiazhou City wrote advising to borrow aid from Hanzhong but Liu Zhang rejected this plan saying It will be useless to try to obtain help from a region under the influence of our relentless enemy Zhang Lu Dong He replied He may be an enemy but Liu Bei is in possession of Luocheng and the situation is extremely dangerous When the lips are gone the teeth are coldIf you clearly indicate the dangers to him he must come to our help So a letter was written and sent to Hanzhong Two years had elapsed since Ma Chao had been defeated and gone over to the Qiang tribes in the northwest He had made friends with them and with their aid had conquered portions of Longxi His expeditions had been very successful the people opening their gates at the first summonsOnly Jicheng had stood out but ever this was on the point of yieldingThe Governor of Jicheng Wei Kang had sent many urgent appeals for help to Xiahou Yuan who however would do nothing without his masters orderWei Kang was in despair and at a council his officers advised him to yieldHowever one of them Yang Fu earnestly opposed yielding saying We cannot surrender to a lot of rebels such as are Ma Chao and his colleagues What is there to hope for asked Wei Kang despairinglyAlthough Yang Fu besought Wei Kang with bitterness to hold out it was useless Wei Kang rejected his advice opened the city gates and bowed his head in submissionYou only yield now as the last resource cried Ma Chao angry at the delay he had sufferedThis is no real submission Whereupon he put to death Wei Kang and all his family to the number of two score But when one told Ma Chao that Yang Fu had been really responsible for the long delay in that Yang Fu had urged his master to hold out Ma Chao did not put him to death but praised him and said Yang Fu had but done his duty Ma Chao further showed his approval by employing Yang Fu and two of his friends in his own armyThese two friends were named Liang Kuan and Zhao QuOne day Yang Fu went to his new chief and said My wife has died in Lintao I wish to take leave for two months to bury her Wherefore Yang Fu was granted leave and went away from the armyOn the way he went to his maternal cousin General Jiang Xu Commander of LichengThe generals mother then an old lady of eightytwo was Yang Fus aunt When Yang Fu saw her he wept before her saying Behold an unfortunate manThe city I had to defend is lost my master is dead and I have survived him I am ashamed to look you in the faceNow this Ma Chao ravages the countryside and everyone hates him Yet my cousin sits still and does nothing against Ma Chao Is this fitting conduct for a state servant Yang Fu wept bitterlyThe old lady was moved by his grief called in her son and said to him reproachfully You are the cause of the evil that has come upon the noble Wei Kang Then turning once more toward Yang Fu she said But what can now be doneYou have surrendered and more than that you have accepted service under your late enemy It is true replied Yang FuI have surrendered and I have accepted service but it is with the desire to preserve my miserable life till I can avenge my master A bold man is Ma Chao and difficult to destroy said Jiang XuNot very difficult replied Yang Fu for though he is bold yet he is unskillfulAlready I have two friends Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu by his side and they would help against him if you my brother would only supply a force What is to be gained by delay then said the old ladyIs there any who will not have to die To perish in the way of loyalty and righteousness is to die in the right pathDo not think of me for if you do and heed not the call of your cousin then will I die at once so that you may be free to make up your mind There was now no excuse for delay and Jiang Xu had to actHe summoned two of his officers Zhao Ang and Yin Feng and took counsel with themNow Zhao Ang had a son Zhao Yue who was an officer in the army of Ma Chao When Zhao Ang had to consent to take part against his sons chief he became very unhappy and went home to talk over it with his wife Lady Wang He said I have today been led into a scheme to destroy Ma Chao and avenge Wei KangBut there is our son there in Ma Chaos service and Ma Chao will certainly put our son to death as soon as he hears that we are arming against himWhat is to be done But his wife replied angrily Should anyone grudge even his life to avenge his liege lord or his father How much less a sonMy lord if you let the thought of your son stay your hand then will I die forthwith This decided the matter and without further parley Zhao Ang decided to share the expedition and set about preparationsThe army was soon on the wayJiang Xu and Yang Fu camped at the city of Licheng Zhao Ang and Yin Feng camped at QishanThe wife of Zhao Ang sold her ornaments and went in person to her husbands camp to feast his soldiers The fears of Zhao Ang concerning the fate of his son were only too soon justified At the first news of the march of an army against him Ma Chao beheaded the young Zhao YueThen Ma Chao marched his force together with Pang De and Ma Dai to Licheng and the troops under Jiang Xu and Yang Fu went out to oppose itThe two leaders on the avenging side went to battle dressed in mourning white They railed at Ma Chao crying Wicked traitorRebel Ma Chao angrily dashed across toward them and the fight began From the very first it was seen that the defenders of the city could not hope to beat off the attack and they turned to fleeMa Chao pursued themBut soon he heard the shouting of soldiers behind him and found the other army led by Zhao Ang and Yin Feng was attacking his rearWherefore he was between two armies and had a double battle to fight As he turned toward that in his rear Jiang Xu and Yang Fu returned again to the attackAnd while engaged with these two there suddenly appeared a third force under Xiahou Yuan who had just received orders from Cao Cao to come against Ma ChaoThree attacks at once were too much for Ma Chao and he fled his force in utter confusionHe retreated all that night and at dawn reached his own city of Jicheng He hailed the gate but a flight of arrows was the responseSoon after Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu appeared and reviled him from the ramparts aboveMore than this they dragged his wife Lady Yang up upon the wall hacked her before his face and threw the bloody body at his feetThey followed up this by the murder in like manner of his three sons and other members of his family to the number of ten and more And all their dead bodies were flung from the wallRage and despair filled Ma Chaos bosom he almost fell from his steedBut little time was allowed to grieve for Xiahou Yuan was nearly upon himKnowing that he could not oppose this force with any chance of victory he made no battle line but set off with two of his generals Ma Dai and Pang De to cut his way through such parties of the enemy as they might meetTheir sole object was escape so when they fell upon Yang Fu and Jiang Xu they only fought to get through and in the same way they cut an arterial alley through the army under Yin Feng and Zhao AngHowever they lost most of their few followers and at the end had only some sixty horsemen left About the fourth watch they came to Licheng In the darkness the gate guards thinking only of the return of their own troops opened the gates and unwittingly let in the enemyOnce in the city Ma Chao and his followers began the slaughter and every one soldier or common person was slain till the city was swept clear from the south gate to the very centerPresently they came to the residence of Jiang Xu and dragged forth his aged motherShe showed no sign of fear but reviled Ma Chao till in his anger he slew her with his own swordThence they went to the house of Yin Feng and Zhao Ang and slew all they found thereinThe only person who escaped the massacre was Lady Wang wife of Zhao Ang who had accompanied her husband But the city proved no place of safetyXiahou Yuan with his army appeared the following day and Ma Chao fled before him to the westBut ere he had gone seven miles he came face to face with another army drawn up in battle array Yang Fu was the leaderGrinding his teeth with rage Ma Chao set his spear and rode at Yang Fu while his two generals Ma Dai and Pang De attacked the rearYang Fu was overcome and his seven brothers who had gone with him into the battle were slainYang Fu himself was wounded in five places but still fought on till he was wounded downHowever Xiahou Yuan had not left pursuing Ma Chao He came up to the city and Ma Chao fled before him to the westHis army was now reduced to the two generals and about five or six of horsemen and these few were left to go their wayCao Caos general Xiahou Yuan set himself to restore order and tranquillity in the region of Xizhou after which he apportioned its defense among Jiang Xu and other trustworthy commandersThe wounded leader Yang Fu was sent to the capital in a carriage When he arrived Xuchang he saw Cao Cao who offered him the title of LordshipBut Yang Fu declined the honor saying I have neither the credit of a successful defense nor the merit of death with my master Death should be my portion rather than honorsHow could I accept the offer Cao Cao praised him and insisted on granting the lordshipHaving escaped from their pursuers Ma Chao and his few followers decided to make for Hanzhong and offer their services to Governor Zhang LuZhang Lu received them gladly for he thought with such help he could certainly get possession of Yiazhou on the west as well as repel Cao Cao on the east More than this he thought to cement the friendship by giving Ma Chao a daughter to wifeBut this displeased one of his generals Yang Bo The misfortune that befell Ma Chaos wife and family was entirely the fault of his own misconductWould you give your daughter to such as he to wife said Yang Bo Zhang Lu again considered the matter and abandoned his intentionBut a certain busybody told Ma Chao what had been proposed and that Yang Bo had defeated the schemeWhereupon Ma Chao was very annoyed and sought to compass the death of Yang BoYang Bo and his brother Yang Song on the other side conspired to destroy Ma ChaoAt this time a messenger from Liu Zhang of Yiazhou arrived in Hanzhong begging for assistance against the invader Liu BeiZhang Lu refused help But then Huang Quan came on the same errandHe first saw Yang Song and talked to him and brought him to favor the scheme Huang Quan said The Eastern and Western Lands of Rivers which stand next each other as the lips are close to the teeth are interdependentIf Yiazhou is lost Hanzhong has little chance to surviveOn the other hand once relieved by your help Imperial Protector Liu Zhang will reward twenty counties to Hanzhong as compensation So Huang Quan won over Yang Song who led him to see his masterTo Zhang Lu again Huang Quan spoke forcibly and laid the matter before him so cogently that Zhang Lu promised his helpYan Pu one of Zhang Lus officers tried to dissuade him by pointing out the old enmity between him and Liu Zhang but another suddenly interjected saying Useless I may be but if you will give me troops I will capture this Liu Bei and you will retain all your land The lands true lord goes west and then Hanzhong sends forth its bravest men Who made this bold offer The next chapter will tellCHAPTER  Ma Chao Battles At Jiameng Pass Liu Bei Takes The Protectorship Of YiazhouIt was Yan Pu who thus opposed sending help to Liu Zhang Then Ma Chao rose and said I have been the recipient of much kindness from my lord which I feel I can never repay adequately Now let me lead an army to take Jiameng Pass and capture Liu Bei Then my lord Liu Zhang will surely lose his twenty counties and they shall be yours This offer rejoiced Zhang Lu who sent away Huang Quan without an answer and told off twenty thousand for Ma Chao to leadPang De was too ill to take part in the expedition so he remained in HanzhongZhang Lu ordered Yang Bo to be Army Supervisor Ma Chao and Ma Dai chose the day to march to Jiameng Pass Meanwhile the messenger sent by Fa Zheng had returned to Luocheng to reportZheng Du advised Liu Zhang to set fire to all the plains and valleys between the capital and the invaders as well as the granaries to move sway the people and to stand solely on the defensive This news caused Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang great anxiety for it would be a grave danger to them However Fa Zheng was more sanguineDo not be anxious said he the plan would be extremely harmful but it will not be carried outLiu Zhang will not do that Surely enough very soon they heard that Liu Zhang had not adopted the suggestion he would not remove the people It was a great relief to Liu BeiThen said Zhuge Liang Now let us capture Mianzhu quickly for that done Chengdu is as good as ours Liu Bei therefore told off Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to advance firstWhen Commander of Mianzhu Fei Guan heard of their advance he ordered Li Yan to go out to stop them and Li Yan led out three thousand troopsThe two sides being arrayed Huang Zhong rode out and fought some half hundred bouts with Li Yan Neither was able to claim a victory and so Zhuge Liang from the midst of the host ordered them to beat the gongs to cease from battleWhen Huang Zhong had got back to his side again he said O Instructor why did you sound the retirement just as I was getting the better of my opponent Because I saw that Li Yan was not to be overcome by mere forceTomorrow you shall fight again and then you shall lead him into the hills by the ruse of pretended defeat There will be a surprise awaiting him Huang Zhong agreed to try this plan and so on the morrow accepted Li Yans challenge when it was offeredAfter about the tenth bout Huang Zhong and his troops pretended to be worsted and ranLi Yan pursued and was quickly lured into the mountainsSuddenly his danger flashed into his mind and he turned to go backBut he found Wei Yans troops drawn up across his path while Zhuge Liang from a hill top near by cried You would better yield if not there are bows and crossbows on both sides of youall ready to avenge the death of our Pang Tong Li Yan dropped off his horse threw aside his armor and offered submissionNot a soldier of his had been hurt The prisoner was conducted to Liu Bei who was very affable and so won Li Yans heart that Li Yan offered to try to seduce Fei Guan from his allegianceThough he is related to Liu Zhang yet Fei Guan and I are very close friendsLet me go and persuade him Wherefore Li Yan was sent back to the city to induce his chief to come over to Liu Beis sideLi Yan talked to such effect of the kindness and virtues of Liu Bei that Fei Guan was won over opened the city gates and admitted the invadersAs soon as Liu Bei had entered Mianzhu he set out his forces to take the capitalWhile thus engaged a hasty messenger came to tell of the doings at Jiameng Pass There suddenly appeared an army from the east under Ma Chao Ma Dai and Yang Bo They are attacking and the Pass will certainly be lost if help is not sent quickly We need both Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun for this remarked Zhuge LiangThen we could oppose successfully But Zhao Yun is away said Liu Bei However Zhang Fei is hereLet us send him quickly Do not say anything my lord said Zhuge LiangLet me stir him to fight his noblest But as soon as Zhang Fei heard of the danger he came rushing in shouting I must say farewell BrotherI am off to fight Ma Chao However Zhuge Liang made as if he heard not and said to Liu Bei That Ma Chao has invaded Jiameng Pass and we have no one to drive him backNobody can stand up to him unless we can get Guan Yu from JingzhouGuan Yu could do it Why do you despise me O Instructor cried Zhang FeiDid I not once drive back a whole army with my mere voiceThink you that I mind a stupid fool like Ma Chao Zhuge Liang said Yes Zhang Fei but when you forced back the waters and broke the bridge in the Long Slope you succeeded because your enemies were doubtfulIf they had known General you would not have come off so easilyAll the world knows this Ma Chao and has heard about his six battles at River Wei and how he made Cao Cao cut off his beard and throw away his robe Ma Chao very nearly slew Cao Cao tooThis is no lightsome task like that and even Guan Yu might fail All I care for is to go and if I do not overcome this fellow I will take the consequences Well if you will put that in writing you may lead the attackAnd I will ask our lord to lead another army to back you up this timeHe can leave the defense of this town to me till Zhao Yun returns I also want to go said Wei YanWei Yan was allowed to go with five hundred of light horse in advance of Zhang Fei Liu Bei marched thirdWei Yan and his scouts soon arrived at Jiameng Pass and there fell in with Yang BoThey engaged but after a few bouts Yang Bo fledAt this success Wei Yan was seized with ambition to rival it and try to snatch the credit that would fall to Zhang Fei So he pursuedBut he presently came across a line of battle all drawn up the commander being Ma DaiWei Yan thinking it was the redoubtable Ma Chao rode toward him whirling his swordSoon Ma Dai turned and ran away and Wei Yan followed him However Ma Dai presently turned back and shot an arrow which wounded Wei Yan in the left arm so that he left the pursuit and turned his face the other way Then Ma Dai came after him and chased Wei Yan nearly up to the PassHere Ma Dai was suddenly confronted by a fierce thunderroaring leader who dashed down from the Pass as on a flying steedIt was Zhang Fei who had just arrived Hearing the noise of battle below the Pass Zhang Fei had come to learn what it meant and saw the arrow wound Wei Yan Soon Zhang Fei was in the saddle and off to the rescue but before he engaged he would ascertain if the foe was worthy of his steelWho are youTell your name cried Zhang Fei then I may fight with you I am Ma Dai of Xiliang As you are not Ma Chao go away quickly for you are no match for meYou may bid Ma Chao himself come and tell him that Zhang Fei of Yan is here How dare you treat me with contempt cried Ma Dai in hot anger and he came galloping up with his spear set ready to thrustBut after a half score bouts he fledZhang Fei was about to pursue when a rider came up to him hastily crying Do not pursue my brother The rider was Liu Bei and Zhang Fei stopped The two returned together to the PassI knew your impulsive temper and so I followed youSince you have got the better of him you may well rest and recuperate for the fight tomorrow with Ma Chao The rolling of drums at dawn next day declared the arrival of Ma Chao Liu Bei looked at the array from a point of vantage and saw Ma Chao emerge from the shadow of his great standardMa Chao wore a lion helmet and his belt was clasped with the shaggy head of a wild beastHis breastplate was silver and his robe of white As his dress and bearing were so extraordinary so were his abilities superior And Liu Bei looked at him sighing admiringlyHe justifies what people say said Liu Bei Handsome Ma Chao Zhang Fei was for going down at once but his brother once more checked him saying No not yetAvoid the first keenness of his fighting ardor Thus below was Ma Chao challenging Zhang Fei while above Zhang Fei was fretting at being unable to settle Ma Chao Time after time Zhang Fei was setting out but each time his brother checked himAnd so it continued till past midday when Liu Bei noticing signs of fatigue and weariness among Ma Chaos army decided that it was time to let Zhang Fei try his fortune Whereupon Liu Bei chose out five hundred horsemen to accompany his brother and let the party goMa Chao seeing Zhang Fei coming with so small a force signaled with his spear to his array to retire a bowshot and Zhang Feis troops haltedWhen all his troops had taken their places Zhang Fei set octaneserpent halberd and rode out Do you know who I am shouted Zhang FeiI am Zhang Fei of Yan Ma Chao replied My family having been noble for many generations I am not likely to know any rustic dolts This reply upset Zhang Fei and in a moment the two steeds were rushing toward each other both men with poised spearsThe fight began and continued for a hundred bouts Neither had the advantageA veritable tiger of a leader sighed Liu BeiBut Liu Bei felt that Zhang Fei was running a risk wherefore he sounded the gong as a signal to cease the fight And each drew off to his own sideZhang Fei rested his steed for a time then leaving his helmet he wound a turban about his head mounted and rode out to renew the fightMa Chao also came out and the duel continued Presently Liu Bei thought his brother in danger So he girded on his armor and went down into the plainHe watched till they had fought another hundred bouts and then as both seemed to wax fiercer than ever he gave the signal again to cease the battleBoth drew off and returned each to his own sideIt was then getting late and Liu Bei said to his brother You would better retire for today he is a terrible opponent Try him again tomorrow But Zhang Feis spirit was roused and was it likely that such advice would be palatableNo shouted he I will die and not come back But it is late you cannot go on fighting said Liu BeiLet them bring torches and we will have a night battle said Zhang FeiMa Chao having mounted a fresh steed now rode out and shouted Dare you try a night battle Zhang Fei Zhang Feis excitement rose higher He hastily changed horses with his brother and rode forth If I do not capture you I will not go back to the Pass said Zhang FeiAnd if I do not overcome you I will not return to the camp said Ma Chao Both sides cheeredThey lit many thousand torches till it seemed as light as day and the two great generals went to the front to fightAt the twentieth bout Ma Chao turned his steed and tiedWhither are you going called out Zhang FeiThe fact was that Ma Chao had begun to see he could not win in direct and simple combat so he thought to try a ruse By a false flight as though he knew he had lost he would inveigle Zhang Fei into pursuit He picked up a copper mace secretly and kept a careful watch on his opponent for the most favorable moment to strikeBut Ma Chaos flight only put Zhang Fei upon his guard and when the moment came for the blow with the mace he dodged so that the weapon flew harmlessly past his ear Then Zhang Fei turned his horse Whereupon Ma Chao began to pursue Then Zhang Fei pulled up took his bow fitted an arrow to the string and let fly at Ma ChaoBut Ma Chao also dodged and the arrow flew byThen each returned to his own sideThen Liu Bei came out to the front of his battle line and called out Note well O Ma Chao that I who have never treated people other than with kindness and justice and truth and sincerity swear that I will not take advantage of your period of repose to pursue or attackWherefore you may rest awhile in peace Ma Chao hearing these words withdrew guarding the rear and the other generals one by one returned while Liu Bei drew off his army toward the PassEarly next day Zhang Fei was once more going down out of the Pass to fight when they told him that the Directing Instructor had arrived Liu Bei went to receive him and Zhuge Liang at once began to speak of Ma Chao He is the most terrible leader of the age if he fights a desperate battle with Zhang Fei loss of a general will ensue So I have come as quickly as I couldI left Mianzhu in the safe hands of Zhao Yun and Huang ZhongI think I have a little ruse left that will bring Ma Chao over to our side Now I have seen the man I greatly admire him said Liu Bei If we could only win him over Then listen my lord said Zhuge LiangZhang Lu greatly desires the title of Prince of Hanzhong Among his most intimate subordinates I know Yang Song open to briberySo we will send a person secretly to see him and give him gold and silver and so win his support This done we will write to Zhang Lu and tell him that you are set upon taking Yiazhou from its present ruler which will give an opportunity to wipe out the enmity he has so long nourished against Liu Zhang and that the reward of his remaining firmly on our side to the end will be that you will memorialize the Throne for the coveted title for himThis will make him order Ma Chao to return and when that is done I shall find a means of winning him over Liu Bei wrote a letter and sent it by the hand of Sun Qian together with gold and pearlsSun Qian went by secret roads to give these to Yang SongAnd when he found Yang Song and explained his mission in private he was quickly led into the presence of Zhang LuHow can Liu Bei memorialize the Throne to confer on me the rank of a prince when he is but a simple General himself asked Zhang Lu when he understood the offer and its conditionsHe is an Imperial Uncle said Yang Song with such a rank he could present such a memorial Zhang Lu assentedHe sent orders to Ma Chao to cease fighting and Sun Qian remained as the guest of Yang Song till he should see whether Ma Chao would obey the commandBefore long the messenger returned with a word from Ma Chao that he could not cease fighting till he had been successfulA second and third messenger returned with a similar responseThis Ma Chao is untrustworthy said Yang Song He will not withdraw his soldiers because he contemplates rebellion That is the real reason Yang Song set stories afloat rumoringMa Chao desires to make himself the ruler of the west and has said that he will no longer be content with subordinate rankAnd he means to avenge the death of his father The rumors came to the ear of Zhang Lu and he asked Yang Song what should be doneYang Song proposed saying Give Ma Chao a limit of a month in order to accomplish his task provided he consents to three conditionsAnd if he does not agree he will have to be put to deathThe three conditions are the capture of the Western Land of Rivers the head of Liu Zhang and the repulse of the Jingzhou troopsIf he fails in any one of these just bring his headMeanwhile Zhang Wei should be sent as guard at one of the strategic points which will control Ma Chaos army in case of rebellion When Ma Chao heard the three demands made on him he was greatly troubled saying What can such a charge mean After taking counsel with Ma Dai it seemed best to suspend fighting and the army returnedBut Yang Song had not yet attained his end so he said to Zhang Lu Ma Chaos return with an army will be a danger and hence all the points of vantage on the homeward road must be guarded so that to stop him Thus Ma Chao was helpless and could see no way out of the difficultyThen Zhuge Liang said to his lord Now is my chance to use my little three inches of unworn tongue Ma Chao is in a fix I am going to his camp to persuade him to come over to your side But I do not like you to run such a risk InstructorYou are my most necessary support and if anything happened to you what should I do Zhuge Liang was set upon going and persisted in his request Liu Bei again and again refusedAt this juncture a messenger came with letters from Zhao YunLiu Bei called him in and questioned himHe was Li Hui of Jianning the man who had formerly remonstrated so earnestly with Liu ZhangYou once pleaded with your master to keep me out why are you here now Because the prudent bird chooses its perch and the wise person his master I did attempt to dissuade Liu Zhang of Yiazhou from a course which I felt to be disastrous and thereby fulfilled my duty as his servantHe rejected my counsel and I knew he would failYour liberality O General has won over all the region and success must be yoursI wish to serve under your banner Your services will surely be of great advantage to me Sir said Liu Bei Then Li Hui began to talk of Ma Chao I knew him when we were in Longxi togetherHe is now in great straits and I may be able to talk him overWhat say you Just the man to go instead of me interjected Zhuge LiangBut what arguments will you use Li Hui leaned over and whispered in his ear thus and thusWhat he said seemed to please Zhuge Liang mightily and he was bidden to go forthwithArrived at the camp Li Hui sent in his name at which Ma Chao remarked Yes I know hima glib and specious persuader I know what he has come for too So Ma Chao placed a score of armed ruffians in hiding about his tent and told them to cut the visitor to pieces if the signal was givenThen the guest was led in and came walking proudly His host remained seated stiff and uprightMa Chao spoke roughly saying What are you come for I am here as persuader This sword here in the scabbard is newly groundYou may try me by words but if the words do not penetrate I shall ask you to try the sword Li Hui smiled saying O General evil is not far offHowever I am thinking the newly ground sword will not be tried on my headYou will want to try it on your own What evil were you talking about The worst vilification could not hide the beauty of Lady Xi Shi of Yue nor could the most fulsome praise gloze over the ugliness of Lady Wuyan of Qi The sun rises to the meridian and then declines the moon waxes to the full and then wanes All things obey the one lawNow General you are at enmity with Cao Cao for your fathers death and in Longxi you carry a stubborn grinding hate for your familys deathYou can neither rescue Liu Zhang by repulsing the army from Jingzhou nor can you settle Yang Song by getting an interview with Zhang LuThe whole world now holds no place for a person without a lord and if you experience further defeats like that one on River Wei or the loss of Jicheng will you not be too shamed to look any human in the face Ma Chao bowed his head saying You speak well SirBut I am helpless Now that you listen to me I would ask why those fearsome ruffians are in hiding by your tent continued Li HuiMa Chao suddenly stricken with shame ordered them to retire Li Hui continued his speechLiu Bei the Imperial Uncle is considerate to his subordinates and I am certain he will succeed and so I have forsaken Liu Zhang to cleave to himYour honored father joined him in destroying rebels Why do you not flee from darkness into the lightThereby you would avenge your father and become famous Ma Chao convinced of the wisdom of the course thus recommended proved his conversion by sending for Yang Bo and slaying him forthwith Taking with him the head of his victim Ma Chao accompanied Li Hui to the Pass and tendered his submissionLiu Bei welcomed him warmly and treated him as a highly honored guestMa Chao bowed his head saying Meeting you O Illustrious Lord is like seeing the clear sky when the clouds have been swept aside When Sun Qian returned from Yang Songs place Liu Bei detached a force to go to the capture of Chengdu left two generals Meng Da and Huo Jun to guard Jiameng Pass and made a triumphant entry into Mianzhu with the welcome of Zhao Yun and Huang ZhongTwo generals of the Western Land of Rivers Ma Han and Liu Jun came to oppose Liu Bei but Zhao Yun went out against them while Liu Bei was entertaining Ma Chao at a banquet on the city wallEre it had concluded Zhao Yun slew both the generals and brought their heads to the banquet chamberThis exploit put Ma Chao on his mettle and doubled his respect for the conquerorsLet not my lord attack said Ma Chao I will make Liu Zhang surrender of his own accordShould he resist my brother Ma Dai and I will take the city and offer it to you with both hands Liu Bei was very pleased with the course of events the day was indeed one of rejoicingBut Liu Zhang was greatly distressed at the news of his fresh misfortunes which reached him with the return of his defeated soldiersHe barred the gates and stopped all exitsBefore long came news of the approach of Ma Chao with an army of rescue The Imperial Protector then ventured to mount the walls and soon Ma Chao and Ma Dai rode up and stood below the rampartsAnd Ma Chao called out I wish to speak with Liu Zhang Then Liu Zhang showed himself and Ma Chao plunged into the matter without more adoI took the leadership of Zhang Lus army to rescue Yiazhou little thinking that under the calumnious advice of Yang Song Zhang Lu would try to slay meHowever now I have gone over to the side of Liu Bei the Imperial Uncle and advise you Sir to do the same you and all your officersThereby you will all escape harmIf any one holds on a misguided course I shall take the city Such words came as a shock and Liu Zhang paled His feelings overcame him and he swoonedWhen he came to his senses he muttered I am stupid and I am sorryBetter open the gates and end it The city will be saved No no cried Dong HeThere are thirty thousand of good soldiers in the city and ample money and stores for a year to comeHold out But Liu Zhang was broken saying My father and I have ruled Shu for twenty years and have done no particular good for the peopleAnd we have fought for three years the grass has been be stained with the blood of my people and the fault is mineI could not bear it and so I see no better way than to surrender whereby I may bring peace to the people Those about him weptOne man spoke saying You speak as Heaven guides you Turning toward him they recognized a man of Baxi named Qiao Zhou who had the reputation of being an astrologer I have studied the aspect of the heavens and a multitude of stars gathered over the west one of which shone as the full moona right royal star And I recall a popular couplet of last yearWhen comes the ruler from the east Then may you on new rice feastNone can withstand the decree of the Most High Liu Ba and Huang Quan who heard these words were very angry at such a speech and rose up to smite the speakerBut Liu Zhang stayed themNext came news that Xu Jing the Governor of the Shu District had gone over to the invaders This was the last blowLiu Zhang went home weepingNext day they reported that Liu Bei the Imperial Uncle had sent Jian Yong as legate to visit Liu Zhang and he was even then at the city gateJian Yong was admitted and he entered riding in a carriage and looking about him most haughtilySuddenly he was hailed from the street by a man with a sword in his hand who cried You have got your wish wretched creature and you seem to think there is no one to compare with youBut do not look so contemptuously at us of Shu Jian Yong quickly got out of his carriage to speak to the speaker who was a man of Mianzhu named Qin Mi Worthy brother said Jian Yong I did not recognize youI pray you not to be angry Both then went to visit Liu Zhang and they spoke of the liberality and broadmindedness of Liu Bei said he had no intention to harm any one and praised him to such effect that Liu Zhang then and there made up his mind finally that he would give up the struggleSo he treated Jian Yong very honorably that dayAnd the next day taking his seal and insignia if of office and his archives he accompanied Jian Yong out of the city and went to Liu Beis camp Liu Bei came out in person to receive himTaking Liu Zhang by the hand Liu Bei wept saying It is not that I wish to act cruelly or wrongly I am the victim of circumstances and cannot help it They entered the camp together where the seal of office and the documents changed hands Afterwards they rode into the city side by sideThe people gave Liu Bei a cordial welcome burning incense and illuminating the cityThe victor went to the residence of the chief of the region where he took his seat and was saluted by all the subordinate officialsHowever Huang Quan and Liu Ba stayed away from the ceremonyThis annoyed the more violent of Liu Beis supporters and they wished to kill the delinquents But Liu Bei would not allow violence and threatened condign punishment to any one who might interfere with these twoWhen the reception was over Liu Bei went to visit the two recalcitrants whereupon both came out and made their obeisanceSaid Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei We have vanquished and all opposition in Yiazhou is at an end But there cannot be two rulers so you must remove Liu Zhang to Jingzhou But I do not wish to exile him said Liu Bei He lost his prestige through weaknessIf you are weak and undecided you also will not last long Liu Bei saw his advice was good and so he gave a great banquet whereat he begged Liu Zhang to pack up his treasures and prepare to move He gave the dispossessed Imperial Protector the title General Who Spreads Prestige Liu Zhang went away to Gongan in Jingzhou taking with him his family and all his possessionsLiu Bei thus became Imperial Protector of Yiazhou He conferred gifts on the civil and military officers who joined him confirming their ranks and titlesYan Yan was made General of the Front Army Fa Zheng Governor of the Shu District Dong He and Xu Jing Imperial Commanders Liu Ba General of the Left Army Huang Quan General of the Right Army and others of Shu officers whose aid had been conspicuous were given high ranks and finer titles under the new rule and the total of more than sixty of them were well rewarded Naturally honors were distributed freely to Liu Beis immediate helpers to whose efforts he owed his positionZhuge Liang was held Directing Instructor Guan Yu General Who Destroys Rebels and Lord of Hanshou Zhang Fei General Who Subdues Rebels and Lord of Xinxian Zhao Yun General Who Guards the West Huang Zhong General Who Conquers the West Wei Yan General Who Wages Successful War Ma Chao General Who Pacifies the WestSun Qian Jian Yong Mi Zhu Mi Fang Ma Liang Ma Su Jiang Wan Yi Ji Liu Feng Guan Ping Liao Hua Zhou Cang and others many of whom had come to Liu Bei from Jingzhou received promotions and rewardsIn addition a special gift of five hundred ounces of gold a thousand ounces of silver much copper money and a thousand rolls of Xichuan silk was sent to Guan YuAnd all the military and civil officers were given appointmentsHuge numbers of oxen and horses were slaughtered for banquets to the army and the contents of the granaries were given to the common people So that there were great rejoicingsYiazhou being settled Liu Bei next desired to confiscate the lands of the more famous of the inhabitants about Capital Chengdu and divide them among his officersBut here Zhao Yun and others dissuaded him saying The sufferings of the people have been severe and losses great it would be wise policy to let them settle down to their occupations as soon as possibleIt would be wrong to reward our own people at the expense of these people Liu Bei listened and gave in with good graceTo Zhuge Liang Liu Bei assigned the revision of the laws the punishments to be made on the whole heavyThen Fa Zheng spoke up The founder of the Hans Liu Bang drew up three chapters of law and the people were all profoundly affected by his virtueI would rather that the laws be few and liberal that people may be comforted Zhuge Liang replied You only look at one sideThe laws of Qin  were fiercely cruel and provoked resentment among the people it was fitting that the Supreme Ancestor should temper them with kindnessUnder the weak administration of Liu Zhang there has never been an efficient government and there is a lack of respect for the lawThe proper relationship between ruler and minister has been gradually obscuredFavor has been the means of rising and the highest in rank have been the basest kindness has been extended into license and the most benefited have been the most contemptuous And thereby have crept in many evilsNow I mean to inculcate respect for the dignity of the law and kindness shall follow its attainmentthere shall be moderation in conferring rank but honor shall really follow on such promotionIn the mutual cooperation of kindness and honor and in proper distinction between superiors and inferiors lies the efficiency of a government Fa Zheng had no argument to opposeIn due time all became perfectly tranquil and all the fortyone counties with their respective garrisons were peaceful and contentedAs Governor of the Shu District Fa Zheng earned much hatred caring for no one but himself and one person told of the complaints to Zhuge Liang urging his dismissalBut Zhuge Liang referred to his meritorious services saying When my lord was in Jingzhou fearful of his enemy on the north and trembling lest he be attacked from the east Fa Zheng was his sure supportIn these prosperous days one can hardly begin to discipline himCould we reasonably forbid him following somewhat his own way So no investigation was made but Fa Zheng heard of the complaints and corrected his faultsOne day when Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were resting and at leisure Guan Ping arrived with a letter from his father thanking his elder brother for the handsome giftsMaking obeisance and handing in his letter Guan Ping said My father was anxious to come into Yiazhou to try conclusions with Ma Chao Said Liu Bei If he were to come and fight I fear they would not both survive There is nothing to be anxious about said Zhuge Liang I will write to Guan Yu Liu Bei feared that his brothers impulsive temperament might lead to trouble so he told Zhuge Liang to compose a letter and send back by Guan PingWhen Guan Ping came again to his father the first question was Did you mention the contest with Ma Chao Then the letter was produced and this is what it saidI hear you are anxious to decide whether of the twain Ma Chao or yourself is the better manNow I can measure Ma Chao He may be unusually brave and bold but he is only of the class of Ying Bu and Peng Yue of oldHe might be a worthy rival of your younger brother but he is far from the standard set by you O Lord of the Beautiful Beard You have a most important chargeIf you come into the Western Land of Rivers and Jingzhou should be lost would you not be guilty of a terrible failureI think you will see this Guan Yu stroked his long beard and smiled as he read the letter The Instructor knows me thoroughly said he to himselfHe showed the letter to his clients and friends and thought no more of going westward The successes of Liu Bei in the west had been duly noted by Sun Quan who thought he was surely now going to obtain the muchcoveted Jingzhou So he called in Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong to ask adviceSun Quan said When Liu Bei occupied Jingzhou temporarily he pledged he would return the region to the South Land when he would possess YiazhouNow he has taken the fortyone counties of the Western Land of Rivers if Jingzhou is not returned I will take it by force Zhang Zhao said I have already a scheme that will need no fighting Liu Bei will offer the place to you with both hands In Shu there shine new sun and moon Wu dreams Jingzhou will be his soonWe shall see in the next chapter the scheme to recover the muchdesired region CHAPTER Armed With Sword Guan Yu Goes To A Feast Alone For The State Empress Fu Offers Her LifeThe scheme which Zhang Zhao had in mind he laid before his master thus The one man upon whom Liu Bei relies most is Zhuge LiangNow his brother is in your service and in your power All you have to do is to seize Zhuge Jins family and send him west to see Zhuge Liang and make Zhuge Liang persuade Liu Bei to return Jingzhou If Liu Bei refuses the family of Zhuge Jin will suffer and Zhuge Liang will not be able to resist the claims of brotherhood But Zhuge Jin is a loyal and true gentlemanI could not lay hands upon his family said Sun QuanExplain the ruse to him that will set his mind at rest said Zhang ZhaoSun Quan consented and issued the command to confine the family of his retainer in the palace but not really imprison themThen he wrote a letter for Zhuge Jin to take with him on his missionBefore many days Zhuge Jin reached Chengdu and sent to inform Liu Bei of his arrival Liu Bei at once sought the advice of Zhuge Liang Why think you your brother has come He has come to force the return of Jingzhou How shall I answer him You must do so and so said Zhuge LiangThe plan of action being prepared Zhuge Liang went out of the city to welcome his brother but instead of taking him to his own residence Zhuge Liang took him to the guesthouseWhen the greetings were over the visitor suddenly lifted up his voice and weptIf you have any trouble my brother tell why do you weep thus asked Zhuge LiangMy family are lost cried heI suppose it is in the matter of the return of Jingzhou If your family have been seized on my account how can I bear it calmly But do not be anxious my brotherI shall certainly find some way out of the difficulty This reply pleased Zhuge Jin and the two brothers went to visit Liu BeiThe letter of Sun Quan was presented but when Liu Bei had read it he said angrily He is related to me by marriage and he has profited by my absence from Jingzhou to steal away his sister That is a sort of kindliness I find it hard to bearWhen I am just going to lead my army to the South Land to take vengeance is it likely he will get Jingzhou out of me At this point Zhuge Liang prostrated himself weeping at his lords feet and said The Marquis of Wu has seized my brothers family and he will put them all to death if the land be not given upCan I remain alive if such a fate befall themI pray my lord for my sake to give back the region and prevent any breach between my brother and me But Liu Bei refusedHe seemed obdurate but Zhuge Liang persisted in his entreaty Finally Liu Bei reluctantly consented Since things are so and the Instructor pleads for it I will return half said heI will give up three territoriesChangsha Lingling and Guiyang Then as you have consented prepare letters ordering Guan Yu to yield these three territories said Zhuge JinLiu Bei said When you see my brother you must use most gracious words to him for his nature is as a fierce fire and even I fear what he may doSo be very careful Zhuge Jin having got the letter took his leave and went straightway to JingzhouHe asked for an interview and was received in the grand reception hallWhen both were seated in their respective places the emissary produced the letter of Liu Bei saying The Imperial Uncle has promised to return three territories to my master and I hope General you will hand them over at once and let me return Guan Yus countenance changed and he said The oath sworn in the Peach Garden bound me and my brother to support the dynasty of HanJingzhou is a portion of their domain and how can any part be given to anotherWhen a leader is in the field he receives no orders not even those of his princeAlthough you have brought letters from my brother yet will I not yield the territories But the Marquis of Wu has laid hands upon my family and they will be slain if the land be not given upI crave your pity O General This is but a ruse on his part but it does not deceive me Why are you so pitiless Guan Yu drew his sword saying Let us have no more This sword is pitiless It will put the Instructor to shame said Guan PingI pray you not to be angry my father Were it not for my respect for the Instructor you would never go back to the South Land said Guan Yu to Zhuge JinZhuge Jin overwhelmed with shame took his leave sought his ship and hastily returned to Chengdu to see his brotherBut Zhuge Liang had gone away upon a journeyHowever he saw Liu Bei and related what had happened and said that Guan Yu was going to slay himMy brother is hasty said Liu Bei It is difficult to argue with himBut return home for the present and when I have finished my conquest of Hanzhong I will transfer Guan Yu to another post and then I may be able to return Jingzhou Zhuge Jin had no choice but to accept this reply and carry the unsatisfactory news to his master who was greatly annoyed and said This running to and fro was nothing more than one of your brothers tricks The unhappy messenger denied saying No no Zhuge Liang had interceded with many tears and obtained the promise to return three territories from Liu Bei It was the obstinacy of Guan Yu that spoiled all Since Liu Bei said he would return three territories we may send officials to take over their administrationThink you that might be done said Sun QuanWhat you say my lord seems most proper The family of Zhuge Jin were restored to liberty and officers were sent to take charge of the three territories of Changsha Lingling and GuiyangBut they quickly returned saying Guan Yu would have none of us but had chased us away at once with threats to kill us if we did not hasten Sun Quan then summoned Lu Su and laid the blame on himYou are Liu Beis guarantor in this matter how can you sit quietly looking on while Liu Bei fails to perform his contract said Sun QuanI have thought out a plan and was just going to impart it to you said Lu SuAnd what is your plan Lu Su said There is a camp at Lukou invite Guan Yu to a banquet there and try to persuade himIf he still remains obstinate have some assassins ready to slay himShould he refuses the banquet then we must try conclusions with an army This suits me said Sun Quan and it shall be done It should not be done interrupted Kan Ze The man is as bold as a tiger and not at all like common humansThe plan will fail and result in more harm Then when may I expect to get my Jingzhou asked Sun Quan angrilySun Quan ordered Lu Su to carry out his plan and Lu Su went to Lukou forthwith and settled the preliminaries of the banquet with Lu Meng and Gan Ning The place selected was by the river Then Lu Su wrote a letter and found a persuasive person to deliver it The messenger set out and sailed across the river to the post where he was received by Guan Ping who conducted him to his fatherAs Lu Su invites me I will come tomorrow you may return was Guan Yus reply After the messenger had gone Guan Ping said to his father Why did you promise to goI think Lu Su means you no good Do you think I do not knowThis has all come out of my refusal to yield those three territories They are going to try coercion at this banquetIf I refuse they will think I fear themI will go tomorrow in a small ship with just my ten personal guards and we shall see whether Lu Su will dare to come near me But Father why risk your priceless self in the very den of a tigerI think you are not giving due importance to my uncles charge I have been in the midst of million blades and arrows yet I have been riding through all directions like traveling through a meadow of no one think you that I shall begin to show fear of a few such rats as those Nor was the son alone in remonstranceMa Liang also warned his chief Although Lu Su has a great repute yet now he is pushed hard He certainly is badly disposed toward you and you must be careful General Guan Yu replied I have given my word and shall I withdraw from itIn the days of the Warring States Liu Xiangru of the state of Zhao had not the force even to bind a chicken yet in the assembly at Shengchi Lake he regarded not the prince and the ministers of the powerful state of Qin but did his duty without fear of consequencesHave I not learned to face any number of foesI cannot break my promise If you must go said Ma Liang at least go prepared Tell my son to choose out ten fast ships and five hundred of good marines and be in readiness to help me at needAnd when he sees a red flag waved he can come over to my aid The order was given and the little squadron was got readyThe messenger returned to his master and told him that Guan Yu had boldly accepted the invitation and Lu Su and Lu Meng took counsel togetherWhat do you think of this asked Lu SuIf Guan Yu comes with a force Gan Ning and I will be in readiness for him by the riverside And you will hear our bomb as a signal that we are attackingIf he has no force with him the assassins can set on during the banquet Next day a lookout was kept on the bank and early in the day a single ship came along It was manned by very few men and a simple red flag flew out on the breeze showing but two words Guan Yu Presently they could see him a handsome figure in a green robe and navyblue turbanBeside him stood Zhou Cang his swordbearer and near him were eight or nine finelooking men each with a sword at his side Guan Yu landed and was received by the trembling Lu Su who conducted him to the hall bowed his greetings and led him to the banquet chamberWhen Guan Yu drank to his host Lu Su dared not raise his eyes but Guan Yu was perfectly composedWhen they had become mellow with wine Lu Su said I have a word to say to you Sir if haply I may have your attention You know that your illustrious brother the Imperial Uncle made me surety with my master that Jingzhou would be returned after Yiazhou had been takenWell now that country is in his possession but Jingzhou is still unreturnedIs not this a breach of good faith This is a government affair said Guan YuSuch matters should not be introduced at a banquet My master only has petty possessions in the east and he allowed the temporary loan of Jingzhou out of consideration for the need in which you then wereBut now you have Yiazhou and Jingzhou should be given upThe Imperial Uncle has even yielded three territories but you Sir seem unwilling to let them goThis seems hard to explain on reasonable grounds Guan Yu replied My brother braved the arrows and the stones in the battle at Wuling and with all his strength drove back the enemy did he get a single foot of land for all his effortsNow you come to force this place out of him No I do not said Lu SuBut at the time that you and your brother suffered defeat at Dangyang when you were helpless and in the greatest straits fugitives you knew not whither then my master was moved with pity and did not grudge the land So he gave your brother a foothold whence he might be able to accomplish other endsBut your brother has presumed upon longsuffering He has attained his endthe country of his desireand still he occupies Jingzhou Such greed and such treachery will make the whole world laugh him to shame as you know quite well All that is no affair of mine it is my brothersI cannot yield the land I know that by the oath in the Peach Garden you three were to live or die togetherBut your brother has consented to yield how are you going to get out of that Guan Yu was at a loss to replyHowever Zhou Cang burst into the conversation roaring out Only the virtuous get hold of territory does that mean only you people of East Wu Guan Yus anger now showed itselfHis face changed he rose in his place took his sword from his swordbearer and said fiercely How dare you talk like this at a discussion of state matters And go quickly Zhou Cang understoodHe left the hall made his way to the river and waved the red callflagThe ships of Guan Ping darted across like arrows and were ready for actionThe mighty sword in his right hand Guan Yu laid hold of Lu Su with his left and simulating intoxication said You have kindly invited me today Sir but do not say anything about Jingzhou for I am so drunk that I may forget our old friendshipSome other day I hope to invite you to Jingzhou and then we will talk about that matter Poor Lu Sus soul almost left his body with fright as he was led down to the river bank in the grip of his guestLu Meng and Gan Ning who Lu Su had placed in ambush dared not act and so made no move lest they should bring about the doom of Lu SuWhen they got to the bank Guan Yu released his host got on board and then said farewellLu Su stood stupidly staring at the ship while a fair breeze bore it quickly out of sight This episode has been commemorated in verseHe showed his contempt for the soldiers of Wu By going alone to their traitor feast As Liu Xiangru of old he was much bolder As the Shengchi Lake game was played againGuan Yu took his homeward way while Lu Su and his two confederates talked over what had occurred What can be done now said Lu SuThe only thing is to tell our master and let him send an army replied Lu MengLu Su sent a messenger to Sun Quan who in his wrath was for sending every available soldier at once against Jingzhou But at this crisis there came news that Cao Cao was raising a huge army with the intention of attacking the South LandSo hasty orders were sent to Lu Su to make no move but to send all the troops he could from Hefei and Ruxu toward the north to repel Cao Cao However Cao Cao did not march south One of his military advisers Fu Gan sent in a memorial against the schemeI Fu Gan understand that inspiring fear is the chief consideration in war as inculcating virtue is in governmentThese two combined in one person fit him to be a princeFormerly in the days of disturbance you Illustrious Sir attacked the rebels and restored tranquillity almost everywhere the only regions unsubdued and not under your control being Wu and ShuThe former of these is protected by the Great River the latter secured by its mountains and both difficult to conquer by force of armsMy humble opinion is that it is more fitting to increase the authority of civil government to lay aside arms and rest weapons to cease from war and train your soldiers until the times shall be favorableIf your mighty legions be now sent to camp on the river bank and the rebels should take refuge behind their natural defenses your soldiers will be unable to prove their prowess and should extraordinary strategies be planned the rebels will not be available In such a case your high prestige would be impairedI trust Illustrious Sir you will deign to examine this After reading this Cao Cao ceased to think of an expedition against the south Instead he established schools and set himself to attract people of abilityAbout the same time four of his officersWang Can Du Xi Wei Kai and He Heconceived the idea of getting for Cao Cao the honor of Prince of WeiBut Xun You opposed this course saying The Prime Ministers rank is already that of Duke and he has received the additional honor of the Nine Dignities so that his position is extremely highIf he advances to the rank of kingship it will be inconsistent with reasonableness But Cao Cao was annoyed at this opposition and said Does the man wish to emulate Xun Yu When Xun You heard of Cao Caos anger he was grieved and fell ill so that in a few days he died He was fiftyeight years of ageCao Cao had his remains interred honorably and he stayed his ambition for princely rankBut there came a day when Cao Cao entered the palace wearing his sword and made his way to the apartment where the Emperor and the Empress were seatedThe Empress rose in a fright and the Emperor gazed at his minister in terrorSun Quan and Liu Bei have each seized a portion of the empire and no longer respect the court what is to be done To this abrupt speech the Emperor replied The matter lies within your province Cao Cao answered angrily If such a remark be known outside they will say I treat my prince without respect If you will help me I shall be most happy said His Majesty if not then I trust to your kindness to let me alone At this Cao Cao glared at the Emperor and went out full of resentmentThe courtiers said It is said that the Duke of Wei desires to become Prince of Wei and soon he will aspire to the throne Both the Emperor and his consort weptPresently Her Majesty said My father Fu Wan has long nourished a desire to slay this man Now I will indite a secret letter to my father to accomplish his end Remember the former attempt with Dong Cheng The plot was discovered and great misery ensuedI fear that this will leak out also and both of us will be undone Said the Empress We pass our days in constant discomfort like sitting on a rug full of needles If life is to be like this one were better deadBut I know one loyal man among the attendants to whom I may entrust the letter That one is Mu Shun and he will deliver it Thereupon Empress Fu summoned Mu Shun within and having sent away all others they told their distress to the faithful oneEmperor Xian said That fellow Cao Cao desires the dignity of a prince and soon he will aspire to the throne itselfI the Emperor wish to order the father of my consort to make away with the man but the difficulty is that all the courtiers are his creatures and there is none whom I can trust save yourselfI desire you to convey this secret letter to Fu WanI know your loyalty and am sure you will prove no betrayer I am the recipient of much graciousness for which not even death would prove my gratitude Thy servant prays that he may be allowed to undertake this The letter was given to Mu Shun who hid it in his hair made his way out of the precincts and handed it to its ownerFu Wan recognized the handwriting of his daughter and read itTurning to the messenger Fu Wan said You know the fellows creatures are many and one must act with extreme caution against himUnless we have the aid of Sun Quans and Liu Beis armies Cao Cao will certainly attain his endsIn this matter we must gain the support of every loyal and faithful one in the court so that within and without there may be a simultaneous attack Then O Father of the Empress write a letter in reply asking for a secret edict so that we may send to the south and the west to join in the attack So Fu Wan composed a reply which he gave to Mu Shun to take into the PalaceThis time also the letter was concealed in his hairBut there was a traitor and Cao Cao heard of the lettersSo he waited at the palace gate for Mu Shun to come outWhere are you going asked Cao Cao when Mu Shun appearedThe Empress is indisposed and has bidden me call a physician Where is the summon for the physician There is no summon Cao Cao bade his guards search Mu Shun but they did not find the letter So he was allowed to goBut just then a gust of wind blew off his hat and it struck Cao Cao that that had not been examined So Mu Shun was called backNothing was found in the hat but when it was given back Mu Shun put it on with both handsThere was something suspicious about the movement and Cao Cao bade the searchers examine his hairTherein the letter of Fu Wan was found Cao Cao read it it said that Sun Quan and Liu Bei were to be induced to helpThe unhappy Mu Shun was taken away into a secret place and interrogated but he would confess nothingThat night three thousand soldiers surrounded the dwelling of Fu Wan who was arrested with all his familySearching the house they found the first letter in the handwriting of the Empress Fu Wan and his family were then consigned to a gaolAt dawn a party of Imperial Guards under Chi Lu bearing ensigns of authority entered the Palace with orders to take away the seal of the EmpressOn the way they met the Emperor who asked the reason for a company of armed guards being in the PalaceI have orders from the Duke of Wei to get the Empress seal said Chi Lu The Emperor grew alarmedWhen Chi Lu reached the apartments of the Empress she had just risenChi Lu ordered to take the seal of the Empress and went awayAs soon as the Empress knew of this she recognized her danger and hid herself in the hollow walls of her private apartments behind one of the ceremonial hallsShe had not been long in hiding when Hua Xin with a company of five hundred armed soldiers appeared and asked where she wasThe palace people said they did not knowThe red doors of the hall were burst open and Hua Xin looked in but he saw no lady thereIt occurred to him where she might be hidden and he ordered his men to break open the wallWith his own hands he laid hold of the ladys hair and dragged her forthSpare my life pleaded sheYou may say what you have to say to the Duke cried heShe pulled down her hair and kicked off her shoes but a couple of soldiers pushed her along in front of them outsideIt may be said here that this Hua Xin had a reputation for learning He and two others Bing Yuan and Guan Ning all good friends made a little coterie which was known as The Dragon Hua Xin was the head Bing Yuan the belly and Guan Ning the tailOne day Guan Ning and Hua Xin were hoeing in their garden to grow some vegetables when they turned up an ingot of gold Guan Ning went on with his labors without giving a second glance at the find but Hua Xin picked it upAfter regarding it a moment he threw it away againAnother day Guan Ning and Hua Xin were reading together when there arose a great shouting outside the window of the study A minister from the Palace was passingGuan Ning took no notice but kept his eyes on his book Hua Xin rose and went to the windowFor this Guan Ning despised his companion and the two parted for goodSometime after in the disturbance of the empire Guan Ning fled into Liaodong where he led the life of hermit He wore a white cap and lived in the upper part of a house never touching the ground with his feet He would have nothing to do with Cao Cao and would not enter his serviceBut Hua Xin led a totally different life For a time he was with Sun Quan then he went over to Cao Cao and served him And here he is found actually laying hands upon the Empress His conduct in this particular is the subject of a poemThat was a dastardly thing that Hua Xin did When he broke don the wall where the Empress hid And dragged her forth by the hair He lent his aid to a foul foul crime And execrations throughout all time Have been and shall be his share A poet also wrote concerning Guan NingEast of Liaodong so stories tell Is Guan Nings tower where long he dweltIgnoble wealth was Hua Xins quest The hermits simple life was bestAs Hua Xin hurried the unhappy woman out of the hall the Emperor saw herHe went over and clasped her to his bosom weepingHua Xin tried to force her onward saying The Duke of Wei ordered no delay My doom is sealed wept the EmpressAnd I know not when my turn will come sighed the EmperorThe soldiers hustled the Empress onward leaving His Majesty beating his breast in despair Can it be that such things happen in the world cried the Emperor to Chi Lu who stood byAnd the Emperor swoonedChi Lu made the courtiers pick him up and they bore him into the PalaceMeanwhile the unhappy Empress had been taken before Cao CaoI have dealt well with you said he angrily and you requited me by plotting my murderIt is the death of one of us I see He ordered the executioners to beat her till she diedAfter this he went into the Palace seized her two sons and had them poisonedIn the evening of the same day the whole households of Mu Shun and Fu Wan were put to death publiclySuch terrible deeds spread terror everywhereThey happened in the eleventh month of the nineteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity As Cao Cao stands first in cruelty So stands Fu Wan in loyaltyA married pair of low estate Had not been torn apart by fateThe Emperor grieved bitterly over the loss of his consort and in his despair refused all food Cao Cao did not wish him to die of starvation and loneliness so he proposed his own daughter as consortBe not sad said Cao Cao thy servant is no rebelMy daughter is already in your palace as a secondary lady She is wise and dutiful fit to be your consort and occupy the first rank Emperor Xian dared not refuse and therefore at the new year  in the time of the festivities Lady Caos name was inscribed on the dynastic rolls as EmpressAnd no one of the courtiers dared protestWherefore Cao Cao became even more powerfulBut it pleased him not to have rivals in the land so he again thought of subduing Liu Bei and Sun QuanJia Xu proposed saying Xiahou Dun and Cao Ren who are serving on the frontiers should be called to give their advice They were sent for and Cao Ren was the first to arrive As a relative he felt he had the right to see the great minister without delay and went directly to the palaceBut it happened that Cao Cao had been drinking heavily and his faithful henchman Xu Chu would not admit the new arrivalI am of the family said Cao Ren angry at the hindranceDare you stop me General you may be a relative but here you are but an officer from the frontierI am of little account but a duty lies on me here in the palaceOur lord is overcome with wine and asleep and I dare not allow you to enter The refusal came to Cao Caos knowledge and he commended the loyalty of Xu ChuSoon after Xiahou Dun came and was called to the councilXiahou Dun gave his opinion saying The two rivals should be left until Zhang Lu of Hanzhong has been subduedThe great army that can overcome Zhang Lu will be in condition to attack the Western Land of Rivers and it will be conquered without difficulty The advice coincided with Cao Caos own idea and so he prepared an expedition for the westBy a crime he showed his power over a feeble king This done at once he hastened to destroy his neighborWhat happened will be told in later chapters CHAPTER Cao Cao Conquers Hanzhong Zhang Liao Spreads Terror At Flageolet Ford The expedition against the Eastern Land of Rivers went out in three divisionsXiahou Yuan and Zhang He were Leaders of the Van Cao Cao with his commanders marched in the center and Cao Ren brought up the rear Xiahou Dun was in charge of the commissariatThe spies soon carried the news into Hanzhong and Zhang Lu called in his brother Zhang Wei to consult how to meet the attackSaid Zhang Wei The strategic point to hold is Yangping Pass and there should be ten stockades there with the forest and hills to support themYou my brother should make your depot of supplies at Hanning Thereupon two generals Yang Ang and Yan Ren were sent with Zhang Wei to the Pass and they built ten stockadesSoon Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He arrived and learned the Pass had prepared a defense They camped at a point five miles awayThe soldiers were fatigued after the long march and all lay down to rest without placing proper guardsSuddenly the camp was attacked in the rear by Yang Ang and Yan Ren from different pointsXiahou Yuan and Zhang He mounted quickly and tried to beat off the attackers but the enemy poured in all round and their army suffered great loss They returned to the main body to tell of their defeat and their chief abused them for their want of care Old soldiers like you should have known better and taken precautions against a raid of the camp when the enemy knew your soldiers were exhausted by a long march Cao Cao even desired to put them to death as a warning but their fellowofficers interceded and he spared them Soon Cao Cao himself marched in the van Then he saw the dangerous and evil nature of the place with its thick growth of trees and as he knew nothing of the roads and was fearful of an ambush he returned to his campCalling up his two leaders Xu Chu and Xu Huang he said Had I known the dangerous nature of the place I would never have come Xu Chu replied The soldiers are here now my lord and you cannot recoil before the hardships Next day Cao Cao with only Xu Chu and Xu Huang rode out to reconnoiter the enemys campAs they rode over the hills Cao Cao pointed out the position with his whip and said It will be very difficult to reduce a place as strong as this Just then there arose a shout in their rear and a shower of arrows fell about themYang Ang and Yan Ren were attacking and the danger became great Friend Xu Huang you look after our lord cried Xu Chu I can hold the enemy Xu Chu galloped out and the two leaders could not stand Xu Chu and took to flight while their troops scatteredIn the meantime Xu Huang led his master over the hillsSoon he met an army of soldiers led by Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He who had heard the sound of fighting and had come to the rescue and Cao Cao got back safely to campThe four generals were rewardedFor fifty days the two armies held each other at bay without coming to a fightAt the end of this time orders were given to retire in the camp of Cao Cao We have not tried the strength of the enemy said Jia XuYou should not retire my lord I see that they are always on the alert said Cao Cao I am only retiring to put them off their guardBy and by I will send some light horse to attack their rear I shall defeat them then AhYour skill is unfathomable cried Jia XuThree thousand horsemen led by Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He got round behind the Yangping Pass by unfrequented roads while Cao Cao broke up his camp and led his main body backwardWhen Yang Ang heard of the retreat he thought it would be a good chance to attack but Yan Ren opposed it saying Cao Cao is full of rusesThe occasion is unclear we should not lead an attack Yang Ang was willful and said I shall go you may come or not as you wish In spite of the protestations of his colleague Yang Ang marched taking with him the soldiers of five camps and leaving only a few defendersThe day he set out was very foggy so that one could hardly see his neighbors face and soon the force got into difficulties and could not advance They bivouacked on the roadNow Xiahou Yuan was out with a reconnoitering force behind the hills when they heard the voices of troops and the neighing of horses In the dense fog they could see nothing but fearing an ambush they hastened to retire Somehow they lost their way and presently stumbled on the deserted camp of Yang AngThe few defenders thought their comrades had returned so they threw open the gates to let the troops of Cao Cao inThey found an empty camp and they raised a great blaze which frightened those few defenders in the other camps so that they fledAs soon as the fog cleared Yan Ren came to the rescue But as Yan Ren and Xiahou Yuan were fighting Zhang He suddenly appeared and attacked from the rearBetween two armies Yan Ren forced his way through and quickly fled toward NanzhengBy and by when Yang Ang returned he found his camp in the possession of Cao Caos troopsSoon Cao Caos main army came up and Yang Ang was between two forcesThere seemed no other way but to make a dash for itFalling in with Zhang He the two engaged and Yang Ang fellThose who escaped carried the news of the disaster to Zhang Wei who abandoned Yangping Pass and fledSo the invaders took possession of the Pass and its late defenders Zhang Wei and Yan Ren had to go back and report failureZhang Wei laid the blame on his generals saying the Pass could not be held after its supporting positions had been lostZhang Lu threatened to behead Yan Ren for his failureBut Yan Ren said Yang Ang did not listen to my advice and the defeat followed Now I volunteer to make another attackIf I fail to take Cao Caos head I will abide by the consequences without protest Zhang Lu took his formal pledge to succeed gave him twenty thousand troops and sent him awayYan Ren marched to Nanzheng and made a stockadeBefore Cao Cao made any further advance he sent Xiahou Yuan with five thousand troops to reconnoiter the road and they fell in with the force led by Yan Ren Both sides drew up their battle arrayFrom Yan Rens side went out one general named Chang Qi to engage Xiahou Yuan Before the fourth bout was fought Xiahou Yuan disposed of Chang QiThen Yan Ren set his spear and rode to the front They two fought near forty bouts and neither could claim victoryThen Xiahou Yuan pretended defeat and fled The other rushed in pursuitThe fugitive suddenly employed the swinginghorse stab and killed his pursuerYan Rens troops ran awayAs soon as Cao Cao knew of the death of Yan Ren he brought up his army marched straightway to Nanzheng and campedZhang Lu became alarmed and called a councilI can propose a man able to stand against the best leader of the enemy said Yan PuWho is he asked Zhang Lu Pang De of NananPang De surrendered at the same time as Ma Chao but could not go with Ma Chao into Yiazhou as he was illYou have treated him generously he will save you Pang De was summoned He came and Zhang Lu loaded him with gifts and gave him a force of ten thousand troops with which he marched and camped three miles from the city near the besieging forceHis camp made Pang De rode out and challengedNow Cao Cao remembering Pang Des boldness at the battle of River Wei Bridge was desirous of winning the warrior for himself so he told his generals saying Pang De is a bold general of Xiliang formerly serving under Ma ChaoThough he is now under Zhang Lu that is not his real wishI want to win him overSo you should try to weary him by prolonging the fights and so make him captive Wherefore first rode out Zhang He to answer the challenger He fought a few bouts and returnedThen Xiahou Yuan did the same thingSo did Xu HuangLastly went Xu Chu who kept up the fight to half a hundred bouts before he retiredStill Pang De showed no signs of fatigue nor of fear and all those who had fought with him praised his prowess and skill If only I could win him over to my side said Cao Cao longinglySaid Jia Xu I know one of Zhang Lus subordinates Yang SongHe is avaricious and open to bribesYou might send him secret presents and get him to slander Pang De to his master so as to weaken Pang Des position But how can one get at this manHe is in Nanzheng In the next battle pretend defeat flee and let Pang De take possession of this campReturn in the night in force and drive him out and he must retreat into the cityLet one of our own people with a persuasive tongue mingle with his troops disguised as one of his soldiers and so gain entrance into the city A subtle agent was found and goodly gifts were his in advance and he was entrusted with a golden breastplate as a bribeHe put it on and over it put on the dress of an ordinary soldier of Hanzhong And he made his way quietly to a point on the road along which the soldiers of Hanzhong would retreat into the city There he waitedNext day two parties under Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He were sent to lie in ambush and Xu Huang was sent to challenge but with orders to be defeatedThe scheme went well and as Pang De came on to smite Cao Caos army retired before Pang De till he found himself at their very campAnd therein he entered and was exceedingly pleased to find fodder and forage in great quantities Having sent off a messenger to his chief Pang De spread a feast in celebration of the victory and when night came on they sleptBut about the second watch there was an alarm from three directions and the camp was threatened by three forces Xu Chu and Xu Huang attacking in the center Zhang He from the left and Xiahou Yuan from the right It was the nightattack arranged by Cao Cao and Pang De could not make any defenseHe got to horse cut his way through and made for the cityWith the attackers in close pursuit Pang De reached the gate got it opened and rushed inAnd the false soldier got in amid the confusion He made his way quickly to Yang Songs residence and saw him He told Yang Song saying The Great Prime Minister Duke of Wei knows you by reputation and holds you in great esteemAnd as a token thereof he has sent you his golden breastplate and a confidential letter as well Yang Song took it all in read the letter and said I will reply by and by and the Duke of Wei needs feel no anxiety for I shall find a means of proving my gratitudeYou may return Soon after Yang Song went to see Zhang Lu and told him saying Pang De has been defeated because he has been bribed by Cao Cao Forthwith Zhang Lu summoned his general abused him and threatened to put him to deathYan Pu however protested and proposed to test Pang De in another encounterZhang Lu then said Tomorrow if you lose I will take your head Pang De retired full of resentmentThe next day Cao Cao attacked and Pang De went out to repel himCao Cao sent out Xu Chu but bade him pretend defeatWhen Pang De pursued Cao Cao rode toward the hills where he halted and presently got speech with Pang De calling out Pang DeWhy not surrender But Pang De thought within himself that to capture Cao Cao would be a fine exploit so he boldly faced his escort and rode up the hillsBut there arose a great shouting as if heaven and earth were clashing together and he and his followers went headlong into ditches and pits that had been dugOut flew Cao Caos troops with ropes and hooks and Pang De was a prisoner When he was taken to Cao Cao he was received with the greatest kindnessCao Cao himself dismounted loosed the captives bonds and asked him Do you surrender Pang De thought of the illtreatment he had just received at the hands of his master and of his injustice and gave inAt once Pang De was helped to mount a horse by Cao Cao himself and led to the great camp Soldiers placed for the purpose on the city wall saw what happened and reported to Zhang LuPang De has ridden off on friendly terms with Cao Cao Whereby Zhang Lu was persuaded that Yang Song had spoken trulySoon after scaling ladders were set against the city walls and catapults threw in great stonesThe danger being imminent Zhang Wei counseled saying Set all supplies on fire and flight to the Southern Mountains where we might be able to defend Bazhong On the other hand Yang Song said The best course is to throw open the gates and surrender Zhang Lu could not decide which to doHis brother Zhang Wei maintained that burning everything and flight was the only courseZhang Lu said I have been always loyal at heart and desired to return to allegiance when circumstances would permit I have been unable to attain my desire but now fight seems the only course open to meHowever the granaries and treasures the public offices and the government property of all kinds must be kept safe So the public buildings were all carefully barred and sealedThe same night in the late evening Zhang Lu and his family went out through the south gate and found their way throughCao Cao let them go unpursuedWhen Cao Cao entered the city and saw the proofs of Zhang Lus care of the government property he compassionated the Governors misfortunesHe then sent a messenger into Bazhong to induce Zhang Lu to surrenderZhang Lu was disposed to do so but his brother would not hear of itYang Song wrote a secret letter to Cao Cao urging him to attack and promising treacherous aid Cao Cao presently attacked and Zhang Wei came out to meet himBut his opponent was the mighty Xu Chu who made short work of him The beaten soldiers fled back into the city which Zhang Lu then decided to defendAs this would not give Yang Song the chance to carry out his treacherous scheme he persuaded his master saying If we stay passive death will surely comeMy lord should go out and fight the enemy to the conclusion leaving me to defend the city Zhang Lu took this advice although it was opposed by Yan Pu and went outBut before his van got near the enemy his rear ranks began to desert and Zhang Lu retreatedCao Cao pursued him to the city walls where Zhang Lu found the gates shut against him Surrender O Zhang Lu cried Cao CaoThere being now no way open Zhang Lu dismounted prostrated himself and gave inBecause of this and his care of the public property Cao Cao treated him with great kindness and consoled him with the title of General Who Guards the SouthYan Pu and many others also were enrolled among the noblesTo each county was appointed a Military Commander in addition to the Governor All the soldiers were feasted and rewardedThen Yang Song who had sold his master came and sued for honors He was condemned to public execution and exposureSelling ones lord may make great service But the gains thereof are vanity No glory clings to his house but a shameful death Wherefore Yang Song is an object of contempt foreverWhen the Eastern Land of Rivers was quite subdued First Secretary Sima Yi said The people of Shu are not loyal to Liu Bei because of his uprooting the late ruler Liu Zhang and if on the strength of your present success you press forward Liu Bei will become as a shattered tileThe wise person takes the occasion when it serves and this should not be missed Cao Cao sighed There is no endas human want has no limit now that I have Hanzhong I am forced into taking Yiazhou Liu Ye supported his colleague saying Sima Yi spoke wellIf you delay Zhuge Liang will have become top minister while Guan Yu Zhang Fei and the other bold warriors will be at the head of the armyIf the people of Shu once settle down and the points of vantage are held you will not be able to overcome them Cao Cao replied My soldiers have marched far and suffered much beside we must show pity Wherefore he rested his army for a timeMeanwhile the populace of Yiazhou having heard of Cao Caos success in the Eastern Land of Rivers concluded that the Western Land of Rivers would suffer next and fear spread among them Whereupon Liu Bei called in the Directing Instructor and asked his adviceZhuge Liang replied I can make Cao Cao retreat of his own accord What is that plan A part of Cao Caos army is camped at Hefei because of the fear of Sun QuanIf now we restore three territories of JingzhouChangsha Jiangxia and Guiyang and send a specious person to talk we can make Sun Quan attack Hefei which will lead to Cao Cao going southward and not looking to the west Who is a fit person for the messenger said Liu BeiAnd Yi Ji replied I will go Liu Bei wellsatisfied wrote letters and prepared gifts with which Yi Ji went calling in at Jingzhou City on the way to tell Guan YuThen he went on to the capital city of Moling and saw Sun QuanAfter the greetings Sun Quan asked On what business do you come Yi Ji replied On a former occasion Zhuge Jin would have had the three territories of Changsha Lingling and Guiyang but for the absence of the Directing Instructor which prevented the actual transfer Now I am the bearer of letters giving Changsha Guiyang and Jiangxia back to youLiu Bei and Zhuge Liang wanted to restore all the territories of Jingzhou including those of Nanjun and Lingling but now that Cao Cao has got possession of Eastern Land of Rivers there is no place for General Guan YuHefei is weak and we hope you will attack it so as to make Cao Cao withdraw to the south and let my master take the Eastern Land of Rivers when he will restore the whole of the Jingzhou Region Go back to the guesthouse and let me take counsel in this matter said Sun QuanAs soon as Yi Ji had gone the Marquis of Wu turned to his officers and asked what should be doneZhang Zhao said All this is because Liu Bei fears that Cao Cao will attack himHowever since Cao Cao is absent in Hanzhong it would be well to seize the opportunity and attack Hefei Sun Quan accepted the adviceAfter he had sent the messenger away he began to prepare for the expedition He left Lu Su in command over the three territories of Changsha Jiangxia and Guiyang Then Sun Quan encamped at Lukou withdrew Generals Lu Meng and Gan Ning and sent to Yuhang for General Ling TongVery soon Lu Meng and Gan Ning returned and the former suggested a plan saying Cao Cao has sent Zhu Guang Governor of Lujiang to camp at the city of Huancheng and plant grain for the supply of HefeiLet us first take Huancheng and then attack Hefei This scheme is just after my own heart said Sun QuanSo Sun Quan appointed Lu Meng and Gan Ning as Van Leaders Jiang Qin and Pan Zhang as Rear Guards he himself with Zhou Tai Xu Sheng Dong Xi commanded the centerBut the Commanders Cheng Pu Huang Gai and Han Dang were not called to take part in this expedition as they were guarding certain especial placesThe army crossed the river and captured Hezhou on the wayGovernor Zhu Guang sent an urgent message to Hefei for help and set himself to strengthen his fortifications for a siegeSun Quan went very near the city walls of Huancheng to observe its defense and a flight of arrows greeted him some striking his great official parasolHe went back to camp and asked his officers to offer plans of attackThen Dong Xi said Pile up great hills of earth and attack from the summits Said Xu Sheng Set up long ladders and construct platforms whence you can look over the city walls and thus attack But Lu Meng said All such plans need a long time to prepare and in the meantime the soldiers of Cao Cao will arrive from HefeiDo not try such longdrawnout schemes but take advantage of the fine fresh spirit of our newly arrived troops and attack impetuously Their elan will carry the wallIf you attack tomorrow at dawn the city will fall before noon So the early meal was taken at the fifth watch and the army went to the attackThe defenders sent down showers of arrows and stonesGan Ning took an iron chain in his hand and climbed up the wallThey shot at him with bows and crossbows but he turned aside the arrows and bolts and he threw the chain round Governor Zhu Guang to pull him downLu Meng beat the drum for the attackThe soldiers made a rush forward to climb the wall and they slew Zhu GuangHis officers and soldiers gave in and so Huancheng fell to Sun Quan It was still a long time to noonIn the meantime Zhang Liao was marching to the aid of the city Halfway he heard that the city had fallen and so he returned to HefeiSoon after the conquerors entry into Huancheng Ling Tong came there with his army The next few days were devoted to feasting the armySpecial rewards were given to the two generals who had done such good work at the capture and at the banquet to the officers Gan Ning was seated in the seat of honor which his colleague Lu Meng readily yielded to him for his late prowessBut as the cup of felicitation was passing round Ling Tongs thoughts turned to the enmity he bore Gan Ning for having slain his father and the praises which Lu Meng now heaped upon Gan Ning filled Ling Tongs heart with bitterness For some time he glared savagely at Gan Ning and then he determined on revenge Drawing his sword he suddenly rose to his feet and cried There is nothing to amuse the assembly I will give them a display of swordsmanship Gan Ning quickly saw his real intentionHe pushed back his table and laid hold of a halberd in each hand crying And you may also watch an adept in the use of this weapon Lu Meng saw the evil meaning of both and assuming his sword and shield he hastily stepped between the two warriors saying Neither of you gentlemen is so dexterous as I So he forced the two combatants asunder while some one ran to tell Sun QuanThe Marquis hastily jumped into the saddle and rode to the banquet hallAt sight of their lord they all three lowered their weaponsI have bidden you two to forget this old enmity said Sun QuanWhy do you revive it today Ling Tong prostrated himself in tearsSun Quan exhorted him to forget his quarrel and once again there was peaceThe next day the army set out for HefeiBecause of the loss of Huancheng Zhang Liao grieved greatlyCao Cao had sent by the hands of Xue Ti a small casket sealed with his own seal and bearing outside the words If rebels come open this So when he received the news of the coming of a powerful army Zhang Liao opened the casket and read the letter therein which said If Sun Quan comes to attack Hefei the two Generals Li Dian and Zhang Liao are to go out to oppose him and Yue Jin is to be left to guard the walls Zhang Liao sent the letter to the two men named thereinWhat do you think to do said Yue JinZhang Liao replied Our lord is away and Wu is coming to attack for certainWe must go out to repel them and exert ourselves to the utmost to inflict defeat upon their advanced guardThus we shall appease the fears of the populace and then we can hold as best we may But Li Dian was silent for he was ever unfriendly to Zhang LiaoThen seeing his colleague inclined to hold off Yue Jin said I am for remaining on the defensive since the enemy is so much more numerous than we Gentlemen it seems you are selfish and not devoted to the common weal said Zhang LiaoYou may have your private reasons for what you do but I intend to go out and try to repel the enemyI will fight them to the death Thereupon Zhang Liao bade his servants saddle his steedAt this Li Dians better feelings were aroused and he rose saying How can I be careless of the common weal and indulge my private feelingsI am ready to follow you and do as you command Zhang Liao was elated at this moral victory and said Since I can depend upon your help my friend then I would ask you to lie in ambush on the north of the Flageolet Ford in order to destroy the bridge there as soon as the army of Wu has crossedI with my friend Yue Jin will smite the enemy Li Dian went away to muster his troops and prepare the ambushAs has been recorded the leaders of the advance guard of the southern army were the veterans Lu Meng and Gan Ning Sun Quan and Ling Tong were in the center the other generals followed themThe leaders of the van met Yue Jin first and Gan Ning rode out and challenged himAfter a few bouts Yue Jin pretended to be defeated and fledGan Ning called to his colleague to join in the pursuit When Sun Quan heard that this advance guard had been successful he hastened his army to the Flageolet Ford But then there came a series of explosions and up came Zhang Liao and Li Dian one on each flankSun Quan was unprepared for this and sent messengers to call off the pursuit and ask for help from Lu Meng and Gan Ning Before it could arrived Zhang Liao had come upManifestly Ling Tong who had with him only a small troop of three hundred horse could not long withstand the army of Cao Cao but he faced them and fought bravely and presently cried to his lord Cross the Flageolet Bridge and run back my lord Sun Quan galloped for the bridge but the southern end had been already broken down and there was a wide breach between the end of the bridge and the shore Not a single plank was there by which to cross What could be doneSun Quan was in a quandary and helpless Go back and jump for it yelled one of the generals Gu Li by nameSun Quan did so Backing his horse some thirty spans or so he then gave it its head and lashed it with his whip The good beast leaped cleared the chasm and his master wee safe on the southern shoreOnce Dilu leant across the Tan Torrent wide And when defeat did Sun of Wu betide And death came threateningly at Flageolet Ford His steed too leapt and saved him from the swordHaving reached the farther shore Sun Quan embarked on one of the boats of Xu Sheng and Dong Xi and was rowed to a place of safety while Ling Tong and Gu Li were still fighting with Zhang Liaos armyGan Ning and Lu Meng coming to their aid were pursued by Yue Jin and Li Dian also stayed their progressBut the soldiers of the South Land fought bravely half of their force fell and Ling Tongs troop of three hundred horse perished all while Ling Tong himself was wounded but found his way to the bridgeFinding it destroyed he fled along the stream Presently he was seen by Sun Quan from the boat and taken on board by Dong XiGan Ning and Lu Meng also cut their ways back to the southern shoreThe terrible slaughter at this battle put such fear into the minds of the people of the South Land that the name of Zhang Liao kept the very children quiet at nightWhen Sun Quan reached his camp he richly rewarded Ling Tong and Gu LiThen he led his army back to Ruxu and began to put his ships in order so that the army and navy might act in unison He also sent home for reinforcementsZhang Liao reflected that he had insufficient force to meet another attack if it should be supported by the navy of the South Land so he sent Xue Ti through the night to carry an urgent message to his master in Hanzhong When the messenger arrived Cao Cao saw that his western expedition would have to yield to the urgency of home defenseHowever he called in his counselors and put a direct question to them Can we take the Western Land of Rivers now or not Shu is too well prepared we cannot replied Liu YeIt is better to go to the succor of Hefei and then go down the river to take the South Land Wherefore leaving Xiahou Yuan to station at the Dingjun Mountains to guard Hanzhong and Zhang He to keep Mount Mengtou Pass Cao Cao broke up his camp and went toward Ruxu with all his commandersThe armored horsemen had conquered Hanzhong The ensigns toward the south were turned againThe subsequent course of the war will be unfolded in later chaptersCHAPTER  Gan Nings Hundred Horsemen Raid The Northern Camp Zuo Cis FlungDown Cup Fools Cao Cao Sun Quan was occupied in ordering his army at Ruxu when he heard of the coming of Cao Cao with four hundred thousand troops to the relief of HefeiHe told off a fleet of fifty large ships to lie in the port while Chen Wu went up and down the river banks on the lookoutIt would be well to inflict a defeat upon Cao Caos army before they recover from the long march it would dishearten them said Zhang ZhaoLooking around at the officers in his tent Sun Quan said Who is bold enough to go forth and fight this Cao Cao and so take the keen edge off the spirit of his army And Ling Tong offered himselfI will go said heHow many soldiers do you require Three thousand troops will suffice replied Ling TongBut Gan Ning struck in saying Only a hundred horse would be needed why send three thousand Ling Tong was angry and he and Gan Ning began to wrangle even in the presence of their chiefCao Caos army is too strong to be attacked recklessly said Sun QuanFinally he gave the commission to Ling Tong with his three thousand bidding him reconnoiter just outside Ruxu and fight the enemy if he met himMarching out Ling Tong very soon saw a great cloud of dust which marked the approach of an armyAs soon as they came near enough Zhang Liao who led the van engaged with Ling Tong and they fought half a hundred bouts without sign of victory for eitherThen Sun Quan began to fear for his champion so he sent Lu Meng to extricate Ling Tong from the battle and escort him homeWhen Ling Tong had come back his rival Gan Ning went to Sun Quan and said Now let me have the hundred horsemen and I will raid the enemys camp this nightIf I lose a soldier or a mount I will claim no merit Sun Quan commended his courage and chose a hundred of his best veterans whom he placed under Gan Nings command for the raidSun Quan also gave him as a feast for the soldiers fifty flasks of wine and seventy five pounds of muttonReturning to the tents Gan Ning drew up his little force and made them sit down in rows Then he filled two silver goblets with wine solemnly drank to them and said Comrades tonight our orders are to raid the camp of the enemy Wherefore fill your goblets and call up all your strength for the task But the men did not welcome his words instead they looked one at another uncertainSeeing them in this mood Gan Ning adopted a fierce tone drew his sword and cried What are you waiting forIf I a leader of rank can risk my life cannot you Moved by the angry face of the leader the men rose bowed their heads and said We will fight to the last Then the wine and meat were distributed to them and each one ate his fillThe second watch was chosen as the hour to start and each man stuck a white goose plume in his cap whereby they could recognize each other in the darknessAt the time appointed they buckled on their armor mounted and galloping away quickly came to Cao Caos camp Hastily throwing aside the thorny barriers they burst in with a yell that rose to the very heavens They made straight for the center hoping to slay Cao Cao himselfBut the troops of the leaders brigade had made a rampart of their carts within which they were sheltered as if in an iron tun so that the raiders failed to find a way inHowever Gan Ning and his small force dashed hither and thither cutting and slashing till Cao Caos men were quite bewildered and frightened They had no notion of the number of their assailants All their efforts only increased the confusionWherefore the hundred men had it all their own way and rushed from point to point slaying whomever they metBut soon the drums beat in every camp and torches were lit and shouts arose and it was time for the raiders to get awayGan Ning led his little body of troops out through the south gate with never a soldier trying to stop him and rode for his own campHe met Zhou Tai who had been sent to help him in case of need but the need had not arisen and the hundred heroes with their leader rode back in triumph There was no pursuit A poem was written praising this exploitThe drums of war make earth to shake When the South Land comes near even devils quakePeople long will tell of that night raid That Gan Nings gooseplumed warriors madeOn his return Gan Ning took the tale of his men at the camp gate not a man nor a horse was missingHe entered to the sound of drum and fife and the shouting of his menLong life shouted they as Sun Quan came to welcome themGan Ning dismounted and prostrated himselfHis lord raised him and took him by the hand saying This expedition of yours must have given those rebels a shakingI had yielded to your desire only I wished to give you the opportunity to manifest your valorI did not wish to let you be sacrificed Gan Nings exploit was rewarded with gifts a thousand rolls of silk and a hundred keen swords all of which he distributed among his soldiersSun Quan was very proud of his subordinates doughty deed and said Cao Cao may have his Zhang Liao but I can match him with my friend Gan Ning Soon Zhang Liao came to proffer another challenge and Ling Tong impatient at being excelled by his rival and enemy begged that he might go out to fightHis request was granted and he marched out a short distance from Ruxu with five thousand troopsSun Quan with Gan Ning in his train went out to look on at the encounterWhen both armies had come out on the plain and were arrayed Zhang Liao with Li Dian and Yue Jin one on either side advanced to the frontLing Tong sword in hand galloped out towards him and at Zhang Liaos command Yue Jin took the challenge and went to open the combatThey fought half a hundred bouts and neither seemed to have the better of the otherThen Cao Cao hearing of the great contest going on rode up to the battlefield and took position under the great standard whence he could see the fighting Seeing both combatants were waxing desperate he thought to decide the struggle by an unfair blowHe bade Cao Xiu let fly a secret arrow which he did by creeping up under cover of Zhang Liao It struck Ling Tongs steed which reared and threw its riderYue Jin dashed forward to thrust at the fallen warrior with his spear but before the blow could be given the twang of another bow was heard and an arrow speeding by hit Yue Jin full in the face He fell from his horseThen both sides rushed forward to rescue their champions the gongs clanged and the combat ceasedLing Tong returned to his camp and reported himself to his masterThe arrow that saved you was shot by Gan Ning said Sun Quan Ling Tong turned to his rival and bowed lowI could not have supposed you would have rendered me such a service Sir said he to Gan NingThis episode ended the strife and enmity between the two leaders who thereafter swore perpetual friendshipOn the other side Cao Cao saw to it that his generals wound was dressed and next day he launched an attack against Ruxu along five different linesHe himself led one army in the center on the left Zhang Liao and Li Dian led two armies on the right Xu Huang and Pang De commanded the other twoEach army was ten thousand strong and they marched to give battle on the river bankThe crews and fighting troops of the South Lands naval squadron were greatly frightened by the approach of these armiesYou have eaten the bread of your prince and you must give loyal service why fear said Xu ShengThereupon he put some hundreds of his best men into small boats went along the bank and broke into the legion under Li DianMeanwhile Dong Xi on the ships beat drums and cheered them onBut a great storm came on lashing the river to fury and the waves rolled mountains highThe larger ships rolled as if they would overturn and the soldiers of Wu were frightened They started to get down into the bulkier cargoboats to save their lives But Dong Xi threatened them with his sword cutting down some half score of the mutineersMy orders are to hold this point against the enemy shouted he we dare not abandon the ships However the wind increased and presently the bold Dong Xi was thrown into the river by the rolling of his ship and was drowned together with his menXu Sheng dashed hither and thither among Li Dians army slaying right and leftChen Wu hearing the noise of battle set out for the river bank On his way Chen Wu met Pang De and the legion under him A melee ensuedThen Sun Quan with Zhou Tai and his troops joined in The small force from the ships that had attacked Li Dian was now surrounded So Sun Quan gave the signal for an onslaught that should rescue them This failed and Sun Quan was himself surrounded in turn and soon in desperate straitsFrom a height Cao Cao saw his difficulties and sent in Xu Chu to cut Sun Quans column in halves so that neither half could aid the other When Zhou Tai had cut an arterial alley out of the press and reached the riverside he looked for his master But Sun Quan was nowhere visible so Zhou Tai dashed once again into the battleComing to his own troops he cried Where is our lord They pointed to where the press was most denseZhou Tai stiffened and dashed inPresently he reached his lords side and cried out My lord follow me and I will hack a way out Zhou Tai fought his way out to the river bank Then he turned to look and Sun Quan was not behind him So he turned back forced his way in and once again found his way to his masters sideI cannot get out the arrows are too thick said Sun QuanThen go first my lord and I will follow Sun Quan then urged his steed as fast as he could go and Zhou Tai kept off all pursuitZhou Tai sustained many wounds and the arrows rattled on his helmet but he got clear at last and Sun Quan was safeAs they neared the river bank Lu Meng came up with some of the naval force and escorted Sun Quan down to the shipsI owe my safety to Zhou Tai who thrice came to my aid said Sun QuanBut Xu Sheng is still in the thick of the fight and how can we save him I will go to his rescue cried Zhou TaiWhirling his spear Zhou Tai again plunged into the battle and presently brought his colleague safely out of the pressBoth were severely woundedLu Meng ordered his troops to keep up a rapid flight of arrows so as to command the bank and in this way the two leaders were enabled to get on board the shipsNow Chen Wu had engaged the legion under Pang De Being inferior in force and no aid being forthcoming Chen Wu was forced into a valley where the trees and undergrowth were very denseHe tried to turn but was caught by the branches and while so entangled he was killed by Pang DeWhen Cao Cao saw that Sun Quan had escaped from the battle to the river bank he urged his steed forward in pursuit He sent flights of arrows toward the fugitivesBy this time Lu Mengs troops had emptied their quivers and he began to be very anxious But just then a fleet of ships sailed up led by Lu Xun the soninlaw of Sun Ce who came with one hundred thousand marines and drove back Cao Caos army Then he landed to pursueHe captured many thousands of horses and slew many men so that Cao Cao was quite defeated and retiredThen they sought and found the body of Chen Wu among the slain Sun Quan was much grieved when he came to know that Chen Wu had been slain and Dong Xi drowned and wept sore Men were sent to seek for Dong Xis body which at last was found Both generals were buried with great honorsAs a recompense for Zhou Tais services in Sun Quans rescue Sun Quan prepared in his honor a great banquet where Sun Quan himself offered Zhou Tai a goblet of wine and complimented and embraced him while the tears coursed down his cheeksTwice you saved my life careless of your own cried Sun Quan and you have received many wounds It is as if your skin had been engraved and painted What sort of a man should I be if I did not treat you as one of my own flesh and blood Can I regard you noble Sir merely as a unit in my army You are my meritorious ministerI share the glory you have won and mine are your joys and sorrows Then Sun Quan bade Zhou Tai open his dress and exhibit his wounds for all the assembly to see The skin was gashed all over as if his body had been scored with a knifeSun Quan pointed to the wounds one after another and asked how each one had been receivedAnd as Zhou Tai told him for every wound Sun Quan made him drink off a goblet of wine till he became thoroughly intoxicatedSun Quan then presented him with a black silk parasol and bade him use it on all occasions as a sign of the glory that was hisBut Sun Quan found his opponents too stable at the end of a month the two armies were both at Ruxu and neither had won a victoryThen said Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong Cao Cao is too strong and we cannot overcome him by mere forceIf the struggle continues longer you will only lose more soldiersYou would better seek to make peace Sun Quan followed this advice and dispatched Bu Zhi on a peace mission to Cao Caos camp Sun Quan offered a yearly tributeCao Cao also saw that the South Land was too strong to be overcome and consentedCao Cao insisted The Marquis should first send away his army and then I would retire Bu Zhi returned with this message and Sun Quan sent away the greater part leaving only Zhou Tai and Jiang Qin to hold Ruxu The army returned to Capital MolingCao Cao left Cao Ren and Zhang Liao in charge of Hefei and he marched the army back to Capital XuchangOn arrival all Cao Caos officers military and civil persuaded him to become Prince of WeiOnly the Chair of the Secretariat Cui Yan spoke strongly against the schemeYou are then the only man who knows not the fate of Xun Yu said his colleagues Such times Such deeds cried Cui YanYou are guilty of rebellion but you may commit it yourselvesI will bear no part in it Certain enemies told Cao Cao and Cui Yan was thrown into prisonAt his trial he glared like a tiger and his very beard curled with contempt he raged and cursed at Cao Cao for a betrayer of his prince and a rebelThe interrogating magistrate reported his conduct to Cao Cao who ordered Cui Yan to be beaten to death in prisonCui Yan of QingheGreenriver Firm and unyielding was he With beard crisp curling and gleaming eyes Which showed the man of stone and iron withinHe drove the evil from his presence And his glory is fair and highFor loyalty to his lord of Han His fame shall increase as the ages rollIn the twentyfirst year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  in the fifth month of that year a great memorial signed by many officers went up to Emperor Xian praying The Duke of Wei has rendered so great services that no minister before him in Heaven as well as on Earth not even Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou could match his manifest merits to the stateThus the title of kingship should be granted to him The memorial was approved and a draft edict was prepared by the famous Zhong Yao to make Cao Cao Prince of WeiThrice Cao Cao with seeming modesty pretended to decline the honor but thrice was his refusal rejectedFinally he made his obeisance and was enrolled as Prince of Wei with the usual insignia and privileges a coronet with twelve strings of beads and a chariot with gilt shafts drawn by six steeds Using the formalities of the Son of God he decorated his imperial chariot with bells and had the roads cleared when he passed along He built himself a palace at Yejun Then he began to discuss the appointment of an heirapparentHis principal wife Lady Ding was without issue but a concubine Lady Liu had borne him a son Cao Ang who had been killed in battle at the siege of Wancheng when Cao Cao fought against Zhang XiuA second concubine Lady Bian had borne him four sons Cao Pi Cao Zhang Cao Zhi and Cao XiongWherefore he elevated Lady Bian to the rank of Queen of Wei in place of Lady DingThe third son Cao Zhi was very clever and a ready master of composition Cao Cao wished him to be named the heirThen the eldest son Cao Pi sought from the High Adviser Jia Xu a plan to secure his rights of primogeniture and Jia Xu told him to do so and soThereafter whenever the father went out on any military expedition Cao Zhi wrote fulsome panegyrics but Cao Pi wept so copiously at bidding his father farewell that the courtiers were deeply affected and remarked that though Cao Zhi was crafty and clever he was not so sincerely filial as Cao PiCao Pi also bought over his fathers immediate attendants who then rang the praises of his virtues so loud that Cao Cao was strongly disposed to name him as the heir after all After hesitating a long time the matter was referred to Jia Xu I wish to name my heir who shall it be said Cao CaoJia Xu would not say and Cao Cao asked why I was just recalling the past in my mind and could not reply at once said Jia XuWhat were you recalling I was thinking of two fathers Yuan Shao and Liu Biao and their sons Cao Cao smiledSoon after this he declared his eldest son his heirIn the winter of that year in the tenth month the building of the palace of the new Prince of Wei was completed and the furnishing begun From all parts were collected rare flowers and uncommon trees to beautify the gardensOne agent went into the South Land and saw Sun Quan to whom he presented a letter from Cao Cao asking that he might be allowed to proceed to Wenzhou to get some orangesAt that period Sun Quan was in a most complaisant mood toward Cao Cao so from the orange trees in his own city he picked forty loads of very fine fruits and sent them immediately to YejunOn the way the bearers of the oranges fell tired and they had to stop at the foot of a certain hill There came along an elderly man blind of one eye and lame of one leg who wore a white rattan headdress and a black loose robe He saluted the bearers and stayed to talk Presently he said Your burdens are heavy O porters may this old Taoist lend you a shoulder What do you say Naturally they were pleased enough and the amiable wayfarer bore each load for two milesWhen they resumed their burdens they noticed that the loads seemed lighter than before and they felt rather suspiciousWhen the Taoist was taking his leave of the officer in charge of the party he said I am an old friend from the same village as the Prince of Wei My name is Zuo Ci Among Taoists I bear the appellation of BlackHornWhen you get to the end of your journey you may say that I was inquiring after your lord Zuo Ci shook down his sleeves and leftIn due course the orange bearers reached the new palace and the oranges were presentedBut when Cao Cao cut one open it was but an empty shell of a thing there was no pulp beneath the rindCao Cao was rather puzzled and called in the porters who told him of their falling in with the mysterious Taoist on the wayBut Cao Cao scouted the idea of that being the reasonBut just then the warden of the gate sent to say that a certain Taoist named Zuo Ci was at the gate and wished to see the king Send him in said Cao CaoHe is the man we met on the way said the porters when he appearedCao Cao said curtly What sorcery have you been exercising on my beautiful fruit How could such a thing happen said the TaoistThereupon he cut open an orange and showed it full of pulp most delicious to the tasteBut when Cao Cao cut open another that again was empty nothing but rind Cao Cao was more than ever perplexedHe bade his visitor be seated and as Zuo Ci asked for refreshment wine and food were brought inThe Taoist ate ravenously consuming a whole sheep and drank in proportion Yet he showed no sign of intoxication or repletionBy what magic are you here said Cao CaoI am but a poor Taoist I went into Shu and on Mount Omi I studied the way for thirty long years One day I heard my name called from out the rocky wall of my cellI looked but could see nothingThe same thing happened next day and so on for many daysThen suddenly with a roar like thunder the rock split asunder and I saw a sacred book in three volumes called The Book of Concealing MethodFrom the first volume I learned to ascend to the clouds astride the wind to sail up into the great void itself from the second to pass through mountains and penetrate rocks from the third to float light as vapor over the seas to become invisible at will or change my shape to fling swords and project daggers so as to decapitate a man from a distanceYou O Prince have reached the acme of glory why not now withdraw and like me become a disciple of the TaoistsWhy not travel to Mount Omi and there mend your ways so that I may bequeath my three volumes to you  Oft have I reflected upon this course and struggled against my fate but what can I do There is no one to maintain the government replied Cao CaoThere is Liu Bei of Yiazhou a scion of the dynastic family could you not make way for himIf you do not I may have to send one of my flying swords after your head one day You are one of his secret agents said Cao Cao suddenly enragedSeize him cried he to his lictorsThey did so while the Taoist laughed And Zuo Ci continued to laugh as they dragged him down to the dungeons where they beat him cruellyAnd when they had finished the Taoist lay there gently respiring in a sound sleep just as if he felt nothing whateverThis enraged Cao Cao still more and he bade them put the priest into the large wooden collar and nail it securely and then chain him in a cellAnd Cao Cao set guards over him and the guards saw the collar and chains just fall off while the victim lay fast asleep not injured in the leastThe Taoist lay in prison seven days without food or water and when they went to look at him he was sitting upright on the ground quite well and rosy lookingThe gaolers reported these things to Cao Cao who had the prisoner brought inI do not mind going without food for years said the victim when Cao Cao questioned him yet I could eat a thousand sheep in a day Cao Cao was at the end of his resources he could prevail nothing against such a manThat day there was to be a great banquet at the new palace and guests came in crowdsWhen the banquet was in progress and the wine cup passing freely suddenly the same Taoist appeared He had wooden clogs on his feetAll faces turned in his direction and not a few were afraid others wonderedStanding there in front of the great assembly the Taoist said O powerful Prince here today you have every delicacy on the table and a glorious company of guests You have rare and beautiful objects from all parts of the world Is there anything lackingIf there be anything you would like name it and I will get it for you Cao Cao replied Then I want a dragons liver to make soup can you get that Wheres the difficulty replied Zuo CiWith a pencil the Taoist immediately sketched a dragon on the whitewashed wall of the banquet hallThen he flicked his sleeve over it the dragons belly opened of itself and therefrom Zuo Ci took the liver all fresh and bloodyYou had the liver hidden in your sleeve said Cao Cao incredulous Then there shall be another test said the TaoistIt is winter and every plant outside is deadWhat flower would you like O PrinceName any one you will I want a peony said Cao CaoEasy said the TaoistAt this request they brought out a flowerpot which was placed in full view of the guestsThen he spurted some water over it and in a very short time up came a peony with two fully expanded flowersThe guests were astonished and they asked the Taoist to be seated and gave him wine and foodThe cook sent in some minced fishThe best mince is made from the perch of River Song said the Taoist How can you get fish five hundred miles away said Cao CaoNot at all difficultTell someone to get a rod and hook and fish in the pond just below this banquet hall They did so and very soon several beautiful perches lay on the stepsI have always kept some of these in my ponds of course said Cao CaoO Prince do you think to deceive meAll perches have two gills except the River Song perch which has two pairsThat is the distinguishing feature The guests crowded round to look and surely enough the fish had four gillsTo cook this perch one needs purple sprout ginger though said the TaoistCan you also produce that asked Cao CaoEasily Zuo Ci told them to bring in a silver bowl which the magician filled with waterVery soon the ginger filled the bowl and he presented it to the hostCao Cao put out his hand to pick some when suddenly a book appeared in the bowl and the title was Cao Caos New Treatise on the Art of WarHe took it out and read it over Not a word of his treatise was missingCao Cao became more mystified Zuo Ci took up a jade cup that stood on the table filled it with fine wine and presented it to Cao Cao Drink this O Prince and you will live a thousand years Drink of it first yourself said Cao CaoThe Taoist took the jade pin from his headdress and drew it across the cup as if dividing the wine into two portionsThen he drank one half and handed the cup with the other half to Cao CaoBut Cao Cao angrily refused it The Taoist then threw the cup into the air where it was transformed into a white dove which circled round the banquet hall and then flew awayAll faces were turned upward following the flight of the dove and so no one had noticed the going of the TaoistBut he was gone and soon the gate warden reported that he had left the palaceSaid Cao Cao A magician like this ought to be put to death or he will do some mischief The redoubtable Xu Chu and a company of three hundred armed men were sent to arrest the TaoistThey saw the Taoist still wearing his wooden clogs not far ahead but striding along quicklyXu Chu rode after Zuo Ci but in spite of all his horse could do he could not come up with Zuo CiHe kept up the chase right to the hills when he met a shepherd lad with a flock of sheep And there walked the Taoist among the sheep The Taoist disappearedThe angry warrior slew the whole flock of sheep while the shepherd lad looked on weepingSuddenly the boy heard a voice from one of the severed heads telling him to replace the heads on the bodies of his sheepInstead of doing so he fled in terror covering his faceThen he heard a voice calling to him Do not run away you shall have your sheep again He turned and lothe sheep were all alive again and Zuo Ci was driving them alongThe boy began to question him but the Taoist made no replyWith a flick of his sleeves he was goneThe shepherd lad went home and told all these marvels to his master He could not conceal such a story and it reached Cao CaoThen sketches of the Taoist were sent everywhere with orders to arrest himWithin three days were arrested in the city and outside three or four hundred persons all blind of one eye lame of one leg and wearing a rattan headdress a black loose robe and wooden clogs They were all alike and all answered to the description of the missing Taoist There was a great hubbub in the streetCao Cao ordered his officer to sprinkle the crowd of Taoists with the blood of pigs and goats in order to exorcise the witchcraft and take them away to the drill ground on the south of the cityThither he followed them with his guards who surrounded the crowd of arrested persons and slew every oneBut from the neck of each one after the head was severed there floated up into the air a wreath of black vapor and all these wreaths drifted toward a center where they joined up into the image of another Zuo Ci who presently beckoned to him a white crane out of the sky mounted it and sat as on a horseClapping his hands the Taoist cried merrily The rats of the earth follow the golden tiger and one morning the doer of evil shall be no more The soldiers shot arrows at both bird and man At this a tremendous storm burst over the cityStones were driven along sand was whirled about and all the corpses arose from the ground each holding his own head in his handsThey rushed toward Cao Cao as if to strike himThe officials covered their eyes and none dared to look another in the faceThe power of a bold man will overturn a state The art of a necromancer also produces wondersRead the next chapter and you will know the fate of Cao Cao CHAPTER  Guan Lu Sees Things In The Book Of Changes Five Loyal Subjects Die For Their StateThe sight of the corpses of his victims rising to their feet in the storm and running toward him was too much for Cao Cao and he swoonedHowever the wind quickly fell and the corpses disappearedHis followers assisted Cao Cao to his palace but he was very ill A poet celebrated the episode of the murdered Taoist He studied his magical books He was learned in mystical lore And with magical fleetness of foot He could travel the wide world overThe magical arts that he knew He employed in an earnest essay To reform the bad heart of Cao CaoBut in vain Cao Cao held on his way Cao Caos illness seemed beyond the art of the physicians and drugs seemed of no availIt happened that Minister Xu Zhi came from the capital to visit the prince who bade the latter take a cast from the Book of Changes Have you ever heard of Guan LuHe is more than human in his skill at divination said Xu ZhiI have heard a lot about him but I do not know how clever he is you tell me about him replied Cao Cao He is from PingyuanHis face is ugly and coarse he drinks to excess and is rather dissipatedHis father was an elder of LangyeFrom a lad Guan Lu loved to study the stars staying up all night to watch them in spite of the prohibition of his father and motherHe used to say that if domestic fowls and wild geese knew the seasons naturally how much more should humansHe often used to play with other boys at drawing pictures of the sky on the ground putting in the sun moon and starsWhen he grew older he studied the Book of Changes very deeply and observed the winds He was a marvelous calculator and excellent physiognomistHis fame reached the ears of Shan Zichun the Governor of Langye who called him to his residence for an interviewThere were present some hundred or so other guests every one of whom could be called able of speechI am young and not overbold said Guan Lu to the GovernorI pray you give me three flasks of wine to loosen my tongue The request was astonishing but the wine was brought in and when he had drunk it Guan Lu looking contemptuously at the other guests said Now I am ready are these the sort of opponents you have got together for me to contend withAre these gentlemen sitting around me disputants I myself am anxious for a match with you said Shan ZichunThen they began upon the meaning of the Book of ChangesGuan Lus words poured forth like a torrent and his ideas were most reconditeThe Governor replied stating difficulties Guan Lu swept them away in a stream of eloquenceSo it went on the whole day without a pause even for refreshmentNeither Shan Zichun nor his other guests could help praising Guan Lu and agreeing with himHis fame spread wide after this encounter and people spoke of him as the Supernatural Boy After this he became famous in another wayThere was a certain Guo En a man of the people who had two brothers All three became lame and they called in Guan Lu to cast lots and discover the reasonGuan Lu said By the lots there is a female demon in your family tomb an aunt the wife of one of your fathers brothersSome years ago in a time of famine for the sake of a few carts of grain she was pushed into a well and a great stone was thrown in on her crushing her head so that she suffered intensely She complained to the Most High and your lameness is the retribution for that crimeNo prayers will avert the evil The three brothers wept and acknowledged their guiltGovernor Wang Ji of Anping heard of the diviners fame and invited him to come on a visit and he wentIt happened that another guest of the Governor was the magistrate of Xindu whose wife suffered from headaches and his son from pains in the heart Guan Lu was asked to discover the reasonHe cast lots and said that at the west corner of the main hall there were buried two corpses one of a man who held a spear the other of a man who had a bow and arrows The wall was built across themThe spearmans master had gashed his head and so his head painedThe archers master had stabbed him in the heart and so his heart suffered anguishThey dug where Guan Lu indicated and about eight spans down found two coffins one with a spear inside and the other with a strung bow and wooden arrows All were much decayedGuan Lu bade them remove the bones and bury them three miles outside the walls Thereafter the woman and her son suffered no moreA certain Zhuge Yuan Magistrate of Guantao newly promoted to Governor was leaving for his new post and Guan Lu went to see him offOne of the guests mentioned that Guan Lu could divine what was hidden from sight The Governor doubted such powers and said he would put a testHe got a swallows egg a wasps nest and a spider and concealed them in three separate boxes He asked Guan Lu to guess the contents The divination made Guan Lu wrote three quatrainsThe latent life will declare itself It will cling to your lordly hall Or male or female flung into space Wide wings will prevent its fall This seems to indicate a swallows eggA manychambered dwelling Is hanging to your eaves Each room has a poisonous tenant Wholl be flying when he leavesThis answers to a wasps nest Therein is a longlegged trembling thing Who spins a thread from his inside And spreads a fine spun net for flies He profits most at eventideAnd this it a spider The guests were amazedAn old woman in his village having lost a cow came to consult himAfter the divination he told her that seven men had taken away the cow and were cooking and eating it on the bank of a certain mountain stream She would better go there quickly and see who they wereIf she went with all speed she would find the skin and the fleshThe woman went and found the seven men hidden behind a small shanty boiling beef Most of the cows flesh was still thereShe told Governor Liu Bin who arrested the seven men and punished themThen the Governor asked the old lady how she got to know exactly who the offenders were and she told him Governor Liu Bin was dubious too He sent for Guan Lu and put him to the following testHe placed his seal and a pheasant feather in a box and asked what were the contents The reply wasSquare within without so round Beauteous colors here abound The jewel within is held secure And what it witnesses is sureIs not this a seal in its bag Theres a bird on the precipice steep Its body with flame seems aglowIts wings are barred yellow and black At sunrise it never fails to crow And I think this hints at a pheasant featherGovernor Liu Bin treated the marvelous diviner with great honorOne day Guan Lu saw a youth plowing a field After watching him for a long time Guan Lu suddenly asked his name and ageMy name is Zhao Yan and I am nineteen said the young manPray who may you be Sir I am Guan Lu you may have heard of meI see an air of early death about you and you will be done with life in three daysIt is a pity that one so handsome should die so young Zhao Yan forsook his plow hurried home and told his fatherThe father at once set out to find Guan Lu and having found Guan Lu threw himself on the ground and besought the diviner to save his son How can I avert the doom It is fate said Guan Lu AlasI have but this one son I pray you save him And the son added his tears and prayers to those of his father Guan Lu was deeply touchedThen he turned to the lad and said You get ready some good wine and some venison Tomorrow go into the forest on the south there and underneath a lofty tree you will see two men seated on boulders playing chess One of them will be dressed in white and he will be facing the south He is very evil lookingThe other will be seated opposite dressed in red He is very handsomeThey will be deeply absorbed in their game and will not notice who offers them food and wine which you will humbly present on your kneesWhen they have eaten and drunk you will prostrate yourself and with tears pray them to grant you length of days You will gain an increased span of life but above all things do not mention that I told you what to do The father kept Guan Lu as a guest and the next day the son followed out his instructionsHe entered the forest and soon came upon the two men seated beneath a pine playing chess They seemed oblivious to all around themZhao Yan presented the wine and the food and the two men ate absentmindedly for the game went onBut when Zhao Yan threw himself on the ground and implored the gift of long life they seemed startledThis must be some of Guan Lus doing said RedRobeStill as we have accepted a gift at his hand we must have pity on him He who was dressed in white then lifted up a book that hung at his side and looked therein You are nineteen this year said WhiteDress to Zhao Yan You ought to dieBut we will insert a number nine over the number one and so make it read ninetynine and that is the age you will attainBut when you go back tell Guan Lu he is not to betray the secrets of fate or Heaven will surely punish him Then RedRobe took out a pen and added the figureA gust of wind passed and the two old men were transformed into two cranes that rose into the sky and flew awayZhao Yan came back home and told what he had seenGuan Lu told him the redrobed man was the Southern Dipper Constellation and the whiterobed the Northern DipperBut the Northern Dipper consists of nine stars and there was only one man objected the ladSeparately they are nine but they combine to form oneThe Northern Dipper records deaths the Southern Dipper birthsNow the extra figure has been added you need have no anxiety you will live longFather and son both thanked him most sincerely but thereafter Guan Lu was very careful how he divined for people lest he should betray celestial secretsNow this man is at Pingyuan and you O Prince can seek your fate of himWhy not call him Cao Cao was greatly glad Guan Lu was sent for and cameAs soon as the salutations were over Cao Cao asked him to cast lots for himGuan Lu at once found the cause and said The illness is only due to magical machinations it should not create anxiety Cao Cao was much relieved in his mind and his health began to improve Next Cao Cao wished to know about the conditions in the empires affairsAfter the necessary calculations the prophet said Three and eight cross the yellow boar meets the tiger the southern expedition causes the loss of one limb Then Cao Cao asked him to inquire whether his life should be long or notGuan Lu replied Lion in the Palace to preserve the talents of ancestorsthe Princes way is securely renewed and his son and grandson shall come to high honor Then Cao Cao asked concerning himselfDivination concerning the fate of the universe may not be foreknown wait a time and I will look into it Cao Cao was pleased and would like to keep such a man near him so he offered him the post of historiographer  at his court but it was declinedMy destiny is mean my luck despicable I am not equal to such an office and dare not undertake it said Guan Lu Why not said Cao CaoMy forehead has no lofty fullness my eyes no steady expression my nose no bridge my feet no round solid heels my back lacks the triple armor I can only control evil spirits securely I cannot rule living humans What think you of my physiognomy What can a minister of extremely exalted rank like yourself desire further said Guan LuCao Cao pressed him to say the soothsayer only laughedThen Cao Cao asked him to look at the many officers of all kinds standing aroundEvery one of them is a servant equal to the administration of the empire said Guan LuBut when Cao Cao asked whether good or bad fortune was to be his the soothsayer would not give a clear and full reply A poem says Guan Lu was a seer of old Stars to him their secrets toldMysteries occult and dim Were as daylight unto himHis so subtle intellect Could the shade of death detect But the secrets of his skill Died with himare secrets stillAgain Cao Cao asked him to divine concerning his rivals Wu and ShuGuan Lu said The south just lost a famous leader and the west is encroaching on your territory Cao Caos doubts as to the accuracy of one of these events were soon set at rest for a messenger came from Hefei to reportLu Su the Supreme Commander of the South Land has died in Lukou Then Cao Cao sent hurriedly into Hanzhong and the scout returned to reportZhang Fei and Ma Chao have taken the Xiabian Pass and are threatening Hanzhong Cao Cao was angry and inclined to march at once against the invaders but he consulted the great soothsayer who advised him not to move Do not act in hasteIn the coming spring there will be a conflagration in Xuchang said Guan LuHaving been witness of the verification of Guan Lus words Cao Cao was in no mood to neglect the warningHe stayed on in his palace but he sent Cao Hong with fifty thousand troops to assist in the defense of the Eastern Land of Rivers while Xiahou Dun with thirty thousand troops went to Xuchang to keep careful watch and be ready against any surprisesHe placed High Minister Wang Bi in command of the Imperial GuardSima Yi warned Cao Cao against this Wang Bi saying The man is given to wine and slack He is not a fit person for such a post Cao Cao replied He is very fit He has followed me through all difficulties and dangersHe is loyal and diligent solid as stone or iron Wang Bi was appointed and led the guard into camp at the capital outside the East Gate of the Imperial PalaceNow there was a certain Geng Ji a Luoyang man who had long been employed in the Prime Ministers palace in a subordinate capacity and afterward had been promoted to a post of Minister He and Minister Wei Huang were close friendsThese two were greatly distressed at Cao Caos advance to princely rank and more especially at his use of the imperial chariotsIn the early months of the twentythird year  Geng Ji and Wei Huang came to a secret exchange of views on Cao Caos conductGeng Ji said The man is rebellious and wicked every day behaving worseHe intends to go farther and how can we as servants of the dynasty help him in his wickedness Wei Huang said I have a friend named Jin Yi who also is a servant of Han and an enemy of Cao Caos He is a descendant of the old Great Minister Jin MidiBeside he is friendly with Wang BiIf we all tried our best we ought to succeed But if he is friendly Wang Bi he will not assist us said Geng JiLet us go and sound him said Wei HuangSo the two went to see Jin Yi who received them in his private rooms There they talkedSaid Wei Huang O virtuous Jin Yi we know you are on most friendly terms with Commander Wang Bi and so have come to beg a favor What is it you ask The Prince of Wei will soon receive the abdication of the Emperor and himself ascend to the seat of the mighty Then you and your friend Wang Bi will advance to places of great honor and when that day comes we pray you not to forget us but to recommend us for employmentWe should feel no shallow gratitude for your kindness Jin Yi flicked down his sleeves and arose looking very angryAt that instant arrived the tea for the visitors He snatched it away from the serving man and emptied it on the floor Wei Huang started up in feigned alarmHow have I offended you my good friend cried heI have been friends with you because you are descendants of people who have served the Hans faithfullyNow instead of trying to repay the debt of gratitude you ought to feel you turn aside to assist one who is their enemy think you that I can regard you as friendsHow could I look the world in the face But if it be destiny one cannot help it said Geng JiOne must accept it Jin Yi grew still more angry so that the two visitors were convinced that at heart he was still loyal to the dynastyThen they began to tell him the true state of the caseOur real desire is to destroy this rebel and we have come to ask your help in thatWhat we said at first was only a test to find out what you thought Think you with my ancestry generation after generation in the confidence and service of the Hans that I would willingly follow a rebelIf you Sirs really think of restoring the dynasty pray tell me your plans Though we have the desire to prove our gratitude yet we lack the means to destroy the enemy said Wei HuangSaid Jin Yi We desire helpers within and supporters without If we could slay Wang Bi we could use his name and troops to help the EmperorWith the help of Liu Bei the Imperial Uncle we should be able to destroy the rebel Cao Cao Hearing Jin Yis plan the others clapped their hands in approvalAnd I have two friends outside of the city who will go with us said Jin Yi Both of them have the murder of a father to avenge We can get their helps Who are they They are sons of the great physician Ji Ping and are called Ji Mao and Ji MuCao Cao put their father to death for his connection with the plot organized by Dong Cheng when Dong Cheng received the secret edict conveyed in the robe and girdle which was conferred upon him by the EmperorThe two sons escaped that time by flight but they have since secretly returned to the capitalWith their help all will go well Geng Ji and Wei Huang rejoiced at the prospect of further help and a messenger was sent to call in the two Reilly brothersSoon they arrived and the plot was laid before them They were deeply affected and shed copious tearsTheir wrath rose to the sky and they swore to aid in the destruction of the rebelOn the fifteenth day of the first month there will be grand illuminations in the city said Jin Yi and felicitations will continue on every sideGeng Ji and Wei Huang will each lead out their retainers and make their way quickly to Wang Bis camp to wait till they see the fire beginThen they will dash in slay Wang Bi and follow me inside the Palace We will then request the Emperor to ascend the Tower of the Five Phoenixes assemble his officers and issue orders to destroy the rebels The two Reilly brothers will make their way into the city and set fires going Then all will raise their voices and summon the populace to their aidThey are to hold up any rescue force in the city till the Emperor has issued the edict and disturbance is allayed when they will rush toward Yejun and seize Cao Cao Then a messenger will be dispatched with a summons for Liu Bei the Imperial UncleWe will begin our work that night at the second watch and we will escape the ill success that attended Dong Chengs attempt All five swore before Heaven to be true and they smeared their lips with blood in earnest of their oath After this each returned to his own home to prepare arms and call up their peopleGeng Ji and Wei Huang each had four or five hundred retainers whom they armedJi Mao and Ji Mu also got together three hundred men They gave out a story of a hunting party to explain the gatheringWhen the preparations were complete and before the time fixed for the rising Jin Yi went to see Wang Bi and said Everything in the world seems now tranquil and the power of the Prince of Wei extends over all the landIt is a season of joy and felicitation and everyone is hanging out lanterns and putting up decorations for the occasion The night of full moon was very clear moon and stars most brilliantThe people of the capital took advantage of the night and thronged the six streets and the three market places The lanterns were hung out in profusion and all went merrily No official interfered with the crowd no one thought of the flight of time all was simple gaietyThat night the Commander of the Imperial Guards Wang Bi and his officers had a feast in their campJust after the second watch had begun they heard a great shouting in the camp and someone came in to say that a fire had started in the rearWang Bi hurriedly left the table and went outsideHe saw flames leaping up and rolling by and heard shouts of Kill rising on every side and echoing to the very sky He thought the camp had certainly mutinied and jumping on his horse went out at the south gate Just outside he ran against Geng Ji who loosed an arrow which struck him in the shoulder He nearly fell with the shock but he got away toward the west gateHe found he was pursued by armed men so he got flurried dismounted and went on footPresently he came to the house of Jin Yi and hammered at the doorNow the fire that had created such a scare had been raised by Jin Yis own people sent for that purpose and Jin Yi had followed them to fight when the time came Hence there was no one but the woman folk left in his houseWhen the women heard the clamor at the door they thought Jin Yi had come back and his wife from the door of the womens quarter called out Have you killed Wang Bi This was a shock but it told Wang Bi that his quondam friend was now an enemyWherefore he fled further to the house of Cao Xiu and told him Geng Ji and Jin Yi have raised a disturbance Cao Xiu immediately armed himself got to horse and led a thousand troops into the cityHe found fires on all sides and the Tower of the Five Phoenixes was in flamesThe Emperor had fled into the recesses of the Palace but Cao Caos friends and partisans were defending the Palace gates like grim deathIn the city the crowd was shouting one to anotherSlay Cao Cao and restore the Hans When Xiahou Dun had received thirty thousand troops and the command to keep watch and ward over the capital he had gone into camp three miles from the cityWhen he saw the conflagration start he set the army in motion and surrounded the city He also sent reinforcements to Cao Xiu within Inside the city the fighting went on all nightNo one joined the conspirators the small band were left to their own effortsSoon it was reported that Jin Yi Ji Mao and Ji Mu were slainGeng Ji and Wei Huang found their way to one of the gates but there they met Xiahou Duns main force and were made prisoners The handful of men with them were cut to piecesWhen the fighting subsided Xiahou Dun went into the city and set his troops to put out the fires He also laid hands on the whole households of the five conspirators Then he sent a report to Cao Cao who sent back orders to execute the two conspirators and put to death in public all the members of the five families He was also to arrest every official and send the whole batch to Yejun for interrogationsXiahou Dun sent his two chief prisoners to the place of executionThey shouted against Cao CaoLiving we have failed to slay you Cao Cao dead we will be malicious spirits smiting rebels in all places The executioner smote Geng Ji on the mouth with his sword so that the blood gushed out but he continued to shout as long as he couldWei Huang his fellowconspirator dashed his temples on the ground crying How I hate him and ground his teeth till he broke them to fragments And they both died of hatred and exhaustionWho can with outstretched hands uphold the sky Or thrones maintain by simple loyalty Hans day was done two would avert the doom But failed and carried anger to the tomb Xiahou Dun carried out his chiefs orders and sent the officials he had arrested to YejunThere Cao Cao set up two flags one red and one white in the drill ground and sent all the officials thither Then he addressed themIn this late rebellion some of you went out to extinguish the fire some of you stayed within doorsLet those who went forth to put out the fire take their stand by the red flag and those who remained in their houses go to the white flag The officials thought within themselves Certainly there can be nothing wrong in trying to put out a fire so they nearly all placed themselves under the red flag only about a third went to the whiteThen the order was given to seize all those by the red flag They protestedWe are guiltless cried theyCao Cao said At that time you intended not to put out the flames but to aid the rebels He sent them all down to River Zhang and had them put to death on the bank There were more than three hundred victimsHe rewarded those who were under the white flag and sent them to their homes in the capitalWang Bi died from his wound and was buried with great honorCao Xiu was placed over the guards Zhong Yao was created Prime Minister of the princedom of Wei Hua Xin became High MinisterThe occasion was taken to create six grades of the title of Lordship with three divisions each eighteen in all There were seventeen grades of Marquis West of the Pass And all these had golden seals of office with purple ribbonsThere were also sixteen ranks of Interior Marquis and Exterior Marquis They had silver seals with tortoise ornaments on the back and black ribbons There were five classes of Minister with three grades in each classThese had brass seals with chain ornaments and ribbonsAnd with all these various gradations of ranks and nobility reorganized the court was entirely reformedThere were new ranks and new people in office Cao Cao then remembered the warning about a conflagration in the capital and wished to reward Guan Lu for his prescience but he would receive nothingCao Hong with an army went into Hanzhong He placed Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He in command at points of importance while he went on to the attackAt that time Zhang Fei and Lei Tong were holding BaxiMa Chao marched to Xiabian and sent Wu Lan out as Van Leader to reconnoiter He fell in with Cao Hong and Wu Lan was going to retire But General Ren Kui advised against this The enemy are newly arrived why not fight and take the keen edge off their prideIf we do not fight how can we look our chief in the face when we return So it was decided to offer battle and Ren Kui rode out and challenged Cao HongThe challenge was accepted and the warriors advancedCao Hong cut Ren Kui down in the third encounter and pressed the advantage and Wu Lan was beaten offWhen Wu Lan returned and told Ma Chao he was blamedWhy did you attack without orders and bring about this defeat It was the fault of Ren Kui who disobeyed orders Defend the Pass most carefully do not engage said Ma ChaoMa Chao sent a report to Capital Chengdu and awaited orders for a further actionCao Hong suspected some ruse when Ma Chao remained so long inactive and retired to NanzhengHere he was visited by Zhang He who asked General why did you retire after the successful attack and slaughter of one of the enemy leaders Seeing that Ma Chao declined to come out to fight I suspected some ruse replied Cao HongBeside when I was at Yejun that wonderful soothsayer Guan Lu foretold the loss of a leader hereI heeded what he said and so was careful Zhang He laughed You have been a leader of soldiers for half your life and yet you heed the sayings of a soothsayerI may be of small wit but I would take Baxi with my own troops and the possession of Baxi would be the key to the whole of Shu The defender of Baxi is Zhang Fei said Cao Hong He is no ordinary man to meet One must be careful All of you fear this Zhang Fei but I do not I look upon him as a mere nobodyI shall have to capture him this time But if you fail what then Then I shall be content to pay the penalty according to military rules Cao Hong made him put his undertaking in writing and then Zhang He marched to the attackThe proud are often defeat Lightsome attacks oft failThe following chapter will tell how Zhang He fared CHAPTER  Zhang Fei Takes Wakou Pass By Tactics Huang Zhong Captures Tiandang Mountain By Stratagem Zhang Hes army with which he felt so sure of victory consisted of thirty thousand troops and they were in three campsCamp Dangqu Camp Mengtou and Camp Dangshiwhich were protected by the hillsWhen Zhang He marched he left half the soldiers in each camp as defendersThe news soon reached Baxi and Zhang Fei called in his colleague Lei Tong to give his opinionLei Tong said The country is bad and the hills full of danger in the area of Langzhong let us lay an ambushYou O General go out to give battle and I will help you by a sudden and unexpected attackWe ought to get Zhang He Whereupon Zhang Fei gave five thousand troops to Lei Tong and himself led out ten thousand troops to a point ten miles from Langzhong Having set them in order he rode out and challenge Zhang He to single combat Zhang He galloped out to meet himAfter the thirtieth or so bout Zhang Hes ranks suddenly began to shout and soon showed signs of confusion The reason was the appearance of the banners of Shu from the cover of some hillsZhang He dared not continue to fight and he fled Zhang Fei pursued himLei Tong also appeared in his road and attacked and so with enemies on both sides Zhang He forced his way out and lost the dayBoth Zhang Fei and Lei Tong continued to smite him even into the night till he got back to his camp at DangquZhang He reverted to his old plan of defending the three camps rolling down logs and hurling stones But he remained behind his defenses Zhang Fei made a camp three miles offNext day Zhang Fei went forth and offered battle but Zhang He took no noticeZhang He ascended to the summit of the hill and drank wine to the accompaniment of trumpets and drums but he would not fightZhang Fei bade his soldiers shout insults but these had no effectLei Tong was sent up the hill but the rolling logs and hurtling stones forced him to retire Then the defenders of the other two camps came out to the attack and Lei Tong was discomfitedNext day Zhang Fei again offered battle but there was no responseAgain the soldiers yelled every form of insult but Zhang He from the hill top only replied by similar abuseZhang Fei was at his wits ends and this game was played for more than fifty days Then Zhang Fei made a strong stockade just in front of the hill and therein he sat day after day drinking till he became half drunkAnd when he was so he reviled his opponentAbout this time Liu Bei sent gifts to the army and when the messenger went back he told Liu Bei that his brother was giving himself over to wine This made Liu Bei anxious so he lost no time in asking advice from Zhuge LiangZhuge Liang was jocular saying Since that is so let us send him fifty vessels of the best brew of Chengdu He probably has but poor stuff in the camp But he has always had a weakness for wine and he has failed because of itYet you would encourage him to drink by sending him more wine My lord is it that you do not understand your brother even after all these yearsHe is brave and steady yet when we first invaded the Western Land of Rivers he released Yan Yan which was not what a mere brave would have doneHe is face to face with Zhang He and has been for nearly two months and day after day he drinks and rages and insults his enemy openlyHe treats Zhang He with most perfect contempt But this is not only the winecup it is a deep plan to get the better of Zhang He This may be so replied Liu Bei but let us not rely upon it too muchLet Wei Yan go to help him Zhuge Liang sent Wei Yan with the wine and the carts set out each flying a yellow flag with a writing in large characters Fine Wine for the Frontier ArmyWhen Wei Yan reached the army he handed over the wine which he said was a gift from the Lord of Shu And Zhang Fei received it with due respectZhang Fei told Wei Yan and Lei Tong each to take a thousand troops and move out on the two wings ready to act when they saw a red flag displayedAnd then he had the wine laid out and called up some soldiers to drink with a great display of flags and a rolling of drumsThe spies reported all these doings on the hilltop and Zhang He came out to look for himself There he saw his opponent drinking and two of the soldiers were boxing before Zhang Fei for his amusementHe despises me too much said Zhang He And Zhang He gave orders to prepare for a night attack on the enemy campHis own troops in Camp Dangqu should do the raiding and those from Camp Mengtou and Camp Dangshi were to support themThere was little moon that night and Zhang He took advantage of the obscurity to steal down the side of the hillHe got quite close to the enemy camp and stood for a time looking at Zhang Fei sitting amid a blaze of lamps and drinkingSuddenly Zhang He dashed forward with a yell and at the same moment his drums on the hilltop rolled out their defiance Zhang Fei never stirred Zhang He rushed at him and delivered a mighty thrust with his spear Zhang Fei toppled overit was a Zhang Fei of straw Zhang He checked and turned his steedAt that moment he heard a string of detonations and a warrior appeared before him barring his wayIt was the real Zhang Fei as the round head and thundering voice speedily made manifest With the octaneserpent halberd set Zhang Fei rode toward Zhang HeThe two warriors fought many bouts under the gleaming lights No help came to Zhang He In vain he yearned for the assistance which the two camps were to bring himHe did not know that his reinforcements had been driven back by Wei Yan and Lei Tong and that the two camps Mengtou and Dangshi were now in possession of his enemiesAs the help did not come Zhang He was powerless and to add to his discomfiture the glare of fire out in the moutains of Dangqu told him of the seizure of his third camp by Zhang Feis rear forceNothing could be done and Zhang He cut an arterial alley forced out of the press and fled to Wakou Pass The victory was all to Zhang FeiThe news of the success delighted Liu Bei and he knew then that Zhang Feis drinking had been part of a stratagem to entice his enemy into the open and defeat themZhang He reached Wakou Pass but with the loss of twothirds of his army of thirty thousand troops He stood on defense and sent urgent messages to Cao Hong to come to his rescueCao Hong angrily replied He disobeyed my orders and marched he has lost an important point and now he sends to me for help While refusing aid Cao Hong sent to urge his colleague to go out and fight But Zhang He too greatly feared At length Zhang He decided upon a plan of actionHe sent out two parties into ambush and said to them I will pretend defeat and flyThey will follow and you can cut off their retreat When he did march out he met Lei TongThe two engaged in battle and Zhang He presently ran awayLei Tong pursued and fell into the ambush Then Zhang He returned and slew Lei TongHis troops went back and told Zhang Fei who came up to provoke another fightZhang He again tried his stratagem but Zhang Fei did not pursue Again and again the ruse was tried but Zhang Fei knew it was only a ruse and simply retired to his own campHe said to Wei Yan Zhang He has compassed the death of Lei Tong by leading him into an ambush and he wants to inveigle me into another What say you to meeting trick with trick But how said Wei YanTomorrow I will lead the army forward you following me with some reliable soldiers When his army come out from their ambush you can smite them sending half your men against each partyWe will secretly fill the byroads with loads of combustibles entice the enemy among them and start a fireIn the confusion I shall try to capture Zhang HeSo will we avenge our comrades death So Zhang Fei went out and Zhang Hes troops came and began to fightAfter a half score bouts Zhang He ran away and this time Zhang Fei pursued Zhang He now fleeing now stopping to exchange a blow or two led Zhang Fei through the hills to a valleyHere suddenly changing front he halted made a camp and offered battle It was now the time when Zhang He expected his hidden troops to appear and surround Zhang Fei But none appearedHe knew not that his ambush had been broken up by Wei Yans army and driven into the valley where the road was filled with cartloads of combustibles and that the valley even then was all aflame Then Zhang Fei came to the attack and the rout was complete Zhang He fighting desperately got through to the Wakou Pass and there mustered the remnant of his force He strengthened the position and remained behind his rampartsZhang Fei and Wei Yan then tried to take the Pass but day after day they failed Zhang Fei seeing no hope of success retired seven miles and bivouacked From this point he sent out scouts under Wei Yan to explore the countryWhile going along they observed some burdenbearers men and women going up a very retired path pulling down the creepers and pushing aside the grassesThat is the way to take Wakou Pass cried Zhang Fei pointing with his whip to the wayfarersHe ordered his soldiers not to scare the people but to call a few gently and bring them to himThey soon had several standing before their leader who spoke to them kindly and put them at easeWhence come you asked Zhang FeiWe belong to Hanzhong and are going homeWe heard that you were out fighting and the high road to Langzhong was blockaded and so we have come across the Mist Torrent and Zitong Mountains and down River GuijinWe are going to our homes in Hanzhong Can one reach Wakou Pass by this roadAnd how far is it The country people replied A small road leads past to the rear of the Pass from Zitong Mountains For this piece of information Zhang Fei rewarded them by taking them into his camp and giving them a good mealThen he sent off Wei Yan to make a frontal attack on the Pass while he himself with five hundred light horse attacked it from the rear by way of Mount ZitongZhang He was grieved and disappointed that Cao Hong sent no help and the news of Wei Yans attack only added to his sorrowBut he girded on his armor and was about to ride out when they told him that fires had started at half a dozen places behind the PassThey most likely indicated soldiersHowever he went out to meet them and to his horror when the flags opened out his eyes fell on the figure of Zhang FeiAway he ran along a byroadBut his steed was not fast and as Zhang Fei pressed him close Zhang He dismounted and ran up the mountain side So Zhang He escaped He had however some ten followers and it was a small and dejected party that presently found its way into NanzhengHe saw Cao Hong and Cao Hong was very angry at his plight I told you not to go but you were willful And you gave in your written pledgeYou have lost all your soldiers yet you do not commit suicideWhat will you do next Cao Hong ordered the lictors to put Zhang He to death But Marching General Guo Huai intercededAn army is easily raised a leader is hard to findThough Zhang He is guilty he is a great favorite with our prince I think you should spare himRather give him command of another army and send him to take Jiameng Pass and so hold up the soldiers at all the stations Hanzhong will be tranquil of its own accordIf he fails a second time you can punish him for both faults Cao Hong was satisfied to do this and instead of dealing with his fault he gave Zhang He five thousand troops and told him to take the Pass The Commanders of the Pass were Meng Da and Huo JunThey were at varianceMeng Da desiring to go out to meet Zhang He but Huo Jun being in favor of defenseMeng Da being set on having his way went out gave battle and was defeatedHuo Jun reported this to the capital where Liu Bei at once called in the Directing Instructor to ask adviceZhuge Liang assembled all the chief generals into the hall Jiameng Pass is in danger we must get Zhang Fei from Langzhong to drive off Zhang He said Zhuge LiangFa Zheng replied Zhang Fei is encamped at Wakou Pass and Langzhong is no less important than Jiameng Pass I do not think he should be recalledChoose one among the generals to go and defeat Zhang He Zhuge Liang laughed Zhang He is renowned in Wei no ordinary leader will availZhang Fei is the only man to send the only one equal to the task Then among the generals one started up crying angrily Instructor why do you thus despise usI will use what little skill I have in slaying our enemy and will lay his head at the foot of our standard The speaker was Veteran General Huang Zhong and all eyes centered on himFriend Huang Zhong you are bold enough but what about your ageI fear you are no match for Zhang He Huang Zhongs white beard bristled and he said I know I am old But these two arms can still pull the fourhundredfiftypound bow and the vigor of my body is not yet departedAm I not strong enough to meet such a poor thing as Zhang He General you are nearly seventy can you still hold you are not aged Huang Zhong tore down the hallSeizing one of the great swords off the rack he whirled it as if it flewAnd the stiffest bow that hung on the wall he pulled till it snappedWell if you will go who will second you said Zhuge Liang I would prefer Veteran General Yan YanAnd if there is the least anxiety well here is this hoary head Liu Bei was pleased to let these two go to fight Zhang He However Zhao Yun put in a protest Zhang He has already got through Jiameng Pass so that the fighting will be no childs play and the loss of that Pass endangers the whole of YiazhouIt is no task to set to a couple of old men Replied Zhuge Liang You regard the two as too old and stupid to succeed but I think the attainment of Hanzhong depends upon these two Zhao Yun and many others sniggered as they went from the hall they did not agree with Zhuge Liang In due course the two Veteran Generals arrived at the PassAt sight of them Meng Da and Huo Jun the defenders of the Pass laughed in their hearts thinkingZhuge Liang has slipped up in his calculations in sending such a pair of dotards on such an important mission Huang Zhong said to Yan Yan You see the behavior of these peopleThey are laughing at us because we are old Now we will do something that will win admiration from all the world I should be glad to hear your orders replied Yan YanThe two generals came to a decision how to actHuang Zhong led his army down below to meet Zhang He in the open plain Both drew up their arrayWhen Zhang He rode out and saw his venerable opponent he laughed in his face You must be very old and yet you are unashamed to go into the battle eh said Zhang HeYou menial replied the veteran Do you despise me for my ageYou will find my good sword however young enough So he urged forward his steed and rode at Zhang HeThe two chargers met and a score of bouts were fought Then suddenly a great shouting came from the rear Yan Yan had come up and fallen upon the rear portion of Zhang Hes armyThus attacked on two sides Zhang He was defeatedThe pursuit did not cease with nightfall and Zhang He was driven back near thirty milesContented with this success Huang Zhong and Yan Yan went into their camp where they rested their soldiers for a timeWhen Cao Hong heard of Zhang Hes new defeat he was going to exact the penalty But Guo Huai persuaded him to forbearIf he is pressed too hard he may take refuge in Shu said Guo HuaiRather send him help You will thus keep a hold over him and prevent his desertion Wherefore Xiahou Shang and Han Hao were sent with reinforcementsXiahou Shang was a nephew of Xiahou Dun and Han Hao was the brother of Han Xuan the late Governor of Changsha They had five thousand troopsThe two generals soon reached Zhang He and asked how now the situation was goingThat old man Huang Zhong is really a hero said Zhang He and with Yan Yans help he is very formidable When I was at Changsha I heard the old man was very fierceHe and Wei Yan yielded the city to Liu Bei and killed my own brother Now that I shall meet him I can have my revenge said Han HaoSo he and Xiahou Shang led out the new armyNow by means of spies Huang Zhong had got a thorough knowledge of the country and Yan Yan said Hereabout there is a mountain named Tiandang Mountain wherein Cao Hong has stored his suppliesIf we can gain its possession we shall reduce the enemy to want and we shall get Hanzhong Huang Zhong replied I think so too and so let us do so and so Yan Yan agreed with him and marched off with a body of troops to carry out his part in the stratagemAt news of the coming of new armies Huang Zhong marched out to meet themHe found Han Hao in front of his array and Han Hao began to abuse the veteran shouting out Disgraceful old ruffian Then Han Hao whipped up his steed and set his spear at Huang ZhongXiahou Shang also rode out and took part in the combat The veteran held them both at bay for some half score bouts and then fledThey pursued him for seven miles when they reached and seized his campHuang Zhong however quickly made another defense of brushwoodNext day Xiahou Shang and Han Hao renewed the pursuit which ended with the capture of the temporary camp of the day before And they had advanced seven miles further Then they called upon Zhang He to protect the rear camp When Zhang He came up he dissuaded them from continuingHuang Zhong has retreated before you for two days there is some deep stratagem behind this said Zhang HeXiahou Shang scoffed at him saying You are such a coward that you have been defeated many timesNow say no more but let us accomplish something Zhang He retired much mortified and shamedNext day the two generals again went out to battle and again Huang Zhong fled from them for seven milesThe two generals pursued as quickly as they couldThe day after Huang Zhong fled without any pretense of showing fight except at short intervals He got to Jiameng Pass and went on the defensive The pursuers knocked at the very gate of the Pass and made a camp close byThen Meng Da secretly wrote to Liu Bei that Huang Zhong had been repeatedly defeated and now was in the Pass and unable to go outLiu Bei became alarmed and consulted Zhuge Liang who said The old general is making the enemy overconfidentto their ultimate destruction But Zhao Yun did not share this opinion nor did many others and Liu Bei decided to send Liu Feng to reinforce his aged generalThe young man came to the Pass and saw Huang Zhong who asked him General what makes you come here My father heard that you have sustained several defeats and he has sent me said Liu FengBut I am only employing the ruse of leading on the enemy said Huang Zhong smilingYou will see tonight that in one battle I shall regain all the camps and capture their supplies and many horses I have only lent the camps to them to store their suppliesTonight I shall leave Huo Jun to guard the Pass while General Meng Da will gather up the spoils for usNow young Sir you shall see the destruction of the enemy That same night at the second watch Huang Zhong left the Pass with five thousand troopsBut now Xiahou Shang and Han Hao seeing no move from the Pass for many days had become careless and so their camps were unable to resistTheir troops had no time to don their armors or to saddle their horses All the leaders did was to flee for their lives while their troops trampled each other down and were killed in great numbersAll three camps were recovered by dawn and in them were found all sorts of military equipmentHorses and their caparisons also fell to the victors and all the booty was carried off by Meng Da and stored in the Pass Huang Zhong pressed on his victoryLiu Feng ventured to say Our soldiers need repose Can you seize the tigers whelps without going into the tigers den cried Huang ZhongAnd he urged on his steedThe soldiers also were eager Zhang Hes own army was thrown into confusion by the flying men from the defeated armies and he could not maintain his station but was forced to retreatThey abandoned all their stockades and rushed to the bank of River HanThen Zhang He sought the two generals who had brought about the misfortune and said to them This is Tiandang Mountain where our stores are Close by is Micang MountainThe two mountains are the very source of life of the Hanzhong armyLose them and Hanzhong is gone tooWe must see to their security Xiahou Shang said My uncle Xiahou Yuan will look out for the defense of Micang Mountain which is next to his station at Dingjun Mountain there need be no anxiety about thatAnd my brother Xiahou De guards Tiandang Mountain Let us go to him and help to protect that Zhang He and the two generals set out at onceThey reached the mountain and told Xiahou De all that had happenedI have one hundred thousand troops in camp here replied he You may take some of them and recover your lost camps No replied Zhang HeThe only proper course is to defend Almost as they spoke the rolling of drums and the clang of gongs were heard and the lookouts came to say that Huang Zhong was nearThe old ruffian does not know much of the art of war after all said Xiahou De with a laugh he is only a brave Be not mistaken he is crafty and not only bold said Zhang He This move is against the rules and not at all craftyHe is worn from a long march and his soldiers are fatigued and they are deep in an enemys country Nevertheless be careful how you attack said Zhang HeYou would still do well to depend upon defense only Give me three thousand good soldiers and I will cut him to pieces cried Han HaoThey told off the three companies for him and down he went into the plainAs he approached Huang Zhong arrayed his armyLiu Feng put in a note of warning saying The sun is setting and our men are weary Let us retire for the fight tomorrow But Huang Zhong paid little attention saying I do not hold with your objectionsThis is the one Godgiven opportunity to make good and it would be a sin not to take it So saying the drums rolled for a great attackHan Hao came forward with his troops and the aged general went toward him whirling his sword In the first encounter Han Hao fellAt this the soldiers of Shu gave a yell and went away up the hill whereupon Zhang He and Xiahou Shang hastily moved out to withstand themBut a great red glare sprang into the sky from behind the hill and a shouting arose Hastily Xiahou De led off his troops to meet the danger there and went straight into the arms of Yan YanThe Veteran Generals arm rose the sword fell and Xiahou De dropped from his steed to rise no more This ambush into which the dead general had rushed had been carefully prepared by Huang Zhong who had sent Yan Yan away before he marched himself and given Yan Yan orders what to do It was the brushwood that Yan Yans men had spent the time in collecting that now sent forth the flames reaching up to the heavens and filling the valleysYan Yan after slaying Xiahou De came round the hill to aid in the attack so that the defenders were taken both in front and rearThey could do nothing and presently left the battlefield and rushed toward Dingjun Mountain to seek refuge with Xiahou YuanMeanwhile the victors took steps to hold the position they had won and sent the good news of victory to Capital ChengduAnd when the news arrived Liu Bei called together all his officers to rejoice Then said Fa Zheng Not long ago Zhang Lu submitted to Cao Cao and thereby Cao Cao got possession of Hanzhong quite easily Instead of following up this by an advance westward he left two generals to guard it and went southThat was a mistake Now my lord do not make a mistake yourself but take advantage of the present favorable position with Zhang He newly defeated and Tiandang Mountain captured to attack Hanzhong and you will have it at onceOnce that is yours you can train your army and amass supplies ready for a stroke against the archrebel himself This Godgiven advantage will be confirmed to you and you should not miss it Both Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang saw the wisdom of this scheme and prepared to actZhao Yun and Zhang Fei were to lead the van while Liu Bei with Zhuge Liang commanded the main army of one hundred thousand troopsA day was chosen to set out and orders were sent to everyone to keep careful guard for YiazhouIt was a certain auspicious day in the seventh month of the twentythird year that the army marched Reaching Jiameng Pass Huang Zhong and Yan Yan were summoned and well rewarded for their servicesLiu Bei said to Huang Zhong People said you were old General but the Directing Instructor of the army know you better than they and you have rendered amazing serviceStill Dingjun Mountain is yet to be captured and it is both a great central store and a major defense of NanzhengIf we could get Dingjun Mountain we could be quite easy about the whole region of HanzhongThink you that you are equal to taking Dingjun Mountain To this harangue of Liu Bei the veteran nobly answered that he was willing to try and was ready to start when they wouldSaid Zhuge Liang hastily Do not be hasty You are brave enough General but Xiahou Yuan is a man of different stamp from Zhang HeXiahou Yuan is a real strategist and tactician so much so that Cao Cao relies upon him as his defense against Xiliang It was he who was set to defend Changan when threatened by Ma ChaoNow he is in Hanzhong and Cao Cao puts his whole confidence in him and his skill as a leaderYou have overcome Zhang He but it is not certain you will conquer this manI think I must send down to Jingzhou for Guan Yu for this task Huang Zhong hotly replied Old Lian Po was eighty years old and yet he ate a bushel of rice and ten pounds of flesh so that his vigor frightened the nobles and not one dared encroach upon the borders of the state of Zhao I am not yet seventyYou call me old O Instructor then I will not take any helper but go out simply with my own three thousand troops and we will lay Xiahou Yuans head at your feet Zhuge Liang refused to allow him to go Huang Zhong insisted At last Zhuge Liang consented but said he would send an overseerThey put upon his mettle the man who was to go Youths vigor may be lesser worth than ages powers we knowThe next chapter will tell who the overseer was CHAPTER At The Capture Of Opposite Hill Huang Zhong Scores A Success On The River Han Zhao Yun Conquers A Host If you are really determined to undertake this expedition I shall send Fa Zheng with you said Zhuge Liang to the veteran leaderYou will have to discuss everything with himI shall also dispatch supports and reinforcements Huang Zhong agreed and the expedition set outThen Zhuge Liang explained to Liu Bei I purposely tried to spur on the old general that he will really exert himself else he fears he will not do muchBut he will need reinforcement After this Zhuge Liang ordered Zhao Yun to march after the first army and help if help was neededSo long as the old man was victorious Zhao Yun was to do nothing if he was in difficulties then Zhao Yun was to rescueAlso three thousand troops under Liu Feng and Meng Da were sent out among the hills to take position at strategic points and set up many banners and make a brave show in order to spread the impression of huge forces and so frighten and perplex the enemyIn addition Zhuge Liang sent to Xiabian Pass to tell Ma Chao what part to play in the campaign Yan Yan was to hold Langzhong and Baxi in place of Zhang Fei and Wei Yan who also went in expedition in HanzhongThe refugees Zhang He and Xiahou Shang reached Xiahou Yuans camp and told their doleful tale Tiandang Mountain has been captured and Xiahou De and Han Hao have died with the lossLiu Bei is about to invade Hanzhong Send a swift messenger to inform the Prince of Wei and ask for help The news was sent to Cao Hong who bore it quickly to Capital XuchangCao Cao lost no time in calling a councilThen High Minister Liu Ye said The loss of Hanzhong would shake the whole countryYou O Prince must not shrink from toil and hardship but must yourself go to lead the army This state of things comes of my not heeding your words before gentle Sir said Cao Cao then repentantHowever Cao Cao hastily prepared and issued an edict to raise an army of four hundred thousand troops which he would leadThe army was ready in the seventh month the early autumn in the twentythird year  and marched in three divisions The leading division was under Xiahou Dun Cao Cao commanded the center and Cao Xiu was the rear guardCao Cao rode a white horse beautifully caparisoned His guards were clad in embroidered silk They carried the huge red parasol woven of silk and gold threadsBeside him in two lines were the symbols of kingly dignity the golden melons silver axes stirrups clubs spears and lances banderoles embroidered with the sun and moon dragon and phoenix all were borne aloftHis escort of twentyfive thousand stout warriors led by bold officers marched in five columns of five thousand each under banners of the five colors blue yellow red white and black The five companies made a brave show as they marched each column under its own flag with soldiers in armor and horses in caparisons all of one color and all glittering in the sunAs they debouched through Tong Pass Cao Cao noticed in the distance a thick wood very luxuriant and asked those near him what it was calledThis place is the Indigo Field they repliedAnd in that wood is the estate of the late Minister Cai YongHis daughter Cai Yan and her present husband Dong Si live there Now Cao Cao and Cai Yong had been excellent friends at one timeCai Yongs daughter had been first married to Wei ZhongdaoThen she was abducted by the frontier tribes and taken away to the north where she had borne two sons She had composed a ballad called Eighteen Stanzas for the Mongol Flageolet which was widespread to the empireCao Cao had been moved by pity for her sorrows and sent a messenger with a thousand ounces of gold to ransom herThe Prince of the frontier Xiongnu State Ce Xian the Khan overawed by Cao Caos strength had restored her to Cai Yong Ordering his escort to march on Cao Cao went up to the gate with only a few attendants dismounted and inquired after the lady of the houseAt this time Dong Si was absent at his post and the lady was alone As soon as she heard who her visitor was she hastened to welcome him and led him into the reception roomWhen Cao Cao was seated and she had performed the proper salutations she stood respectfully at his sideGlancing round the room Cao Cao saw a rubbing of a tablet hanging on the wall So he got up to read it and asked his hostess about it It is a tablet of Cao E or the fair Lady CaoIn the time of the Emperor He  in the Xiongnu State there was a certain magician named Cao Xu who could dance and sing like the very Spirit of MusicOn the fifth of the fifth month he was out in a boat and being intoxicated fell overboard and was drownedHe had a daughter Cao E then fourteen years of age She was greatly distressed and sought the body of her father for seven days and nights weeping all the whileThen she threw herself into the waves and five days later she floated to the surface with her fathers body in her armsThe villagers buried them on the bank and the magistrate reported the occurrence to the Emperor as a worthy instance of daughterly affection and remarkable pietyA later magistrate had the story inscribed by Handan Chun in memory of the eventAt that time Handan Chun was only thirteen but the composition of the inscription was so perfect that neither jot nor tittle could be added and yet he had written it impromptu without revision The stone was set up beside the grave and both inscription and story were the admiration of all the people of that day My father went to see it It was evening but in the obscurity he felt out the inscription with his fingersHe got hold of a pencil and wrote eight large characters on the reverse of the stone and later some person recutting the stone engraved these eight words as well Cao Cao then read the eight words they formed an enigmaLiterally they read yellow silk young wife a daughters child pestle and mortar Can you explain asked Cao Cao of his hostessNo although it is a writing of my fathers thy handmaid cannot interpret it she repliedTurning to the strategists of his staff Cao Cao said Can any one of you explain it But no one made any replySuddenly they heard one voice I have grasped the meaning of it The man who said he had fathomed the meaning was First Secretary Yang XiuDo not tell me yet let me think it out said Cao CaoSoon after they took leave of the lady went out of the farm and rode onAbout one mile from the farm the meaning suddenly dawned upon Cao Cao and he laughingly turned to Yang Xiu saying Now you may try This is the solution of the enigma said Yang XiuYellow silk is silk threads of natural color and the character for silk placed beside that for color forms a word meaning finally decidedly the young wife is a little female and the character for female with little or few placed beside it forms a word meaning admirable fine the daughters child is daughter and child which side by side make the word good and a pestle and mortar suggest pounding together the five bitter herbs in a receptaclethe character for receptacle and bitter form a word meaning to tell So the four words are Decidedly fine and well told Cao Cao was astonished at Yang Xius cleverness and said Just what I made it Those around greatly wondered at Yang Xius ingenuity and knowledgeIn less than a day they reached Nanzheng where Cao Hong welcomed them He told the tale of Zhang Hes misfortunesTo suffer defeat is no crime said Cao Cao that and victory are things that happen constantly in war Liu Bei has sent Huang Zhong to take Dingjun Mountain said Cao Hong Xiahou Yuan hearing you were coming O Prince has been defending the position and not going out to give battle But standing always on the defensive is showing weakness said Cao CaoThereupon he bade a man carry an authority flag to the Mountain Commander and so order him to attack the enemyXiahou Yuan is very stern and inflexible and he may be carried too far and fall victim to some vile ruse said Liu YeWherefore the Prince wrote a letter to him to accompany the authority flagAnd when the messenger arrived and the letter was opened it readEvery leader must exercise a combination of inflexibility and yieldingBoldness is not the only thing that counts if he makes it so then is he a mere creature to fightNow I am camped at Nanzheng ready to watch the deeds of your admirable prowess and capacity and all I have to say is Do not disgrace your previous reputation The letter pleased the Commander mightilyHaving sent away the bearer Xiahou Yuan called in Zhang He to consult The Prince has a great army at Nanzheng ready to destroy Liu BeiWe have been on the defense here long enough and it is time we rendered some solid serviceTomorrow I am going out to battle and hope to capture Huang Zhong Your opponent combines ready resource with boldness and prevision said Zhang He Beside he has Fa Zheng to aid him and you must be cautious for the country is very difficult and dangerousYou would better keep on the defensive How shall we be able to look our prince in the face when other leaders render good servicesHowever you just keep the hill and I will go out to battle Then an order was issued asking who would go out to reconnoiter and provoke a battleXiahou Shang volunteeredXiahou Yuan said to him You are not to make a real stand but merely to begin the fightYou are to lose and not win for a grand ruse is ready for the enemy He explained his plans and Xiahou Shang went away with a small columnNow Huang Zhong and his helper Fa Zheng were camped quite close to the Dingjun MountainThey had endeavored to entice Xiahou Yuan out into the field to fight but failed to attack him as he stood in that difficult mountainous country So thus far no advance had been madeBut as soon as Xiahou Shangs troops appeared and seemed to offer battle Huang Zhong was ready to march out to meet them at onceBut General Chen Shi offered his servicesDo not trouble yourself to move O General said Chen Shi for I will go out to fight them Huang Zhong consented and placed three thousand troops under Chen Shi who went out of the valley and set his army in arrayAnd when Xiahou Shang came up and as arranged merely fought a few bouts and ran away Chen Shi followed to take advantage of his successBut he was soon brought to a standstill by the rolling of logs and hurling of stones on the part of his opponentsAs he turned to retire Xiahou Yuan brought out his troops and attacked Chen Shi had no chance against them and was quickly made prisonerMany of his soldiers joined the enemy but a few escaped to their own side and told Huang Zhong of the misfortuneHuang Zhong at once asked advice from Fa Zheng who said This Xiahou Yuan is easily provoked to anger and being angry he is bold without discretionYour way now is to work up the enthusiasm of your soldiers then break camp and advance Do this in a series of marches and you will excite him up to the point of giving battle when you can capture himThey call this the Ruse of the Interchange of Host and Guest So Huang Zhong collected all the things his soldiers liked and made them presents till the sound of rejoicing filled the whole valley and the men were hot to fightThen camp was broken and the army marched forward a certain distance Then they encampedAfter some days rest the march was repeated and then againWhen tidings of the advance reached Xiahou Yuan he proposed to go out and fight No no said the prudent Zhang He This is a well known ruse and you should remain on the defensiveYou will lose if you fight Xiahou Yuan was not the man to stomach this moderate advice so he sent out Xiahou Shang to give battleAs soon as this force reached the camp of Huang Zhong the Veteran General mounted and rode out to fight In the very first bout he captured Xiahou ShangThose who escaped told how their leader had been captured and Xiahou Yuan at once sent to offer an exchange of prisonersThis was agreed to to be effected the following day in front of both armiesSo next day both sides were arrayed in a spot where the valley widened the two leaders on horseback beneath their respective standards Beside each stood his prisonerNeither was encumbered with robe or helmet but each wore thin simple dressAt the first beat of the drum each started to race over to his own sideJust as Xiahou Shang reached the ranks of his own side Huang Zhong shot an arrow and wounded him in the backThe wounded man did not fall but went onBut Xiahou Yuan mad with rage could contain himself no longerHe galloped straight at Huang Zhong which was exactly what the latter wanted to irritate him into doingThe fight that then ensued went on for twenty bouts when suddenly the gongs clanged out from Xiahou Yuans side and he drew offHuang Zhong pressed on and shattered the army of WeiWhen Xiahou Yuan reached his own side he asked why the gong had soundedBecause we saw the banners of Shu through openings in the mountains in several places and we feared an ambush said Zhang HeXiahou Yuan believed him and did not return to the battlefield he simply remained defensiveBefore long Huang Zhong had got quite near to Xiahou Yuans camp and then he asked further advice from his colleagueFa Zheng pointed over to the hills and said There rises a steep hill on the west of Dingjun Mountain difficult of access but from its summit one has a complete view of the defenses of the enemyIf you can take this hill the mountain lies in the hollow of your hand Huang Zhong looked up and saw the top of the hill was a small tableland and there were very few defenders thereSo that evening he left his camp dashed up the hill drove out the small host of one hundred under Xiahou Yuans General Du Xi and took itIt was just opposite to Dingjun MountainThen said Fa Zheng Now take up position half way up the hill while I go to the topWhen the enemy appears I will show a white flagBut you will remain quiet till the enemy become tired and remiss when I will hoist a red flagThat will be the signal for attack Huang Zhong cheerfully prepared to act on this planIn the meantime Du Xi who had been driven from the hilltop had run back and reported the loss of the hill to Xiahou YuanWith Huang Zhong in occupation of that hill I simply must give battle said heZhang He strongly dissuaded him saying The whole thing is but a ruse of Fa ZhengGeneral you would better defend our position But Xiahou Yuan was obstinateFrom the top of that hill the whole of our position is visible our strength and our weakness I must fight In vain were the remonstrances repeatedXiahou Yuan set out his troops to surround the opposite hill and then began to vent his rage at his enemy so as to incite Huang Zhong to give battleThen the white flag was hoistedHowever Xiahou Yuan was allowed to fume and rage in vain He tried every form of insult but no one appearedIn the afternoon the soldiers became weary and dispirited Plainly their eagerness had gone and Fa Zheng unfurled the red flag Then the drums rolled out and the men of Shu shouted till the earth seemed to shake as the hoary old leader rode out and led his force down the slope with a roar as of an earthquake Xiahou Yuan was too surprised to defend himselfHis chief enemy rushed straight to his standard and with a thundering shout Huang Zhong raised his sword and cleft Xiahou Yuan through between the head and shoulders so that he fell in two piecesHoary headed is he but he goes up to battle Gray haired yet recklessly mighty With his strong arms he bends the bow The arrows flyWith the swiftness of the wind he rides The white sword gleamsThe sound of his voice is as the roar of a tiger His steed is fleet as a dragon in flightVictory is his and its rich rewards For he extends the domain of his lordAt the death of their general the soldiers of Wei fled for their lives and Huang Zhong attacked Dingjun MountainZhang He came out to oppose the army of Shu but attacked at two points by Huang Zhong and Chen Shi he could not stand He lost the day and fledHowever before he had gone far another cohort flashed out from the hills and barred his wayAnd the leader cried out Zhao Yun of Changshan is here Confused and uncertain what to do Zhang He led his troops toward Dingjun MountainBut a body of soldiers came out to stop himThe leader was Du Xi who said The mountain is in the hands of Liu Feng and Meng Da So Zhang He and Du Xi joined their forces and went to River Han where they camped Thence they sent to tell Cao Cao of their defeat At the news of the death of Xiahou Yuan Cao Cao uttered a great cry and then he understood the prediction of the soothsayer Guan Lu that the cast showed opposition It was the twentyfourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity The affection between Cao Cao and his general had been very close for he considered Xiahou Yuan as his limbCao Cao sent to inquire the whereabouts of Guan Lu but no one knewCao Cao nourished feelings of resentment against the slayer of his friend and he led his army out against Dingjun Mountain to avenge Xiahou Yuans death Xu Huang led the vanWhen the army reached River Han Zhang He and Du Xi joined themThey said to Cao Cao Dingjun Mountain is lost Before marching farther the stores in Micang Mountain should be moved to the Northern Mountain And Cao Cao agreedHuang Zhong cut off the head of Xiahou Yuan and took it to Liu Bei when he reported his victoryFor these services Liu Bei conferred upon him the title General Who Conquers the West and great banquets were given in his honorWhile these were going on General Zhang Zhu brought the news Cao Caos army of two hundred thousand troops is on the way to avenge Xiahou Yuans loss and the supplies on Micang Mountain are being moved to the Northern Mountain Then said Zhuge Liang Cao Cao is certainly short of suppliesIf we can burn what he has and destroy his baggage train he will have but little spirit left to fight I am willing to undertake the task said Huang ZhongRemember Cao Cao is a different sort of man from Xiahou Yuan Liu Bei said Though Xiahou Yuan was the Mountain Commander after all he was but a bold warriorIt would have been ten times better to have killed Zhang He I will go and kill him said the aged general firing upThen go with Zhao Yun said Zhuge Liang act in concert and see who can do best Huang Zhong agreed to this condition and Zhang Zhu was sent with him as Marching GeneralSoon after the army had marched out Zhao Yun asked of his colleague What plan have you prepared against Cao Caos army of two hundred thousand in their ten camps and how are the stores of grain and forage to be destroyed I am going to lead said Huang ZhongNo wait I am going first said Zhao YunBut I am the senior leader you are only my second said Huang ZhongNo you and I are equal in responsibility and both anxious to render good service We are no rivalsLet us cast lots for who is to lead the way They did so and the Veteran General gained precedenceSince you have won the right to make the first attempt you must let me help you said Zhao YunNow let us decide upon a fixed time and if you have returned by that time I shall not need to stirBut if at that time you have not come back then I shall come to reinforce you That suits me admirably said Huang ZhongSo they decided upon noon as the time and Zhao Yun went back to his own camp where he called in his Deputy General Zhang Yi and said My friend Huang Zhong is going to try to burn the stores tomorrowIf he has not returned at noon I am to go to aid himYou are to guard our camp which is in a dangerous place by the river but you are not to move out unless compelled Huang Zhong went back to his camp and said to his general Zhang Zhu I have slain Xiahou Yuan and cowed Zhang HeI am going to destroy the enemys store of grain tomorrow taking with me most of the troopsYou are to come and assist meA meal for the men is to be ready about midnight tonight and we shall move at the fourth watchWe shall march to the foot of their hill capture Zhang He and then start the fire All being ready they set outHuang Zhong leadingand stole across River Han to the foot of the hillsAs the sun got up out of the east they saw before them mountains of grain and only a few guards on watchThese fled at first sight of the army of ShuThe horsemen dismounted and began to collect brushwood and pile it round the grain heapsJust as they were starting the fire there appeared a cohort led by Zhang He who at once began a fight with Huang ZhongThen Cao Cao heard of the fight and sent Xu Huang to helpXu Huang came up in the rear and Huang Zhong was surroundedZhang Zhu with three thousand troops tried to get away to their camp but they were intercepted by Wen Ping and more troops of Wei coming up by the rear Zhang Zhu also was surrounded Both were in difficultiesMeanwhile time passed and noon came with no news of Huang Zhong Wherefore Zhao Yun girded on his armor took three thousand troops with him and went to his aidJust as he was leaving he again warned Zhang Yi to keep good watchGuard the camp most carefully see that you have archers and crossbowmen on both sides Yes yes said Zhang YiZhao Yun rode off spear in hand and went out to give battle where he could find the enemySoon he fell in with one of Wen Pings companies led by General Murong LieZhao Yun plunged in cut Murong Lie down and disposed of the troops of Wei Then he came to the real pressA cohort barred his way led by General Jiao BingWhere are the soldiers of Shu cried Zhao YunAll killed cried Jiao BingZhao Yun angrily dashed forward and thrust Jiao Bing through so that he diedThe cohort scattered and Zhao Yun went on to the foot of Northern Mountain where he found Huang Zhong surroundedWith a yell Zhao Yun dashed at the encircling ring thrusting this way and shoving that so that every one shrank and recoiled before himThe mighty spear laid low his opponents as the whirlwind scatters the petals of the wild pear tree till they lie on the bosom of the earth like snowflakesPanic seized Zhang He and Xu Huang so that they dared not stand in his way and thus Zhao Yun fought his way through and rescued his fellow warriorThen they fought their way out and none could withstand themCao Cao had been watching the course of the fighting from a high place and when he saw a doughty warrior forcing his way into the press and all going down before him he asked of his officers if they knew who the hero wasThat is Zhao Yun of Changshan replied one who knewSo the hero of Dangyang is still alive said Cao Cao marveledThen Cao Cao gave general orders to his soldiers not to attack Zhao Yun without being sure of success no matter where they met him Having rescued his colleague and got clear of the battle Zhao Yun was told Zhang Zhu hemmed in on a hill not far offWherefore Zhao Yun went to his relief before going back to his own campHe had little need to fight for Cao Caos soldiers no sooner saw the name emblazoned on the banners than they fled without more adoBut it filled Cao Cao with rage to see his troops falling away before Zhao Yun who marched on as though no one would think of standing in his way and he went in pursuit himself with his officers Zhao Yun reached his own camp where he was welcomed by Zhang Yi But a cloud of dust was seen in the distance and they knew Cao Cao was in that cloud and coming upon them Let us bar the gates while we make preparation said Zhang YiDo not bar the gates said Zhao YunHave you never heard of my exploit at Dangyang when I laughed at Cao Caos many legionsNow that I have an army at my back and generals to help what is there to fear Then Zhao Yun placed the archers and the bowmen in a covered position outside while he threw down all the weapons and flags withinAnd no drums beatBut he himself alone stood outside the gate of the campIt was dusk when Zhang He and Xu Huang neared the camp of the army of ShuThey saw that the ensigns and weapons had been overthrown and no drums beat at their approach They also saw the one figure of the doughty warrior at the gate and then they halted and dared advance no fartherWhile they hesitated Cao Cao arrived and urged his army to march quickerThey answered with a shout and made a dash forward but they saw the one figure at the gate and every man halted And before long one by one they turned about and went awayThen Zhao Yun gave a signal to his troops to come out of the moat and the archers and bowmen began to shootThe soldiers of Cao Cao knew not in the dusk how many their enemies were but terror seized upon them and they ran each trying to be firstAnd as they ran the drums rolled and the soldiers of Shu shouted and pursued till the flight became a perfect rout and a confused mass of troops reached the banks of River HanThe press continuing many soldiers of Cao Cao were forced into the river and were drownedZhao Yun Huang Zhong and Zhang Zhu followed close on the heels of the routed army and while Cao Cao was making off with all speed two other generals of Shu Liu Feng and Meng Da came from Micang Mountain and set fire to all the army stores of food and forage in Northern MountainThen Cao Cao abandoned the stores in Northern Mountain and set out hastily for NanzhengZhang He and Xu Huang could make no stand and they also abandoned their camps which Zhao Yun at once occupied Beside the stores of food the victors collected countless weapons along the banks of the riverThey sent news of the victory to Liu Bei who came with Zhuge Liang to the scene of the victory and there they heard the full story of Zhao Yuns prowessLiu Bei was glad and when he had seen the steepness and difficulties of the surrounding hills and understood the fine deeds of valor that had been done he turned to Zhuge Liang and said Truly the man is brave all through Behold Zhao Yun of Changshan Whose whole body is valor Formerly he fought at Dangyang And his courage today is no lessHe rushes into the array to manifest his heroism Surrounded by his enemies He is dauntless and daringDevils howl and spirits cry The sky is afraid and earth tremblesSuch is Zhao Yun the brave Whose whole body is valorFor his services Liu Bei gave Zhao Yun the title of General Who Possesses Tiger Prowess And the soldiers of his army were rewarded and there was banqueting to a late hour Soon it was reportedCao Cao is coming again down through the Xie Valley to try to capture River Han But Liu Bei laughed saying He will not succeed for I think that we shall gain command of the river Then Liu Bei led his army west of the river to oppose Cao CaoWhen Cao Cao drew near he sent out Xu Huang to lead the van and open the battleA General named Wang Ping said I know the country well and I wish to help General Xu Huang to destroy the army of Shu Wang Ping was sent as second in commandCao Cao camped on the north of Dingjun Mountain and his advanced guard marched away making for River Han And when they reached the bank Xu Huang gave orders to cross to the other sideTo cross the river is well said Wang Ping but what if you have to retreat Of old when Han Xin made his array with a river in his rear he said that out of the place of death one could return to life You are mistaken nowThe cases are not the same for then Han Xin knew his opponents were unskillfulHave you reckoned upon the skill of our opponents Zhao Yun and Huang Zhong You may lead the footmen to hold the enemy while I destroy them with the horsemen said Xu HuangThen bridges were built and the army crossedA man of Wei blindly quoted Han Xin A minister of Shu would be another Zhang LiangWho won the victory will next be revealedCHAPTER  Zhuge Liangs Wit Takes Hanzhong Cao Caos Army Retires To The Ye Valley In spite of the most earnest dissuasion Xu Huang crossed the river and campedHuang Zhong and Zhao Yun asked to be allowed to go against the host of Cao Cao and Liu Bei gave his consentThen said Huang Zhong Xu Huang has been bold enough to come we will not go out against him till evening when his soldiers are fatiguedThen we will fall upon him one on either side Zhao Yun consented and each retired to a stockadeXu Huang appeared and for a long time tried to draw them into a fight but they refused to go forthThen Xu Huang ordered his bowmen to begin to shoot straight before them and the arrows and bolts fell in the Shu campHuang Zhong said He must be thinking of retreat or he would not shoot thusNow is our time to smite him Then the scouts reported that the rearmost bodies of the enemy had begun to retreatThe drums of Shu rolled a deafening peal and Huang Zhongs army from the left and Zhao Yuns army from the right came to the attack and the double fight beganXu Huang was badly defeated and the flying soldiers were forced to River Han where many were drowned But Xu Huang escaped after fighting desperately and when he got back to camp he blamed his colleague Wang Ping for not having come to his aidHad I done so these camps would have been left unguarded said Wang PingI tried to dissuade you from going but you would not hear me and you brought about this reverse yourself Xu Huang in his wrath tried to slay Wang Ping but Wang Ping escaped to his own campIn the night Wang Ping set fire on both camps and great confusion reigned in the linesXu Huang ran away but Wang Ping crossed the river and surrendered to Zhao Yun who led him to Liu BeiWang Ping told Liu Bei all about River Han and the country near byI shall surely capture Hanzhong now that you are here to help me friend Wang Ping said Liu BeiLiu Bei made Wang Ping General and Army GuideXu Huang reported Wang Pings defection which made Cao Cao very angryCao Cao placed himself at the head of a force and tried to retake the bank of the riverZhao Yun thinking his troops too few retired to the west side and the two armies lay on opposite sides of the stream Liu Bei and his adviser came down to view the positionZhuge Liang saw in the upper course of the stream a hill which might well screen a thousand soldiers so he returned to camp called in Zhao Yun and said General you lead five hundred troops with drums and horns and place them in ambush behind the hill to await certain orders which will come some time during the night or at dawnWhen you hear a detonation you are not to appear only give a long roll of the drums at every report Zhao Yun departed to play his part in the drama while Zhuge Liang went to a hill whence he could overlook the sceneWhen next the army of Cao Cao approached the camp of Shu and offered battle not a man came out nor was an arrow or a bolt shot They retired without any resultBut in the depths of the night when all the lights in the camp were extinguished and all appeared tranquil and restful Zhuge Liang exploded a bomb and at once Zhao Yun beat his drums and blared his trumpetsCao Caos soldiers awoke in alarm thinking it was a night raidThey rushed out but there was no enemy and as the hubbub ceased they went back to sleep Soon after there was another bomb and again the drums and the trumpets seeming to shake the earth itself and the fearsome roar echoing along the valleys and from the hills again scared Cao Caos soldiersThus the night passed in constant alarms The next night was the same and the nextOn the fourth day Cao Cao broke up his camp marched his troops ten miles to the rear and pitched his camp in a clear wide space among the hills Zhuge Liang was pleased at the result of his ruseSaid he smiling Cao Cao is skilled in war but still he is not proof against all deceitful tricks The troops of Shu then crossed the river and camped with the stream behind them When Liu Bei asked the next move he was told but also told to keep the plan a secretSeeing Liu Bei thus encamped Cao Cao became doubtful and anxious and to bring things to a decision he sent a written declaration of war to which Zhuge Liang replied that they would fight a battle on the morrowOn the morrow the armies faced each other half way between the two camps in front of the Mountain of Five Borders and there they arrayedCao Cao presently rode up stood beside his banner with his officers right and left and the dragon and phoenix banners fluttering in the wind His drums rolled thrice and then he summoned Liu Bei to a parleyLiu Bei rode out supported by Liu Feng Meng Da and other leaders Then Cao Cao insolently flourished his whip and vilified his opponentLiu Bei you have forgotten kindness and lost the sense of right you are a rebel against the government Liu Bei answered I am related to the imperial family and I hold an edict authorizing me to seize all rebelsYou have dared to lift up your hand against Empress Fu made yourself a king and arrogantly presume to an imperial chariotIf you are not a rebel what are you Then Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang out to give battle and Liu Feng went to meet himAs the combat began Liu Bei retired within the ranks of his array Liu Feng was no match for his opponent and fledCao Cao issued an order to capture Liu Bei saying He who captures Liu Bei will be made Prince of Hanzhong At this the army of Wei uttered one great roar of rage then they came surging onThe troops of Shu fled toward the river abandoning everything even throwing aside their weapons which littered the roadBut as Cao Caos army pressed forward he suddenly clanged the gongs called a halt and drew offWhy did you call us off O Prince just as we were on the point of success said his commandersBecause I saw the enemy had encamped with the river in their rear which was very suspiciousThey also abandoned their steeds and weapons which made me doubt Wherefore I could only retireBut retain your armorLet not a person take off his harness on pain of deathNow retire as quickly as you can march As Cao Cao turned about to retire Zhuge Liang hoisted the signal to attack and the retreating soldiers were harassed on every side both night and day till they were all disorderedCao Cao ordered his army to retire to Nanzheng Presently they saw flames rising all around and soon it was known that their city of refuge was in the hands Zhang Fei and Wei Yan who after Yan Yan had taken the command of Langzhong had launched a double attack and captured NanzhengDisappointed and saddened Cao Cao bade them march to Yangping PassLiu Bei with the main army followed them to Baozhou and Nanzheng and there pacified the people and restored confidenceCao Cao was exceedingly quickly overcome this time said Liu Bei how was that He has always been of a suspicious nature said Zhuge Liang and that has led to many failures although he is a good leader of armiesI have defeated him by playing upon his doubts He is rather weakened now said Liu BeiCan you not devise a plan to drive him away finally That is all thought out Next Zhang Fei and Wei Yan were sent along two different roads to cut off Cao Caos supplies Two other cohorts led by Huang Zhong and Zhao Yun were bidden to go and fire the hills and forestsAll these four armies had natives of the place to act as guides and show the wayCao Caos scouts sent out from Yangping Pass returned to reportThe roads far and near are blocked by the troops of Shu and every place seems to be burningNo soldier is seen Cao Cao knew not what to doThen other scouts told him Our stores are being plundered by Zhang Fei and Wei Yan At this Cao Cao called for a volunteer to drive off the plunderers and Xu Chu offeredHe was given a thousand veterans and went down the Pass to act as escort of the grain wagonsThe officers in charge of the transport were very glad to receive a general of such renownExcept for you O General the grain could never reach Yangping Pass They entertained Xu Chu with the wine and food on the carts and he ate and drank copiously so that he became very intoxicated And in that state he insisted on marching urging the convoy to start at onceThe sun has nearly set said the transport officers and the road near Baozhou is bad and dangerous so that we cannot pass there at night I can face any danger boasted the drunken general I am brave as a myriad men put togetherWhat do you think I fear Beside there is a good moon tonight just the sort of thing to take grain carts along by Xu Chu took the lead sword in handBy the second watch they were passing BaozhouAbout half the train had passed when the rolling drums and the blare of horns came down to them through a rift in the hills It was soon followed by the appearance of a cohort led by Zhang FeiWith spear ready he came racing down straight for Xu Chu who whirling his sword dashed to the front to meet the enemyBut Xu Chu was too drunk to stand against such a warriorAfter a few bouts he received a spear thrust in the shoulder turned round in his saddle and fell from his horseHis men rushed to his help and they carried him away as they retreated while Zhang Fei took the whole transport train of fodder and forage away to his own campThe defeated escort carried their wounded leader back to Cao Caos camp where he was placed in the care of physiciansThen Cao Cao himself led out his army to fight a decisive battle with the army of ShuLiu Bei went out to meet him and when both sides were arrayed Liu Feng went out to challenge Cao Cao at once let loose a torrent of taunts and reproachesSeller of shoes you are always sending out this pretended son of yours to fight for youIf I only call my goldenbearded son Cao Zhang your socalled son will be chopped to mincemeat These words enraged Liu Feng who raised his spear and galloped toward Cao CaoCao Cao bade Xu Huang do battle with the young man and Liu Feng at once ran awayCao Cao led on his legions but he was harassed by the explosion of bombs the beating of drums and the blare of trumpets that came from every sideHe concluded that he was being led into an ambush and he hastened to retireThe retreat was unfortunate for the soldiers trampled upon each other and many were killed Anon they all ran off to Yangping Pass as quickly as they couldBut the soldiers of Shu came right up to the walls of the Pass and some burned the east gate while others shouted at the westOthers again burned the north gate while drums rolled at the southLeaders and led were alike harassed and frightened and presently they left the Pass and ran away They were pursued and sore smitten The road to safety was not easy In one direction Zhang Fei barred the way while Zhao Yun attacked the rearThen Huang Zhong came from Baozhou and pressed a slaughter on the flankCao Caos army lost many troops and he was severely defeated in this triple attackHis commanders gathered about him and took him off toward the Xie Valley Here a great cloud of dust was seen in the distance If that is an ambush it is the last of me sighed Cao CaoThe soldiers came nearer and then Cao Cao recognized not a enemy but his second son Cao ZhangAs a lad Cao Zhang was a good horseman and an expert archerHe was more powerful than most men and could overcome a wild beast with his bare hands Cao Cao did not approve of the young mans bent and often warned him to study insteadYou do not study but only love your bow and your horse this is the courage of a mere person Think you that this makes for an honorable career But Cao Zhang replied The really noble person ought to imitate such grand men as Wei Qing and Huo QubingThey won their reputation in the Gobi Desert where they led a mighty host of hundred thousand able to overrun the whole world and go anywhere What have I to do with scholarship Cao Cao used to ask his sons what career they found admirable and Cao Zhang always replied that he would be a leader of armiesBut what should a leader be like asked Cao CaoHe should be endued with firmness and courage never turn aside from a difficulty but be in the van of his officers and troopsRewards should be certain and so should punishments Cao Cao smiled with pleasureIn the twentythird year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  the Wuhuan Peoples revolted in Daichun and Cao Cao sent this son with fifty thousand troops to suppress them Just as Cao Zhang was leaving his father read him a homily on his dutyAt home we are father and son but when a task is given you you have to consider your duty as a servant of your rulerThe law knows no kindness and you must beware When the expedition reached the north of Daichun Cao Zhang led the array and smote as far as Sanggan in the Gobi Desert and peace was restoredHe had lately heard that his father was at Yangping Pass and had come to help him to fightHis coming greatly pleased his father who said Now that my goldenbearded son has arrived we can destroy Liu Bei for certain Then the army was marched back again and pitched camp at the Xie ValleySomeone told Liu Bei of the arrival of Cao Zhang and he asked for a volunteer to go out against the newcomer Liu Feng offeredMeng Da also desired to go and Liu Bei decided to let both go Vie with each other said heEach general had five thousand troops and Liu Feng led the way Cao Zhang rode out and engaged him and in the third bout Liu Feng was overcome and ran off Then Meng Da advanced and a battle was just beginning when he saw that Cao Caos troops were in confusion The cause was the sudden coming of Ma Chao and Wu LanBefore the enemy had recovered from the panic Meng Da attacked on another sideMa Chaos force who had been nursing their courage for a long time fought brilliantly so that none could withstand their onslaught and they won the dayBut in his flight Cao Zhang met Wu Lan and he thrust and slew Wu Lan with his spearAfter a great fight Cao Cao ordered his army to retire into camp at the Xie ValleyHere he remained many days prevented from advancing by Ma Chao and fearing the ridicule of Shu if he should retreatOne day while he was anxiously trying to decide what to do his cook sent in some chicken brothHe noticed in the broth some chicken tendons and this simple fact led him into a train of reflectionHe was still deep in thought when Xiahou Dun entered his tent to ask the watchword for that nightCao Cao at once involuntarily replied Chicken tendon The word was passed on in ordersWhen First Secretary Yang Xiu saw the order that the watchword was chicken tendon he told all his people to pack up their belongings ready for the marchOne who saw this went and told Xiahou Dun who sent for Yang Xiu and asked why he had packed upYang Xiu replied By tonights orders I see that the Prince of Wei is soon going to retire Chicken tendons are tasteless things to eat and yet it is a pity to waste themNow if we advance we cannot conquer and if we retire we fear we shall look ridiculous There being no advantage here the best course is to retire You will certainly see the Prince of Wei retreat before longI have made my preparations so as not to be hurried and confused at the last moment You seem to know the Princes inmost heart said Xiahou Dun and he bade his servants packThe other generals seeing this also made preparations for departureCao Caos mind was too perturbed for sleep In the night he got up took a steel battleax in his hand and wandered privily through the campWhen he got to Xiahou Duns tents he saw everything packed and ready for a moveMuch surprised he made his way back to his own tent and sent for that officerWhy is everything in your camp packed as if ready for the march Yang Xiu the First Secretary seems to have private knowledge of the Princes design to retire said Xiahou DunCao Cao summoned Yang Xiu and questioned him and Yang Xiu replied with the chicken tendon incidentHow dare you invent such a story and disturb the hearts of my army Cao Cao called in his lictors and told them to take Yang Xiu away and behead him and hang his head at the camp gateYang Xiu was a man of acute and ingenious mind but inclined to show off His lack of restraint over his tongue had often wounded Cao Caos susceptibilities Once Cao Cao was having a pleasance laid out and when it was completed he went to inspect the workHe uttered no word of praise or blame he just wrote the word alive on the gate and left Nobody could guess what he meant till Yang Xiu heard of itGate with alive inside it makes the word for wide said heThe Prime Minister thinks the gates are too wide Thereupon they rebuilt the outer walls on an altered plan When complete Cao Cao was asked to go and see it And he was then delightedBut who guessed what I meant said heYang Xiu replied his people Cao Cao thereafter lauded Yang Xius ingenuity but in his heart he fearedAnother time Cao Cao received a box of cream cheese from MongoliaCao Cao just scribbled three words One Cream Box on the top and left it on the table The words seemed to have no meaningBut Yang Xiu happened to come in saw the box and at once handed a spoonful of the contents to each guest in the roomWhen Cao Cao asked why he did this he explained that that was the interpretation of the words on the box which resolved into primary symbols read Each person a mouthful Could I possibly disobey your orders said heCao Cao laughed with the others but hatred was in his heartCao Cao lived in constant fear of assassination and said to his attendants Let none of you come near me when I am sleeping for I am likely to slay people in my dreams One day he was enjoying a siesta and his quilt fell off One of the attendants saw it and hastened to cover him againCao Cao suddenly leaped from the couch cut down the intruder with his sword and lay down again to sleepSome time after he awoke simulated surprise and asked who had killed his attendantWhen they told him Cao Cao wept aloud for the dead man and had him buried in a fine graveMost people thought that Cao Cao had slain the man while asleep but Yang Xiu knew better and at the funeral of the victim Yang Xiu remarked The Prime Minister was in no dream but only you were asleep This only increased the hatredCao Caos third son Cao Zhi took great delight in Yang Xius cleverness and often invited him when they would talk the whole nightWhen Cao Cao was considering the nomination of his heir and desired to name Cao Zhi Cao Pi got to hear of the proposal to set him aside in favor of his younger brother so he secretly requested the Master of the Court Singers Wu Zhi to come and discuss this matterThen fearing that someone might see his visitor Cao Pi got a large basket made in which his friend was smuggled into the PalaceCao Pi gave out that the basket contained rolls of silkYang Xiu heard the truth and informed Cao Cao who sent guards to watch at the gatesCao Pi in alarm told Wu Zhi who said Be not afraid but to fill a basket actually with rolls of silk on the morrow and have it carried in as before The searchers peeped into the basket and found the rolls of silkThey told Cao Cao the result of their search and Cao Cao began to think Yang Xiu was plotting against his son This also added to his hatredAnother time Cao Cao wishing to compare the abilities of his two sons Cao Pi and Cao Zhi told them both to go out of the city at the same time ordering the gate wardens to forbid their exitCao Pi first came to the gate was stopped by the wardens and returned to his palaceBut his brother Cao Zhi consulted Yang Xiu who said You have received orders from the Prince to go out simply cut down any who may try to prevent you When Cao Zhi went to the gate and was stopped he shouted out to the wardens I have the Princes order to go out dare you stop me He slew the man who would have prevented himWherefore Cao Cao considered his younger son the more ableBut when some other person told him that the device came from Yang Xiu he was angry and took a dislike to his son Cao ZhiYang Xiu also used to coach Cao Zhi in preparing replies to likely questions which were learned by heart and quoted when necessaryCao Cao was always asking this son his opinion on military matters and Cao Zhi always had a fluent reply readyHis father was not without suspicions which were turned into certainties when Cao Pi gave his father the written replies which Cao Pi had bribed a servant to filch from his brothers apartments Cao Cao was quite angry How dare he throw dust in my eyes like this said Cao Cao Yang Xiu very nearly lost his life for his share in that businessNow sending him to execution on the charge of destroying the morale of the soldiers was only a subterfugeYang Xiu was but thirtyfour when he met his endTalented was Yang Xiu Born of an illustrious stock His pen traced wonderful characters In his breast were beautiful words When he talked his hearers were astonished His alert responses overpast every oneHe died because of misdirected genius And not because he foretold retreatCao Cao thus put to death the prime mover and simulated anger against Xiahou Dun He threatened to execute Xiahou Dun but listened to those who begged him to show mercyGet out of this said heNext he issued an order to advance on the morrow The army moved out of the valley and came face to face with the troops of Shu led by Wei YanHe summoned Wei Yan to surrender but received abuse and contumely in returnPang De went out to fight Wei Yan but while the combat was in progress fires broke out in Cao Caos camp and a soldier came flying to say that the rear and center camps had been seized by Ma ChaoFearing lest this should lead to a rout he drew his sword and stood before the army crying out Death for any officer who flinches Wherefore the men of Wei pressed forward valiantly and Wei Yan pretending defeat retreatedHaving driven back this army Cao Cao gave the signal to turn toward camp and fight with Ma Chao He took up his station on the top of a hill whence he could survey the fieldSuddenly a cohort appeared just below him and the leader cried Wei Yan is here Wei Yan fitted an arrow to his bow shot and wounded Cao Cao right in his lipCao Cao turned and fellWei Yan threw aside his bow seized his sword and came charging up the hill to finish his enemy But with a shouting Pang De flashed inSpare my lord cried Pang DeHe rushed up and drove Wei Yan backwardThen they took Cao Cao away Ma Chao also retired and the wounded prince slowly returned to his own campAs has been said Cao Cao was wounded full in the face and the arrow knocked out two of his front teeth When in the hands of the physicians he lay thinking over Yang Xius wordsIn a repentant mood he had Yang Xius remains decently interred Then he gave the order to retreatPang De was the rear guardCao Cao set out homeward in a padded carriage escorted by his Tiger GuardBefore they had gone far there was an alarm of fire and ambush in the Xie ValleyThe soldiers of Wei were all fearstrickenThat was something like the danger once at Tong Pass met Or like the fight at the Red Cliffs which no one could never forgetHow Cao Cao fared will next be told CHAPTER Liu Bei Becomes Prince Of Hanzhong Guan Yu Attacks Xiangyang When Cao Cao retired to the Xie Valley Zhuge Liang considered it to mean the abandonment of his attempt to acquire possession of Hanzhong and he sent out several parties to harass and hasten his retreat by guerrilla attacksFor this reason the retreating army had to keep on the moveBeside Cao Cao was suffering from his wound and marched as hurriedly as possibleBut it was a dejected army when the leading legions encountered fire on both flanks which had been raised by troops placed in ambush while Ma Chaos main force kept driving the army before itEvery one in the Cao Cao army was dispirited and there was no more courage in themThey pressed forward day and night alike without halting to restIt was only after reaching Jingzhao that they had some repose Then Liu Bei sent Liu Feng Meng Da and Wang Ping to take Shangyong The Commander of the city Shen Dan and his colleagues knowing that Cao Cao had retreated offered their submission After confidence had been restored among the people Liu Bei rewarded his army generously and they were all joyful It was after this that the general body of the officers decided to urge Liu Bei to assume the title of Emperor but they dared not tell him so However they sent up a petition to Zhuge Liang who replied that he had already decided on this courseSo he and Fa Zheng headed a deputation that went in to see their lordThey said Now that Cao Cao really holds the reins of authority the people are without a true sovereignOur lord your kindness and sense of justice have spread throughout the empire You have restored peace over the two Lands of Rivers and your becoming an emperor would be according to Gods will and the desire of the people Then by right and title you could destroy rebelsThis matter should not be delayed and we pray you choose the auspicious day But Liu Bei evinced great surprise and replied Your words O Instructor of the Army are wrongAlthough I am of the imperial house yet I am but a minister and to do this thing would be rebellion against Han Zhuge Liang replied Not soToday the empire is riven and many of the bolder spirits have seized upon and claim the rule of various portions The talented of the empire and the virtuous among officers who have risked death and lost their lives in serving those above them all desire to have the opportunity of serving a true emperor and doing service for a true throneNow if you insist on modestly maintaining your righteous way I fear that you will lose popular supportMy lord I wish that you should reflect upon this But you desire me to usurp a place of great honor in the state and I dare notLet there be more delay and discussion But with one voice they said Our lord if you reject this the hearts of the people will turn from you My lord said Zhuge Liang you have made rectitude your motto all your lifeIf you really object to the most honored title then since you have Jingzhou Yiazhou and Hanzhong take temporarily the title of Prince of Hanzhong Gentlemen though you may desire to honor me by the title of Prince yet without an edict from the Emperor such action would be usurpation Said Zhuge Liang The time demands recognition of the actual state of authority and not a rigid adherence to all the rules of propriety And Zhang Fei roared out All sorts of people with all sorts of names are making themselves rulers how much more ought you O Brother who are of the dynastic stockIt ought not to be Prince of Hanzhong but Emperor What prevents it Brother say no more said Liu Bei roughlyMy lord said Zhuge Liang it is fitting to follow political changes and suit ones conduct to circumstances Wherefore first take the princedom and then memorialize the Throne As there seemed no option Liu Bei listened and compliedIn the twentyfourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  in the seventh month an altar was set up at Mianyang nine square miles which was set around with the proper flags and banners and symbolsIn the presence of all his civil and military officers assembled according to their rank and at the request of the two Ministers Xu Jing and Fa Zheng Liu Bei received the head dress and seat of a prince Then he took his seat facing the south as a ruler should and received the salutes and felicitations of all his officers as the Prince of HanzhongAnd his son Liu Shan was nominated his heirapparentXu Jing was given the title of Royal Guardian Fa Zheng that of Chair of the SecretariatZhuge Liang was reappointed Directing Instructor of the Forces with the additional powers of control over the whole state policyGuan Yu Zhang Fei Zhao Yun Huang Zhong and Ma Chao were the Five Tiger GeneralsWei Yan was made Governor of Hanzhong and all the others who had assisted were given ranks and offices As soon as the investiture was completed Liu Bei composed a memorial and sent it to Capital Xuchang This is the document I Liu Bei have but ordinary talents yet was I made a general of high rank and led a great armyThough I received a commission to purge the empire of rebels I was unable to cleanse it and so renew the tranquillity to Your Majestys house and restore the dynasty Too long have I delayed to spread Your Majestys sacred governance The world is evil and not in good case and as I sorrowfully think it over and over I am distressed as one in severe painRebellion began with Dong Zhuo and all kinds of evils have spread abroad cruelty and ferocity have become rifeStrong in faith in Your Majestys sacred virtue and inspiring presence many banded together to helpThe loyal exerted themselves to destroy the rebels but others of them were smitten of heaven The fierce and the contumacious have been exterminated and gradually rebellion has melted awayOnly Cao Cao now remains too long unpunished He has arrogated to himself the authority of the state His wicked heart is very rebelliousOnce I with General Dong Cheng the State Uncle conspired against him but the plot was discovered and my fellow conspirator suffered Thenceforward I was a wanderer and my loyalty availed nothingIt only allowed Cao Cao further license and liberty to do evil till he dared even to accomplish the death of the Empress and the destruction of her sonsAlthough we might band together and form associations yet with all our energy we had to recognize that we were too weak for war Wherefore the years passed and nothing was accomplishedIn constant fear of destruction we even forgot our duty to the stateWaking and sleeping we sighed and our nights were times of anxiety Now my fellows consider that history has repeated itself They attach the utmost importance to the family and would manifest it with all their mightHereditary succession of rulers is still a principleThe rulers of Zhou taking the two preceding dynasties as models strengthened its position through all the states and it reinforced itself with the support of the states of Jing and ZhengWhen the great Founder of the Hans came into his own he ennobled his whole family with kingships and lordships Later the dynasty had to issue a general command throughout the whole of the nine regions in order to destroy the widespread Lu Family and to enhance the Liu FamilyNow Cao Cao is an enemy of all rectitude and his followers are all evil His treachery is manifestSince the members of the imperial clan are few and weak the clan is not honored Having reflected upon the ancient models and being desirous of temporary alleviation my fellows have made me assume the title of Prince of Hanzhong with the addition of Regent Marshal I have deeply considered these thingsIf one receives kindness from the Throne and accepts the responsibility for a portion of the state and fail then such a fault would only be made the more serious by holding high rank and thereby increasing the burden of reproachBut my fellows have urged me and they have convinced me that it would be right and should I refuse the wicked will not be destroyed and the danger to the state will not be removedThe temple of our ancestors is in danger and the imperial prerogatives are failingA faithful servant who in the day of tribulation can undertake a suitable policy whereby to preserve the dynasty should not refuse his help at any cost Wherefore I have yielded and accepted the position for the glory of the stateHumbly I think of such a title and its exalted position and the favor vouchsafed me and I would endeavor to show true gratitudeMy anxiety is deep for the responsibility is heavyI am as one on the brink of a great gulfI must surely exert myself to the utmost and encourage my armies and lead all disciples of rectitude in accordance with the will of Heaven and as occasion serves to smite rebellion so as to restore the dynasty When this memorial reached Capital Xuchang Cao Cao was in his palace at Yejun and it annoyed him greatly How dare this mean weaver of straw shoes behave thus said heNow I swear that I will destroy him So he issued orders for the whole force of the state to go out against the two Lands of Rivers to wage fierce war with the new Prince of Hanzhong But a remonstrance came from the mouth of one manLet not the great Prince of Wei trouble himself to go on a distant expedition because of a temporary annoyanceI can propose a plan of which the execution will need not the bending of a single bow and yet it will make Liu Bei bring down disaster upon his own headWhen his army shall have become exhausted it will only be necessary to send one single general against him and victory will be ours Cao Cao looked at the officer it was First Secretary Sima YiWhat is your exalted view my friend said Cao CaoSun Quans sister is wife to Liu Bei but Sun Quan has found an occasion to steal away the brideLiu Bei is in possession of Jingzhou still and he and Sun Quan are bitter enemiesTherefore send some able speaker with a letter to Wu to persuade the Marquis to send an army to recover JingzhouThat will draw thither all the armies of Shu when you can send your army to Hanzhong Liu Bei will be helpless and his strength will be wasted The scheme pleased Cao Cao He at once drew up a letter and sent it by the hand of Man Chong who soon arrived in WuAs soon as Sun Quan knew of the mission he summoned his advisers to consultZhang Zhao said Wei and Wu are primarily enemies because of the dissension fomented by the words of Zhuge Liang They have been fighting for several years and many lives have been lostNow this messenger has surely come to discuss terms of friendship and he should be welcomed On the strength of this Man Chong was well received and conducted into the city and into the presence of Sun QuanHe presented his letters at the conclusion of the ceremonies of reception and declared his missionWu and Wei have no fundamental quarrel and their dissension has been brought about by Liu BeiMy master sends me to covenant with you for an attack on Jingzhou while he goes against HanzhongThis double attack being successful the conquered country can be divided between us two and we can both swear to respect each others territory Having read the letter Sun Quan prepared a banquet in honor of Man Chong and then sent him to the guesthouse to rest while he discussed the matter with his council of advisersSaid Gu Yong Although the messengers speech was all special pleading it was correct in formI propose that the messenger be allowed to return and that a covenant be made with Cao Cao for joint attackIn addition let spies be sent over the Great River to find out Guan Yus movements and then we may act Zhuge Jin said I hear that since Guan Yu has been in Jingzhou Liu Bei has found him a wife who has borne him a son and a daughterThe daughter is too young to have been betrothed wherefore let me go to ask her in marriage with your heirIf Guan Yu agrees then we can arrange with him to attack Cao CaoIf Guan Yu refuses then let us aid Cao Cao in an attack on Jingzhou Sun Quan took this adviceSo he sent Man Chong away and sent Zhuge Jin to Jingzhou to try to arrange the betrothalZhuge Jin was received and when the time came to state the reason for his coming Guan Yu asked him What have you come for Zhuge Jin I have come seeking to ally the two housesMy master the Marquis of Wu has a son who is quite cleverHearing that you have a daughter General I ask her in marriage hereby the two houses may join in an attack on Cao CaoThis would be an admirable result and I pray you consider the proposal But the warrior flared upHow can my tigers daughter marry with a dogs whelpWere it not for your brother I would take your head Say no more Guan Yu called his servants to hustle forth the hapless messenger who ran away with his hands over his head too astonished to look any one in the faceAnd reaching his own place he dared not hide the manner of his reception but told the whole truthWhat ruffianism exclaimed the MarquisThereupon Sun Quan ordered the council again to consider an attack on JingzhouBu Zhi rose and said It has been long manifest that Cao Cao wishes to usurp the Throne but he is afraid of Liu BeiNow we are to attack Shu with an army and Cao Cao want to shift the misfortune to us indeed But I also want the place said Sun Quan Said Bu Zhi Cao Ren is already camped at Fankou and Xiangyang and in no danger from the riverIf Cao Cao can take Jingzhou by land why does he not take itHowever he wants you my lord to send your army and you can judge his real intention from this Send to Cao Cao and tell him to make Cao Ren attack by landThen Guan Yu must take the army from Jingzhou to FankouWhen Guan Yu has left Jingzhou you can send an army to seize it Sun Quan thought the scheme good and sent letters with these proposals to Cao CaoCao Cao adopted the plan and having sent the messenger back to the South Land he next sent Man Chong to help Cao Ren at Fankou as Assistant Adviser in the matter of attackHe also sent dispatches to the South Land to ask for the assistance of Sun Quans marine forceHaving laid on Wei Yan the task of holding the Eastern Land of Rivers the Prince of Hanzhong with his officers returned to Chengdu and began to set his new house in orderA palace was begun and public guesthouses were built and between Chengdu and Baishui at selected places they built four hundred resthouses and post stationsThe Prince of Hanzhong also set himself to accumulate great stores of grain and forage and to till his arsenals with weapons with the design of mastering the capital in the north and the whole empireThen his spies told him of the treaty between Cao Cao and Sun Quan with designs upon Jingzhou and he hastily called in Zhuge Liang to ask what should be doneI felt that Cao Cao would try to do this said Zhuge Liang and most of the advisers in the South Land will persuade Cao Cao to order Cao Ren to begin the campaign But what am I to do asked the PrinceFirst send a special messenger to Guan Yu with his new title telling him to capture Fankou which will so damp the ardor of the enemy that they will break off themselves Therefore Liu Bei sent Fei Shi a minister from his Board of War to take the patent of the new title to Guan Yu who received the delegate with great deference and conducted him into the cityAfter they had arrived at the official residence Guan Yu inquired what new title had been conferred upon himThe First of the Five Tiger Generals replied Fei ShiAnd who are the five Their names are Guan Yu Zhang Fei Zhao Yun Ma Chao and Huang Zhong The second is my brother said Guan YuMa Chao comes of a famous family and Zhao Yun has been with my elder brother so long that he is as a brother It is right for them to be put on a level with meBut what sort of a man is this Huang Zhong that he is ranked with usThe really great man does not stand shoulder to shoulder with any old soldier that comes along And Guan Yu refused both title and seal You do wrong to refuse said Fei ShiOf old Xiao He and Cao Shen helped Liu Bang the Founder of the Han Dynasty in his great enterprise and were very dear friends while Han Xin was but a runaway leader from ChuYet Liu Bang made Han Xin a prince and so placed over the heads of the other two I have never heard that these two resented itThe Prince of Hanzhong has his Five Tiger Generals but he is still your brother and all that that means As his brother you are he and he is youIs there any comparison with any otherThe Prince has always treated you with the greatest kindness You two are one in sorrow and joy sharers of disaster and good fortune No such question as that of a mere title ought to reckon at allI pray you Sir reflect Guan Yu understood and thanked Fei Shi saying You have prevented me from making a great mistake due to my ignorance Guan Yu then received the seal with all humilityNext Fei Shi produced the edict ordering the capture of FankouGuan Yu lost no time in obeying its command He appointed Fu Shiren and Mi Fang Leaders of the Van to take the first army out of the city into campThis done a banquet was prepared for Fei Shi and they sat late at their wineWhile still at table there was an alarm of fire in the new camp and Guan Yu hastened out of the city to seeHe found that the two generals had also been feasting and the fire had started behind their tent a spark having fallen into some explosives whence it spread and destroyed the whole camp and all that was in itGuan Yu and his soldiers did what they could to put out the fire and then reentered the city There Guan Yu summoned the two generals before him abused them for their lack of care and sentenced them to deathHowever Fei Shi interceded for them saying It is not well to put two leaders to death at the beginning of a campaign before even the army has marchedYou might reprieve them at least Guan Yus anger had by no means subsided but he recalled the two generals and said Were it not that I have the greatest regard for Chairman Fei Shi here I had let the sentence take its courseNow I will only flog you So the two officers received forty blows each and were degraded from leading the van Their seals were taken away and Mi Fang was sent to Nanjun Fu Shiren to Gongan Now be warned said Guan YuIf when I return from my victories there is the least sign of disorder on your part you will suffer for both faults The two men flushed crimson and went out Then two new officers were appointed Liao Hua and Guan PingNext Guan Yu took command of the main army and he had two advisersMa Liang and Yi JiThen it was that Hu Huas son Hu Ban came to Jingzhou and joined Guan Yu who loved him for the sake of his father and the good service Hu Ban had rendered when he saved Guan YuGuan Yu sent Hu Ban to the Prince of Hanzhong in the train of Fei ShiThe day that Guan Yu sacrificed to his standard before starting he was lying in his tent resting when suddenly there dashed into his tent a huge boar very large as big as a bullock and quite black It bit his footHe jumped up to kill the creature when it squealed with the sound of tearing clothand he awokeIt was a dream but he had a pain in his footThe dream perplexed him and he could not explain itHe related it to his son who interpreted it happily saying The boar is a royal beast like the dragon and coming to your feet means a rise of your dignity When the dream got noised abroad for he told his officers some interpreted it as auspicious and some the reverseWhen a person nears sixty he ought not to be greatly disturbed by the thought of death said Guan YuAfter all I am a warrior Just about that time came an edict from the Prince of Hanzhong making him Commanding General with honorable insignia of rank and control over the nine territories of fortyone counties in Jingzhou When the officers congratulated him on his new honors they did not forget the dreamThis shows what a dream of boars means This new distinction pleased Guan Yu greatly and he had no more perplexing doubts Soon he marched away along the great road to the point of dangerCao Ren was in Xiangyang when he heard that Guan Yu was coming against him He was much put about and inclined to trust solely to defenseBut his next command Zhai Yuan did not support this course and argued against it The Prince of Wei has ordered you to act in concert with Wu and take JingzhouFor the other side to come against such a combination is to walk in the way of death certainly we have no occasion to avoid a conflict On the other hand the newly sent Adviser Man Chong inculcated cautionSaid he Guan Yu is brave and cunning and one not to be met lightlyI think defense is best Then General Xiahou Cun said contemptuously This is all the talk of a lot of bookfolkWhen the flood approaches bank up to keep it outLet the enemy come with their tired soldiers and we shall go out defeat them and receive our reward for we are sure of victory Cao Ren was won over to the side of those of actionHe placed Man Chong in command of the defenses while he went outside to beat off Guan YuWhen the two forces met Guan Yu called to his side Guan Ping and Liao Hua to whom he gave certain ordersThese two advanced settled their array and Liao Hua then rode out and offered a challenge Zhai Yuan accepted it but soon after the combat began Liao Hua made as if he was defeated and turned to leave the fieldZhai Yuan went after himThe Jingzhou troops retired seven miles or soSoon the Jingzhou soldiers came again and offered battle when Xiahou Cun and Zhai Yuan both went out The maneuver of the preceding day was repeated and the Jingzhou army retreated another seven milesBut suddenly there was a detonation behind the army of Cao Cao and the rolling of drums as for attackCao Ren hastily called upon his troops to return They did so but Guan Ping and Liao Hua then turned and followed on their heels so that the troops of Cao Cao were thrown into confusionCao Ren by this time had seen that a trap had been laid and he had fallen therein so he hastily marched with one army to XiangyangHe got to within a short distance of the city when he saw before him a handsome banner waving in the wind and out came Guan Yu with his greendragon saber ready to slayCao Ren was powerless from fear and fighting being impossible he turned off in a diagonal direction for XiangyangThen Xiahou Cun cameHe fell into a rage at the sight of the old warrior and went to fight him But Xiahou Cun was slain in the first encounterZhai Yuan fled but Guan Ping pursued and slew him Then the pursuit was continued and the loss of Cao Caos side was very heavyMore than half were drowned in River XiangThis phase ended with Cao Ren fleeing to Fankou and Guan Yu in possession of Xiangyang You have obtained this city very easily said the Marching General Wang Fu but the task is not ended Cao Caos army have been beaten and their courage broken but there is danger from the side of Wu Lu Meng is at Lukou and he has long cherished the desire to lay hands on JingzhouSuppose he now attacks what will happen I was even thinking of that myself You may go and attend to this matterYou will certainly be able to find certain elevated spots on the river bank about seven miles apart suitable for alarm beacons whence could be signaled any attempt of the marines of Wu to cross the river Fifty soldiers could guard each stationLet there be a flame by night and a smoke by dayIf they cross the river I must go and smite them Wang Fu replied Fu Shiren and Mi Fang are defending important places but they may not be able to defend the Passes wellThere ought to be a commanderinchief over Jingzhou City There is no need for anxiety Army Inspector Pan Jun is guarding the city The objection is the character of Pan Jun He is jealous and selfish and not a fit person for the taskI think you would do well to replace him by Zhao Lei now of the Chief of the CommissariatZhao Lei is loyal trusty cleanhanded and straight a much more desirable man for the post I know Pan Jun very well but I have delegated him for that duty and cannot change nowThe work Zhao Lei has to do in the supplies is also most importantI do not think you need be anxiousJust get along with those beacons for me Wang Fu annoyed took his leaveThen Guan Ping was bidden to prepare ships ready to cross the river and attack Fankou whither Cao Ren had retired after his defeatNow Cao Ren said to Man Chong Neglecting your advice I lost my soldiers my two generals and the city of Xiangyang What am I to do now Guan Yu is very dangerous too brave and skillful for us to try to defeat We would better remain on the defensive replied Man ChongJust about this time came the tidings that Guan Yu was crossing the river on the way to attack Man Chong maintained his policy of defenseBut one of Cao Rens generals Lu Chang was for going out to meet the enemy I ask for a few thousand troops said Lu Chang and I will meet the enemy on the way You cannot do any good said Man ChongAccording to the advice of you and the other bookish officials there is only one thing to doBut will defense drive off the enemyThe proper way is to attack your enemy while he is crossing a river and as Guan Yu is doing that now why not attackIt will be quite another matter if you let him reach the walls and get possession of the moat As a result of his arguments and protest Lu Chang got command of two thousand troops whom he led to the river And there he found Guan Yu already arrayed for battleGuan Yu at once rode out and the bold Lu Chang was going to attack himBut his soldiers were panicstricken at the sight of Guan Yus fierce countenance and ran away Lu Chang called them to come back but they would not stop and as Guan Yu came on with a rush the army of Cao Cao again lost the day Many were slain and the remainder ran into FankouCao Ren sent off a hasty messenger for help and a letter to Xuchang to tell what Guan Yu had done and how Fankou was in imminent danger of fallingThe letter reached Cao Cao who chose a certain general among his leaders and assigned the task You go and defend Fankou The man at once stepped out and accepted the assignment The man was Yu JinLet me have another general to lead the van said Yu JinWho volunteers asked Cao Cao looking around I do cried a man I will give my poor services for what they are worthAnd I will capture this fellow Guan Yu and bring him as an offering before your standard The soldiers of Wei began the war Even before Wu had sent out armies But who was the man bold enough to say he would capture Guan YuFor his name see the next chapterCHAPTER  Pang De Takes His Coffin On A Decisive Campaign Guan Yu Drowns The Seven Armies The bold and selfconfident leader of Cao Caos army who promised to make an end of Guan Yu was Pang De Cao Cao was glad to find such a man That fellow Guan Yu has a great reputation and in the whole country he has no rivalHe has not met his match yet but now you are going he will find all his work cut out So spoke Cao CaoHe conferred on Yu Jin the title of General Who Corrects the South and on Pang De that of General Who Corrects the West and he made Pang De Leader of the Van The two generals marched out with their seven armies to FankouThese seven armies were composed of sturdy fellows from the north led by two of their own commanders named Dong Heng and Dong ChaoHearing who was to command them these two supported by their generals went to see Yu Jin and represented that the Leader of the Van was unsuitableDong Heng said Sir General the expedition you lead is for the relief of Fankou and it can confidently expect victory but is it not unwise to place such as Pang De in command of the van Why said Yu Jin surprisedBecause Pang De was once under the command of Ma Chao He had no alternative but to surrender and fight for WeiBut his former chief is now in high honor in Shu one of the Five Tiger Generals and his own brother Pang Rou is there too as an officerTo send Pang De as Leader of the Van just now seems like trying to extinguish a fire with oilWould it not be well to inform the Prince of Wei and ask him to exchange this man for another Without further argument or delay Yu Jin went to see the Prince and laid before him the objections to Pang Des appointmentAs soon as Cao Cao understood he summoned Pang De to the steps and bade him yield his seal as Leader of the VanO Prince why do you reject my servicesI was just about to do my best for you I do not doubt you but Ma Chao is now in the west and your brother also both in the service of Liu BeiI myself have no doubts but it is what all the crowd are saying What can I do Pang De took off his headdress and prostrated himself bitter tears rolling down his cheeksSince I surrendered to you O Prince I have experienced much kindness so that I would undergo any sufferings to show my gratitude I hope you will trust meWhen my brother and I were at home together his wife was a wicked woman and I slew her pretending I was drunk My brother has never forgiven me but is permeated with hate for meHe swears never to see me again and we are enemiesFor my old master Ma Chao I have profound contempt He is bold but only that and was in a pitiable and dejected state when he found his way to the west Now like me he serves his own master but our friendship is at an endHow could I think of another after your kindness to me Cao Cao raised Pang De from the ground and soothed him saying I have always known what a noble man you are and what I said just now was to satisfy the feelings of other peopleNow you can strive to win fame and if you do not turn your back on me I shall not on you Then Pang De took his leave and returned to his house where he ordered the artificers to make him a coffinNext he invited all his friends to a banquet and the coffin was set out in the reception room for all to seeAnd they asked one another What can that inauspicious thing mean putting out on the eve of a campaign By and by drinking to them Pang De said The Prince of Wei has been generous to me and I am pledged to show my gratitude to the deathI am about to go out against this Guan Yu and I have to kill him or he must kill meIf he does not kill me I must commit suicide and so I have prepared what is necessaryI will not return leaving my task unachieved The terrible omen saddened the guests and they fell to sighingThen Pang De called in his wife Lady Li and bade her bring their son Pang Hui whom he commended to her care I have been appointed Leader of the Van of this new expedition against Guan Yu and my duty bids me seek death or glory on the battlefieldIf I die our son is in your special careAlas the child has been born illstarred and when he grows up he will have to avenge a father Both mother and son wept as they bade him farewell When the army marched the coffin was carried in its trainHe bade his officers saying I will fight to the end with Guan Yu Place my body therein if I fall in combat And if I slay him then will I bring his head in this coffin as an offering to our Prince Then out spoke his five hundred veterans and said If you are like this O General then we also will follow you to the end The vanguard then marched awayA certain man told the story of these happenings to Cao Cao who was very pleased saying I have no anxiety with such a general to lead my armies But Jia Xu said I am anxious for Pang Des safetyHe is overbold and imprudent to fight with Guan Yu to the death Cao Cao thought such an act would be unwise and he hastily sent a messenger with an edict warning Pang De against his antagonist This Guan Yu lacks neither cunning nor valor You are to be most cautious in engaging himIf you can conquer then conquer but if there be any doubt remain on the defensive How highly does our Prince regard this fellow Guan Yu said the general to his officers when he heard this new commandBut I think I shall be able to take the keen edge off his thirtyyear reputation The command of the Prince is to be obeyed said Yu JinPang De hastened to Fankou in all the pomp and panoply of war his gongs clanging his drums rolling as he marched Guan Yu was sitting in his tent when his spies came to report Seven armies of the north under Yu Jin are approachingThey are ten miles away The van leader is Pang De Rage took possession of Guan YuHis face changed color his beard shook and he roared out There is never a fighting man in all the world who has heard my name without tremblingDoes this fellow dare disdain me Then he ordered Guan Ping to attack Fankou while he went out to stay the impudent boaster who dared himFather said Guan Ping Taishan Mountain in its majesty does not quarrel with a pebbleLet me go and fight this Pang De Well my son go and try I will support you So Guan Ping took his sword mounted his steed and went out with his troopsBoth sides being drawn up for battle On the side of Wei there flew a single black flag on which was inscribed Pang De Corrector of the West in whiteThe leader himself wore a blue robe with a silver helmet and rode a white chargerHe stood out in front backed by his five hundred veterans and a few foot soldiers were there too bearing the gruesome coffin Guan Ping was very angry crying out TurncoatTraitor Who is that asked Pang De of his followersA certain one replied That is Guan Yus adopted son Guan Ping Pang De cried I have an edict from the Prince of Wei to take your fathers head You are but a weakling and I will spare youBut call your father Guan Ping dashed forward flourishing his swordPang De went to meet him and there followed thirty odd bouts with no advantage to either Both sides then drew off to rest Soon the news of this combat reached Guan Yu and he was not pleasedHe sent Liao Hua to assault the city while he went to do battle with Pang DeGuan Ping met his father and related the story of the indecisive fightSo Guan Yu rode out with his greendragon saber ready and he shouted to Pang De Come quickly and be slain The drums reechoed as Pang De rode out and replied The edict from the Prince of Wei tells me to take your headIn case you disbelieve it here is the coffin ready to receive itIf you fear death down from your horse and surrender I hold you for a simple fool cried Guan Yu What can you doIt is a pity to stain my blade with the blood of such a rat Then he galloped out toward Pang De flourishing the saberPang De whirled his blade and came to meet him and they two fought a hundred boutsAnd as they fought the lust of battle seemed to grow and both armies were lost in amazementBut the army of Wei began to fear for their champion and the gongs sounded the retirementAt the same time Guan Ping began to think of his fathers fatigue and his gongs clanged tooSo that both armies drew off at the same timePeople rumor Guan Yu is a mighty man of war today I really believe that said Pang De when he had got back among his own lineThen his chief Yu Jin came to see him and said O General you fought the great combat of a hundred bouts which ended indecisively I think it would be prudent to retire out of his way But Pang De replied haughtily What makes you so softYet the Prince gave you the command of the seven armiesBut tomorrow I will fight again and that to the deathI swear I will never give way Yu Jin could not overcome his decision so he went back to his own campWhen Guan Yu had got back to his camp he extolled Pang De saying His swordsmanship is perfect he is my worthy enemy The newborn calf fears not the tiger said Guan PingBut if you slay this fellow my father you have only killed a barbarian of the tribes beyond the frontierIf any accident occurs then you will have the reproach of not having considered your brothers charge How can my resentment be assuaged save by the death of this man returned Guan YuI have decided to fight so say no more Next day Guan Yu took the field first but Pang De quickly came out Both arrayed their troops and then went to the front at the same momentThis time neither spoke but the combat began forthwithIt went on for fifty bouts and then Pang De pulled his horse sheathed his sword and fledGuan Yu went in pursuit and Guan Ping followed lest there should be need of himGuan Yu roared out reviling to his flying foe TraitorYou want to use the swinginghorse stab but here I am never afraid of that But the fact was that Pang De had only pretended to try for a foul stroke in order to cover a resort to his bowHe pulled in his horse fitted an arrow to the string and was just on the point of shooting when Guan Ping who was sharpeyed shouted out a warningThe bandit is going to shoot Guan Yu saw it but the bowstring twanged and the arrow came flyingHe was not nimble enough to avoid it and it wounded his left armGuan Ping at once went to his fathers assistance and led him away to the campPang De wished to follow up this advantage and came back whirling his sword but ere he could strike the gongs of his own side rang out He thought there was something amiss in the rear and stopped The signal for retreat had been sounded by Yu Jin out of jealousy for he had seen that Guan Yu had been wounded and he grudged his colleague the glory which would eclipse his ownPang De obeyed but when he got back he wanted to know why retreat had been sounded on the very verge of a great successWhy did the gongs clang asked Pang DeBecause of our Princes warningThough Guan Yu was wounded I feared some trick on his partHe is very cunning I should have killed him if you had not done that said Pang DeHaste makes slow going you can postpone your fight with him said Yu JinPang De though ignorant of the real reason why he was made to miss success at the critical moment was still very vexedGuan Yu went back to camp and the arrowhead was puled out of the woundHappily it had not penetrated very deeply and the usual remedies against injuries by metal were appliedGuan Yu was very bitter against his enemy and declared I swear I will have my revenge for this arrow Never mind anything but recovering now said his officersRest and get well then you may fight again Before long Pang De renewed his challenge and Guan Yu was for going out to fight however he yielded to the entreaties of his officersAnd when Pang De set his soldiers to reviling the warrior Guan Ping saw to it that his father never heard itAfter ten days of challenges hurled uselessly at an army that ignored them Pang De took council with Yu Jin Evidently Guan Yu is helpless from the effects of that arrowwoundWe ought to advance all our seven armies against him while he is ill and destroy his campThereby we shall relieve Fankou Thus spoke Pang De but jealousy of the glory that might accrue to his next in command again made Yu Jin urge caution and obedience to the command of the Prince of Wei Yu Jin refused to move his army in spite of Pang Des repeated persuasion still more Yu Jin led the army to a new camping ground behind the hills some three miles north of Fankou There his own army prevented communication by the main road while he sent Pang De into a valley in the rear so that Pang De could do nothingTo Guan Pings great joy Guan Yus wound soon healedSoon after they heard of Yu Jins new camp and as Guan Ping could assign no reason for the change and suspected some ruse he told his father who went up to a high place to reconnoiterLooking round Guan Yu noted that there seemed much slackness about everythingfrom flags to soldiersin Fankou that the relief armies were camped in a valley to the north and that River Xiang seemed to run very swiftly After impressing the topography on his mind he called the guides and asked the name of the gully about three miles north of the cityZengkou Stream was the reply He chuckledI shall capture Yu Jin said heThose with him asked how he knew thatHe replied Why how can any fish last long in such a trap Those in his train gave but little weight to what he said and presently he went back to his own tentIt was just then the time for the autumn rains and a heavy downpour came on lasting several daysOrders were given to get ready boats and rafts and such things Guan Ping could not think what such preparations meant in a dry land campaign So he asked his fatherDo you not know even replied his fatherOur enemies have camped in difficult ground instead of the open country and are crowded in the dangerous valley thereAfter some days of this rain River Xiang will swell and I shall send people to dam up all the outlets and so let the water rise very highWhen at its highest I shall open the dams and let the water out over Fankou That valley will be flooded too and all the soldiers will become aquatic animals The Wei armies had camped in the gully and after several days of heavy rain Army Inspector Cheng He ventured to speak to his commanderHe said The army is camped near the mouth of a stream in a depressionThere are hills around us but they are too far off to keep the water awayOur soldiers are already suffering from these heavy rains and moreover they say the Jingzhou troops have moved to higher groundMore than that at River Han they are preparing boats and rafts so that they can take advantage of the floods if there are anyOur army will be in great danger and something should be done But Yu Jin scoffed at his words saying You fool Do you want to injure the spirit of our soldiers Talk no more or your head will be fallen Cheng He went away greatly ashamedThen he went to Pang De who saw the force of his words and said What you said is excellentIf Yu Jin will not move camp tomorrow I myself will do so So Cheng He left it at thatThat night there came a great stormAs Pang De sat in his tent he heard the sound as of ten thousand horses in stampede and a roar as of the drums of war seeming to shake the earthHe was alarmed left his tent and mounted his charger to go and see what it meantThen he saw the rolling waters coming in from every side and the seven armies flying from the flood which speedily rose to the height of ten spansYu Jin Pang De and several other officers sought safety by rushing up the hillsAs day dawned Guan Yu and his marines came along in large boats with flags flying and drums beatingYu Jin saw no way of escape and his following was reduced to about fifty or sixty soldiers They all said they must surrenderGuan Yu made them strip and then took them on boardAfter that he went to capture Pang De who was standing on a hillock with Dong Heng Dong Chao Cheng He and his five hundred troops all unarmedPang De saw his archenemy approach without a sign of fear and even went boldly to meet himGuan Yu surrounded the party with his boats and the archers began to shoot When more than half the troops had been struck down the survivors became desperateDong Heng and Dong Chao pressed their chief to give in saying We have lost more than half of our menSurrender is the only course But Pang De only raged saying I have received great kindness from the Prince think you that I will bow the head to any other Pang De cut down Dong Heng and Dong Chao right in the battlefield and then shouted Anyone who says surrender shall be as these two So the survivors made a desperate effort to beat off their enemies and they held their own up to middayThen Guan Yus marines redoubled their efforts and the arrows and stones rained down upon the defenders who fought desperately hand to hand with their assailantsThe valorous leader fears death less than desertion the brave warrior does not break faith to save his life cried Pang DeThis is the day of my death but I will fight on to the lastAnd you General should fight to your end too So Cheng He pressed on till he fell into the water by an arrow of Guan Yu and then the soldiers yieldedPang De fought on Then one of the boats happened to close in to the bank With a tremendous leap Pang De lighted on it and slashed at the marines killing ten of them The others jumped overboard and swam awayThen Pang De one hand still holding his sword tried to maneuver the boat across the river to FankouThen there came drifting down a raft which collided with and upset his boat so that he was struggling in the waterBut a general on the raft jumped into the water gripped him put him on the boat againThe captor was Zhou Cang a skillful waterman who having lived in Jingzhou for many years was thoroughly expert in boat navigationBeside he was very powerful and so was able to make Pang De a prisonerIn this flood perished the whole of the seven armies except the few that saved themselves by swimming these latter having no way of escape surrendered to the victorsIn the depth of night rolled the war drums Summoning the warriors as to battle But the enemy was no man For the waters had risen and the flood came This was the plan of Guan Yu the crafty To drown his enemies More than human was he in cunningThe ages hand on his fame As his glory was told in his own dayGuan Yu then returned to the higher ground where his tent was pitched and therein took his seat to receive his prisonersThe lictors brought up Yu Jin who prostrated himself humblyHow dared you think to oppose meTo execute you would be like killing a hog It would be soiling weapons for nothing said Guan Yu stroking his beardYu Jin was hound and sent to the prison in Jingzhou I will decide your fate when I return said Guan YuThe general having thus dealt with the chief Pang De was sent forHe came pride and anger flashing from his eyes he did not kneel but stood boldly erectYou have a brother in Hanzhong and your old chief was Ma Chao also in high honor in ShuWould you not better join them Rather than surrender to you I would perish beneath the sword cried Pang DeHe reviled his captors without ceasing till losing patience at last Guan Yu sent him to his deathPang De was beheaded He stretched out his neck for the headsmans swordOut of pity he was honorably buriedThe floods were still out and taking advantage of them the troops of Jingzhou boarded the boats to move toward Fankou which now stood out as a mere island with waves breaking against the wallsThe force of the waters being great the city wall was beginning to give way and the whole population male and female were carrying mud and bricks to strengthen it Their efforts seemed vain and the leaders of Cao Caos army were very desperateSome of the generals went to see Cao Ren who said No ordinary persons strength can fend off todays dangerIf we can hold out till nightfall we may escape by boat We shall lose the city but we shall save our skins But Man Chong interposed before the boats could be got readyHe said NoThough the force of these mountainous waters is great we only have to wait ten days or so and the flood will have passedThough Guan Yu has not assaulted this city yet he has sent another army to Jiaxia which indicates he dares not advance lest we should fall upon his rearRemember too that to retire from this city means the abandonment of everything south of the Yellow RiverTherefore I decide that you defend this place Cao Ren saluted Man Chong as he concluded his harangue saying What a tremendous error I should have committed had it not been for you Sir Then riding his white charger he went up on the city walls gathered his officers around him and pledged himself not to surrenderThe Princes command being to defend this city I shall defend it to the lastAnd I shall put to death anyone who even mentions abandonment said he And we desire to defend it to out last gasp chimed in his officers Then they saw to it that the means of offense were goodMany hundreds of archers and crossbowmen were stationed on the wall and kept watch night and dayThe old and the young of ordinary people were made to carry earth and stones to strengthen the wallAfter some ten days the flood was at an endThen the news of Guan Yus success against the Wei campaign got abroad and the terror of his name spread wider and widerAbout the same time too his second son Guan Xing came to visit his father in campGuan Yu thought this a good opportunity to send his report of success to Capital Chengdu and entrusted to Guan Xing a dispatch mentioning each officers services and requesting promotion for themGuan Xing accordingly took leave of his father and leftAfter Guan Xings departure the army was divided into two halves one under Guan Yu to attack Fankou and the other to go to Jiaxia One day Guan Yu rode over to the north gateHalting his steed he pointed with his whip toward the defenders on the wall and called out You lot of rats will not give in thenWhat are you waiting for Cao Ren who was among his soldiers on the wall saw that Guan Yu had no armor on so he ordered his men to shoot The archers and bowmen at once sent a great flight of arrows and bolts that wayGuan Yu hastily pulled the reins to retire but an arrow struck him in the arm The shock of the blow made him turn in the saddle and he fell from his horseJust now a mighty army perished By the rivers overflow A crossbow bolt from the city wall Lays a valiant warrior lowWhat further befell Guan Yu will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER  Guan Yu Has A ScrapedBone Surgery Lu Meng In White Robe Crosses The RiverAt the sight of Guan Yu falling from his charger Cao Ren led his army out of the city to follow up with an attack but Guan Ping drove him off and escorted his father back to campThere the arrow was extracted but the arrow head had been poisoned The wound was deep and the poison had penetrated to the bone The right arm was discolored and swollen and uselessGuan Ping consulted with the other leaders and proposed saying As fighting is impossible for the moment we should withdraw to Jingzhou where my fathers wound can be treated Having decided upon this they went to see the wounded warriorWhat have you come for asked Guan Yu when they enteredConsidering that you Sir have been wounded in the right arm we fear the result of the excitement of battle Moreover you can hardly take part in a fight just now and we therefore propose that the army retire till you are recovered Guan Yu replied angrily I am on the point of taking the city and if I succeed I must press forward to Capital Xuchang and destroy that brigand Cao Cao so that the Hans may be restored to their ownThink you that I can vitiate the whole campaign because of a slight woundWould you dishearten the army Guan Ping and his colleagues said no more but somewhat unwillingly withdrewSeeing that their leader would not retire and the wound showed no signs of healing the various generals inquired far and near for a good surgeon to attend their generalOne day a person arrived in a small ship and having landed and come up to the gate of the camp was led in to see Guan PingThe visitor wore a squarecut cap and a loose robe In his hand he carried a small black bagHe said My name is Hua Tuo and I belong to QiaoI have heard of the wound sustained by the famous general and have come to heal it Surely you must be the physician who treated Zhou Tai in the South Land said Guan Ping I am Taking with him the other generals Guan Ping went in to see his fatherGuan Yu was engaging in a game of chess with Ma Liang although his arm was very painful But Guan Yu kept up appearances so as not to discourage the troopsWhen they told him that a physician had come he consented to see himHua Tuo was introduced asked to take a seat and after the tea of ceremony was shown the injured armThis was caused by an arrow said the doctor There is poison in the wound and it has penetrated to the boneUnless the wound is soon treated the arm will become useless What do you propose to do asked Guan YuI know how to cure the wound but I think you will be afraid of the remedy Am I likely to be afraid of that when I am not even afraid of death Death is only a return home after all Then Hua Tuo said This is what I shall do In a private room I shall erect a post with a steel ring attachedI shall ask you Sir to insert your arm in the ring and I shall bind it firmly to the postThen I shall cover your head with a quilt so that you cannot see and with a scalpel I shall open up the flesh right down to the bone Then I shall scrape away the poison This done I shall dress the wound with a certain preparation sew it up with a thread and there will be no further troubleBut I think you may quail at the severity of the treatment Guan Yu smiledIt all sounds easy enough said he but why the post and the ring Refreshments were then served and after a few cups of wine the warrior extended his arm for the operationWith his other hand he went on with his game of chess Meanwhile the surgeon prepared his knife and called a lad to hold a basin beneath the limb I am just going to cut do not start said Hua TuoWhen I consented to undergo the treatment did you think I was afraid of pain The surgeon then performed the operation as he had predescribedHe found the bone much discolored but he scraped it cleanWhen the knife went over the surface of the bone and made horrible sounds all those near covered their eyes and turned paleBut Guan Yu went on with his game only drinking a cup of wine now and again and his face betrayed no sign of painWhen the wound had been cleansed sewn up and dressed the patient stood up smiling and said This arm is now as good as it ever was there is no painIndeed Master you are a marvel I have spent my life in the art said Hua Tuo but I have never seen such a patient as you SirYou are as if not from the earth but heaven Here as surgeons there physicians all boast their skill Bitter few are those that cure one when ones really illAs for superhuman valor rivals Guan Yu had none So for holy touch in healing Hua Tuo stood aloneWhen the cure was well advanced Guan Yu gave a fine banquet in honor of Hua Tuo and offered him a fee of a hundred ounces of goldBut Hua Tuo declined it saying I had come to treat you O General from admiration of your great virtue and not for moneyAlthough your wound is cured you must be careful of your health and especially avoid all excitement for a hundred days when you will be as well as ever you were Then Hua Tuo having prepared dressings for the wound took his leave refusing fees to the very lastHaving captured Yu Jin and accomplished the death of Pang De Guan Yu became more famous and more fearinspiring through the whole empire than even before Cao Cao called together his advisers to help him decide upon what he should doSaid Cao Cao I must acknowledge this Guan Yu as the one man who in skill and valor overtops the whole world Lately he has obtained possession of Jingzhou and the territory near it and has so become very terrible He is a tiger with wings addedPang De is no more Yu Jin is his prisoner the armies of Wei have lost their morale and if he led his armies here Xuchang we should be helplessI can only think of avoiding the peril by removal of the capitalWhat think you No do not take that step said Sima Yi rising to replyYu Jin and all the others you lost were victims of the flood and slain in battleThese losses do no harm at all to your great planThe Suns and Lius are no longer friends since Guan Yu has accomplished his desireYou may send a messenger into Wu to foment the quarrel and cause Sun Quan to send his armies to attack the army of Guan Yu from the rear promising that when things are tranquil you will reward the south to Sun QuanIn this way you will relieve Fankou Here Minister Jiang Ji said Sima Yi speaks well and the messenger should lose no timeDo not move the capital or send an army Cao Cao therefore did not carry out his first proposalBut he was sad at the loss of Yu Jin and spoke of him affectionately Yu Jin had followed me faithfully for thirty years yet in that moment of truth he was less than Pang De It was necessary to send someone with the letters to Wu and also to find another leader willing to face Guan YuCao Cao had not long to wait for the latter as an officer stepped out from the ranks of those in waiting and offered himselfIt was Xu HuangXu Huangs offer was accepted and he was given fifty thousand of veterans Lu Qian was sent as his second and the army marched to Yangling Slope where they halted to see if any support was coming from the southeastSun Quan fell in with the scheme of Cao Cao as soon as he had read Cao Caos letter He at once prepared a reply for the messenger to take back and then gathered his officers civil and military to consult Zhang Zhao was the first speaker We know Guan Yu has captured one leader and slain another This has added greatly to his fame and reputation Cao Cao was going to move the capital rather than risk an attack We also know that Fankou is in imminent dangerCao Cao has asked for our help but when he has gained his end I doubt whether he will hold to his promise Before Sun Quan had replied they announced the arrival of Lu Meng who had come in a small ship from Lukou with a special message He was at once called in and asked what it wasSaid Lu Meng The armies of Guan Yu being absent at Fankou the opportunity should be taken to attack Jingzhou But I wish to attack Xuzhou in the north what of this plan said Sun QuanIt would be better to attack Jingzhou and so get control of the Great River Cao Cao is far away to the north and too occupied to regard the east Xuzhou is weakly held and could be taken easily but the lie of the land favors the use of an army rather than a navy forceIf you capture it it will not be easy to hold but once you hold Jingzhou you can evolve other schemes Really my desire was to attack Jingzhou but I wished to hear what you would say to the other planNow Sir make me a plan speedily and I will act upon it So Lu Meng took his leave and went back to LukouBut soon they heard that Guan Yu had had beacon towers erected at short distances all along the Great River and that the army of Jingzhou was being put into most efficient condition If this is so it is hard to make a plan that will ensure success said Lu MengI have already advised my master to attack Jingzhou but I am unable to meet this complication Therefore he made illness an excuse to stay at home and sent to inform Sun Quan who was very distressed at the newsThen said Lu Xun The illness is feigned he is quite well If you know that so well go and see said Sun QuanAway went Lu Xun and speedily arrived at Lukou where he saw Lu Meng who indeed appeared to be in perfect health Nor did his face bear any signs of recent illnessThe Marquis of Wu has sent me to inquire after your honorable complaint said Lu XunHow distressed I am that the state of my wretched carcass has caused the Marquis the inconvenience of inquiring replied Lu MengThe Marquis placed a very heavy responsibility on your shoulders but you are not making the best use of the opportunity However what is the real origin of your distress Lu Meng sat gazing at his visitor a long time without replying I have a little remedy said Lu XunDo you think you might use it Lu Meng dismissed the servants and when the two were alone he said This remedy my friend please tell me what it is Your ailment is due simply to the efficiency of the Jingzhou soldiers and I know how to keep the beacons from flaring and I can make the defenders of Jingzhou come to you with their hands tiedWould that cure you My friend you speak as if you saw into my inmost heartPray unfold your good scheme Guan Yu thinks himself too much of a hero for anyone to dare to face him and his only anxiety is yourselfNow you must take advantage of this excuse you have made of illness actually to resign this post so that the farce may be kept up and another person be appointed to your place Let this person your successor humbly praise Guan Yu till that general becomes so conceited that he will withdraw all the troops from Jingzhou to send them against FankouWhen Jingzhou is left undefended then is our chance and the city will fall into our hands The plan seems most excellent said Lu MengWherefore Lu Mengs malady waxed worse so that he was confined to bed and he gave Lu Xun his letter of resignation to carry back to Sun QuanThe messenger hastened back and explained the ruse to his master who soon after issued a command for Lu Meng to retire and attend to the recovery of his healthBut Lu Meng came to Sun Quan to discuss the matter of a successor Sun Quan said to him As to the appointment at Lukou you know Zhou Yu recommended Lu Su who at his last moment proposed youNow you ought to be able to mention some other talented and wellknown officer to succeed you If you choose a wellknown man Guan Yu will certainly be on his guard against himNow Lu Xun is deep and farseeing but he has no widespread fame Hence no particular notice would be taken of his appointment and no countermeasures takenSo he is the most suitable person to send Sun Quan agreed and thereupon promoted Lu Xun to the rank of General of the Right Army and Admiral of the Right Fleet and sent him to defend the portI am very young said Lu Xun and feel unequal to such a post Lu Meng has proposed you and you will not make any mistakesPray do not decline said Sun QuanSo the appointment was made and Lu Xun set out at onceWhen he had assumed charge of the cavalry the infantry and the marines he set about drawing up a letter to Guan Yu and he selected fine horses and beautiful silks and good wines and delicacies suitable for gifts to go with the letter He sent all by the hand of a trusty messenger to FankouThe news of the change of command reached Guan Yu when he lay ill from the effects of his wound and unable to conduct any military operationsClose upon the news came the letter and the gifts from Lu Xun and the bearer was called in to see the warriorFriend Sun Quan was not very prudent when he made a general out of a mere scholar said Guan Yu pointing to the messengerThe messenger said General Lu Xun sends this letter and some presents which he hopes you will acceptHe also sends his felicitations and would rejoice if the two houses could become friends Guan Yu read the letter which was couched in most modest language and then threw back his head and laughed loud He bade the attendants receive the various gifts and sent the bearer awayThe messenger forthwith returned to Lukou and said the old warrior had seemed very gratified and would henceforward feel no anxiety that danger might threaten from their directionSpies were sent out to report on proceedings and they returned to say that half the troops of Jingzhou had been sent to assist in the siege of Fankou That city was to be seriously assaulted as soon as Guan Yu had recoveredThis news was promptly sent on to Sun Quan who at once called in Lu Meng to decide upon the next move Now is the favorable moment to get possession of Jingzhou said Sun QuanI propose to send you and my brother Sun Jiao to lead the army This Sun Jiao was really only a cousin as he was the second son of Sun Quans uncle Sun Jing But Lu Meng objectedMy lord if you think to employ me then employ me only if Sun Jiao then Sun Jiao onlyYou cannot have forgotten that Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu were associate commanders and although the final decision lay with Zhou Yu yet the other presumed upon his seniority and there was some unfriendliness between the twoAll ended well because Cheng Pu recognized the ability of his colleague and so supported himI know I am not so clever as Zhou Yu but Sun Jiaos consanguinity will be a greater obstacle than mere length of service and I fear he may not be wholly with me Sun Quan saw the force of the contention and appointed Lu Meng to sole command with Sun Jiao to help him in the commissariatLu Meng thanked his lord for his commission soon got his thirty thousand marines together and assembled eighty ships for the expedition Lu Meng dressed a number of sailors in the plain white costumes of ordinary merchants and put them on board to work his vessels He concealed his veterans in the compartmentsHe selected seven generalsHan Dang Jiang Qin Zhu Ran Pan Zhang Zhou Tai Xu Sheng and Ding Fengto serve under him and settled the order of their successive movementsThe remainder of the forces was left with Sun Quan as supports and reservesLetters were also written to Cao Cao that he might cooperate by sending his army to attack Guan Yu in the rear and to Lu Xun that he would act in concertThen the sailors in plain white dress navigated the ships to River Xunyang as quickly as possible and then crossed to the north bankWhen the beaconkeepers came down to question them the men of Wu said We are traders forced into the bank by contrary winds And they offered gifts to the beaconkeepers who accepted them and let the ships come to an anchor close to the shoreAt about the second watch the soldiers came out of hiding in the holds of the transports suddenly fell upon the beaconkeepers and made them prisoners officers and soldiers Next the signal for a general landing was given and all the soldiers from the eighty ships went ashore The guard stations were attacked and all the troops captured and carried off to the ships not one being allowed to escapeThen the force of Wu hurried off to the city of Jingzhou having so far carried out their plans that no one knew of their comingNearing Jingzhou Lu Meng spoke kindly to his captives and gave them gifts and comforted them in order to induce them to get the gates opened for him to enter the city He won them over to his side and they promised to aid him They would show a flare as a signal that the gates were freeSo they went in advance and arrived at the gates about midnightThey called the watch and the wardens of the gate recognizing their voices opened for themOnce within they shouted and lit the flaresImmediately the soldiers of Wu came in with a rush and were soon in possessionThe first order issued by Lu Meng was to spare the people Instant death should be the punishment for any murder or robberyThe various officials in the city were retained in their offices and continued their functionsSpecial guards were set over Guan Yus family dwelling and none dared break open any other houseA messenger was sent with tidings to Sun QuanOne very wet day Lu Meng with a few horsemen as escort was going round the walls and visiting the gatesOne of the soldiers took from a passerby a broadbrimmed hat and put it on over his helmet to keep his armor dry Lu Meng saw it and the offender was seized He was a fellowvillager of Lu Meng but that did not save himYou are an old acquaintance but you knew my order why did you disobey it I thought the rain would spoil my uniform and I took the hat to protect it I did not take it for my own advantage but to protect official propertySpare me O General for the sake of our common dwellingplace I know you were protecting your armor but still it was disobedience to the order against taking anything from the people The soldier was beheaded and his head exposed as a warningBut when all was over Lu Meng had the body buried decently and wept at the grave for the loss of his friend Never after this was there the least laxity of disciplineWhen Sun Quan visited the city Lu Meng met him at the boundary and led him to the official residence where Sun Quan issued rewards and commendationsThis done Sun Quan ordered Pan Jun to take charge of the new possessionYu Jin who was in prison was freed and sent back to Cao CaoWhen the people had been comforted and the soldiers rewarded there was a great banquet in honor of the success of the expeditionThen said Sun Quan to Lu Meng We have got the city of Jingzhou but now Fu Shiren is holding Gongan and Mi Fang Nanjun How can we get these two territories Suddenly Yu Fan started up and offered his servicesYou will need neither bows nor arrows said Yu Fan unless my little tongue is worn outI can persuade Fu Shiren to surrender Friend Yu Fan how will you do it asked Sun Quan Fu Shiren and I are very old friends ever since we were boys and if I explain the matter to him I am sure he will come over to this side So Yu Fan with an escort left quickly for Gongan where his friend was in commandNow when Fu Shiren heard of the capture of Jingzhou he closed his gates Yu Fan arrived but was refused entranceSo Yu Fan wrote a letter attached it to an arrow and shot it over the city wallA soldier picked it up and took it to his commander who found therein much persuasion to surrenderHaving read all this he thought within himself I think I should do well in surrender for at his departure Guan Yu was very bitter against me Without further ado he bade the wardens open the gate and his friend came inAfter their greetings they talked of old times and Yu Fan praised Sun Quans magnanimity and liberality and greatness generallySo finally Fu Shiren decided to exchange masters and went away taking with him his seal of officeHe was presented to Sun Quan who reappointed him to the command of Gongan under its new lordLu Meng thought the appointment imprudent and said to Sun Quan Guan Yu is yet unconquered we should not put Fu Shiren in Gongan Instead send him to Nanjun to induce his former colleague and fellow Mi Fang to join him in desertion to the enemy Lu Mengs advice was followed and Fu Shiren was recalledGo to Nanjun and win over Mi Fang and I will reward you richly said Sun QuanFu Shiren accepted the mission and duly left for NanjunJingzhous defender failed when tried So Wang Fus words were justifiedFor the events of the journey see the next chapter CHAPTER  Xu Huang Fights At The River Mian Guan Yu Retreats To MaichengThe fall of Jingzhou put Mi Fang in a quandary and before he could decide upon any course his old colleague Fu Shiren came to see himFu Shiren was admitted and when asked why he had come he blurted out his business without beating about the bushI am faithful enough but I got into difficulties and danger and could not hold on so I have surrendered to WuAnd I advise you to do the same You and I have both fed on the bounty of the Prince of Hanzhong and I cannot understand how you can turn against him Guan Yu went away hating both of us intensely and even if he comes back victorious I do not think he will forgive usJust think it over My brother and I have followed the Prince these many years and I do not like leaving him like this Mi Fang hesitatedBefore he could make up his mind there came a messenger saying The army in Fankou is short of grain and I was sent to demand white rice for the soldiers Nanjun and Gongan are to send ten thousand carts at onceDelay will be most severely punished This sudden demand was a shock to Mi Fang Where am I to get the rice said he despairingly to his friend and tempterJingzhou is now in the hands of Wu Do not dillydally said Fu ShirenThereupon he drew his sword and slew the messenger as he stood in the hallWhat have you done cried Mi FangGuan Yu wanted to slay us two and has forced me to thisAre we to fold our hands and await deathEither you give in at once and go over to Wu or you will be put to death by Guan Yu Just then they heard that Lu Mengs troops had actually reached the city wallMi Fang saw that nothing could save his life but desertion so he went out with Fu Shiren and gave in his allegiance to Lu Meng by whom he was led to Sun QuanSun Quan gave both of them presents after which he proceeded to restore order and to reward his army for their servicesAt the time that great discussion about Jingzhou was going on in Xuchang a messenger arrived with a letter from Sun QuanIt told the tale of the acquisition of Jingzhou and begged Cao Cao to send an army to attack Guan Yu in the rear enjoining the utmost secrecyAt the meeting of advisers that Cao Cao summoned to consultation First Secretary Dong Zhao said Now that the relief of Fankou is contemplated it would be well to shoot letter into the city to let the besieged know so that they may not yield to depression and to inform Guan YuIf Guan Yu hears that Jingzhou is in the hands of Wu he will come back to try to recover itThen let Xu Huang take the chance to attack and our victory will be complete Cao Cao agreed that the plan was good and so he sent a messenger to urge Xu Huang to attackCao Cao himself led a large force to Yangling Slope south of Luoyang to rescue Cao RenXu Huang was sitting in his tent when they told him that a messenger from the Prince of Wei had arrivedThe messenger was called in and said The Prince has led an army to Luoyang and he wishes you to hasten to attack Guan Yu in order to relieve Fankou Just then the scouts came to report Guan Ping has encamped at Yencheng and Liao Hua at SizhongThe enemy have built a line of twelve stockades Xu Huang ordered two of his generalsLu Qian and Xu Shangto Yencheng to masquerade as if he himself was in command by showing his ensignsXu Huang himself at the head of five hundred veterans went along River Mian to attack Yencheng in the rearWhen Guan Ping heard of the approach of Xu Huang he prepared his own division to meet him When both sides were arrayed Guan Ping rode out and engaged Xu ShangAfter three encounters Xu Shang had the worst of it and fledThen the other general Lu Qian went outHe fought half a dozen bouts and also ran away Thereupon Guan Ping went in pursuit and smote the flying enemy for seven milesBut then there was an alarm of fire within Yencheng and Guan Ping knew that he had been inveigled into the pursuit and was a victim So he turned and set out for the city againOn his way he met a body of troops and standing under the great standard was Xu Huang Xu Huang shouted out Guan Ping my worthy nephew it is strange that you do not recognize death when it stares you in the faceYour Jingzhou has fallen into the hands of Wu and yet you act so madly Guan Ping whirling his sword just rode hard at Xu Huang and they engagedBut after the third bout there was a tremendous shouting among the soldiers for the flames within the city burst up higher than before Guan Ping could not follow up his desire to continue the fight but cut his way out and made a dash for Sizhong where Liao Hua received him with the news of the disaster to JingzhouPeople say that Jingzhou has fallen to Lu Meng and the news has frightened the whole army what is to be done said Liao HuaIt is only a malicious rumor do not let it spreadIf any one repeats it put him to death Just then a man came running in to say that Xu Huang was attacking the first stockade on the north If that goes said Guan Ping the remainder will followBut as we have River Mian at our back they will not dare attack thisLet us go to the rescue So Liao Hua summoned his subordinate leaders and gave them orders to hold the camp and make a signal if the enemy came There is no danger here said theyThe camp is defended by a tenfold line of thorny barriers even a bird could not get in Guan Ping and Liao Hua mustered all the veterans they had and went away to the first stockadeSeeing the Wei soldiers camped on a low hill Guan Ping said to his colleague Those soldiers are stationed in an unsafe place let us raid their camp tonight You take half the force General and I will remain to keep the camp said Liao HuaWhen night fell the attacking force went out But on reaching the camp not a man opposed them The camp was empty Then Guan Ping knew he had been deceived and turned to retreatHe was at once attacked on two sides by Xu Shang and Lu Qian from left and right Unable to stand his troops ran for the campThe soldiers of Wei followed and presently the camp was surrounded They were compelled to abandon the position and set off for SizhongAs they drew near they saw torches and presently knew by the ensigns displayed that the camp had also fallen to the enemyRetiring they hastened along the high road toward Fankou but presently their way was barred by a force under Xu Huang himself By dint of hard fighting they got away and returned to their main camp and Guan Ping went to his fatherXu Huang has got possession of Yencheng Cao Caos main army is on the way in three divisions and many say that Jingzhou is in the enemys hands Guan Yu bade him be silentThis is a fabrication of the enemy said Guan Yu but it may dishearten the soldiersWe know Lu Meng is ill and they have appointed that impractical fellow Lu Xun to succeed him at LukouThere is nothing to fear Then news came that Xu Huang had arrived At once Guan Yu bade them saddle his chargerFather you are not strong enough to go into the battle said Guan PingXu Huang and I were once friends and I know what he can do and not doI will give him the chance to retire and if he does not take it then I shall just slay him as a warning to the others Mounting his charger Guan Yu rode out as impetuously as of yore and the sight of the old warrior made to quake the hearts of the troops of WeiWhen he came close enough to his enemy Guan Yu checked his steed and said Where is my friend Xu Huang As a reply the gate of the battle opened and Xu Huang appeared under the standard With a low bow he said Some years have passed since I met you most excellent Marquis but I had not expected to see you so grayI have not forgotten the old brave days when we were together and you taught me so much and I am very gratefulYour new fame has spread throughout the whole empire and your old friends cannot but praise youI am indeed glad that I have the happiness to see you Guan Yu replied We have been excellent friends Xu Huangbetter than mostBut why have you pressed my son so hardly of late Xu Huang suddenly turned to the officers about him and cried fiercely I would give a thousand ounces of gold for this Guan Yus head Guan Yu greatly shocked said What did you say that for Because today I am on state business and I have no inclination to let private friendship override my public duty As he said this he whirled his battleax and rode at Guan Yu who greatly enraged threw up his great saber to strikeThey fought a half score bouts but although his skill lacked nothing of its pristine vigor and excelled all the world the old warriors right arm was still weak from the wound Guan Ping saw that his father failed somewhat and so hastily beat the gong for retreat Guan Yu rode backSuddenly the noise of a great shouting was heard it came from the troops in Fankou for Cao Ren having heard of the arrival of troops of his own side had made a sortie and was about to attack to help Xu Huang His army fell on and the army of Jingzhou were routedGuan Yu with as many of his officers as could fled away along the banks of River Xiang hotly pursued by the army of WeiCrossing the river he made for XiangyangSuddenly the scouts reported Jingzhou has been taken by Lu Meng Your family is now in the hand of enemy Guan Yu was shocked thence he marched for Gongan But the scouts told himFu Shiren has yielded Gongan to the hands of Wu Then some of the men he had dispatched for supplies came in and reportedFu Shiren murdered the officer and persuade Mi Fang to surrender to Wu The story filled Guan Yu with boundless rage It was too muchThe wound reopened and he fell in a swoonWang Fu you were right said he when he recovered consciousness How I regret that I did not heed what you saidAnd now But why were the beacon fires not lighted continued he presentlyLu Mengs marines in the guise of traders came over the riverThere were soldiers hidden in the ships and they seized the beacon guards so preventing them from kindling the fires Guan Yu sighedBeating the ground with his foot he said Indeed I have fallen into their trapHow shall I look my brother in the face Then outspoke Commissariat Commander Zhao Lei saying We are in straitsSend to Chengdu for help and let us take the land road to Jingzhou to try to recover it So three messengers were sent by different routes to ask for help while the army set out to return to Jingzhou Guan Yu leading and Liao Hua with Guan Ping keeping the rearThe siege of Fankou being thus raised Cao Ren went to see his master With tears he acknowledged his fault and asked pardonIt was the will of heaven and no fault of yours said Cao Cao and he rewarded the armies When he visited Sizhong and had inspected the captured stockades he remarked on the defenses saying Xu Huang was very clever to overcome theseWith my thirty years of war I should not have dared to penetrate such oppositionHe is valiant and wise and both in a high degree Aye said they with him for they could not but agreeCao Caos army marched back to Mopo and there campedWhen Xu Huang returned Cao Cao went out of the stockade to meet him and netted with joy when seeing the excellent order and discipline that his army showed Every soldier was in his place the ranks perfectly kept all without a trace of disorderGeneral Xu Huang has the spirit of the old Zhou Yafu said Cao Cao and on the spot conferred on his commander the title of General Who Pacifies the SouthXu Huang was sent soon after to share in the defense of Xiangyang with Xiahou Shang to meet Guan Yus armyJingzhou being still in turmoil Cao Cao remained at Mopo waiting for newsGuan Yu found himself at a standstill on the road to Jingzhou with the army of Wu in front and the men of Wei coming up behind What is to be done he discussed the position with Zhao Lei when we cannot advance nor retreat and the aid has not come Zhao Lei proposed a halt to try to shame Lu Meng into aiding Cao CaoSaid he When Lu Meng was at Lukou he used to write to you often and you agreed to join hands in the destruction of Cao Cao Now he is a traitor and fighting on the other sideSend a letter and reproach him Perhaps we may get a satisfactory reply So the letter was written and sent to JingzhouMeanwhile by Lu Mengs special command the most complete protection was given to the families of all the officers who were serving under Guan Yu and they were kept supplied with all they requiredEven the ailing members of their households were treated by physicians free of chargeThe result was that they were quite won over to the new order of things and there was no attempt to disturb itWhen Guan Yus letter came the messenger was led into the city and well treatedWhen Lu Meng read the letter he said to the bearer thereof You must understand the different circumstances When your general and I were leagued together it was a personal matter between us twoNow things have changed I am sent here with certain orders and am not my own masterI would trouble you O Messenger to return and explain thus to your master and in good words The bearer of the letter was entertained at a banquet and sent to repose himself in the guesthouse where the families of the absent officers sought him to have news of their husbands and fathersMoreover they brought him letters and gave him messages for the officers and the whole tenor of these letters and messages was that they were all in good health all their needs were supplied and they lacked nothingWhen he left the city Lu Meng himself escorted him to the outskirts and set him on his wayOn his return to the army he gave to Guan Yu the message of Lu Meng and told him that the families were all well and safe and well cared for This however did not greatly please Guan Yu for he saw in this merely a plan to gain favor and popularity The brigandIf I cannot slay him while I live I will after I am deadMy hate shall not go unappeased He roughly dismissed the messenger who went out and was at once surrounded by those whose families were in the city and who desired to have news of themAnd when he gave them the letters and messages and told them all were well there was great rejoicing among the men in the camp and kindly feelings for Lu Meng prevailed And therewith died down the spirit of fightingGuan Yu led the army to attack Jingzhou but day by day the men deserted and ran away to the very city they were moving to attackSo day by day Guan Yus bitterness and anger increased and he advanced in angry haste One day there was a great shouting and the noise of drums and he found his way blocked Why do you not surrender friend Guan Yu said the leader of this body Jiang QinCould I give in to a rebel I a servant of the Hans and a leader of their army roared Guan Yu in a passionThereupon he whipped his horse forward and swung up his sword to strike However Jiang Qin would not fightThe two exchanged a few blows and Jiang Qin fled Guan Yu followed When he had gone a long way there suddenly appeared from a gully near him Han Dang while Zhou Tai came out from the other side Thereupon Jiang Qin wheeled round and once more came to do battle so that three forces were opposed to Guan YuUnable to withstand these he retreatedBefore he had gone very far he saw signs of many people bivouacking among the hills and presently made out on a huge white banner that flapped in the breeze the words Natives of Jingzhou and the people about were calling out All the inhabitants of this place have surrendered Guan Yu felt like rushing up and cutting these people to pieces but just then two other cohorts appeared led by Ding Feng and Xu Sheng who supported Jiang QinThe three bodies of troops then set on with shouting and loud beating of drums that seemed to make the very earth tremble And Guan Yu was like the kernel in a nut quite surrounded This was not allHe saw the number of his followers diminishing every momentHe fought on till dusk and looking about him he saw all the hills crowded with Jingzhou folks and heard them calling brother for brother and son for father till his soldiers hearts had melted within them One by one they ran to their relatives heedless of their leader and his voicePresently he had but three hundred left but with them he kept up the battle till the third watch Then there was another shouting in another note for his leaders Guan Ping his son and Liao Hua came to his help And they rescued him The soldiers hearts are all melted said Guan Ping We must find some place wherein to camp till help can arriveThere is Maicheng small but sufficient let us camp there Guan Yu consented and the exhausted army hurried thither as quickly as they couldThe small force was divided among the four gates to guardZhao Lei said This place is near Shangyong where Meng Da and Liu Feng station We should send for their helpIf their army marches to our relief until the grand army of Shu comes the morale of our army will improve But disappointments dogged themVery soon the army of Wu came up and laid siege to the cityWho will try to break through and go away to Shangyong for assistance asked Guan YuI will go said Liao HuaAnd I will escort you past the danger zone said Guan PingGuan Yu wrote his letter which Liao Hua concealed next his skin and having eaten a full meal he rode out at the gateThe leader of the enemy Ding Feng tried to check him but Guan Ping fought vigorously and drove him away So Liao Hua escaped the siege and reached Shangyong while Guan Ping returned Then they barred the gates and hold their defense Now having captured Shangyong Liu Feng and Meng Da had remained to guard it Liu Feng had been created Governor General and together with Meng Da to defend that city When they heard of the defeat of Guan Yu they took counsel what to doWhen Liao Hua came he was admitted into the cityHe told the tale of Guan Yus straits and asked for helpGuan Yu is closely besieged in MaichengHelp from the west will be a long time in coming so I have been sent to beg your assistanceI hope you will march the Shangyong troops thither as quickly as possible for any delay will be fatal Liu Feng replied Sir go to the resthouse for a time till we can decide So Liao Hua went and the two leaders talked over the matterLiu Feng said This is bad news what is to be done Wu is very powerful replied his colleagueNow they have control over the whole region of Jingzhou save this small clod of earth called MaichengCao Cao is at hand with five hundred thousand troops and we cannot stand against the two mighty forcesI say we must not move I know all thisBut Guan Yu is my uncle and I cannot bear to sit still and not try to save him So you hold him as an uncle said Meng Da with a smile Yet I do not think he holds you much as a nephewWhen the Prince of Hanzhong adopted you Guan Yu was greatly annoyed And after the Prince had accepted his new dignity and was nominating his heir I heard he consulted Zhuge Liang who said the affair was one to be decided within the family and declined to advise Then the Prince sent to ask Guan Yus advice Did Guan Yu name you Not at all You were only a son by adoption and could have no place in the succession Further Guan Yu advised that you be sent to a distance lest you might cause troubleThis is common knowledge and I am surprised that you are ignorant of itYet today you make capital out of the relationship and are willing to run a great risk to support it Granted that what you say is true still what reply can we give Simply say that this city is still unsettled and you dare not move lest it be lost Liu Feng took his colleagues view sent for the messenger and told him Liao Hua was greatly disappointed He threw himself on the ground and knocked his head imploring assistanceIf you act thus there is an end of Guan Yu cried Liao HuaWill a cup of water extinguish a wagon load of blazing wood said Meng DaHasten back and await patiently for the coming of help from the west Liao Hua renewed his entreaties The two commanders simply rose shook out their sleeves and left himLiao Hua saw that things had gone against him and thought his best course would be to go at once to Chengdu He rode out of the city cursing its defenders and went away westGuan Yu from his fortress looked anxiously but vainly for the coming of the expected aid He was in a sorry plightHis army numbered but a few hundred many wounded there was no foodThen someone came to the foot of the wall and calling out to the defenders on the wall not to shoot said he had a message for the commanderHe was allowed to enter it was Zhuge Jin When he had made his salutations and taken tea he began his harangueI come at the command of my master the Marquis of Wu to persuade you to a wise courseFrom of old it has always been recognized that the hero must bow to circumstances The region with its nine territories and fortyone counties that you ruled have come under another with the exception of this single cityWithin there is no food without no help so that it must fall quicklyWherefore O General why not hear me and join your fortunes to those of Wu You shall be restored to your governorship and you will preserve your familyIf haply Sir you would reflect thereon Guan Yu replied quite calmly I am a simple soldier from the village of Jieliang I am the hands and feet of my lord How can I betray himThe city may fall and then I can but dieJade may be shattered but its whiteness remains bamboo may be burned but its joints stand straight My body may be broken but my fame shall live in historySay no more but leave the city I begI will fight Sun Quan to the death My master desires to enter into such a league with you as did Jin and Qin in former days that you may mutually assist to destroy Cao Cao and restore the HansThat is his idea and why do you persist in this wrong course As Zhuge Jin finished this speech Guan Ping who was by drew his sword to slay him But his father checked himRemember his brother is in Shu helping your uncleIf you hurt him you will injure the principle of fraternity Guan Yu then bade his servants lead Zhuge Jin awayZhuge Jin went his face covered with shame and left the cityWhen he reached his master he told of Guan Yus obduracy and rejection of all argumentHe is indeed a loyal servant said Sun Quan Still what is to be done next Take some casts in the Book of Changes said Lu FanSo the lots were taken and explained to mean that the Marquis enemies should flee to a distanceThen Sun Quan asked Lu Meng saying If he flies to a distance how can he be captured The divination exactly fits in with my schemes replied Lu Meng and though Guan Yu had wings to soar to the skies he would not escape my net The dragon in a puddle is the sport of shrimps The phoenix in a cage is mocked of small birdsThe scheme of Lu Meng will be unfolded in the next chapter CHAPTER Guan Yu Manifests His Sacredness At Mount of The Jade Spring Cao Cao Is Possessed At LuoyangSun Quan having asked Lu Meng for a plan Lu Meng replied This Guan Yu has very few soldiers left and he will not venture along the high road North of Maicheng is a risky path and he will try to escape along thatTherefore you must lay an ambush for him seven miles away from the city but do not stop him Let him go by and then harass his rear Thus he will be forced into LinjuSet another small ambush near there and you will capture your enemyFor the present attack the city vigorously on all sides but one leaving the north gate for escape Before carrying out this plan Sun Quan bade Lu Fan consult the auspicesHe did so announcing The enemy will flee toward the northwest but will be caught that night before midnight So Zhu Ran was sent in command of the first ambush and Pan Zhang was the secondThe troops sent were all veterans When Guan Yu mustered his fighting men in the city of Maicheng he had but three hundredThe food was doneThat night many soldiers of Wu came to the city walls and called to their friends by name and many of these slipped over the wall and deserted reducing the small force still furtherNo rescue force appeared and Guan Yu was at the end of his resourcesAgain he bewailed to Wang Fu saying I regret that I have neglected your wise warning in this danger what is to be done I think even if Lu Wang could come to life again he would be helpless in this case replied Wang Fu weepingSaid Zhao Lei Liu Feng and Meng Da have surely decided not to send help from ShangyongLet us abandon this miserable place try to get to Yiazhou and recover the army We may then tempt our fortune once more I agree with you that that is the best plan said Guan YuThen he ascended the walls and surveyed the countryNoting that the weakest side was the north he called in some of the inhabitants and inquired the nature of the country on that sideThey replied There are only paths there but by them one may get into the Western Land of Rivers We will go that way tonight said Guan YuWang Fu opposed it saying General you will surely fall into an ambushThe main road will be safer There may be an ambush but do I fear that said the old warrior Orders were given to be ready to march At least be very cautious said Wang FuI will defend this city to the very last I only need a hundred troops Never will we surrender Only I hope most noble General that you will send me speedy help The two parted in tears Wang Fu and Zhou Cang remaining to guard Maicheng Guan Yu Guan Ping and Zhao Lei marched with their weak force out of the north gate Guan Yu his greendragon saber ready to hand went first About the third watch seven miles lay between them and the city There they saw a deep cleft in the hills wherefrom rolled the sound of beaten drumsAnd men were shouting Soon appeared a large force with Zhu Ran at their head He came dashing forward and summoned the small party saying Guan Yu do not runSurrender and live But Guan Yu whipped his steed to a gallop and bore down on the leader with anger in his eyesThen Zhu Ran ran awayGuan Yu followed him till there came the loud boom of a large drum and out sprang troops from all sidesGuan Yu dared not engage such a number and fled in the direction of LinjuZhu Ran came up behind and attacked the flying soldiers so that Guan Yus following gradually became smaller and smaller Still he struggled onA few miles farther the drums rolled again and torches lit up all round This was Pan Zhangs ambush and he appeared flourishing his swordGuan Yu whirled his blade and went to meet him but Pan Zhang ran away after a couple of boutsHowever Guan Yu saw they were too many for him and sought refuge among the mountains His son followed and when he got within speaking distance Guan Ping gave him the mournful tidingsZhao Lei has fallen in the melee Guan Yu was very sad and bade his son try to protect the rear while he should force his way forwardWith about ten men he reached Zhuxi a place with mountains on both sides At their foot was a thick mass of reeds and dried grass The trees grew very closeIt was then the fifth watchPresently the small party stumbled into another ambush and the ambushing soldiers thrust forth hooks and threw ropesEntangled in these Guan Yus horse fell and Guan Yu reeled out of the saddle In a moment Ma Zhong the Marching General of Pan Zhang made him a prisonerGuan Ping dashed to his rescue but before he could do anything he also was surrounded and heldFather and son were both captives With great joy Sun Quan heard of the success of his plans In the morning he assembled all his officers in his tent to await the arrival of the prisonersBefore long Ma Zhong came hustling his prisoner before his lord I have long had a friendly feeling for you said Sun Quan to Guan Yu on account of your great virtues Now I would have made a covenant and alliance with you if you wouldYou and your son have long held yourselves to be invincible but you see you are my prisoners todayYet I hope to win you over to my side But Guan Yu only answered roughly You greeneyed boyYou redbearded rat I made a covenant in the Peach Garden with my brothers to uphold the Hans Think you that I will stand side by side with a rebel such as you areI am a victim of your vile schemes but I can only die onceAnd there is no need of many words He is a real hero and I love him said Sun Quan to those standing nearI will treat him well and endeavor to win him over Do you think it well Said the First Secretary Zuo Xian When Cao Cao had hold of this man Cao Cao treated him lavishly wellCao Cao created him a marquis in threeday interval Cao Cao held a small banquet in five days a great one Cao Cao gave him gold and presented him with silver all this hoping to retain him at his side But Cao Cao failed The man broke through his gates slew his six generals in five passes and went away Today Cao Cao fears him and almost moved the capital for dread of himNow he is in your power destroy him or you will rue the day Evil will come if you spare him Sun Quan reflected for some timeYou are right said he presently and gave the order for executionSo father and son met their fate together in the winter of the twentyfourth year  in the tenth monthGuan Yu was fiftyeight A poem saysPeerless indeed was our Lord Guan Yu of the latter days Head and shoulders stood he out among the best Godlike and terrible in war elegant and refined in peace Resplendent as the noonday sun in the heavens Haloed as are the noblest of those early days He stands the brightest model for all ages And not only for the strenuous days he lived in And another Seek ye a noble oneThen take ye the way of Jieliang Watch ye how all men revere Guan Yu Each excelling others to honor him Him one of the three brothers of the Peach Garden Oath Of whom two have won sacrifices as Emperor and princeIncomparable their aura spreads through the world They are resplendent as the great lights of the firmament Temples to our Lord Guan Yu abound no village lacks one Their venerable trees at sundown are the resting places for birds So Guan Yu ended his lifeHis famous steed RedHare also captured with its master was sent to Sun Quan who gave it as a reward to his captor Ma Zhong But RedHare survived its master only a short time it refused to feed and soon diedForeboding of misfortune came to Wang Fu within the city of MaichengHis bones felt cold his flesh crept and he said to his colleague Zhou Cang I have had a terrible dream in which I saw our lord all dripping with goreI would question him but I was overcome with dreadMay it augur no evil tidings Just then the troops of Wu came up to the city wall and displayed the gory heads of the two father and sonWang Fu and Zhou Cang went up on the wall to see if the dread tokens were real There was no doubtWang Fu with a despairing cry threw himself over the wall and perished Zhou Cang died by his own handThus Maicheng fell to WuNow the spirit of Guan Yu did not dissipate into space but wandered through the void till it came to a certain spot in Dangyang on a famous hill known as the Mount of the Jade SpringThere lived a venerable Buddhist priest whose name in the faith was TransversePeace He was originally of the Guardian Temple in the River Si Pass and abbot of that templeIn the course of roaming about the world he had reached this place Entranced with its natural beauty he had built himself a shelter of boughs and grass where he sat in meditation on the Way He had a novice with him to beg food and to attend to his simple wantsThis night about the third watch the moon was bright and the air serene TransversePeace sat in his usual attitude in the silence of the mountains Suddenly he heard a great voice calling in the upper air Give back my head give back my head Gazing upward TransversePeace saw the shape of a man mounted on a horse In the hand was a shining blade like unto the greendragon saberTwo military figures were with him one on either side He on the left had a white face he on the right was swarthy of countenance with a curly beard And they followed the figure with the shining blade They floated along on a cloud which came to rest on the summit of the mountainThe recluse recognized the figure as that of Guan Yu so with his yaks tail flagellum he smote the lintel of his hut and cried Where is Guan Yu The spirit understood and the figure dismounted glided down and came to rest at the door of the hutInterlacing its fingers it stood in a reverential attitude and said Who is my teacher and what is his name in the faith In the state Guardian Temple in River Si Pass I once saw you O noble Sir and I was not likely to forget your face replied the priestI am deeply grateful for the help you gave meMisfortune has befallen me and I have ceased to live I would seek the pure instruction and beg you to indicate the obscure way Let us not discuss former wrongdoings nor present correct actionsLater events are the inevitable result of former causes I know that Lu Meng has injured youYou call aloud for the return of your head who will also return the heads of your several victimsYan Liang Wen Chou and the commanders of the five passes Thereupon Guan Yu seemed suddenly to comprehend bowed in token of assent and disappearedAfter this appearance to the recluse his spirit wandered hither and thither about the mountain manifesting its sacred character and guarding the peopleImpressed by his virtue the inhabitants built a temple on the Mount of the Jade Spring wherein they sacrificed at the four seasons In later days one wrote a couplet for the temple the first member readingRuddy faced reflecting the honest heart within outriding the wind on the RedHare steed mindful of the Red Emperor In the light of clear lamp reading the histories resting on the GreenDragon saber curved as the young moon heart pure as the azure heaven The execution of Guan Yu gave Sun Quan undisputed possession of the whole of the Jingzhou RegionHe rewarded his soldiers and spread a great feast at which Lu Meng was in the seat of honorSun Quan made a speech saying After long waiting the desire of my heart has come to me very easily through the magnificent efforts of my friend Lu Meng Lu Meng bowed and bowed deprecatingly but Sun Quan continued My good Zhou Yu was superior to most humans and he defeated Cao Cao at the Red Cliffs He died too soon My good Lu Su succeeded himIn his first interview he inaugurated the general policy of creating a state That was the first instance of his keen insightWhen Cao Cao descended upon my country and everyone counseled me to yield he advised me to summon my good Zhou Yu to oppose and smite Cao Cao That was the second instance of his keen insightHe made only one fault he advised me to let Liu Bei occupy JingzhouNow today my good Lu Meng has succeeded and in that he far surpasses both his predecessors Then Sun Quan filled a goblet and in person presented it to the guest of the eveningLu Meng took the cup but as he raised it a sudden change came over himDashing the cup to the ground he seized Sun Quan crying O greeneyed boyO redbearded rat Do you know me Consternation seized the whole assembly but many rushed to the rescue of their lord who had been thrown to the floor by the guest he had so lately complimentedRushing forward over Sun Quans body Lu Meng sat himself in the hosts seat his eyebrows staring stiff and his eyes glaring After I quelled the Yellow Scarves I went hither and thither for thirty years Now I have fallen victim to your base plots and you have overcome me If living I have been unable to gorge upon the flesh of my enemy dead I will pursue the spirit of this bandit Lu MengI am the Lord of Hanshou Guan Yu Terrorstricken Sun Quan was the first to fall prostrate and all his officers followed himThereupon Lu Meng fell over dead with blood gushing from the seven orifices of his body In due time the body was coffined and interredLu Meng was created posthumously Governor of Nanjun and Lord of ChanlingHis son Lu Ba was given hereditary nobilityAfter this visitation Sun Quan lived in constant terror Soon Zhang Zhao came in from Jianye to see him and blame him for the murder My lord by the slaughter of Guan Yu you have brought misfortune very near to this stateYou know the oath sworn in the Peach GardenNow Liu Bei has the force of the two Lands of Rivers at his back Zhuge Liang as adviser and those heroes Zhang Fei Zhao Yun Huang Zhong and Ma Chao to carry out his behestsWhen Liu Bei hears of the death of both father and son he will set in motion the whole force he has to avenge them and I fear you cannot stand such an onslaught Sun Quan started up in a fright Yes I have made a little mistake said heBut seeing it is so what shall I do You need have no fear replied Zhang ZhaoI have a plan to fend off the armies of the west from our borders and keep Jingzhou quite safe What is your plan asked Sun Quan Cao Cao with his many legions is greedily aiming at the whole empireIf Liu Bei wants revenge he will ally himself with Cao Cao and should they combine against this country we should be in great danger Therefore I advise you to send Guan Yus head to Cao Cao to make it appear that Cao Cao was the prime cause of his destructionThis should divert Liu Beis extreme hatred toward Cao Cao and send the armies of Shu against Wei instead of toward WuAfter carefully considering the whole matter I counsel this as the best course of action Sun Quan thought the move worth making and so the head of the great warrior was placed in a box and sent off as quickly as possible to Cao CaoAt this time Cao Caos army had marched back from Mopo to Luoyang When he heard of the coming of the gruesome gift he was glad at heart and said So Guan Yu is dead now I can stick to my mat and sleep soundly at night But Sima Yi saw through the ruse and said from his place by the steps This is a trick to divert evil from Wu What do you mean How said Cao CaoThe Peach Garden Oath bound the three brothers to live and die together Now Wu is fearful of revenge for the execution of one of the three and sends the head to you to cause Liu Beis wrath to fasten on you O Prince Sun Quan wishes Liu Bei to attack you instead of himself the real perpetrator of the crimeThen he will find a way of accomplishing his ends while you two are quarreling You are right friend said Cao Cao and now how can we escape I think escape is easyYou have the head of Guan Yu make a wooden image of the remainder of the body and bury the whole with the rites suitable to a minister of stateWhen Liu Bei hears of this he will turn his hate toward Sun Quan and raise all his forces to attack himIf you will think it out you will see that whichever is victor the other will be smitten and if we get one of the two the other will follow before very long Cao Cao was pleased with the solutionThen he ordered the messenger to come in with the box which was opened and he looked upon the face of the dead The features had not changed the face bore the same appearance as of oldCao Cao smiled I hope you have been well since our last meeting Guan Yu said Cao CaoTo his horror the mouth opened the eyes rolled and the long beard and hair stiffened Cao Cao fell to the ground in a swoon They rushed to him but it was a long time before he recovered consciousness General Guan Yu is indeed a spirit he saidSuddenly the messenger who had brought the dead warriors head became also possessed by the spirit of Guan Yu and fell to cursing and reviling his master Sun Quan and he told the story of what had befallen Lu MengCao Cao filled with dread prepared sacrifices and performed the rites for the honored dead An effigy was carved out of heavy fragrant wood and buried outside the south gate with all the rites of a princely noble a huge concourse of officials of all grades following in the procession At the funeral Cao Cao himself bowed before the coffin and poured a libation He also conferred on the dead the posthumous title of Prince of Jingzhou and appointed guardians of the tombThe messenger was sent back to WuThe Prince of Hanzhong returned to his capital Chengdu Fa Zheng memorialized saying O Prince thy consort has passed away and the Lady Sun has returned to her maiden home perhaps never to come againHuman relations should not be set at nought wherefore a secondary consort should be sought so that all things may be correctly ordered within the palace The Prince having signified his acceptance of the principle Fa Zheng continued There is the sister of Wu Yi comely and good and declared by the physiognomist as destined to high honorShe was betrothed to Liu Mao son of Liu Yan but he died in youth and she has remained unweddedTake her as a wife It is incompatible with propriety Liu Mao and I are of the same ancestry As to the degree of relationship would it differ from the marriage of Duke Wen of Jin and Huai Ying Upon this precedent the Prince gave his consent and wedded the lady and she bore to him two sons the elder of whom was named Liu Yung and the younger Liu LiMeanwhile the whole land of Shu was prospering the people were tranquil and the state was becoming wealthy The fields yielded bountiful harvestsSuddenly there came one who told of the attempt of Sun Quan to ally himself with Guan Yu by marriage and the indignant rejection of the proposalJingzhou is in danger said Zhuge LiangRecall and replace Guan Yu Then began to arrive a series of messengers from Jingzhou bearers of news of the moves in the game At first they brought good tidings then evilGuan Xing came first to tell of the drowning of the seven armies of Yu JinThen one reported the installation of beacon towers along the river bank and other preparations which seemed as near perfect as any could be And Liu Beis anxiety ceased But evil tidings were on the way Liu Bei was ill at ease and felt a creepiness of the skin that boded evilHe was restless by day and sleepless by night One night he rose from his couch and was reading by the light of a candle when drowsiness overcame him and he fell asleep over the low table by his side He dreamedA cold gust of wind swept through the chamber almost putting out the candle flame When it brightened again he glanced up and saw a figure standing near the lightWho are you who thus come by night to my chamber asked he The figure made no reply and Liu Bei got up to go over and see who it was Then the figure took the shape of his brother But it avoided him retreating as he advancedLiu Bei said Brother there is nothing wrong I hopeBut surely something of great importance brings you here thus in the dead of the nightAnd why do you avoid me your brother who loves you as himself Then the figure wept and said Brother send your armies to avenge me As Guan Yu said that a chilly blast went through the room and the figure disappearedJust then Liu Bei awoke and knew that he had dreamedThe drums were beating the third watch as he awoke He felt greatly worried and disturbedSo he went into the front portion of the palace and sent for Zhuge Liang Soon he came and Liu Bei told him of the visionYou have been thinking too deeply of Guan Yu lately my lord said Zhuge LiangThere is no need to be distressed But Liu Bei could not find comfort and Zhuge Liang was long in calming his feelings and arguing away his fanciesAs Zhuge Liang left the palace he met Xu Jing who said Instructor I went to your residence to deliver a very secret piece of news and they told me to find you here What is your secret There is a report about that Wu has got possession of Jingzhou Lu Meng has taken it And more than that Guan Yu is dead I had to come to tell you I saw it in the sky some nights ago A large star of a general fell over against Jingzhou and I knew some evil had befallen Guan Yu But I feared the effect upon our master and I forbore to say anything They did not know that Liu Bei was standing just within the doorSuddenly he rushed out seized Zhuge Liang by the sleeve and said Why did you hide from me Why when you had such terrible news Because it is only a rumor replied they It is too improbable for beliefWe pray you not to be distressed By our oath we live or die together how can I go on living if he is lost The two men soothed their lord as best they could but even as they spoke to him one of the private attendants said that Ma Liang and Yi Ji had arrivedLiu Bei called them in and questioned them eagerlyThey said Jingzhou has indeed been lost and Guan Yu begs for instant help The letters they brought had not been read before Liao Hua was ushered inHe prostrated himself and weeping told the story of the refusal of help on the part of Liu Feng and Meng DaThen is my brother lost cried Liu BeiIf those two have really behaved so badly the offense is even too great for death said Zhuge Liang But calm yourself O Prince I will see about an army and lead it to the rescue If Guan Yu is gone I cannot live moaned Liu BeiTomorrow I myself will set out with an army to rescue him Liu Bei sent off a messenger to Zhang Fei in Langzhong and gave orders to muster horse and foot for instant departureBefore day dawned other messengers arrived giving step by step the sequence of the tragedy Guan Yu had cut his way to Linju at night and been captured by a general of Wu He had refused to bend and both father and son had gone to the Nine Springs When he heard of the final catastrophe Liu Bei uttered a great cry and fell swooningHis mind went back to the pledge of days gone by Could he live still and let his brother die What happened will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER  Treating A Headache A Famous Physician Dies Giving The Last Words The Crafty Hero Departs As has been said the Prince of Hanzhong swooned on hearing the terrible news of the death of the two Guans father and sonHis officers went to his help and when he had recovered sufficiently they led him to his private apartmentsMy lord control your grief said Zhuge LiangLife and death are fixed by fateGuan Yu brought the evil upon himself by his harshness and haughtinessYou must now take care of your health and mature your vengeance When we swore brotherhood in the Peach Garden we pledged ourselves to live or die togetherWhat enjoyment of riches and honors is there for me now that my brother is gone Just then he saw Guan Yus son Guan Xing coming in weeping in deep distressAt sight of the youth Liu Bei uttered a great cry and again sank to the earth By and by he came to and spent the whole day weeping and swooning at intervalsFor three days he refused all nourishment and he wept so bitterly that his garments were wetted and there were spots of blood Zhuge Liang and the others tried every means to soothe him but he was inconsolableI swear I will not live under the same heaven as Sun Quan cried heIt is said that the head of your brother has been sent to Cao Cao but Cao Cao has buried the remains with the rites of a princely noble said Zhuge Liang Why did he do that asked Liu BeiBecause Sun Quan thought thereby to bring evil upon Cao Cao But Cao Cao saw through the subterfuge and has buried your brother with great honor so that your anger may burn against Wu I want to send my armies to punish Wu and appease my wrath said Liu BeiNo you may not do that Wu wishes to move you to smite Wei and Wei wishes you to attack Wu each harboring the malevolent design of taking advantage of the quarrelYou would do well my lord to keep your armies at homePut on mourning for Guan Yu and wait till Wei and Wu are at war That will be your time The other officers supported Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei listened Presently his grief spent itself and he began to take food againAn edict was promulgated enjoining mourning dress upon all officialsThe Prince went outside the south gate to summon the spirit home and sacrificed and wailed a whole day for the dead warrior his brotherAlthough Cao Cao had given honorable burial to the remains of Guan Yu yet he was continually haunted by the dead mans spirit Every night when he closed his eyes he saw Guan Yu as he knew the warrior so well in the fleshThese visions made him nervous and he sought the advice of his officersSome suggested the building of new rooms for his own use There is much witchcraft and malign influence in this old palace at Luoyang build a new palace for your own occupation said theyI would and it should be called The Firm Foundation said heBut where is the good architect Jia Xu said There is one Su Yue a very cunning artificer in Luoyang Su Yue was called and set to work on the plans for a ninehall pavilion for Cao Caos own use It had verandahs and upper rooms as well His plans pleased Cao Cao greatlyYou have planned just such a place as I wished only where will you find the main beam for such a building I know a certain tree that will serve said the architectAbout ten miles from the city there is the Pool of the Leaping DragonNear it is a shrine and beside that grows a fine pear treeIt is over a hundred spans high and that will serve for the roof tree Cao Cao at once sent people to fell the treeBut after one whole day of labor they came back to say they could make no impression on it neither with saw nor ax Cao Cao doubting their word went to seeWhen he had dismounted and stood by the tree he could not but admire its size and proportions as it rose above him tall straight and branched till the widespreading and symmetrical top reached into the cloudsBut he bade the men attack it again Then a few aged people of the village came and said The tree has stood here some centuries and is the haunt of a spiritWe think it should not be cut down Cao Cao grew annoyed saying I have gone to and fro in the world now some forty years and there is no one from the Emperor to the commoner who does not fear meWhat spirit is there who dares oppose my wish Drawing the sword he was wearing Cao Cao went up to the tree and slashed at the trunkThe tree groaned as he struck and blood stains spattered his dressTerrorstricken he threw down the sword mounted his horse and galloped offBut that evening when he retired to rest he could not sleep He rose went into the outer room and sat there leaning on a low tableSuddenly a man appeared with his hair unbound dressed in black and carrying a naked sword The visitor came straight toward Cao Cao stopped in front of him and pointing cried out Behold the Spirit of the Pear TreeYou may desire to build your ninehall pavilion and you may contemplate rebellion but when you began to attack my sacred tree the number of your days was accomplishedI am come now to slay you Where are the guards shouted Cao Cao in terrorThe figure struck at him with the sword Cao Cao cried out and then awokeHis head was aching unbearablyThey sought the best physicians for him but they failed to relieve the terrible pain Sympathy for their lord was universal among Cao Caos subordinatesHua Xin one day said to his master My lord have you heard of Hua Tuo Do you mean him of Qiao who cured Zhou Tai Yes that is he replied Hua XinI have heard something of his fame but I know nothing of his capabilities in his art He is very clever there are few so skillfulIf one is ill and calls him in he knows immediately whether to use drugs or the needle or the cutlery and the patient finds relief at onceLet one suffer from an internal complaint and drugs are ineffectual with a dose of hashish he throws the patient into a state of perfect insensibility and then opens the abdomen and washes the affected organs with a medicament The patient feels no painWhen the cleansing is complete he sews up the wound with thread dresses it and in a month or less the patient is well This shows you how skillful he isOne day Hua Tuo was traveling when he heard a man by the wayside groaning with painThat is dyspepsia said Hua TuoAnd further questions confirmed the diagnosisHe prescribed long draughts of the juice of garlic as an emetic and the man vomited a worm after this the man was quite wellChen Deng the Governor of Guangling suffered from a heavy feeling at the heart His face was red and congested and he had no appetiteHua Tuo gave him a drug and he threw up many internal wriggling parasites with red headsThe Governor asked what had caused the trouble and Hua Tuo told him that he ate too much strong smelling fishHe could cure Chen Deng this once but in three years the disease would recur and then nothing could save himThree later Chen Deng diedAnother man had a tumor between the eyes and it itched intolerablyHua Tuo examined it and said there was a bird in itThe tumor was opened and surely enough a canary flew outThe patient was relieved A dog bit a mans toe and two tumorous growths ensued one of which itched intolerably and the other pained severelyHua Tuo said the painful one contained ten needles and the other a couple of chess pips black and whiteHe opened the two swellings and the contents were as he had said Really he is of the same class of physician as masters Bian Que and Zang Kong of old timesHe lives at Jincheng not far away and could be here very soon Cao Cao summoned him and as soon as he arrived Hua Tuo felt the pulse and made careful examinationPrince your headaches are due to a malignant humor within the brain case The humor is too thick to get out Swallowing drugs will do no goodBut I propose to administer a dose of hashish then open the brain case and remove the thickened humorThat will be a radical cure You mean you want to kill me cried Cao Cao angrilyO Prince you have heard how I cured Guan Yu of the poison that had got into his bones I scraped them and he did not hesitate a momentYour malady is trifling and why do you mistrust me A painful arm may be scraped but how can you cut open a mans headThe fact is you have conspired with some of Guan Yus friends to take this opportunity to make away with me in revenge for his death Cao Cao told his lictors to hale Hua Tuo to gaol and there he was tortured to try to find who were his accomplicesJia Xu pleaded for him saying The man possesses rare skills to kill him is to waste his talents But the intervention was of no availThe man wants to get a chance to kill me he is the same sort of scoundrel as Ji Ping The wretched physician was subjected to worse sufferingsHis gaoler was a certain Wu nicknamed The Gaoler by nearly everybodyHe was kindly disposed to Hua Tuo and saw that he was well fedHua Tuo conceived a liking for his gaoler and said to him one day I am doomed I know The pity is that my Black Bag treatise on medicine may be lostYou have been most kind to me and as I have no other way of recompensing you I will give you a letter to my wife telling her to send the Black Bag and I will give it to you that you may carry on my art Wu the Gaoler rejoiced greatly thinking that he would throw away the menial position of gaoler and travel about the country healing sick folks and so he told Hua Tuo to write the letter and promised to carry on his workThe letter was written and given to Wu the Gaoler who lost no time in traveling to Jincheng to meet with Hua Tuos wife and she gave him the Black Bag to bring back to Hua TuoAfter Hua Tuo had read through the book carefully he presented it to Wu the Gaoler who took it home and hid it awayTen days after this Hua Tuo died in prisonWu the Gaoler bought a coffin and had him buried This done he quitted the prison and went home But when he asked for the book he found that his wife had discovered it and was using it to light the fire He snatched away what was left of it but a whole volume was missing and what was left amounted only to a few pagesHe vented his anger in cursing his wife and she retorted saying If you become such a learned person as Hua Tuo you will only die in prison like himWhat good did it all do him It struck Wu the Gaoler that there was something in what she said and he ceased grumbling at herBut the upshot of all this was that the learning in the Treatise of the Black Bag was finally lost to the world for what was left only contained a few recipes relating to domestic animalsHua Tuo was the ablest of physician Seeing what diseases were lurking within beingsThat he died and his writings Followed him to the Nine Golden Springs Meanwhile Cao Cao became worse the uncertainty of the intentions of his rivals aggravating his disease not a littleThen they said an envoy had come with letters from Wu the gist of which was satisfactory as it ran like thisThy servant Sun Quan has long seen whom destiny indicates as master of all and looks forward with confidence to his early accession to the dignity of the Son of God If he will send his armies to destroy Liu Bei and sweep rebellion from the two Lands of Rivers his servant at the head of his armies will submit and accept his land as a fief Cao Cao laughed as he read this and he said to his officers Is this youth trying to put me on a furnace But Minister Chen Qun and the attendants seriously replied O Prince the Hans have been feeble too long while your virtues and merits are like the mountainsAll the people look to you and when Sun Quan acknowledged himself as your minister he is but responsive to the will of God and the desire of humans It is wrong that you oppose when such contrary influences work to a common end and you must soon ascend to the high place Cao Cao smiledI have served the Hans for many years and if I have acquired some merit yet I have been rewarded with a princedom and high rank I dare not aspire to greater thingsIf the finger of heaven points to me then shall I be as King Wen of Zhou As Sun Quan acknowledges himself your servant and promises obedience you my lord can confer a title upon him and assign to him the duty of attacking Liu Bei said Sima YiApproving of the suggestion Cao Cao gave Sun Quan the titles of General of the Flying Cavalry and Lord of Nanzhang and appointed him to the Imperial Protectorship of Jingzhou Forthwith this command was sent away to Sun QuanCao Caos condition grew worse dailyOne night he had a dream of three horses feeding out of the same manger Next day he told it to Jia Xu saying I saw three horses feeding on the same manger before the family of Ma Teng was harmed Last night I saw the same dream again How do you interpret it It is auspicious to dream of dignity replied Jia Xu And naturally such an honor comes to the CaosI do not think you need feel any misgivings Cao Cao was comfortedCao Cao dreamed three steeds together fed The vision seers could not explain None guessed how soon when Cao Cao was dead One dynasty would rule againAh yes Cao Cao had vainly wrought Of none avail each wicked wile For later in Wei court there fought Against him one with equal guileThat night Cao Cao became worse As he lay on his couch he felt dizzy and could not see so he rose and sat by a table upon which he leanedIt seemed to him that someone shrieked and peering into the darkness he perceived the forms of many of his victimsthe Empress Fu the Consort Dong Fu Wan Dong Cheng and more than twenty other officials and all were bloodstainedThey stood in the obscurity and whispered demanding his life He rose lifted his sword and threw it wildly into the air Just then there was a loud crash and the southwest corner of the new building came down And Cao Cao fell with itHis attendants raised him and bore him to another palace where he might lie at peace But he found no peaceThe next night was disturbed by the ceaseless wailing of men and womens voicesWhen day dawned Cao Cao sent for his officers and said to them Thirty years have I spent in the turmoil of war and have always refused belief in the supernaturalBut what does all this mean O Prince you should summon the Taoists to offer sacrifices and prayers said theyCao Cao sighed saying The wise Teacher said He who offends against heaven has no one to pray to I feel that my fate is accomplished my days have run and there is no help But he would not consent to call in the priestsNext day his symptoms were worse He was panting and could no longer see distinctly He sent hastily for Xiahou Dun who came at once But as Xiahou Dun drew near the doors he too saw the shadowy forms of the slain Empress and her children and many other victims of Cao Caos crueltyHe was overcome with fear and fell to the ground The servants raised him and led him away very illThen Cao Cao called in four of his trusty advisersCao Hong Chen Qun Jia Xu and Sima Yithat they might hear his last wishesCao Hong speaking for the four said Take good care of your precious self O Prince that you may quickly recover But Cao Cao said Thirty and more years have I gone up and down and many a bold leader has fallen before me The only ones that remain are Sun Quan in the south and Liu Bei in the west I have not yet slain themNow I am very ill and I shall never again stand before you wherefore my family affairs must be settledMy first bornCao Ang son of Lady Liufell in battle at Wancheng when he was youngThe Lady Bian bore four sons to me as you knowThe third Cao Zhi was my favorite but he was vain and unreliable fond of wine and lax in morals Therefore he is not my heirMy second son Cao Zhang is valiant but imprudentThe fourth Cao Xiong is a weakly and may not live longMy eldest Cao Pi is steady and serious he is fit to succeed me and I look to you to support him Cao Hong and the others wept as they heard these words and they left the chamberThen Cao Cao bade his servants bring all of the Tibetan incenses and fragrances that he burned every day and he handed out to his handmaids And he said to them After my death you must diligently attend to your womanly laborsYou can make silken shoes for sale and so earn your own living He also bade them go on living in the Bronze Bird Pavilion and celebrate a daily sacrifice for him with music by the singing women and presentation of the eatables laid before his tabletNext he commanded that seventytwo sites for a tomb should be selected near Jiangwu that no one should know his actual burying place lest his remains should be dug upAnd when these final orders had been given he sighed a few times shed some tears and diedHe was sixtysix and passed away in the first month of the twentyfifth year A certain poet composed A Song of Yejun expressing sympathy for Cao Cao which is given here I stood in Yejun and saw the River Zhang Go gliding by I thought no common human Ever rose from such a place Or he was great In war a poet or an artist skilled Perchance a model minister or son Or famous for fraternal duty shownThe thoughts of heroes are not ours to judge Nor are their actions for our eyes to seeA man may stand the first in merit then His crimes may brand him chief of criminalsAnd so his reputations fair and foul His literary gifts may bear the mark Of genius he may be a ruler born But this is certain he will stand above His fellows herding not with common peopleTakes he the field then is he bold in fight Would he a mansion build a palace springs In all things great his genius masters him And such was Cao Cao He could never be Obedient he a rebel was foredoomedHe seized and ruled but hungered for more power Became a prince and still was not content And yet this man of glorious career When gripped by sickness wept as might a child Full well he knew when on the bed of death That all is vanity and nothing worth His latest acts were kindlySimple gifts Of fragrant incense gave he to the maidsThe ancients splendid deeds or secret thoughts We may not measure with our puny ruleBut criticize them pedants as ye may The mighty dead will smile at what you sayAs Cao Cao breathed his last the whole of those present raised a great wailing and lamentationThe news was sent to the members of the family the Heir Cao Pi Lord of Yanling Cao Zhang Lord of Linzi Cao Zhi and Lord of Xiaohuai Cao XiongThey wrapped the body in its shroud enclosed it in a silver shell and laid it in a golden coffin which was sent at once home to YejunThe eldest son wept aloud at the tidings and went out with all his following to meet the procession and escort the body of his father into his homeThe coffin was laid in a great hall beside the main building and all the officials in deep mourning wailed in the hallSuddenly one stood out from the ranks of the mourners and said I would request the heir to cease lamentation for the dead and devote himself to the present needs of state It was Sima Fu and he continued The death of the Prince will cause an upheaval in the empire and it is essential that the heir should assume his dignity without loss of time There is not mourning alone to be seen to The others repliedThe succession is settled but the investiture can hardly proceed without the necessary edict from the EmperorThat must be secured Said Chen Jiao who was Minister of War As the Prince died away from home it may be that disputes will ensue and the country will be in danger Then Chen Jiao slashed off the sleeves of his robe with a sword and shouted fiercely We will invest the prince forthwith and any one who do not agree let him be treated as this robe Still fear held most of the assembly Then arrived Hua Xin most haste from the capitalThey wondered what his sudden arrival meantSoon he entered the hall and said The Prince of Wei is dead and the world is in commotion why do you not invest his successor quickly We await the command cried they in chorus and also the order of PrincessMother Bian concerning the heirship I have procured the Imperial edict here cried he pulling it out from his breastThey all began to congratulate himAnd he read the edictHua Xin had always been devoted to Wei and so he drafted this edict and got it sealed by Emperor Xian almost by forceHowever there it was and therein Cao Pi was named as Prince of Wei First Minister and Imperial Protector of Jizhou Cao Pi thereupon took his seat in the princely place and received the congratulations of all the officers This was followed by a banquet However all was not to pass too smoothly While the banquet was in progress the news cameCao Zhang Lord of Yanling with an army of one hundred thousand troops is approaching from Changan In a state of consternation the new Prince turned to his courtiers saying What shall I doThis young goldenbearded brother of mine always obstinate and determined and with no little military skill is marching hither with an army to contest my inheritance Let me go to see the Marquis I can make him desist said one of the guestsThe others cried Only yourself O Exalted One can save us in this peril Quarrel between two sons of Cao Cao Just as in the House of Yuan ShaoIf you would know who proposed himself as envoy read the next chapter CHAPTER  Brother Oppressing Brother Cao Zhi Composes Poems Nephew Harming Uncle Liu Feng Receives PunishmentAll eyes turned toward the speaker High Minister Jia Kui and the young prince commanded him to undertake the missionSo he went out of the city and sought to speak with Cao Zhang Cao Zhang came quickly to the pointWho has the late Princes seal asked heJia Kui replied seriously There is an eldest son to a house and an heirapparent to a stateSuch a question from your lordship is unbecoming Cao Zhang held his peace and the two proceeded into the city to the gates of the palaceThere Jia Kui suddenly asked him You come as a mourner or as a rival claimant I am come as a mourner I never had any ulterior motive That being so why bring in your soldiers Whereupon Cao Zhang ordered his escort to retire and entered the city aloneWhen the Cao brothers met they fell into each others arms and weptThen Cao Zhang yielded command of all his army and he was directed to go back to Yanling and guard it He obediently withdrewCao Pi being now firmly established changed the name of the period of his rule to the Prolonged Repose Era the First Year He made Jia Xu Grand Commandant Hua Xin Prime Minister and Wang Lang High Minister and made many promotionsTo the late Prince he gave the posthumous title of the King of Great Might and buried him in Gaoling To the superintendence of the building of King Caos tomb Cao Pi nominated Yu Jin but with malevolent intentFor when Yu Jin reached his post he found the walls of the rooms decorated with chalk sketches depicting the drowning of the seven armies and the capture of himself by Guan Yu Guan Yu was looking very dignified and severe Pang De was refusing to bow to the victor while Yu Jin himself was lying in the dust pleading for his lifeCao Pi had chosen this method of putting Yu Jin to open shame because Yu Jin had not preferred death to the dishonor of capture and had sent an artist on purpose to depict the shameful scenesWhen Yu Jin saw them shame and rage alternately took possession of him till he fell ill Soon after he died War waged he for many a year Yet fell prey to craven fearNone can know anothers heart Drawing tigers with bones startSoon after the accession Hua Xin memorialized the Prince of Wu saying The Lord of Yanling has cut himself loose from his army and gone quietly to his post but your other two brothers did not attend the funeral of their fatherTheir conduct should be inquired into and punished Cao Pi took up the suggestion and sent commissioners to each They who were sent to the younger quickly returned to reportCao Xiong the Lord of Xiaohuai had hanged himself rather than suffer for his fault Cao Pi ordered honorable burial for Cao Xiong and gave him the posthumous title of Prince of Xiaohuai Soon after the envoy to Linzi returned to reportThe Lord of Linzi Cao Zhi is spending his time in dissipation his especial boon companions being two brothers named Ding Zhengli and Ding Jingli They were very rude When we presented ourselves Cao Zhi sat bolt upright but would not say a wordDing Zhengli used insulting words saying King Cao intended our lord to succeed but was turned there from by the slanderous tongues of certain among youAs soon as he is dead your master begins to think of punishment for his own flesh and blood The other brother Ding Jingli said In intellect our lord leads the age and he ought to have been heir to his fatherNow not only does he not succeed but he is treated in this harsh way by a lot of courtiers of your sort ignorant of what genius means And then Cao Zhi in a fit of anger had ordered his lictors to beat the chief envoy and turn him out This treatment of his messenger annoyed Cao Pi greatly and he dispatched a force of three thousand Imperial Tiger Guards under Xu Chu to arrest his brother and all his immediate surroundings When Xu Chu arrived Linzi the gate commander stopped himXu Chu slew that general and entered the city unchallengedHe went to the residence and found Cao Zhi and all his companions dead drunk so he bound them put them into carts and sent them to court in Yejun He also arrested all the officers of the palaceCao Pis first order was to put to death Ding Zhengli and Ding Jingli The two brothers were not wholly base they had a reputation for learning and many were sorry for themCao Pis mother Lady Bian was alarmed at the severity of the new rule and the suicide of her youngest son wounded her deeplyWhen she heard that Cao Zhi had been arrested and his comrades put to death she left her palace and went to see her eldest sonAs soon as he saw her the Prince hastened to meet her She began to weepYour brother has always had that weakness for wine but we let him go his way out of consideration for his undoubted abilityI hope you will not forget he is your brother and that I bore you bothSpare his life that I may close my eyes in peace when I set out for the deep springs I also admire his ability Mother and have no intention to hurt himBut I would reform him Have no anxiety as to his fate said Cao PiSo the mother was comforted and withdrewThe Prince then went to a private room and bade them call his brotherSaid Hua Xin Surely the PrincessMother has just been interceding for your brother is it not so It is so replied the PrinceThen let me say that Cao Zhi is too clever to be content to remain in a humble stationIf you do not remove him he will do you harm I must obey my mothers command People say your brother simply talks in literature I do not believe it myself but he might be put to the testIf he bears a false reputation you can slay him if what they say is true then degrade him lest the scholars of the land should babble Soon Cao Zhi came and in a state of great trepidation bowed low before his elder brother confessing his faultThe Prince addressed him saying Though we are brothers yet the proper relation between us of prince and minister must not be overlooked Why then did you behave indecorouslyWhile the late Prince lived you made a boast of your literary powers but I am disposed to think you may have made use of anothers penNow I require you to compose a poem within the time taken to walk seven paces and I will spare your life if you succeedIf you fail then I shall punish you with rigor Will you suggest a theme asked Cao ZhiNow there was hanging in the hall a black and white sketch of two bulls that had been fighting at the foot of a wall and one of them had just fallen dead into a wellCao Pi pointed to the sketch and said Take that as the subjectBut you are forbidden to use the words two bulls one bull fighting walls foot falling well and dead Cao Zhi took seven paces and then recited this poemTwo butchers victims lowing walked along Each head bore curving bones a sturdy pair They met just by a hillock both were strong Each would avoid a pit new dug thereThey fought unequal battle for at length One lay below a gory mass inertIt was not that they were of unequal strength Though wrathful both one did not strength exertThis exhibition of skill amazed the Prince and the whole courtCao Pi thought he would use another test so he bade his brother improvise on the theme of their fraternal relationship the words brotherhood or brother being barredWithout seeming to reflect Cao Zhi rattled off this rhyme They were boiling beans on a beanstalk fire Came a plaintive voice from the pot O why since we sprang from the selfsame root Should you kill me with anger hot The allusion in these verses to the cruel treatment of one member of a family by another was not lost upon Cao Pi and he dropped a few silent tearsThe mother of both men came out at this moment from her abiding place and said Should the elder brother thus oppress the younger The Prince jumped from his seat saying My mother the laws of the state cannot be nullified Cao Zhi was degraded to the rank of Lord of AnxiangHe accepted the decision without a murmur and at once left his brothers court by horseCao Pis accession was the signal for a set of new laws and new commands His behavior toward Emperor Xian was more intemperate than his fathers had ever beenThe stories of his harshness reached Chengdu and almost frightened Liu Bei who summoned his counselors to discuss what he should do Said he Since the death of Cao Cao and the accession of his son the position of the Emperor has changed for the worseSun Quan acknowledges the lordship of Wei and its influence is becoming too greatI am disposed to destroy Sun Quan in revenge for the death of my brother That doneI will proceed to the Capital District and purge the whole land of rebellionWhat think you Then Liao Hua stood out from the ranks of officers and threw himself upon the earth saying with tears Liu Feng and Meng Da were the true cause of the death of your brother and his adopted son both these renegades deserve death Liu Bei was of the same opinion and was going to send and arrest them forthwith but here Zhuge Liang intervened and gave wiser adviceThat is not the way go slowly or you may stir up strifePromote these two and separate them After that you may arrest The Prince of Hanzhong saw the prudence of this procedure and stayed his handHe raised Liu Feng to the Governorship of Mianzhu and so separated the two delinquentsNow Peng Yang and Meng Da were old friends Hearing what was afoot the former hastened home and wrote warning his friend The letter was confided to a trusty messenger to bear to Meng DaThe messenger was caught as he went out of the city and carried before Ma Chao who thus got wind of the businessHe then went to Peng Yangs house where nothing being suspected he was received kindly and wine was brought inThe two drank for some time When Ma Chao thought his host sufficiently off his guard he said The Prince of Hanzhong used to look on you with great favor why does he do so no longer The host began to rave against his master The obstinate old leatherbellyBut I will find some way to pay him out In order to see to what lengths he would go Ma Chao led him on saying Truth to tell I have long hated the man too Then you join Meng Da and attack while I will win over the people of Eastern and Western Lands of Rivers That will make it easy enough said Peng YangWhat you propose is very feasible but we will talk it over again tomorrow said Ma Chao and took leaveTaking with him the captured man and the letter he carried Ma Chao then proceeded to see the Prince to whom he related the whole storyLiu Bei was very angry and at once had the intended traitor arrested and put in prison where he was examined under torture to get at full detailsWhile Peng Yang lay in prison bitterly but vainly repentant Liu Bei consulted his adviserThat fellow Peng Yang meant to turn traitor what shall I do with him The fellow is something of a scholar but irresponsible replied Zhuge LiangHe is too dangerous to be left alive Thereupon orders were given that he should be allowed to commit suicide in gaol The news that Peng Yang had been made away frightened his sympathizer and friend Meng Da and put him in a quandary What would he better do on the top of thisLiu Fengs promotion and transfer to Mianzhu arrived and frightened him still moreSo he sought advice from two friends and commanders the brothers Shen Dan and Shen Yi who lived in Shangyong My friend Peng Yang and I did much for the Prince of HanzhongBut now Peng Yang is dead and I am forgotten More than that the Prince wishes to put me to death What can I do said Meng DaShen Dan replied I think I can find a plan that will secure your safety What is it asked Meng Da feeling happier Desertion My brother Shen Yi and I have long desired to go over to Wei You just write the Prince of Hanzhong a memorial resigning your service and betake yourself to the Prince of Wei who will certainly employ you in some honorable wayThen we two will follow Meng Da saw that this was his best course so he wrote a memorandum which he gave to the messenger who had brought the recent dispatches to take back with himThat night Meng Da left his post and went to WeiThe messenger returned to Chengdu handed in Meng Das memorial and told the story of his desertionThe Prince was angry He tore open the letter and read In the humble opinion of thy servant O Prince you have set out to accomplish a task comparable with that of Yi Yin and to walk in the meritorious footsteps of Lu Wang in building the fame of Kings Wen and Huan When the great design was roughhewn you had the support of the lands of the states of Wu and Chu wherefore many people of ability incontinently joined youSince I entered your service I have committed many faults and if I recognize them how much more do you see themNow O Prince you are surrounded by famous people while I useless as a helper at home and inept as a leader abroad should be shamed were I to take a place among themIt is well known that when Fan Li saw certain eventualities he went sailing on the lakes and Zi Fan acknowledged his faults and stayed by the riversInasmuch as one cannot take means of safeguarding ones self at the critical and dangerous moment I desireas is my dutyto go away as I came untaintedMoreover I am stupid and without use or merit merely born in these days as the sport of circumstancesIn the days of old Shen Sheng though perfectly filial incurred the suspicions of his father and died Zi Xu though perfectly loyal was put to deathMeng Tian though he extended the borders of Qin suffered the extreme penalty and Yue Yi though he destroyed the might of Qi was the victim of calumnyWhenever I have read of these men I have been moved to tears and now I am in like case and the more mortifiedLately Jingzhou was overwhelmed and I an officer of rank failed in my duty not one in a hundred behaving as I shouldOnly I return Fangling and Shangyong and seek service abroadNow I desire you O Prince graciously to understand to sympathize with thy servant and to condone the step he is about to takeReally I am but a mean man incapable of great deedsI know what I am doing and I dare to say it is no small fault They say that dissolution of bonds should not occasion recrimination and the dismissed servant should take leave without heartburningI have taken your orders many times and now O Prince you must act yourselfI write this with extreme trepidation But the reading gave rise to great anger in the breast of the Prince The unmerited fellow said heHe turns traitor and dares to insult me by sending a letter of farewell Liu Bei was just giving orders to send a force to seize the deserter when Zhuge Liang interposed saying You would better send Liu Feng to capture him and let the two tigers worry each other to weaknessWhether Liu Feng succeeds or fails he will have to come to the capital and you can kill him Thus will you cut off two evils Liu Bei took his adviceOrders were sent to Mianzhu and Liu Feng obediently led out his troopsNow Meng Da arrived when Cao Pi was holding a great councilWhen the attendants told him that General Meng Da of Shu had come Cao Pi summoned him to enter and said to him Is not this an insincere surrender Meng Da replied I was in fear of death for not having relieved Guan Yu That is my only reason for coming However Cao Pi did not trust himWhen they reported that Liu Feng was coming to arrest him with a large army and had attacked Xiangyang and was challenging Meng Da to battle Cao Pi said You seem to be trueGo then to Xiangyang and take Liu FengIf you bring me his head I shall no longer doubt Meng Da replied I will convince him by argument no soldiers will be neededI will bring him to surrender too So Meng Da was made General Who Establishes Strong Arms Lord of Pingyang and Governor of Xincheng and sent to guard Xiangyang and FankouNow there were two generals there already Xiahou Shang and Xu Huang who engaged in reducing the surrounding territoriesMeng Da arrived met his two colleagues and was told that Liu Feng was fifteen miles from the city Whereupon Meng Da wrote him a letter urging him to surrenderBut Liu Feng was in no mood to surrender instead he tore up the letter and put the messenger to deathThe renegade has already made me offend against my duty to my uncle and now would sever me from my father so that I shall be reproached as disloyal and unfilial said Liu FengMeng Da went out with his army to give battle Liu Feng rode to the front pointed with his sword at his opponent and railed against himDeath is very near you replied Meng Da yet you continue blindly in the way of foolishness and will not understand Liu Feng rode out flourishing his swordHe engaged Meng Da who ran away before the conflict had well begun Liu Feng pursued hotly to seven miles Then he fell into an ambush and found himself attacked on two sides by Xiahou Shang and Xu Huang Also Meng Da returned to the attackLiu Feng was forced to fly He made straight for Shangyong pursued all the way When he reached the city and hailed the gate he was met by a volley of arrowsI have surrendered to Wei cried Shen Dan from the city towerIt was impossible to attack the city as the army of Wei was close behind and having no resting place he set off for Fangling He arrived there to find the banners of Wei set out along the walls Then he saw Shen Yi wave a signal from the tower and at once there appeared from the shelter of the wall a body of soldiers led by Xu Huang Then Liu Feng made for homeBut he was pursued and only a hundred riders of his remained to him when he regained ChengduSeeking an interview with his father he found but scant sympathy for in response to his petition made prostrate and weeping Liu Bei said Shameful sonHow are you come to see me at all My uncles mishap was not due to my refusal of help but because Meng Da thwarted me You eat as a man you dress as a man but you have no more the instincts of a man than an image of clay or woodWhat mean you by saying another wretch thwarted you Liu Bei bade the executioners expel Liu Feng and put him to deathBut the Prince felt some compunction later when he heard of Liu Fengs treatment to the messenger who had brought Meng Das letter inviting him to become a traitorAnd he gave way to grief for the death of Guan Yu until he fell illSo no military movements were madeAfter he had succeeded to the princedom Cao Pi raised all his officers to high rank and had an army prepared of three hundred thousand and maneuvered them over the southern territories and made great feasts in the county of Qiao in the old state of Pei which was the land of his ancestorsAs the grand army passed by the aged villagers lined the roads offering gifts of wine just as when the Founder of the Hans returned home to PeiWhen it was announced that the Regent Marshal Xiahou Dun was near death Cao Pi hastened back to Yejun but arrived too late to see himHe put on mourning for the great leader and instituted magnificent funeral ceremoniesIn the late summer of this same year it was reported that a phoenix had been seen to bow at Shiyi and a linlion had appeared at Linzi while a yellow dragon was observed in YejunWhereupon Imperial Commander Li Fu and Minister Xu Zhi discussed these appearances and putting them all together they concluded saying Those splendid signs presage that Wei is about to supplant Han and the altar of abdication should be set up Presently a deputation of forty high officers both military and civil led by Hua Xin Wang Lang Xin Pi Jia Xu Liu Ye Liu Yi Chen Jiao Chen Qun and Huan Jie went into the Palace and proposed to Emperor Xian that he should abdicate and yield to the Prince of Wei Cao PiIt is time to set up the throne of Wei And steal the land from the HansThe next chapter will record the Emperors reply CHAPTER Cao Pi Deposes The Emperor Taking Away The Fortunes of Hans Liu Bei Assumes The Throne Continuing The Heritage Hua Xin was the spokesman of the deputation of officers that went into the palace and he spoke thusSince the inauguration of the Prince of Wei virtue has spread to the four corners of the empire and humanity has permeated all the earth to a degree unexcelled in all the ages even in the days of the ancient rulers King Tang and King YuWe your servants have taken account of these things and have reached the conclusion that the fortunes of Han is worn out wherefore we trust Your Majesty in imitation of the great prototypes King Yao and King Shun will yield the mountains the rivers and the peoples to a more able guardian and high priest of the sacrifices in the person of the Prince of Wei thereby pleasing Heaven and satisfying the hearts of humans and enabling Your Majesty to enjoy the happiness of freedom and repose from the exacting duties of the chief ruler The happiness of your ancestors and of humanity at large would thereby be enhancedHaving thoroughly debated this matter we have come to lay it before you The Emperor listened in amazement and for a time could not replyThen looking at the assembly he said sadly How can I abandon my empire for the sake of reposethe empire won by my Great Ancestor its Founder when with a threespan sword he slew the Snake and restored Right and consolidated when he reduced Qin and overwhelmed Chuthe empire which has been handed down for four centuriesThough I possess not brilliant talents yet I have done no wrongGo back and debate this again in a just and moderate spirit Then Hua Xin led forward Xu Zhi and Li Fu nearer the throne saying If Your Majesty thinks we may be mistaken pray ask these two who will explain Said Li Fu Since the Prince of Wei has taken his seat the Linlion has descended the Phoenix has appeared the yellow Dragon has come forth the Grain of Felicity has flourished and Sweet Dew has watered the earthAll these things augur that Heaven decrees a change and Wei must replace Han Xu Zhi continued The astrologers watching the aspect of the skies at night have seen the blazing light of the star of Han gradually fade away and Your Majestys own star become dimOn the other hand the aspect of the sky and the attitude of the earth have been wholly bright in favor of Wei to a degree hard to state in wordsMoreover the lots have been cast and they gave the word Devil at the side has been sent there must be an inroad upon Han without word another lot Word in east light moves west two suns radiating as the air blows south These oracles gave two words which joined compose Xu two suns one on the other which is ChangThese signs are unmistakeable for when put together the whole reads Wei at Xuchang is to receive the abdication of Han If you consider Your Majesty must admit this All empty words and madness this talk of auguries and lotsIs it reasonable that I should suddenly abandon the great heritage for such nonsense Then Wang Lang said Wax and wane has been the law of all things from the beginning every period of glory is followed by one of obscurityHas any rule endured forever or any House never failedThe rule of Han handed down through four centuries to Yourself has lost its vigor and the time has come to yieldRetirement may not be delayed or confusion will ensue The Emperor wept aloud and retired to his private chamber while the officers left the hall laughingNext morning they assembled in the court but the Emperor did not appear So they sent the palace officers to request his presenceStill he feared to show himselfThe Empress Cao asked him Why do Your Majesty not hold the court as usual especially when you are requested to go out Because your brother wishes to depose me and become Emperor himselfHe has set the whole host of officers against me to force me to abdicate and I will not expose myself to this compulsion But what can have induced my brother to do such a dreadfully rebellious thing said she angrilyJust as she spoke Cao Hong and Cao Xiu both armed forced their way into the inner apartments and requested His Majesty to come to the Hall of Audience The Empress broke out into abuseSo you are two of the disorderly rebels who for the sake of your own ends have conspired to upset all the good service of my fatherThough he overshadowed the whole land yet he never dared to aspire to the sacred Throne But my brother who has only just succeeded him sets no bounds to his ambition and temerity and would usurp the ThroneHeaven will surely cut off his offspring She wept bitterly as she went away and the attendants sobbed and wept tooBut Cao Xiu and Cao Hong still urged the Emperor to go to the Hall of Audience and at last he had to yield There Hua Xin took up the question againYour Majesty should act as was advised yesterday and so avoid any misfortune The Emperor sobbed All of you have eaten of the bounty of Han for years and among you are many whose fathers and grandfathers were conspicuous for meritHow can you bring yourselves to act thus improperly toward me If Your Majesty refuses to follow advice I fear that there will soon be trouble in the familyReally we are not disloyal Who would dare to murder me cried the EmperorEveryone knows that Your Majesty lacks the happy attributes of a successful ruler and that is why there is so much confusion in the countryIf it was not for the presence of the Prince of Wei in your court many a man would murder youYour Majesty has never yet learned how to treat people is your sole desire to set people against you The Emperor alarmed at the violence of his language shook out his sleeves and rose to go awayThen Wang Lang glanced at Hua Xin who rushed forward and seized the Emperor by the sleeve Is it consent or not cried he angrilyOne word The Emperor was dumb with terrorWhere is the Keeper of the Seal shouted Cao Hong and Cao Xiu drawing their swordsThe Keeper of the Seal is here said Zu Bi stepping calmly to the frontThey tried to force the seal from him but he cried The Seal belongs to the Emperor and I will not yield it Cao Hong called up the executioners and told them to behead him which they didZu Bi abused the ruffians to the last breathDethroned by wicked traitors was the ruling House of Han They falsely claimed as precedent the deeds of Yu and TangThe crowd of officers at court were all on Cao Pis side Save one Zu Bi the Keeper of the Seal and loyally he diedThe Emperor was in a state of abject terror and when he saw the whole court filling up with armed guards all the soldiers of Wei and so enemies he burst into tearsYes I will give up the throne to the Prince if haply I may be spared to live out the few years Heaven has assigned me wailed heThe Prince will always take care of Your Majesty said Jia XuIt would be as well to prepare the abdication manifesto quickly so as to preserve tranquillity Such a hint could not be missed and Chen Qun was directed to draft the documentAs soon as it was finished Hua Xin followed by a host of officers took it off to the palace and presented it with the Imperial Hereditary Seal in the name of the EmperorVery joyfully Cao Pi read this writingDuring the whole of my thirtytwo years of reign the land has been in a state of turmoil but the spirits of my ancestors have preserved me in the midst of dangerNow from the signs of the heavens and the hearts of the people I see that the virtue of the Hans is exhausted and happy fortune has devolved upon the House of Wei as may be seen from the success in war enjoyed by the late King Cao and the resplendent virtue of the present Prince which answers to the timesBy all noble principles the empire is no private possession but a public trustWherefore the great King Yao to his eternal glory passed over his own son How I admire this deedNow in imitation thereof I have resolved to abdicate in favor of my Chief Minister the Prince of Wei who will not I hope disappoint my wishes Cao Pi heard this and was going to accept it as finalBut Sima Yi said noAlthough the declaration and the seal have been sent yet decorum demands refusal at first so as to silence peoples criticism Then Wang Lang drafted a memorial modestly declining the proposal of succession on the ground of unfitness and asking that some other be soughtWhen this reached the Emperor he was much perturbed and asked what was to be done nextReplied Hua Xin When his father was offered a princedom he declined thrice but he finally accepted Wherefore Your Majesty should renew the offerThe Prince will end by acceptance There was no help for it and so Huan Jie was bidden to draft another declaration of offer which was sent by the hand of the Officer of the Dynastic Temple Zhang Yin together with the emblems and the seal This new declaration read thus To the Prince of Wei You have sent your modest refusal of our offer to abdicateBut I have long since seen that the virtue of Han is passing and I could only rely upon the late Prince your father who virtuously undertook the great task of removing the evil oppressors and purging the land Now his son Cao Pi has succeededHis perfect virtue is resplendent his fame universal and his benevolence is wafted to all partsThe divine choice rests upon himIn the days of old Yao the Great would abdicate and did so in favor of Shun who possessed merit after his twenty accomplishments and the Godking Shun in the same manner handed the Throne to Yu after he had labored to control the floodwatersThe House of Han succeeded in the course of ages to the work of Yao and now passes on the sacred trust to promote the repose of the Earth and manifest the command of Heaven By the hand of the Minister Zhang Yin this is sent with the emblems and the seal Greatly rejoicing Cao Pi received thisBut he said to Jia Xu Although I have received two such declarations yet I fear that I may not escape being branded as a usurper by posterity That is easily arranged replied Jia XuDirect Zhang Yin to take the seal back again and tell Hua Xin to cause the Emperor to set up a Terrace of Abdication and select an auspicious day for the ceremonyThen assemble all the officers at the terrace and cause the Emperor to offer the seal with his own hands and surrender the empire to youThus can you dissipate all doubts and prevent any caviling So the seal was once more rejected with a memorial to say soZhang Yin returned and the Emperor inquired of the courtiers how he was to understand this actThen Hua Xin said Your Majesty can set up a Terrace of Abdication and assemble nobles officers and common people to witness the act of abdicationThereafter the descendants of your House shall receive favor at the hands of Wei The Emperor consented and sent officials in the Office of Imperial Ceremonies to select a site at FanyangAnd there they built a terrace of three stories and they chose an auspicious day of the tenth month for the act of abdicationOn the appointed day Emperor Xian requested Cao Pi to ascend the terrace and receive his abdication At the foot of the terrace stood the officials more than four hundred and the Imperial Guards and the Tiger Guards and soldiers to the number of three hundred thousand Thereupon the Emperor presented the seal which Cao Pi received into his handsThen all those about the terrace knelt to listen to the reading of the manifesto To the Prince of WeiIn days of old Yao yielded the empire to Shun and Shun in turn gave it to Yu The will of Heaven does not follow the way of mortals but seeks the virtuousThe rule of Han has lost its virility and the times are out of jointWhen my turn came to rule great disorder arose and evils stalked abroad till the empire was in danger of subversionI trusted to the military genius of the late Prince of Wei to restore order and purge away the evil whereby to ensure tranquillity to my HouseWhat could my single hand do to correct this and ensure peace for my Nine DomainsThe present Prince has succeeded to his father he is also resplendent in virtue capable as Wu the Military King and Wen the Scholar King of the great task brilliant in the glory of his fatherThe spirit of the empire is upon him gods and humans declare his worthTo him be the bright reward and let him accept this mandate For all say his capabilities fit him to stand beside YuAs did my great predecessor I respectfully retire that you may be set upThe revolution of Heaven brings the glory upon your person and you will accept the high office and comfort all people by reverently obeyingthe decree of Heaven The reading finished the Prince of Wei Cao Pi proceeded to the terrace and ascended to the place of the EmperorThen Jia Xu at the head of the great concourse of officers came to the foot of the terrace and a court was heldThe year of reign was changed from Prolonged Wealth the First Year to Yellow Dawn the First Year  and the government became that of Great WeiAn edict was then published proclaiming a general amnesty and the title of Founder of the Dynasty was conferred upon the late Prince Cao CaoThen said Hua Xin As heaven has but one sun so the people can have but one rulerThe Hans have abdicated and it is fitting that they withdraw to a distanceI pray for an edict naming the place of residence of the Liu family Taking the late Emperor by the arm Hua Xin led him forward and made him kneel below the terrace to hear the commandThen the new Emperor Pi conferred upon him the title of Duke of Shanyang bidding him depart forthwithThereupon Hua Xin drew his sword and in a harsh voice said It is an old rule that the setting up of one Emperor means the degradation of anotherNow through the gracious kindness of His Majesty you are spared personal injury and created a dukeProceed at once and return not to court without express command The late Emperor Xian controlled his emotion thanked the Emperor Pi for his clemency and left on horsebackBut those who saw the departure could not help a feeling of pity for himSaid Cao Pi to his courtiers Now I understand the story of Shun and Yu Then they all shouted O ruler may thy life be eternal The ruling policy of Han had failed them Dangers pressed in upon the House And the land they had held so long Passed from them foreverLittle thought he who then snatched their scepter That the precedent he then claimed Would be used in due time by another To justify the destruction of his own HouseThe officials then requested Cao Pi to make a solemn declaration to Heaven and Earth which he did with humble obeisanceBut at this moment a sudden storm burst whirling up the dust and rolling along stones till no one could see the face of his neighborAll the lights on the terrace were extinguished The newly enthroned Emperor was terrified and fell prostrate He was borne away unconsciousWhen he revived he was assisted into the palace but for many days he was too ill to hold a courtWhen he had somewhat recovered he met his courtiers and received their felicitationsHe rewarded Hua Xin who had taken so active and prominent a part in the late scenes with the post of Minister of Instruction and Wang Lang with that of Minister of WorksAll the officers were advanced in rankBut as his recovery was slow he began to think there was too much witchcraft about the palaces at Xuchang and left it for Luoyang where he erected a large palace complexThe tale of these doings reached Chengdu and caused great grief to the Prince of Hanzhong for it was told him the late Emperor had been put to death He issued an order for mourning to be worn and instituted sacrifices and he conferred the posthumous title of Emperor Xian the Filial on the late EmperorThis worry brought on an illness so that he could not transact the business of the court which was left in the hands of Zhuge LiangThen Zhuge Liang and some of his colleagues took counsel one with another saying The empire cannot be one single day without its ruler wherefore we desire that our Prince should be honored with the title of Emperor Qiao Zhou said There have been auspicious indicationsA yellow vapor has been seen in the northwest of Chengdu rising to the clouds and the star of emperor has greatly increased in splendor and shined like the moonThese signs mean that our Prince is to become Emperor in succession to the House of HanThere can be no doubt Whereupon Zhuge Liang and Xu Jing at the head of a large number of officers presented a memorial requesting the Prince to assume the title of Emperor But Liu Bei objectedO Nobles do you desire to set my feet in the way of disloyalty and wrongdoing Not so said Zhuge LiangBut Cao Pi has usurped the Throne while you are a scion of the HouseIt is right and proper that you succeed and prolong the line But the Prince suddenly showed anger saying Can I imitate the deeds of such a rebel He rose and left the chamber going to his own apartmentsSo the officials dispersedBut three days later Zhuge Liang again led a deputation to the court and they requested that the Prince should come forth and hear themHe came and they all prostrated themselvesXu Jing spoke The late Emperor of the Hans has been slain by Cao PiYou O Prince will fail both in loyalty and rectitude if you do not assume the succession and destroy the wrongdoersThe whole empire requests you to rule that you may avenge the death of the late Emperor and the people will be disappointed if you do not accede to their wishes The Prince replied Although I am descended from the grandson of Emperor Myers I have not been of the least advantage and if I assumed the title of Emperor how would that act differ from usurpation Zhuge Liang pleaded with him again and again but the Prince remained obdurateThen Zhuge Liang bethought that where argument failed a ruse might succeed So having arranged the parts his several colleagues were to play he pleaded illness and remained at homePresently it was told the Prince that his advisers condition was becoming serious wherefore Liu Bei went to see him as he lay on his couch What illness affects you my CommanderinChief asked Liu BeiMy heart is sad like unto burning and I shall soon die What is it that causes you such grief But Zhuge Liang did not replyAnd when the question was repeated again and again he said nothing but just lay with his eyes closed as if he was too ill to speakThe Prince however pressed him to reply and then with a deep sigh he said Great Prince from the day I left my humble cottage to follow you you have always listened to my words and accepted my advice and now this western domain the whole of the two Lands of Rivers is yours just as I said it would beBut this usurpation of Cao Pi means the annihilation of the Hans and the cessation of their sacrifices wherefore my colleagues and I desired you to become Emperor in order to crush this upstart Wei and restore the Hans We all worked for this end never thinking that you would refuse so obstinately to accede to our wishesNow the officers are all annoyed and they will drift away before very longIf you are left alone and Wu and Wei come to attack it will be difficult for you to hold on to what you haveDo you not think this sufficient reason for me to feel grieved Unless I refused the whole land would blame me and I am afraid replied the PrinceQuoting Confucius the Teacher Zhuge Liang replied If names be not correct language is not in accordance with the truth of things In other words if one be not really straight people will not speak of one favorably O Prince you are straight and people speak of you favorably What more is there to sayYou know when Heaven offers and you refuse you are certainly to blame When you have recovered it shall be done said the PrinceUp leapt Zhuge Liang from his bed tapped at the screen in front of a doorway and in rushed a number of high officers who prostrated themselves crying So you have consentedO Prince Then choose the day for the ceremony They were all the most trusted of his court Imperial Guardian Xu Jing General Who Brings Peace to Han Mi Zhu Lord of Qingyi Xiang Ju Lord of Yangquan Liu Bao Deputy Governor Zhao Zuo First Secretary Yang Hong Counselor Du Qiong Secretary Zhang Shuang Minister Lai Gong Minister He Zong Doctorate Scholar Yin Mo Minister Qiao Zhou Commander Yin Chun Commander Zhang Yi Doctorate Scholar Yi Ji Counselor Qin Mi and many othersThe Prince was greatly startled and said You are committing me to doing what is dishonorable But Zhuge Liang said Since consent has been given let a terrace be built and a day chosen for the great ceremony The Prince was escorted back to his palace and Academician Xu Ci and Minister Meng Guang were told off to see to the building of the terrace south of ChengduAnd when all was ready a great concourse of officers solemnly escorted the Prince seated in a carriage of the imperial pattern to the ground prepared and he went up to the altar and performed the appointed sacrifice This done the solemn announcement was read in a loud voiceOn this twelfth day of the fourth month of the year of the Rebuilt Tranquillity Era Liu Bei the Emperor makes this solemn announcement to Heaven and Earth The dynasty of Han has possessed the empire for years without endFormerly Wang Mang rebelled against his sovereign and Liu Xiu the Founder of Later Han rose in his wrath and put him to death thus restoring the prerogatives of the great sacrifices to him who rightly exercised themLately Cao Cao powerful and cruel slew the Empress and his crimes cry aloud to Heaven for vengeanceHis son Cao Pi carrying evils into every quarter then seized the scepterMy subordinates regarding the dynasty as having been overthrown think it fitting that I Liu Bei would continue the line As successor to my two warrior ancestors Liu Bang and Liu Xiu I will punish as Heaven decreesFearing lest my virtue be inadequate to the Imperial Throne I consulted the voices of the people and all even the most distant have said that the mandate of Heaven may not be disobeyed and the great task of my ancestors may not continue in the hands of another the land must have a lord and they aver the cynosure of all eyes is myselfNow I respecting the mandate of Heaven and fearing lest the great achievements of Liu Bang and Liu Xiu may be overthrown have reverently selected this auspicious day to ascend the altar sacrifice and announce my assumption of the Imperial Seal in order to comfort all the people rejoice the ancestors of the Dynastic House and bring eternal tranquillity to all the domains When the reading was ended and the sacrifice and the prayer Zhuge Liang in the name of all those assembled presented the Imperial SealThe Prince received it in both hands laid it upon the altar and again declined acceptance saying I Liu Bei am unfitted I pray that another more able may be chosen But Zhuge Liang said Our lord has settled the empire and his merits are manifest to the whole world Moreover he is of the Dynastic Family and it is fitting that he succeedNow that the great announcement has been made such selfabnegation is impossible So all the officers shouted Eternal life to the Emperor And they did obeisanceThen the style of the reign was announced to be Manifest Might the First Year The Lady Wu was declared Empress and the eldest son Liu Shan was declared HeirApparentThe second son Liu Yung was made Prince of Lu and the third son Liu Li Prince of Liang Zhuge Liang became Prime Minister and Xu Jing Imperial GuardianMany others were promoted and a general amnesty was proclaimed so that there was great rejoicing throughout all the length and breadth of the two Lands of RiversNext day the first court was held and after the ceremonial prostration and when they were all arranged in due order the First Ruler made a pronouncement In the Peach Garden I and my brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei pledged ourselves to live and die togetherUnhappily my brother Guan Yu came to his end at the hands of Sun Quan of Wu and I must avenge him lest I fail to fulfill the oath Therefore will I devote the whole force of my kingdom to the destruction of Wu and the capture of its rebellious chief whereby to wipe away my reproach But just as he closed this oration an officer threw himself down at the foot of the throne crying It may not be so All eyes turned to this man he was Zhao YunDire vengeance will I wreak so cried the King His minister replied Do no such thing What arguments were used will appear in the next chapterCHAPTER Eager For Vengeance Zhang Fei Is Assassinated Athirst Of Retribution The First Ruler Goes To War Zhao Yun was opposed to the attempt to fight Wu and spoke against the planThe real rebel was not Sun Quan but Cao Cao and now it is his son who has usurped the Imperial Throne and called forth the anger of gods and menYou should first aim at the inside by camping on the River Wei from which to attack the rebel After that the rightthinking sort on the east of the Passes will do their utmost to help youIf you leave River Wei out of consideration in order to fight Wu your military force will be engaged and could you disengage it quickly in case of necessityIt is worth reflection The First Ruler replied Sun Quan slew my brotherFurthermore Fu Shiren Mi Fang Pan Zhang and Ma Zhong are on his side all of whom I hate so much that I could eat their flesh with gusto and devour their relatives whereby I should have my vengeanceWhy Noble Sir do you obstruct me Because the enmity against Cao Cao is a public matter vengeance for the manner of your brothers end is privateThe empire should be placed first What care I for myriads of square miles of territory as long as my brother is unavenged So Zhao Yuns remonstrance was disregarded and orders went forth to prepare an army against WuThe First Ruler also sent into the Five Valleys to borrow the aid of fifty thousand of tribesmenHe sent a messenger to Langzhong conferring on Zhang Fei the rank of General of Chariots and Cavalry and the title of Lord of Xiliang Zhang Fei became also Governor of LangzhongWhen Zhang Fei heard the tidings of Guan Yus death at the hands of Sun Quan he wept very bitterly day and night so that his raiment was soaked with his tearsHis subordinates tried to cheer him with wine but he overdrank and this increased his illhumor which he vented on any offender in his campSome of his people even died under the lashEvery day he gazed southward grinding his teeth with rage and glaring He wept and groaned without ceasing Then a messenger was announcedHe was summoned immediately and Zhang Fei at once tore open and read his dispatchesWhen Zhang Fei read the edict he accepted his new rank in all humility bowing northward toward the imperial mandate Then he gave a banquet to the messengerHe said My enmity for the death of my brother is deep as the seaWhy do not the officers at the court propose an avenging expedition The messenger replied Most of them favor first the destruction of Wei Wu is to follow What sort of talk is this cried Zhang Fei angrilyWhen we three swore brotherhood in the Peach Garden we pledged ourselves to die together Now alasmy brother has perished by the way and can we enjoy wealth or honors without him I must see the Son of Heaven and pray to be allowed to lead the vanI will wear mourning and in that garb I will smite Wu and capture the bandit that rules there Sun Quan shall be sacrificed to my brothers manes in virtue of our oath Zhang Fei accompanied the messenger to Capital ChengduIn the meantime the First Ruler had been training his armies Day after day he went to the drill ground and he decided upon a day to start and he would accompany the expeditionThereupon a number of courtiers went to the palace of the Prime Minister to talk with Zhuge Liang trying to get this intention modified They said It is not in accordance with the importance due to the Emperors position that he should go in personal command of this army particularly as he has but lately assumed his throneYou Sir hold the weighty post of adviser in such a matter and why do you not dissuade him I have done so most sincerely and repeatedly but he will not listenBut now you all come with me to the drill ground and we will try once more So they proceeded thither with Zhuge Liang at their head and he said Your Majesty has but lately taken the imperial seatIf the expedition was one to march northward to destroy the rebels against Han and in the interest of rectitude it would be perfectly correct for the Emperor to lead the army but an officer of high rank should more properly be sent against WuWhy should Your Majesty expose yourself to such fatigues The First Ruler was touched by the depth of his ministers concern and the sincerity of his counsel and was on the point of yielding when the arrival of Zhang Fei was announcedZhang Fei was immediately summoned and came to the pavilion on the drill ground where he threw himself on the ground and clasped the First Rulers feet weeping bitterlyThe First Ruler joined in the lamentationYour Majesty is now ruler and too quickly forgets the oath in the Peach Garden why is our brothers death not avenged The First Ruler replied Many officers dissuade me from such a course I cannot act rashly What do others know of our oathIf Your Majesty will not go then let me sacrifice myself to avenge our brotherIf I cannot then would I rather die and see your face no more Then will I go with you said the First RulerBring your own troops from Langzhong and I will bring my veterans to meet you at JiangzhouWe will both attack Wu and wipe out the reproach As Zhang Fei rose to take leave the First Ruler said to him I know that your weakness for wine leads you astray and you become very cruel in your cups and hog your people and keep the beaten ones near you They may be dangerous and it is certainly the road to misfortuneNow you must be more kindly and not give way to passion as before Thus admonished Zhang Fei said farewell and leftSoon after when the First Ruler was preparing to march out the High Minister Qin Mi memorialized saying That Your Majesty the Lord of a Myriad Chariots should risk his person in what is not the way of perfect rectitude is not what the ancients would have doneI pray that this may be reflected upon But the First Ruler replied Guan Yu and I were as one body and the way of perfect rectitude is hereHave you forgotten But the officer remained at his feet and said I fear disaster if Your Majesty disregards your servants words The First Ruler replied angrily Why do you use such bad words when I desire to march He bade the executioners thrust forth and put to death the bold speaker Still Qin Mis face showed no sign of fearHe only smiled saying I die without regret It is a pity that this newly established state should be overturned ere it be well begun Other officials interceding the death punishment was remitted but the faithful officer was committed to prisonYour fate will be decided when the army of vengeance return said the First RulerZhuge Liang sent up a memorial in favor of Qin Mi sayingI Zhuge Liang address Your Majesty in my own name and those of my colleagues we regard as most grievous the recent eventsWus perfidy by which Jingzhou was lost the star of a great general was brought down and the pillar holding the sky was broken and we shall never forgetBut it is to be remembered that the crime of overturning the Throne of Han rests on Cao Cao and the fault of driving away the Liu Family lies not on Sun QuanWe venture to think that the destruction of Wei would involve the submission of Wu wherefore we beg consideration of the valuable words of Qin MiThus the army will be spared needless exertion and occasion given to make other plans for the prosperity of the Throne and the happiness of the people But having listened to the memorial the First Ruler threw it to the floor saying I have decided and no remonstrance should be raised Then he appointed the Prime Minister to take care of his son and the two Lands of RiversThen the Generals of the Flying CavalryMa Chao and Ma Dai together with the General Who Defends the North Wei Yan were ordered to guard Hanzhong against WeiThe Tiger General Zhao Yun was to be in reserve and to control the supplies Huang Quan and Cheng Ji were made Counselors Ma Liang and Chen Zhen Recorders Huang Zhong the van leader assisted by the Marching Generals Feng Xi and Zhang Nan Fu Tong and Zhang Yi Marching Commanders of the Center Army Zhao Rong and Liao Chun the rear guardsThe whole army including the borrowed foreign troops numbered seven hundred fifty thousand and highrank officials amounted several hundred And the tiger day of the seventh month of the first year of Manifest Might was selected as the most propitious day for the startAs soon as Zhang Fei had got back to his post he issued orders that his soldiers should be ready to march in three days and the whole body was to be in mourning white uniforms and whitened armsJust after the order appeared two generals named Fan Jiang and Zhang Da came to their chief saying The time allowed is insufficient to make white flags and armors Pray give us more time General I am hot to avenge my brother said Zhang FeiMy only regret is that I cannot reach the miserable wretchs country tomorrowDo you dare to disobey my order Zhang Fei called in the lictors had the two officers bound to trees and ordered each to receive fifty lashesAt the close of the flogging he said Now you will be ready tomorrow if you are not I will put you to death as an example The two generals returned to their place spitting blood and hot with anger and they said one to another We have been beaten today what about tomorrowThis mans temper is unbearable and if things are not ready we shall suffer death Suppose we slay him suddenly said Zhang Da since if we do not he will kill us But how can we get near him If we are to have a chance to live he will get drunk and go to bed if we are to die he will remain sober They made all their arrangements for the crime That day Zhang Fei was greatly disturbed in his mind and restlessHe told some of his subordinates saying I feel nervous and creepy and shivery and cannot not restWhat does it mean This is due to too much brooding over the loss of your brother said theyThen Zhang Fei bade them bring in wine and he drank with his officers Presently he became quite intoxicated and lay down on a couch in his tentMeanwhile the two assassins had followed all his doings and when they knew he was lying on his couch intoxicated and incapable they went into the tent each armed with a watersharp dagger They got rid of the attendants by saying they had confidential matters to talk about and so got into the inner roomsBut even then they dared do nothing for Zhang Fei slept always with open eyelids and he lay on his couch as if still awakeHowever huge snores soon convinced them that their victim really slept and they crept to the side of the couchThen both stabbed simultaneously deep into the body Zhang Fei uttered one cry and lay stillSo he died at the hand of assassins at the age of fiftyfive years He who whipped the inspector in Anxi Who swept vile rebels from the land of Han And thereby won great glory for the Lius Whose valor shone at Tiger Trap Pass Who turned the tide of victory at Long Slope Bridge Who freed Yan Yan and thus won a friend That helped him and his brothers conquer Shu Whose wisdom defeated Zhang He to get Hanzhong Is dead the victim of assassins blowsNot his avenge his brothers death on Wu Langzhong will grieve him all the ages through Having done their victim to death the two murderers hacked off his head and made off for the country of Wu without loss of time and when the deed was known they had got too far for captureThe assassination was reported in a memorial by a commander of Zhang Fei named Wu Ban who had left Jingzhou to see the First Ruler and then had been sent to serve under Zhang FeiHe wrote a memorial to the First Ruler and bade the eldest son Zhang Bao prepare a coffin for the remainsAfter the ceremony leaving his younger brother Zhang Shao to hold Langzhong Zhang Bao went to see the EmperorThe day of departure had already come and the First Ruler had left the capitalZhuge Liang and many officers had escorted him out of the city for three miles and taken leaveReturning to Chengdu Zhuge Liang felt ill at ease and he remarked to his colleagues If Fa Zheng had been alive he would have been able to interdict this expedition One night the First Ruler felt nervous and shuddered from time to timeHe could not sleep so he went out of his tent and looked up at the starsSuddenly he saw a bright meteor fall in the northwest and began to wonder what the portent meantHe sent at once to ask Zhuge Liang to tell him Zhuge Liang sent back the replyThis means the loss of a great leader and there will be bad news in a few days So the army was halted and did not marchThen the arrival of a message from Wu Ban of Langzhong was announcedThe First Rulers foreboding increased and he stamped his foot saying AlasMy other brother is gone Opening the letter he found it was indeed soAs he read the news of the assassination he uttered a loud cry and fell in a swoonHe was raised and presently they brought him back to lifeNext day they reported a body of horsemen comingThe First Ruler went out of the camp to look at them and presently saw a young general dressed all in white armor sweeping forth in quite a terror The First Ruler recognized that was Zhang BaoAs soon as he reached the First Rulers presence he dismounted and bowed to the earth weeping My father has been killed by Fan Jiang and Zhang DaThey have gone over to Wu taking my fathers head with them The news was very grievous and the First Ruler burst into tears and even refused foodHis officers remonstrated saying Now Your Majesty has the loss of two brothers to avenge and you must not destroy yourself So after a time he began to eat and drink and he then offered the leadership of the van to Zhang Bao saying Are you and Wu Ban willing to lead your troops to attack Wu and to avenge your father For my country or for my father I would shrink from no sacrifice said the young manJust as the force for the young mans leadership was being organized another party of horsemen approached also dressed in white armors This was a small force under Guan Xing son of Guan Yu The youth also threw himself to the ground and weptAt sight of him thoughts stirred in the First Rulers breast and he burst into tears Neither reason nor persuasion could stop them I think of the plain and simple days of long ago when we pledged ourselves one to the other Now I am Emperor How I should rejoice to share my good fortune with themBut they have met violent deaths and the sight of these two youths wrings my heart to the very core Young gentlemen please retire said the officers to the two youthful generals and let our Sacred One repose his dragon body They wentSaid the attendants Your Majesty is no longer young you are over sixty remember and it is not fitting that you give way to such extreme sorrow But my brothersdead wailed the First RulerHow can I live without them He broke into a fresh paroxysm and beat his head on the groundWhat can be done asked the officers one to another He is in such troubleHow can we comfort him Ma Liang said Sire it is bad for the army to spend whole days in wailing and tears when leading against the enemy And then Chen Zhen said There is a certain hermit living among the Blue Mountains near Chengdu who is said to be three hundred years old He is called Li Yi and people say he is a seerLet us tell His Majesty and let him send for this old man that he may know what the future may have in storeIt will have more weight than anything we can say They went to the First Ruler and told him he agreed to summon the seer and sent Chen Zhen with the command Soon the messenger reached the town near the hills and asked the people where the prophet dweltThey led him far into a secluded valley like a fairy village very unlike any ordinary spotSoon a lad came to receive the visitorYou are surely Chen Zhen Chen Zhen was startled that the lad knew him and still more so at the familiar address and said O superhuman boy how do you know my name so well Last evening my master told me that a messenger with an imperial command would come today and mentioned your name Truly he is more than wise said Chen Zhen and people have not believed him So the two proceeded to the old mans abode and Chen Zhen declared his errandThe old man said he was too aged to travelBut the Emperor anxiously desires to see you face to face if haply you would not mind making the effort In the end and after much persuasion the old fellow consented and wentThe First Ruler received him affably surprised at the contrast between his hoary head and fresh boyish complexion The venerable one had blue eyes with square and sparkling pupils His carriage was erect and he stood straight as a pine tree This is no common man thought the First Ruler and he treated him with distinguished courtesyThe seer said I am but an old man of the barren hill country without learning or wisdom you shame me O Emperor by calling me and I know not why I and my two brothers both now deceased swore a mutual oath some thirty years ago Both have gone both by violent deathsI would lead a great army to avenge them and wish to know how the expedition will endHearing that you Venerable Sir are learned in the deeper mysteries I sent for you and beg you to tell me But this is fate it is not for an old man like me to know But the First Ruler pressed him to say However the aged one got paper and a brush and wroteSoldiers horses weaponsagain and again on many sheets of paper Having done this he suddenly tore them into fragmentsFurther he drew a picture of a tall man lying supine and another above him digging a grave And over all he wrote White After this he bowed and departed leaving the First Ruler annoyedThis is only a demented man what he says is not worthy of confidence said the First RulerAnd he burned the paper Then he ordered an advance at full speedZhang Feis son Zhang Bao came in saying Wu Ban and his army have come I pray that I may be appointed to lead the van The First Ruler admired his noble intent and gave him a vanleaders sealBut just as he was attaching the seal to his girdle another youth boldly stepped forth and said Leave that seal to me It was Guan Xing son of Guan YuI have already received my commission said Zhang BaoWhat abilities have you for such a task cried Guan XingThat I have been training as a soldier since my boyhoodI can shoot and never miss I should like to see your prowess said the First Ruler that I may decide who is the better Zhang Bao ordered some of his people to set up a flag at a hundred paces and on the flag he drew a heart in redThen he took his bow and shot three arrows each of which went through the heartThose present commended the performanceThen Guan Xing seized his bow saying What is it to hit such a mark Just as he said this a flock of wild geese flew over his headI will hit the third of the flying geese said he He shot and the third fellFine cried all the assembly as one voice But Zhang Bao was enragedLeaping on his steed he seized the long octaneserpent halberd left him by his father crying Dare you try a real combat Guan Xing took up the challenge at onceHe sprang into the saddle took his great saber and galloped out You can use the spear think you that I cannot wield a sword cried heThe two impetuous youths were on the point of a battle when the First Ruler bade them hold Do not behave so badly cried heBoth dropped out of the saddle threw aside their weapons ran to his feet and begged pardonYoung men from the time I left my native place Zhuo and swore brotherhood with your fathers they were as my own flesh and bloodYou two are also brothers and you should help each other in vengeance rather than quarrel and disputeYou have lost the sense of rectitude while your fathers deaths are still recent and what will happen in future Both fell at his feet and implored forgivenessWhich of you two is the elder asked the First RulerI am the elder by a year said Zhang BaoThe First Ruler then bade Guan Xing bow to Zhang Bao as to an elder brother and there in front of all they broke an arrow as a pledge that each would always succor the otherThen the First Ruler issued a mandate appointing Wu Ban leader of the van and the two young men were enrolled as his own escortThe advance began on land and on water and they made a brave show as they moved against the land of WuIn the meantime the two assassins with the grim evidence of their deed duly reached Wu and told their story to the Marquis who received themThen Sun Quan said to his assembled officers Liu Bei has declared himself Emperor and is leading against us in person a great host of more than seven hundred thousand What shall we do for the danger is imminent They all turned pale and looked one at another Then Zhuge Jin spoke outI have been in your service these many years and have never justified the favor you have shown meI will risk my life and go to this Liu Bei of Shu that I may talk to him plainly and prove to him the advantages of friendship and alliance against Cao Pi This offer pleased Sun Quan who then appointed Zhuge Jin as his messenger to try to induce the First Ruler to keep the peaceMessengers pass when states are at wrangle May this one succeed and unravel this tangleWhat fortune attended this messenger will be related in the next chapter CHAPTER Sun Quan Submits To Wei Receiving The Nine Dignities The First Ruler Attacks Wu Rewarding Six Armies In the eighth month of the first year of Manifest Might  through the Kui Pass His advanced guard had gone beyond the Lands of Rivers when his attendants told him that Zhuge Jin had come as a messenger from Wu He told them not to admit himBut Huang Quan said His brother being your Prime Minister Zhuge Jin is certainly come on some important missionYour Majesty ought to see him and hear what he saysIf his proposals are admissible then agree if not he can be made use of to take knowledge of your intentions to Sun Quan and let Sun Quan know that you intend to punish his crime Then the First Ruler gave way and the messenger was brought inHe bowed down to the earthZhuge Jin you have come a long journey what is its object said the First RulerMy brother has long served Your Majesty I have come at the risk of my life to discuss Jingzhou affairsWhen Guan Yu was at Jingzhou my master repeatedly sought to ally the two families by marriage but was refusedWhen Guan Yu attacked Xiangyang Cao Cao wrote again and again urging my master to attack JingzhouBut the Marquis was unwilling and it was the enmity between your brother and Lu Meng that led to the attack and the unfortunate successMy master is now very sorry for it but it was Lu Mengs doingHowever Lu Meng is now dead and his enmity has died with himMoreover Lady Sun is always thinking over returning to youMy master now proposes to send back the lady to bind and hand over to you those officers who surrendered and to restore JingzhouIf the two houses swear perpetual amity then they may join forces against Cao Pi and punish his usurpation To this harangue the First Ruler only replied You of Eastern Wu killed my brother yet you dare to come with your artful talk Zhuge Jin said I only wish to discuss the relative importance of the issuesYour Majesty is an Imperial Uncle and Cao Pi has seized the throne of your HouseYet you do not think of destroying the usurper but on the other hand you disregard the most honorable position in the world for the sake of a socalled brother a connection of another name Surely this is rejecting the chief for the subordinate the main issue for a detailThe Middle Land is the biggest part of the empire and the two capitals Luoyang and Changan are both famous as places whence the two one the Founder the other the Restorer of the Hans initiated their mighty task Your Majesty takes no thought of these but would dispute over Jingzhou in other words the important is abandoned for the worthlessAll the world knows of your assumption of the dignity of Emperor and that you will assuredly restore the Hans and rescue their territory only now you do not try to deal with Wei you only desire to attack Wu I venture to think you have made a bad choice All this argument only added fuel to the fireThe slayer of my brother shall not live in the same world as I You ask me not to fightI will cease when I have slain your masterWere it not for the sake of your brother I would behead you at onceAs it is you may go and you may tell your master to cleanse his neck ready for the blade of the executioner Zhuge Jin saw that the position was hopeless and took his leave to return to the South LandBut while Zhuge Jin had been absent Zhang Zhao said to Sun Quan He knows something of the strength of the armies of Shu and he made this mission of his an excuse to get out of dangerHe will not return The Marquis replied He and I are sworn friendsfriends to the deathI shall not wrong him nor will he betray meWhen he was at Chaisang and Zhuge Liang came to our country I wanted my friend Zhuge Jin to persuade his brother to remain with meHis reply was that his brother would not remain any more than he himself would go each would be faithful to his saltThat was quite clear enough How could he desert me after thatOur friendship has something of the divine in it and no talk from outside can sow dissension between us Even as Sun Quan spoke the servants told him that Zhuge Jin had returnedWhat do you think now said Sun Quan Zhang Zhao retired overwhelmed with shameThe luckless messenger unfolded his tale of failureThen the South Land is in great danger said Sun Quan as he heard the storyBut a certain man here interposed saying I have a way out of the difficulty He was Counselor Zhao ZiWhat good scheme do you propose friend Zhao Zi said Sun QuanLet my lord draw up a document which I will take to Cao Pi in Wei making a full statement of the case and get him to attack Hanzhong and so draw off the danger from our land Though the suggestion is good yet shall we not lose something of our dignity by that said Sun QuanIf there is any such thing I will simply jump into the riverI could not look the South Lands people in the face again Sun Quan was satisfied and composed the memorial styling himself Minister Therein Zhao Zi was duly appointed messengerHe took the document and soon reached Capital Xuchang where he first sought out the High Minister Jia Xu and then saw the othersNext day Jia Xu stood forth one day at court and said Eastern Wu has sent a high officer Zhao Zi with a memorial Because he wants the armies of Shu driven off said Cao Pi smiling and as if completing the sentenceBut he summoned Zhao Zi who having prostrated himself in the outer court handed in his memorialAfter reading it Cao Pi said What sort of an overlord is the Marquis Intelligent clearsighted wise brave and perspicacious was the replyCao Pi laughed Your praise is none too enthusiastic I do not wish to overstate replied Zhao Zi but my master has shown various qualities at different timesHe made use of Lu Su among the officials of high ranks which shows his intelligenceHe chose Lu Meng as leader of all armies which showed his clearsightednessHe captured Yu Jin but did not hurt him which shows his kindlinessHe took Jingzhou without slaughter which shows his wisdomHe maintains the Three Rivers so as to command the respect of the empire which shows his boldnessLastly he bows before Your Majesty which shows his perspicacityYou see now that my epithets are justifiable Is he at all learned Sire remember he commands a large fleet of ten thousand battleships and a huge army of million armored soldiers He endeavors to find wise and capable people to help him and his mind is full of plans and projectsWhen he has a little leisure he reads the histories and the annals for the sake of the general lessons to be learned therefromHe is no dryasdust pedant seeking remarkable passages and culling model sentences Do you think I could overcome Wu If a large state has military force to attack a small one has also preparations for defense Does Wu fear Wei How can you think so considering our army of million armored soldiers and the defensive moats we have in the River Han and the Great River How many such persons as high minister does Wu possess Nearly a hundred intelligent and specially qualified ministers like your servants of my sort of ordinary knowledge there are too many to reckon up Cao Pi sighed saying The book says Going on mission without losing the dignity of the master That is the sort of man you are Thereupon he issued the mandate ordering Xing Zhen Minister of Ceremonies and Sacrifices to be his ambassador to Wu bearing for Sun Quan the title of Prince of Wu and allowing him to use the Nine Signs of Honors But when the messenger had gone out of the city Liu Ye went to remonstrate saying Sun Quan has done this for fear of the armies of ShuIn my opinion if Shu and Wu fight heaven will make an end of one countryIf you will send an army across the river to attack and Shu attack at the same time Wu as a state will disappearIf Wu goes then Shu will be left alone and can be dealt with when you will But I cannot attack Sun Quan now that he has come over to my side It would prevent anyone else from doing soNo I will really accept his submissionIt is the best course Liu Ye said After all though talented he is but a General of the Flying Cavalry and Lord of Nanzhang of the decadent days of HanHis rank is low and his influence small yet he still wants to contest the Middle LandIf you promote him to princely rank he is only one step below yourself While doubting the reality of his submission you give him an exalted rank and increase his influenceSurely this is only giving wings to a tiger Not at all I am helping neither Wu nor ShuI am waiting till they are at grips and if one goes under there will be only one left to destroy That will be easyHowever say no more for I have decided Whereupon Xing Zhen was bidden to take the mandate and the Nine Dignities and accompany Zhao Zi to WuSun Quan assembled his officers to discuss how the armies of Shu could be driven offThen came the news of princely rank conferred by Wei and by the rules of courtesy the messenger bearing the edict should be met at a great distance from the capital Gu Yong was opposed to accepting the rank My lord you should style yourself Supreme Ruler and Lord of the nine territories you should not receive any rank from Wei But on one occasion Liu Bang received the princedom of Han  from Xiang Yu it depends upon the timesWhy refuse Sun Quan discussed the matter no more but went out at the head of a great gathering of officers to welcome the messengerXing Zhen the bearer of the mandate from Wei on first arrival comported himself haughtily as the representative of a superior country and an imperial ambassador And when he entered the city he did not descend from his carriage Wherefore Zhang Zhao ventured to rebuke him Everyone must obey the rules of courtesy as everyone must respect the lawsYou Sir are behaving proudly as if there was no such thing as a sword in this country Immediately the messenger descended from his chariot and was presented to Sun Quan Afterwards they went in side by sideAs the cavalcade proceeded a loud voice was heard in the rear of the two carriages crying Here we are prevented from risking our lives in smashing Wei and swallowing Shu and our lord receives a title from another manAre not such things shameful The man was Xu ShengAnd the messenger sighed saying If all the leaders and ministers of the South Land are like this the lord of the country will not long be content to obey another However the title was acceptedAnd when he had received the felicitations of his officers Sun Quan gave orders to collect beautiful works in jade and brilliant pearls which were sent to Wei as return gifts Not long after came tidings of the forces under the ruler of ShuThe First Ruler together with King Shamo Ke of the Mang nations leads his own army and a large number of tribesmen from the east and south furthermore he is aided by the two Han generals of Dongxi Liu Ning and Du Lu with their cohorts They advance both by land and by water a mighty host of which the shouting shakes the heavensThe naval force has already come out at Wukou and the land force has reached Zigui Although Sun Quan had been created a prince yet Emperor Pi would not send a relieve armyAnd when the news came the Prince of Wu asked present advice from his officers but there was none to help him they only muttered and were silentAh sighed heAfter Zhou Yu I had Lu Su and Lu Meng succeeded Lu SuBut now they have all three gone and there is no one to share my troubles But just then a very youthful general stepped out from the ranks of the officials and said with a lowly obeisance Though I am young I am not a little versed in the books of war and with a few legions I could destroy the power of Shu Sun Quan recognized Sun Huan the son of Yu HeSun Ce loved the youth and gave him his own family name of Sun and so made him a member of his own clanYu He had four sons of whom Sun Huan was the eldest He was an expert archer and horseman and had accompanied his protector in several campaigns where he had distinguished himself right well and had been given a rankAt this time he was twentyfiveHow do you think you can overcome them There are two able commanders under my command named Xie Jing and Li Yi both very braveWith a few legions I will capture Liu Bei Though you are brave nephew yet you are young and ought to have an assistant Thereupon Tiger General Zhu Ran stepped forward saying Let me go Sun Quan consented and he told off fifty thousand of soldiers and marines over whom he placed Sun Huan and Zhu Ran as joint commanders They were to start as soon as possibleThe scouts reported that the army of Shu was camped at Yidu and Sun Huan Commander of the Left led half his army to the borders of that county and camped in three stockadesNow the Shu General Wu Ban had received his seal as leader of the van From the day he left the borders of the Lands of Rivers he had had uninterrupted success Everyone had submitted at the mere rumor of his coming He had conducted his campaign with unstained swords as far as YiduWhen he heard that Sun Huan was camped there to oppose his progress he sent back rapid messengers to the First Ruler who was then at ZiguiThe First Ruler got angry saying So they think this youth is able to withstand me Since this nephew of Sun Quan has been made a leader said Guan Xing it is unnecessary to send a leader of high rank let me go I was just wishing to see what you could do said the First Ruler and he gave him orders to goJust as Guan Xing was leaving Zhang Bao stepped forth and asked permission to go tooThen both go my nephews said the EmperorBut you must be prudent and not hasty So they took leave collected their troops and advancedSun Huan hearing of the coming of a large army called out all his troops and drew up his arrayHis two famous generals Li Yi and Xie Jing were placed by the great standard They watched the soldiers of Shu filing out and noted two leaders in silver helmets and silver armors riding on white horses and the flags were white First came Zhang Bao with a long spear and then Guan Xing carrying a great saberSun Huan you tiny rascal your time has come cried Zhang Bao abusivelyHow dare you stand against the forces of Heaven Your father is a headless devil cried Sun Huan no way backward in reviling and you are going just now to join him dont you see Then Zhang Bao rode at Sun HuanFrom behind his chief Xie Jing dashed out to meet himThey fought nearly forty bouts and then Xie Jing ran away with Zhang Bao in pursuitWhen Li Yi saw his comrade overcome he whipped up his steed and came into the fray whirling his silvered battleaxZhang Bao fought twenty bouts with him but neither got the betterThen in the army of Wu a marching general named Tan Xiong seeing that his two comrades could not overcome Zhang Bao shot a treacherous arrow from the ranks and wounded Zhang Baos steedFeeling the pang of the wound the horse bolted back to its own side but fell before it reached it throwing its rider sprawling on the groundSeeing this Li Yi turned and rode toward the prostrate leader to slay him with his battleax But just as he was about to deliver his blow lo a red flash came between and his head rolled along the earth The red flash was Guan Xings great swordSeeing the horse fall and Li Yi coming up he had rushed in and dealt that fatal blow And he had saved Zhang Bao from deathThen they attacked and lay on so that Sun Huan suffered a great defeatThen each side beat the retreat and drew offNext day Sun Huan came out to offer battle again and the two cousins went forth togetherGuan Xing from horseback by the main standard challenged his enemySun Huan rode out fiercely and they two fought near thirty bouts But Sun Huan was not strong enough and drew off The two youths followed and reached his campWu Ban together with Feng Xi and Zhang Nan also launched another attackZhang Bao helped them with all his force and was the first to force his way into the ranks of Wu He came across Xie Jing whom he slew with a spear thrustThe soldiers of Wu scattered and fled and the victory was on the side of ShuBut Guan Xing was missingZhang Bao was desperate saying If something wrong happens to Guan Xing I will not live So he girded on his huge spear and rode far and wide seeking himPresently he met Guan Xing bearing his sword in his left hand while his right held a captiveWho is this asked Zhang BaoIn the melee I met an enemy cried Guan Xing and I took him prisoner Then Zhang Bao recognized Tan Xiong the man who had let fly the treacherous arrow that had brought down his horseThe two returned to camp where they slew their prisoner and poured a libation of his blood to the dead horseAfter this they drew up a report of the victory for the First RulerSun Huan had lost his generalsLi Yi Xie Jing and Tan Xiongas well as many other officers and many troops His army was too weakened to continue the campaign so he halted and sent back to Wu for reinforcementsThen Generals Zhang Nan and Feng Xi said to Wu Ban The power of Wu is broken let us raid their encampment But Wu Ban said Though so many have been lost there are many leftZhu Rans marine force is in a strong position on the river and is untouchedIf you carry out your plan and the marines land in force and cut off our retreat we shall be in difficulties That is easily met said Zhang NanLet each of the two leaders Guan Xing and Zhang Bao take five thousand troops and go into ambush in the valleys to guard against any such move I think it better to send some persons to pretend to be desertersLet them tell Zhu Ran of the plan to raid the camp and Zhu Ran will come to the rescue as soon as he sees fire Then the ambushing soldiers can attack him They thought this a fine plan and they made the necessary arrangementsHearing of the ill success and losses of his colleague Commander of the Right Zhu Ran was already thinking of going to his help when a few deserters appeared and hoarded his shipHe questioned them and they said We are Feng Xis soldiers and we have deserted because of unfair treatmentWe have a secret to tell What secret can you betray Tonight Feng Xi is going to make an attack upon General Sun Huans camp he thinks it is a good chance They are going to raise a fire as a signal Zhu Ran saw no reason to doubt the men and he sent off at once to tell Sun HuanBut the messenger never arrived as Guan Xing intercepted and slew him Then Zhu Ran deliberated upon going to helpYou cannot trust what those soldiers said said Cui Yu one of the commandersBoth army and navy will be lost if anything goes wrongNo General rather keep careful watch and let me go Zhu Ran saw this was the wiser plan so he gave Cui Yu ten thousand troops and Cui Yu leftThat night Wu Ban Zhang Nan and Feng Xi made an attack on Sun Huans camp from three directions and the soldiers were scattered and fled Then the three generals set the whole camp on fireCui Yu saw the flames as he marched and pressed onThen just as he was passing some hills he came upon the ambush and Guan Xing and Zhang Bao poured out from left and rightTaken by surprise Cui Yu could only try to flee but he met Zhang Bao who made him prisonerWhen Zhu Ran heard the news he was panicstricken and dropped downriver twenty milesThe remnant of Sun Huans troops ran away following their leader As they went Sun Huan inquired Is there any city ahead that has good defense and granary They told him saying To the north is Yiling where we can camp So they went thitherJust as they reached the wall their pursuers came up and the city was besieged in all four sidesGuan Xing and Zhang Bao brought the captive Cui Yu back to Zigui and saw the First Ruler who rejoiced at their success The prisoner was put to death and the soldiers were rewardedThe effect of these victories spread far so that the leaders in Wu had no inclination to fightWhen the Prince of Wu received Sun Huans call for help he was frightened and knew not what to do So he called a great council and he said Sun Huan is besieged in Yiling and Zhu Ran has been defeated on the river what can be done Then Zhang Zhao said Though several of your commanders are dead yet have you some left Half a score is enough to relieve your anxietySend Han Dang as Commander with Zhou Tai as his second Pan Zhang as Van Leader Ling Tong as Rear Guard Gan Ning in reserve You want one hundred thousand troops Sun Quan made the appointments as proposedGan Ning was very seriously ill just then but he accepted the taskNow the First Ruler had made a line of forty camps from Wukou and Jianping to Yiling spreading twentyfive miles of distanceHe was exceedingly pleased with his two nephews who had distinguished themselves again and again and he said The generals that have followed me since the early days have got aged and thus no longer a big useBut now that I have such two valorous nephews I have no fear for Sun Quan When he heard of the coming of Sun Quans army under Han Dang and Zhou Tai he wished to select a commander to oppose the Wu army Then those near him reportedHuang Zhong and a half dozen other officers have run off to Wu Huang Zhong is no traitor said the First Ruler smiling it is only that he heard what I happened to say about old and useless leadersHe will not confess he is old and wants to prove he is not Then he called Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and said to them Huang Zhong may fail in this enterprise of his so I hope you two will not mind going to his assistanceAs soon as there is some success to report get him to return and do not let him come to grief So the two got their troops together and went off to assist the aged warriorWhen young success is easy thine at will The aged servant fails though willing stillThe next chapter will relate the outcome of Huang Zhongs expeditionCHAPTER  Fighting At Xiaoting The First Ruler Captures An Enemy Defending The Three Gorges A Student Takes Supreme Command In spring the first month of the second year of Manifest Might  the veteran warrior Huang Zhong was among the officers who followed the First Ruler to war against WuWhen he heard his master talk of old and incapable leaders he girded on his sword and with a few faithful followers made his way to the camps at YilingHe was welcomed by Wu Ban the commander in charge of the siege there For what reason do you come O Veteran General asked heI have followed the Emperor ever since he left Changsha and I have done diligent serviceI am now over seventy but my appetite is still good for ten pounds of meat and I can still stretch the strongest bow and I can still ride five hundred miles without fatigue I am not weak or worn outBut our master has been talking of old and useless leaders and I am come to take part in the fight with WuIf I slay one of their leaders he will see I may be old but not worn out Just about that time the leading division of the Wu army drew near the campHuang Zhong hastily rose went out of the tent and mounted to go into the battleAged General be careful said the generals But Huang Zhong paid no attention and set off at full speedHowever Wu Ban and Feng Xi rode out to help himAs soon as he saw the array of the enemy he pulled up and challenged Commander Pan Zhang of the vanguardPan Zhang sent out one of his generals Shi Ji to take the challengeShi Ji despised his seed antagonist and rode lightly forth with his spear set but in the third bout Huang Zhong cut him downThis angered Pan Zhang who flourished the greendragon saber the great sword of the old warrior Guan Yu which had passed into his possession and took up the battleThese two fought several bouts and neither was victor for Huang Zhong was brimful of energyHis antagonist seeing that he could not overcome the old man galloped offHuang Zhong pursued and smote his army and scored a full victoryOn his way back Huang Zhong fell in with the two youthful generals Guan Xing and Zhang BaoWe come by the sacred command to aid you if necessaryAnd now that you have scored so complete a victory we pray you return to the main camp said they But the veteran would notNext day Pan Zhang came to challenge again and Huang Zhong at once acceptedNor would he allow Guan Xing and Zhang Bao to come with him or accept assistance from any otherHe led out five thousand troopsBefore many bouts had been exchanged Pan Zhang made a feint and got away Huang Zhong pursued shouting to him not to fleeFlee not for now will I avenge the death of Guan Yu cried heHuang Zhong pursued some ten miles but presently he fell into an ambush and found himself attacked from all sidesZhou Tai on the left Han Dang on the right Ling Tong from behind and the erstwhile flying Pan Zhang turned to attack the front so that Huang Zhong was surrounded and hemmed inHuang Zhong forced his way to retreat But suddenly a great storm came on the wind blowing violently and as Huang Zhong was passing some hills an enemy cohort led by Ma Zhong came down the slopes and one of the arrows wounded the veteran in the armpit He nearly fell from his horse with the shockThe soldiers of Wu seeing Huang Zhong wounded came on all together but soon the two youthful generals Guan Xing and Zhang Bao drove them off and scattered them Thus they rescued Huang Zhong He was taken back to the main campBut he was old and his blood was thin and the wound gaped wide so that he was near to dieThe First Ruler came to visit him and patted his back and said It is my fault O Veteran General that you have been hurt in the battle I am a soldier said the old manI am glad that I could serve Your MajestyBut now I am seventyfive and I have lived long enoughBe careful of your own safety for the good of the state These were his last wordsHe became unconscious and died that night A poem was written of himFirst among veterans stands Huang Zhong Who won great merit in the conquest of Shu Old he still donned his coat of mail And laid his hand to the curving bow His valor was the talk of all the North Fear of his might maintained the WestTardy he bowed his snowwhite head to death Fighting to the endin very truth a heroThe First Ruler was very sad when he heard of Huang Zhongs death and made him a grave in ChengduMy brave general is gone sighed he and the third of my five Tiger Generals and I have been unable to avenge their death it is very grievous So the Emperor led the Imperial Guard to Xiaoting where he summoned a great assembly He divided his forces into eight parts ready for an attack by land and waterThe marines were placed under Huang Quan and he himself led the land forcesIt was then the second month of the second yearWhen Han Dang and Zhou Tai heard that the army of Shu was approaching they marched toward it When near the two armies were arrayedThe two leaders of Wu rode out and saw the First Ruler riding out under the great standard with his staff about him A silken umbrella splashed with gold was over his head right and left were white banners golden axes and other insignia of an emperorThen Han Dang spoke Your Majesty is now Ruler of Shu why do you risk your life in the battlefieldIt would be most regrettable if any untoward event happened The First Ruler pointed the finger of scorn at the speaker and said You rats of Wu bereft me of my brother and I have sworn that you shall not live with me under the same sky Who dares plunge in among the enemy asked Han Dang turning to those in his trainThe Marching General Xia Xun set his spear and rode to the front and as he did so Zhang Bao with a roar galloped out to meet himBut this thunderous voice affrighted Xia Xun and he sought to fleeThen Zhou Tais brother Zhou Ping seeing that his colleague was panicstricken flourished his sword and rode out too At once Guan Xing dashed to the frontZhang Bao roared again and thrusting at Xia Xun and unhorsing himThis disconcerted Zhou Ping and enfeebled his defense so that Guan Xing speedily slew him with a slashThen the two youths rode furiously at Han Dang and Zhou Tai They sought refuge in their battle arrayThe tiger fathers have not begotten curs of sons said the First Ruler with a sigh of satisfactionThen he waved his whip as a signal to fall on and the Wu army suffered a great defeatThe Shu force of the eight divisions was irresistible as a river in flood and the slaughter was immenseGan Ning was in his ship ill but he roused himself when he heard the armies of Shu had come and mounted to go into the battle Soon he met a cohort of the Mang soldiers These warriors wore their hair loose and went barefoot Their weapons were bows and crossbows and long spears and swords and axes And they had shields to ward off blowsThey were led by their own King Shamo Ke His face was spotted with red as if splashed with blood and his eyes were green and big He rushed among Gan Nings troops wielding a spiked iron mace with bone pendants and he had two bows slung at his belt He was terrible to look uponGan Ning recognized that he had no chance of victory against such a man and did not engage Shamo Ke but turned his steed to fleeBut as Gan Ning fled Shamo Ke shot an arrow that pierced Gan Nings skullWounded as he was Gan Ning rode on to Fuchikou but there he dismounted and sat under a tree where he diedOn the tree were many hundreds of crows and they gathered round the corpse as if to protect the corpseThe Prince of Wu was sore grieved at the news of Gan Nings death and had the remains buried honorably Moreover he raised a temple in Fuchikou to Gan Nings memory Gan Ning was first of warriors in Wu With silken sails he stemmed the Great Rivers tide Right loyally he served his prince and true He made two ill friends put their hate asideLight horse led he by night a camp to raid And first he warmed his soldiers with generous wineIn his resting place the holy crows welcome guests And fragrant incense smolders at his shrineThis victory gave the First Ruler possession of XiaotingBut at the muster after the battle Guan Xing did not appearSearch parties were sent to find him and they went far and wide beating the country around However the dashing young soldier was only following in his fathers foeWhen Guan Xing had got in among the army of Wu he had caught sight of Pan Zhang his especial enemy and galloped in pursuitIn terror Pan Zhang took to the hills and disappeared in one of the valleysIn seeking him Guan Xing lost his way and went to and fro till it grew dark without finding a way outIt was clear moonlight Near midnight he came to a farm where he dismounted and knocked at the doorA venerable old man appeared and asked who he wasI am a leader of the army and I have lost my way I beg a meal for I am starving said Guan XingThe old man led him into a hall lit by many candles and there he saw in the family altar a picture of Guan YuAt once he began to wail and bowed before itWhy do you wail thus asked the old manThis is my father said Guan XingAt this the old man prostrated himself before his guestWhy should you treat my father with such respect asked Guan XingThis place is sacred to his honored spiritWhile he lived the people served him and now that he is a spirit should they not revere him the moreI have been waiting for the armies of Shu to avenge his death and it is indeed the great good fortune of the people that you have come Then the host brought forth wine and food and served his guest Moreover he unsaddled and fed his horseIn the third watch a knocking came at the door and when the old man opened it the visitor was no other than Pan Zhang the General of Wu He also asked shelterAs Pan Zhang came in Guan Xing recognized him and drew his sword crying Stay you ruffian Do not flee Pan Zhang turned and would have gone out but on the threshold suddenly appeared a figure of ruddy complexion with bright eyes and heavy eyebrows and a long flowing beard And it wore a green robe and golden armor and was armed with a huge swordPan Zhang shrank back for he recognized that was Guan Yu in spirit formHe uttered a shriek and became as one distraught but before he could turn Guan Xing raised his sword it fell and Pan Zhang lay deadTaking the heartblood of his dead enemy Guan Xing poured it in libation before the picture of his fatherAfter that he took possession of his fathers greendragon saber curved as the young moon Having hacked off the head of his fallen enemy he fastened it to his bridle Then he took leave of his aged host saddled his enemys horse and rode away toward his own campThe old man dragged the corpse of the dead commander outside and burned itGuan Xing had not gone very far when he heard the neighing of horses and soon met a troop led by Ma Zhong one of Pan Zhangs generals who was looking for his chiefMa Zhong fell into a great rage when he saw the head of Pan Zhang swinging at the neck of Pan Zhangs horse and Guan Xing beheld the famous sword in his handMa Zhong galloped up furiously and Guan Xing who recognized an enemy of his late father rushed to meet himJust as he would strike however Ma Zhongs troops galloped up to support their general and Guan Xing was surroundedHe was in dire danger but just opportunely came up a troop of horse led by his cousin Zhang BaoAt this Ma Zhong thinking discretion the better part drew off his army and rode away The two cousins pursued himBefore they had gone far they met another force under Mi Fang and Fu Shiren who had come out to seek Ma ZhongThe two bodies of soldiers met and fought but the troops of Shu were too few for victory and drew off Thence they made their way to headquarters in Xiaoting where they told their adventures and presented the head of Pan ZhangThe First Ruler was very pleased and rewarded all armed forcesMa Zhong went back and rejoined Han Dang and Zhou TaiThen they collected their troops many wounded and stationed them in various pointsMa Zhong together with Mi Fang and Fu Shiren marched to the river bank and encampedThe night they arrived many soldiers were groaning with the pain of their woundsMi Fang who was listening unknown to them heard one of them say We are Jingzhou soldiers and victims of Lu Mengs vile machinations If we had only remained under Liu Bei Now he is Emperor and has set out to destroy Wu and he will do it one dayBut he has a special grudge against Mi Fang and Fu ShirenWhy should we not kill these two and go over to ShuThey will think we have done well Another said Do not be hasty we will do it presently when there is a chance Mi Fang started as he heard thisHe told Fu Shiren saying The troops are mutinous and we ourselves are in dangerMa Zhong is an object of especial hatred to the Ruler of Shu suppose we kill him and surrenderWe can say we were compelled to give in to Wu but as soon as the news of the Emperor came near we wanted to get back It will not do said Fu Shiren If we go they will kill us No the Ruler of Shu is liberal and kind And the heir Liu Shan is my nephewThey will surely not do any harm to a connection In the end they decided to goAnd in the third watch they made their way into their chiefs tent and stabbed him to death Then they cut off his head and with their grisly trophy and a few followers they set off for the camp of the Ruler of ShuThey arrived at the outposts and were taken to see Zhang Nan and Feng Xi to whom they told their taleNext day they went into the main camp and were admitted to the presence of the First Ruler to whom they offered their trophy And they threw themselves on the ground and wept saying We are not traitorsWe were the victims of Lu Mengs wickedness He said that Guan Yu was dead and tricked us into giving up the city We could not help surrenderingWhen we heard the Sacred Chariot had come we slew Ma Zhong to satisfy your vengeance and we implore forgiveness But the First Ruler was angry and said I left Chengdu a long time ago why did you not come to confess your fault beforeNow you find yourselves in danger and so you come with this specious tale to try to save your livesIf I pardon you how shall I look my brother in the face when we meet beneath the Nine Golden Springs Then he bade Guan Xing set up an altar to his father in the camp and thereon the First Ruler offered the head of Ma Zhong in sacrifice before the tablet of Guan YuThis done he had Guan Xing strip the two deserters make them kneel before the altar and presently with his own hand he hewed them in pieces as a sacrificePresently Zhang Bao came in and wailed before him saying The two enemies of my uncle have been slain but when will vengeance be taken upon those of my father Do not grieve my nephew said the First Ruler I am going to lay waste the South Land and slay the whole of the curs that live thereI will assuredly capture the two murderers of your father and you shall hack them to pieces as a sacrifice Zhang Bao went away still weepingAbout this time the fear of the First Ruler was very great among the people of the South Land who stood in dread of him so that they grieved night and dayHan Dang and Zhou Tai were rather frightened too and they sent a report to their master of the assassination of Ma Zhong and what had befallen the assassinsThen Sun Quan was distressed and called together his counselors At this meeting Bu Zhi proposed submission and selfhumiliation for the sake of peaceSaid he There were five personsLu Meng Pan Zhang Ma Zhong Mi Fang and Fu Shirenwhom Liu Bei had a grudge against and they are all dead Now the objects of his hate are the murderers of Zhang FeiFan Jiang and Zhang DaWhy not send back Zhang Feis head and these two assassins and give up Jingzhou and restore Lady Sun and ask for peace and alliance against Wei This will make the army of Shu retire and we shall have peace This proposal seemed goodSo the head of Zhang Fei was enclosed in a sandalwood box Fan Jiang and Zhang Da were bound and put in a cagecart All these were sent with letters by the band of Cheng Bing to the camp at XiaotingThe First Ruler was about to march farther east when they told him that a messenger had come from the South Land and what he had broughtThe Ruler struck his forehead with both hands saying This is the direct gift of Heaven through my youngest brothers spirit He bade Zhang Bao prepare an altar whereon to sacrifice the heads of his fathers assassinsWhen he opened the box and saw the fresh features of Zhang Fei he broke into wailing for the deadThen the son hewed Fan Jiang and Zhang Da in pieces and offered them upon the altarBut this sacrifice did not appease the First Rulers anger and he still desired to destroy Wu Whereupon Ma Liang remonstratedYour enemies are now all dead you are avengedWu has sent a high officer with large concessions and awaits your reply But the First Ruler angrily replied The one I would grind to pieces is Sun QuanTo act as he proposes and enter into alliance would be treachery to my two brothers and a breach of our oathNow I will exterminate Wu and Wei shall follow He wished also to put the messenger to death to annihilate all emotions with Wu but relented when his officers insistently interceded Poor Cheng Bing ran off terrified glad to escape with life He went back and told the Prince of Wu how implacable his enemy seemedSaid he The Ruler of Shu not listening to words of peace was determined to level Wu before attacking WeiThose under him protested in vainWhat is to be done Sun Quan was frightened and bewilderedSeeing this Kan Ze stepped forward and said Since there is a skysupporting pillar why not use it Whom do you refer to asked Sun QuanYou once had perfect confidence in Zhou Yu and he was followed by Lu Su equally ableLu Meng succeeded and you pinned your faith upon himThough now Lu Meng is dead yet there is Lu Xun And he is quite near in JingzhouHe is reputed to be a scholar but really he is a bold and capable man no whit inferior to Zhou Yu in my opinionThe plan that broke Guan Yu was hisIf anyone can destroy Shu it is heIf he fails then I will stand the same punishment as may be his If you had not spoken thus my whole scheme might have gone amiss said Sun QuanLu Xun is a student said Zhang Zhao He is no match for Liu BeiYou may not use him Gu Yong also said He is too young and too inexperiencedI fear he will not be obeyed and that will be mischievous Bu Zhi also said He is well enough to control a region but he is not fit for a big matter Kan Ze got desperate shouting It is the only hopeI will guarantee him with the lives of all my house I know he is able said Sun Quan and I have now made up my mind he is the manGentlemen that is enough Lu Xun was called homeLu Xun was originally named Lu YiHe was a native of Wu County in Wu grandson of Lu Jun who was Commandant of the City Gates and son of Lu Yu Commander of JiujiangHe was eight spans in height with a beautiful face like the finest jadeWhen Lu Xun arrived at court and made his bow Sun Quan said to him I wish to send you in supreme command of all the forces against Shu Sir you have numerous old and tried officers under your command I am very young and not at all clever replied Lu XunKan Ze goes bail for you and pledges his whole house Moreover I know your abilitiesYou must be CommanderinChief and may not refuse the appointment But what will happen if the officers do not support me Here is authority said Sun Quan taking his own sword from his side and giving it to Lu XunSlay the disobedient and report afterwards I am grateful for this proof of confidence but I dare not accept forthwithI pray you assemble all the officers and confer the office upon me in their presence Said Kan Ze The ancient fashion was to set up a platform and thereon present to the leaderelect a white yaks tail and a golden ax with the seal of office and commission Thereafter his dignity and the reverence due from others were beyond all questionIt would be well O Prince to follow the old rule Choose a good day and appoint Lu Xun before all the world and no one will refuse support An altar was begun at onceThey worked at it day and night and as soon as it was finished a great assembly was called Then Lu Xun was requested to ascend and make his bow on receiving his appointment as CommanderinChief Leader of the Senior General Who Guards the West and Lord of Fenglou The sword of authority and the seal of office were presented His powers extended over the six territories and the eightyone counties of the South Land over the forces in Jingzhou and WuAnd in charging him Sun Quan said Domestic affairs belong to me outer affairs are under your direction Lu Xun then descendedHe chose Xu Sheng and Ding Feng as commanders of his guards and the army lost no time in taking the fieldThe various dispositions of horse and foot were made and dispatches were sent to the outlying commandersWhen the dispatch reached Han Dang and Zhou Tai who were camping near Xiaoting they were alarmed saying Why did the Prince appoint a mere bookish student to the commandership of all armed forces So when the new CommanderinChief came they showed their discontent by a lack of hearty supportLu Xun went to his tent to receive the reports and there the majority of the officers manifested only sullen respect and unwilling deferenceThen Lu Xun addressed them saying By order of my superior I am CommanderinChief and my commission is to destroy ShuYou gentlemen all know the ordinary military rules and you would do well to obey themThe law is no respecter of persons as those who disobey will find out Do not have to regret when it is too late They nodded in sullen acquiescenceThen Zhou Tai said There is Sun Huan nephew of our Prince he is surrounded at Yiling and is short of foodI venture to request you to send relief to him and get him out so that the Princes heart may be comforted I know all about him His soldiers are faithful and he can easily maintain his position There is no need to go to his aidWhen Shu is broken he will be free to come out They all sniggered as they left the tent and Han Dang did not fail to express his contempt for the newly appointed CommanderinChiefThis will be the end of Wu said he to his colleagueDid you note what he said I tried him just to see what he would do said Zhou Tai You see he had no plan ready he destroys Shu indeed Next day general orders were issued for defense and prohibitions against giving battle which provoked more laughter at the incapable pedant as they thought him in command and secret resolves to disobey Moreover the officers showed their contempt by a general disregard of ordersSo once more Lu Xun assembled them and said You know I am in command yet the recent orders for defense have been disregardedWhy Then Han Dang spoke up Some of us followed General Sun Ce when he first subdued the South LandOthers won fame in destroying rebels or in following the present Prince in his campaigns All of us have donned our armors and gripped our weapons in many a bloody fightNow Sir you have been placed in supreme command to repulse Shu and there should be some plan of campaign made for us at once some dispositions of our forces and some definite advance toward that end Instead of that we are told to strengthen our defenses and are forbidden to fight What are we to wait forWill Heaven destroy our opponents for usWe are not afraid to die Why is our keenness left to be eaten away and our energies wasted in idleness All the others applauded this speech and cried that the speaker had expressed their own ideasGeneral Han Dang just says what we thinklet us fight a decisive battle they cried The new general waited till the uproar had subsided then drawing his sword he shouted That I am a student is true But I have been entrusted with a great task a task for which the Prince of Wu considers me competent and for the performance of which I am prepared to bear all the responsibilitiesAs for you you will do well to act on the defensive as I ordered and not allow yourselves to be led astray into any attacks And I shall put the disobedient to death This speech had little effect and they dispersed grumbling and murmuringMeanwhile the Ruler of Shu had made a long chain of forty camps from Xiaoting to the borders of the Lands of Rivers spreading out two hundred miles These base camps looked very imposing with their fluttering banners by day and their fires at night Then the spies came in and reportedWu appointed Lu Xun as CommanderinChiefLu Xun ordered his commanders to defend strategic points and not to engage in battle What sort of a man is this Lu Xun said the First RulerHe is a scholar among the people of Wu and though young he is very talented replied Ma Liang His schemes are very deepHe was the author of the villainous and crafty plan of attack on Jingzhou His crafty scheme caused the deaths of my brothers but now I shall have him said the First Ruler angrilyHe gave orders to advanceBut Ma Liang ventured to remonstrate and dissuade himBe very careful said he this Lu Xun is no whit inferior to Zhou Yu I have grown old in the field said the EmperorDont you think me a match for this callow youth He confirmed the order to go forward and they attacked passes and fords and redoubts wherever they wereHan Dang notified his chief of the movement of the Shu army and Lu Xun still rather dubious of the strict obedience to his orders hastened to the point of dangerHe found Han Dang on a hill surveying the enemys force which advanced like a great waveAmidst the army they saw a wide yellow umbrella and Han Dang pointed it out That must be Liu Bei said heI should like to kill him Careful said Lu Xun So far he has scored victory after victory and his soldiers are very keen and confident Maintain a careful defense on high grounds and do not go out to battle If you do you will loseImpress that upon your officers and soldiers and make them understand the strategy while you follow the enemys movesThey are hastening into the wide open space and I do not wish to hinder themNor will I accept any challenge to battle but wait till they have moved their camps into the forest and among the trees Then I shall have a scheme ready Han Dang agreed so far as words went but in his heart he was still illconditioned When the Shu army drew near a small force came to challengeThey shouted all sorts of abuse and hurled reproaches to put their opponents to shame but Lu Xun took no notice and bade his troops stop their ears He would not allow them to go out to battle but he went from fort to redoubt encouraging the soldiers to remain carefully on the defensiveThe First Rulers heart burned within him at this refusal to come out to battleSaid Ma Liang Lu Xun is a deep and crafty fellowHe recognizes the disadvantages of Your Majestys troops in being far from their base and from spring to autumn he will not come out to fight till some move occurs that he may profit by What ruse can he be contemplate said the First RulerThe real fact is that he is afraidTheir army has suffered nothing but defeat times and againThey dare not meet us One day the leader of the van Feng Xi memorialized the First Ruler saying The weather is scorching and the troops are camped in the full glare of sunBeside water is scarce and hard to get Thereupon orders were given to move the camps into the shade of the forest close by and near the streams till the summer heats should have passedThis order given Feng Xi moved the camp to a retired and shady spot for his troopsMa Liang said If our soldiers move the enemy will rush out on us and we shall be hard set I will provide for that said the First RulerI will send Wu Ban with ten thousand of our inferior troops to camp near their linesBut I will choose eight thousand of veterans and place them in ambushWu Ban will have orders to flee before the soldiers of Wu and lead them into my ambush if they come out and I will cut off their retreatWe ought to capture this precocious youth A genius in plans a marvel of prevision cried ail those about him as this plan was unfoldedNone of us can approach him in cleverness So they felicitated their rulerBut Ma Liang said They say the Prime Minister is on a tour of inspection of the defenses in the eastern portion of Shu seeing that they are in good order against any attack on the part of WeiWhy not send him a sketch of your present dispositions of troops and ask his opinion I also am not entirely ignorant of the art of war and I see no reason to seek advice was the cold replyThere is an old saying about hearing both sides said Ma LiangWell then you go round to all the camps and make a map and take it to the Prime MinisterIf he finds any fault you may come and tell me So Ma Liang went while the First Ruler busied himself with getting his army into shelter from the fierce heat of summerHis move was no secret and the scouts soon told Han Dang and Zhou Tai who rejoiced at the news and soon went to tell Lu Xun All the enemies forty camps had been moved into the shadeNow Sir you can attack said theyThat was not a bad plan an ambush to set Thus thought he his chiefest opponent to getWhether Lu Xun acted upon the suggestion of his subordinates will be seen in the next chapter CHAPTER Lu Xun Burns All Consecutive Camps Zhuge Liang Plans The EightArray Maze The last chapter closed with the report that the First Ruler had shifted camp in search of cool shade and the news was very welcome to Lu XunHe went forthwith to assure himself of the truth of the report and observe the new positionA level plain lay at his feet whereon he saw something short of ten thousand Shu troops the greater part of whom appeared invalids On the banner of their leader he read the name Van Leader Wu BanWe consider these troops children said Zhou TaiLet me and General Han Dang go out and smite themI will give the formal guarantee of victory The CommanderinChief made no reply but remained gazing out before himPresently he said It seems to me that an air of slaughter is rising over there from that valley surely there is an ambush there These poor troops in the foreground are nothing but a baitNo Gentlemen do not leave your positions Those who heard this took it only as another proof of the imbecility of their pedant commanderNext day Wu Bans soldiers approached closer and challenged to battle swaggering about and brandishing their weapons and shouting volleys of abuse without endThey manifested contempt by throwing off their armor and clothing and moving to and fro with the utmost carelessness bare bodies and naked forms blatantly unready to fight Some even sat or lay asleepXu Sheng and Ding Feng came to the commanders tent to complain saying Those Shu soldiers despise us so muchLet us go out and punish them But Lu Xun only smiled saying You see everything from the point of view of brute courage You seem not to know the principles of war laid down by Sun Zi and Wu Qi This display is only meant to entice us into fight You will see the pretense yourselves in about three days In three days the change of camp will be complete and the enemy will be too strongly posted for our success said theyI am just letting them move their camp Xu Sheng and Ding Feng left the tent also sniggeringBut on the third day the officers were assembled at a lookout point whence they saw that Wus army had leftThere is still a deadly look over the valley said Lu XunLiu Bei will soon appear Very soon they saw a whole army all well accoutered pass across the field escorting the First RulerAnd the sight took away all their courageThat is why I would not listen to those of you who wanted to fight Wu Ban said Lu XunNow that the ambush has been withdrawn we can settle them in about ten days The proper time to attack was when they began to transfer their campNow they are fully established with encampments stretching two hundred miles Having spent seven or eight months in strengthening where they might be attacked will it not be difficult to destroy them said they I see you do not understand how to carry on war This man Liu Bei is a capable and crafty man When he first started on this expedition his methods were of the best and he kept to them for a long time so we gave him no chance against usWhen his troops are worn out and his thoughts cease to be clear that will be our day to attack At last they agreed with their chiefThe general discoursed on war According to the book Right craftily the bait for whales Was put upon the hookWhen kingdoms three were carved out Though famous men were many Lu Xun of Wu At least stands high as anyLu Xun had already had the plan whereby the Shu army was to be crushed and at this stage he wrote to the Prince of Wu in full details even naming a day for the victoryWe have found another remarkably able leader said the Prince and I have no further anxietyThey all said he was a useless pedant and only I knew betterReading this letter shows him nothing at all of a pedant Then the Prince of Wu mustered the remainder of his soldiers to hold in reserveMeanwhile the First Ruler had sent orders to hasten the marines down the river and take up stations along the banks deep in the territory of WuHowever Huang Quan spoke against this saying It is easy enough for the ships to go a down but how about returningLet me make the first advance and Your Majesty may followThat will make it more than probable that nothing will go wrong Those Wu enemy are afraid objected the ruler and I want to make a dash at themWhere is the difficulty Though many others had spoken against the proposal the First Ruler did not give up the notion of going into the forefront of the attackThen dividing the army into two portions he placed Huang Quan in command on the North of the Great River to keep a watch on Wei while he commanded on the South of the Great River They made encampments and stations along the bankThe spies of Wei duly reported these doings to the Ruler of Wei Shu marches against Wu erecting forty base camps along two hundred miles of woods and hills Moreover the Ruler of Shu places Huang Quan in command of the North of the Great RiverHuang Quans marines patrolled as far as thirty miles dailyWe do not know their intention The Ruler of Wei laughed aloud when he heard the details of the long line of camps and the encampments among the trees and all this Liu Bei is going to be defeated said heHow do you know asked his courtiersBecause Liu Bei does not know how to wage warHow can he beat off an enemy along a front of two hundred milesThe maxims of war forbid to camp in open plains among marshes amid precipitous heights and obstaclesHe will be defeated at the hand of Lu Xun and we shall hear of it in about ten days His officers felt more than doubtful and entreated their master to prepare an armyBut the Ruler of Wei replied If successful Lu Xun will lead all his force westward into the Western Land of Rivers and his country will be defenselessI shall pretend to send an army to help I shall send them in three divisions and I shall overcome Wu easily They all bowed acquiescence and approvalThen orders went out appointing Cao Ren to lead an army out by Ruxu Cao Xiu to take a second out by Dongkou and Cao Zhen to command a third to go through Nanjun and the three armies were to combine on a given date for a sudden attack on Wu The Ruler of Wei would himself bring up the reinforcement in this southern campaign Reaching Chengdu Ma Liang lost no time in seeing the Prime Minister and presenting the plan of the armies as they were in the fieldNow the forces are on both sides of the Great River extending along a front of two hundred miles with forty stations each beside a mountain stream or in a pleasantly shaded forest At our lords command I prepared this map and he sent me to ask your opinion Who advised such an arrangementHe ought to be put to death whoever it was cried Zhuge Liang sorrowfully tapping the table at his sideIt is entirely our lords own work no other had any hand in it said Ma LiangThe life and energy of the Hans are done indeed said Zhuge Liang He has committed those very faults which the rules of the Art of War lay down as to be particularly avoidedThe camps are made where free movement is impossible and nothing can save him if the enemy use fireBeside what defense is possible along a twohundredmile frontDisaster is at hand and Lu Xun sees it all which explains his obstinate refusal to come out into the openGo back as quickly as you can and tell our lord that this will not do that it must be changed at once But if I am too lateif Wu has already attacked and won what then The enemy will not dare to follow up their victory by a march on ChengduSo this capital is secure Why will they not Wei is behind their back that is whyOur lord will be compelled to shelter in BaidichengI have already placed ten thousand troops in hiding at Fishbelly Creek Have youI have been up and down that creek three or four times without seeing a soldierI do not see the reason of telling lies to me said Ma LiangYou will see do not ask so many questions With the precious instructions which he had persuaded Zhuge Liang to draw up Ma Liang hastened back to the imperial camp while Zhuge Liang went to the capital to prepare a relief expeditionThe soldiers of Shu had become slack and idle and no longer maintained adequate defense wherefore Lu Xun perceived that his moment had arrived and called his generals to his tent to receive orders There has been no fighting since I received our lords commandI have spent the time in acquiring a knowledge of the enemy As a preliminary operation I want to capture a camp on the south bankWho volunteers Out stepped Han Dang and Zhou Tai and Ling Tong all three at once each crying that he wanted to be sentBut they were sent back the CommanderinChief did not want any of them Then he called up the junior general Chunyu Dan and said You will take the fourth camp on the south side you may have five thousand troops The commander of the post is Fu TongI shall support you When Chunyu Dan had gone Lu Xun summoned Xu Sheng and Ding Feng and said Each of you will take three thousand troops and bivouac two miles from the camp so that if your colleague is repulsed and pursued you can rescue him Chunyu Dan marched between the lights and reached the camp he was to capture just after the third watchHis drums rolled and he attacked at onceThe defenders came out led by Fu Tong who spear ready to thrust rode straight toward the leader of the attack and forced him backSuddenly there arose the roll of other drums and a cohort under Zhao Rong barred the wayChunyu Dan turned off along another road escaping with loss of many troops But he was not yet safe Some distance farther he ran against the Mang tribesmen leader Shamo KeHowever Chunyu Dan avoided him also and went on his way pursued now by three partiesSoon he reached the spot two miles from the camp and here the two leaders of ShuXu Sheng and Ding Feng who had been placed ready to afford succor came out and stopped the pursuit When the enemy had retired Chunyu Dan was escorted back to campHe was wounded and with the arrow still undrawn he appeared before Lu Xun and apologized for his failureIt was no fault of yours said the CommanderinChief I wanted to test the force of our enemyMy plan of attack is quite ready The enemy is very strong and will not be easily overcome said Xu Sheng and Ding FengWe have now suffered great loss to no purpose This plan of mine would not hoodwink Zhuge Liang but happily he is not hereHis absence will allow me to score a great success Then he summoned his generals to receive orders Zhu Ran is to lead the marine force He is to advance next day afternoon when the southeast wind will serve His ships are laden with reeds and straw which are to be used as orderedHan Dang is to attack the north bank Zhou Tai the south Each soldier in addition to his weapons is to carry a bundle of straw or reeds with sulfur and saltpeter hidden therein and each has a piece of tinder They are to advance and when they reach the Shu camps they are to start a conflagrationBut they are to burn only alternate camps twenty in all leaving the others untouchedThey are to advance and only stop if they capture Liu Bei The leaders received the orders and so set outThe First Ruler was in his own camp pondering over a plan to destroy the armies of Wu when suddenly the staff that bore the great standard in front of his own tent fell over and lay on the ground There was no wind to account for this so he turned to Cheng Ji and asked what it might portendIt means only one thing that the troops of Wu will raid the camp tonight said Cheng JiThey will not dare after the slaughter of yesterday But suppose that was only a reconnaissance what then Just then a report came in that some troops of Wu could be seen very far off going along the hills eastwardThey are soldiers meant to put us in confusion said the First RulerTell the generals not to move but let Guan Xing and Zhang Bao with a small mounted force go out to reconnoiter It was dusk when these two returned and they then reportedFire is seen among the camps on the north bank The Emperor hastily bade Guan Xing go to the north camps and Zhang Bao to the south to find out what was really happeningAnd they startedAbout the middle of the first watch the wind got up and blew strong from the eastThen fire arose from the camp on the left of the First Rulers ownHe was starting to extinguish this flame when another fire began in the camp on his rightWith the aid of the strong breeze both fires became fierce and soon the trees caught A confused roar showed the gathering strength of the fireThe soldiers of the burning camps were rushing into the First Rulers own camp to escape the fire and in their confusion they trampled on each other so that many diedBehind them came the troops of Wu bent on slaughterIgnorant of how many they might be the First Ruler mounted and dashed for Feng Xis camp but that also was in flames which seemed to rise to the very skyBy this time flames were rising from both sides of the river so that everything was as visible as by dayFeng Xi leaped to his horse and fled followed by a few of his mounted troops This small force ran against the soldiers of Wu under Xu ShengA melee ensued thereupon the First Ruler turned and galloped westXu Sheng then left Feng Xi and went in pursuit Presently the Emperor saw a party of soldiers in the way and became greatly alarmedThis was Ding Fengs army and the First Ruler was between two foesIn his terror he saw no possibility of safety no road was open Just at this moment another cohort broke through to his side and rescued him The leader was Zhang Bao and he led the Imperial Guards who fled taking the First Ruler with themAs they marched along they fell in with another force of Shu the leader was Fu Tong and he joined up with themThe Wu army was still following when the fugitives reached Saddle Hill The two leaders Zhang Bao and Fu Tong were urging their lord to go to the top of this out of immediate dangerSoon Lu Xun arrived with his army and began to surround the hillZhang Bao and Fu Tong held the road up the hill and kept the enemy from ascendingFrom the summit could be seen flames all around and the First Ruler witnessed the corpses of his soldiers lay about in heaps or floated in the streamsNext day the soldiers of Wu set themselves to firing the hill The First Rulers remaining escort fled for their lives like rats and their lord was in despairSuddenly he saw a general followed by a few horsemen cutting an arterial alley through and coming up the hill As he drew nearer the Emperor recognized Guan XingGuan Xing quickly leapt down prostrated himself and said Your Majesty the fire is gaining all round and this place is not safeI request you to try to reach Baidicheng and as many as possible will gather there Who will dare stay behind to keep off the enemy said the First RulerFu Tong volunteered saying I will fight to death to guard the rear It was dusk when they started Guan Xing led the wayThey got their lord safely down the hill and away As soon as the troops of Wu noticed the flight they pressed forward each anxious to gain kudos by the capture of the Emperors person Great armies of Wu blotting out the sky and hiding the earth went westward in pursuit The First Ruler ordered his soldiers to make fires of their clothing and other things in the road so as to hinder pursuitZhu Ran marched up from the river to try to intercept the flight and the noise of his drums was terrifying The First Ruler thought there was no possibility of escape from this force and cried This is the end His two nephews dashed to the front to try to cut a way through but returned wounded and bleeding And the noise of the pursuers came constantly nearer as they found their way along the valleys About the first glimpse of dawn the case seemed quite desperateBut just at the worst they saw Zhu Rans soldiers suddenly begin to break up and scatter tumbling into streams and rolling down precipices Soon the reason was evident a fearsome general leading a cohort came to their relief Once again the First Ruler was rescued from pressing danger and this time the rescuer was Zhao YunHe had been in Jiangzhou and news of the straits of his lord had reached him there He had set out forthwith Then he had seen the glow of the burnings and had marched toward it And thus he had arrived just at the moment to save his master when danger was most imminentAs soon as Lu Xun heard that Zhao Yun had appeared he ordered his troops to stop pursuit and retireZhao Yun happening upon Zhu Ran engaged him forthwith and in the first encounter slew Zhu Ran with a spear thrustAnd so the army of Wu were dispersed and retired and the First Ruler got safely to the wall of Baidicheng But on the way thither his thoughts went back to his companions in misfortune and he inquired after them anxiouslyThough I am safe how about the other generals and soldiers asked the First RulerThe pursuers are close upon us and we cannot wait for anything said Zhao YunI wish Your Majesty to get into the city as quickly as possible and while you are reposing yourself we may try to rescue some of the leaders When the First Ruler entered Baidicheng he was in sore straits only having about a hundred men leftA poet wrote concerning this victory of Lu Xun He grips the spear he kindles fire the camps are swept away Liu Bei to White Emperor City flees lonely and sad todayBut Lu Xuns meteoric fame now shoots through Shu and Wei For bookish people the Prince of Wu has naught but good to sayBut Fu Tong who commanded the rearguard was surrounded by the enemy in all eight directions Ding Feng shouted to him You would better surrenderMany of the soldiers of Shu have fallen more have surrendered and your lord is a prisonerYou have no hope against us with your scanty force But Fu Tong replied Shall I a servant of Han give in to the cure of Wu Undaunted he rode at his opponents and fought many bouts But his strength and valor availed naught struggle as he would he could not make his way out And so he fell among his enemies A poem celebrates his valiancyWu at Yiling strove with Shu Flames not swords used crafty Lu XunWorthy of a place among Hans bold generals is Fu TongThe Minister Cheng Ji having got clear of the battle rode swiftly to the river bank and called to the marines to join in the battle They landed but were soon scatteredOne of Cheng Jis generals shouted to himThe soldiers of Wu are upon us let find a way to escape But Cheng Ji shouted back Since I first followed my lord I have never yet turned my back upon the foe The enemy surrounded Cheng Ji and as he could do no more he took his sword and slew himselfNoble among the warriors of Shu was Cheng Ji He kept his sword for the service of his princeWhen danger pressed near he wavered not Wherefore his fame remains forever brightNow Wu Ban and Zhang Nan had been besieging Yiling Then came Feng Xi and told of the need of their lord and they led off their army to rescue him Whereupon Sun Huan was set free as Lu Xun had foretold would happen As soon as Sun Huan was free he set off in pursuit of Feng Xi and Zhang NanThese two marched until they met an army of Wu face to face and so were between two forcesA desperate battle was fought and both these generals perished therein Feng Xi was loyal without peer Zhang Nan was righteous few have equaled himIn battle on the flaming shore they died And the histories record their deeds Wu Ban broke throughHe was pursued but he luckily fell in with Zhao Yun and got safely to BaidichengThe Mang tribesmen King Shamo Ke was flying from the battle field when he met Zhou Tai who slew him after a short fightThe two Shu generals Du Lu and Liu Ning surrendered to Wu as did many soldiersOf the stores and weapons in the camps of Shu nothing was savedWhen the story of the disaster to Shu reached the Southern Land and with it the report that the First Ruler had been killed in battle Lady Sun gave way to wild grief She rode down to the river bank and gazing westward wept and lamented Then she threw herself into the stream and was drownedPosterity erected a temple on the shore called The Shrine of the Bold Beauty and one who described it wrote a poemThe Ruler defeated fled to Baidicheng Through thunderous tiding Lady Sun committed suicideToday the water still flows by the carved stone To show where and why this heroine died There could be no question that this exploit brought tremendous glory to Lu XunAnxious to push his advantage as far as possible he led his exultant army westwardBut as he drew near to Kui Pass he suddenly pulled up his horse remarking that he saw an aura of death about the mountain side in frontWe may not yet advance farther I suspect an ambush So they retreated three miles and camped in a wide open spaceAnd the army was arrayed ready against any sudden attackMeanwhile scouts were sent outThey returned reporting no soldiers Lu Xun doubted and went up to the summit of a hill whence he could see over the countryThe aura was still visible to him and so he dispatched other people to spy But he received the same report not a soldier not a horseStill as the sun got lower and lower in the west he saw the same appearance accentuated and he began to feel grave doubts He sent a confidant to look once moreThis man came back saying There is not a single soldier but I have noticed on the river bank nearly a hundred heaps of boulders The CommanderinChief still doubting called in several of the natives and questioned them about the stonesWho put them there Why did they look so ghastly asked Lu Xun We do not knowThis place is called Fishbelly CreekWhen Zhuge Liang was going west into the Lands of Rivers he came along here with a lot of soldiers and heaped up the boulders like that above the Sandy RapidWe have seen vapors rising from the boulders they seemed to come from inside them Lu Xun decided to go and look at these boulders himself So he rode off with a small escort Looked down from a declivity the stones were evidently arranged with a design related to the eight points of the compass There were doors and doorsills and lintelsThis looks likely to drive a person out of his senses he said I wonder whether it is any good They rode down with intent to examine the mysterious arrangement more closely and went in among the stonesPresently one of the escort called attention to the increasing darkness and said The sun is setting we ought to be returning to camp But as Lu Xun glanced round to look for an exit a sudden squall came on and the dust whirled up obscuring both sky and earthAnd in the swirl the stones reared themselves up like steep mountains pointed like swords and the dust and sand shaped themselves into waves and hillocks one behind the otherThe roar of the boiling river was as the drums before a battleThis is some trick of Zhuge Liang said Lu Xun in a scared voice and I have been caught He would go out but he had quite lost his way and could find no exitAs he stopped to consider what he should do an old man suddenly appeared who said Does the General wish to go out I greatly desire that you would pilot me out O Elder replied heLeaning on his staff the old man led the way and with quiet dignity conducted Lu Xun outside He had no difficulty in finding his way and paused not a single instantWhen they were once again on the slope Lu Xun asked his aged guide who he wasI am Zhuge Liangs fatherinlaw my name is Huang ChenyanMy soninlaw placed these boulders here as you see them and he said they represented the EightArray MazeThey are like eight doors and according to the scheme are named Gate of Rest Gate of Life Gate of Injury Gate of Obstruction Gate of Prospect Gate of Death Gate of Surprise and Gate of OpeningsThey are capable of infinite mutations and would be equal to a hundred thousand soldiersAs he was leaving he told me that if any leader of Wu became mazed in them I was not to conduct him outsideFrom a precipice near by I saw you General enter in at the Gate of Death and as I guessed you were ignorant of the scheme I knew you would be entangledBut I am of a good disposition and could not bear that you should be entrapped without possibility of escape so I came to guide you to the Gate of Life Have you studied this matter Sir asked Lu XunThe variations are inexhaustible and I could not learn them all Lu Xun dismounted bowed low before the old man and then rode away The famous poet Du Fu wrote some verses which run something like thisPlanner of three kingdoms no small praise Is hisInventor of the Eight ArraysAnd for that famous boulders on the rivers brim Firm was set the denouncement of Wus whim Lu Xun took his way to his camp in deep thoughtThis Zhuge Liang is well named SleepingDragon said he I am not his equal Then to the amazement of all he gave orders to retireThe officers ventured to remonstrate seeing that they had been so successful General you have utterly broken the enemy and Liu Bei is shut up in one small city it seems the time to smite and yet you retire because you have come across a mysterious arrangement of stones I am not afraid of the stones and it is not on their account that I retire But I fear Cao PiHe is no less resourceful than his father and when he hears I am marching into Shu he will certainly attack usHow could I return then The homeward march beganOn the second day the scouts brought a report Three Wei generals with three armies are debouching at three different points and moving toward the borders of WuCao Ren from Ruxu Cao Xiu from Dongkou and Cao Zhen from Nanjun Their intentions are unclear Just as I thought said Lu XunBut I am ready for them And now the west is mine the victor thought But danger from the north discretion taughtThe story of the retreat will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER The First Ruler Confides His Son To The Guardians Care Zhuge Liang Calmly Settles The Five Attacks In summer the sixth month of the second year of Manifest Might  Lu Xun destroyed the army of Shu at YilingThe First Ruler sought refuge in Baidicheng of which Zhao Yun then undertook the defenseWhen Ma Liang returned only to find his lord defeated he was more distressed than he could say He announced what Zhuge Liang had said concerning the plansThe First Ruler sighed saying If I had listened to the Prime Ministers advice the defeat would not have happenedNow how can I face a return to my capital So he promulgated a command to change the guesthouse into the Palace of Eternal PeaceHe was deeply grieved when they told him of the deaths Feng Xi Cheng Ji Fu Tong Zhang Nan King Shamo Ke and many of his generals Next he heard people sayHuang Quan who had been given command of the army on the north bank had given in to WeiYour Majesty should deliver his whole family to the authority and hold them responsible for the renegade But the First Ruler only said The army was quite cut off by Wu from the south bank and he had no alternative but to surrender Really I betrayed him not he meWhy should I take vengeance on his family So he continued the issue of the renegades pay to his familyWhen Huang Quan surrendered he was led into the presence of Cao Pi who said You have surrendered to me because you desired to imitate the admirable conduct of Chen Ping and Han Xin of old But Huang Quan replied weeping The Ruler of Shu has been very kind to me and he gave me the leadership of the army on the North of the Great RiverLu Xun cut me off so that I could not return to Shu and I would not surrender to Wu wherefore I have yielded to Your MajestyDefeated as I am I should be only too happy if my life were spared but I have no claim to the credit of the virtuous ones of old The reply satisfied the Ruler of Wei and he conferred on him the title General Who Guards the SouthBut Huang Quan however declined the offerThen one of the courtiers said A spy has reported that all of your family have been put to death by the Ruler of Shu But the leader replied that he could not believe it I have the greatest confidence in the clemency of the Ruler of ShuHe knows I would not have surrendered of my own free will and he would not injure my family And the Ruler of Wei agreed with his opinion A poem has been written upbraiding Huang QuanThat was a pity that Huang Quan grudged to die Though he yielded to Wei not Wu Yet he crooked the knee in an alien court Which the loyal cannot doCao Pi sought advice from Jia Xu concerning his design of bringing the whole country under his own ruleI wish to bring the whole empire under my rule which shall I first reduce Shu or Wu Liu Bei is an able warrior and Zhuge Liang is a most capable administrator Sun Quan possesses discrimination and his general Lu Xun occupies all the strategic positions of importance The natural obstacles the intervening rivers and spreading lakes would be hard to overcomeI do not think you have any leader to match either of these two menEven with the prestige of Your Majestys own presence no one could guarantee the resultThe better course is to hold on and await the outcome of the struggle between those two I have already dispatched three armies against Wu can it be that they will fail The Chair of the Secretariat Liu Ye held the same opinion as his colleagueSaid he Lu Xun has just won a great victory over the great host of Shu and all his army is full of confidence Further there are the lakes and the rivers which are natural difficulties hard to cope withAnd again Lu Xun is resourceful and well prepared The Ruler of Wei said Formerly Sir you urged me to attack Wu why do you now give contrary advice Because times have changedWhen Wu was suffering defeat after defeat the country was depressed and might be smittenNow this great victory has changed all that and their morale has increased a hundred timesI say now they may not be attacked Well but I have decided to attack So say no more said the Ruler of WeiHe then led the Imperial Guards out to support his three armies But the scouts soon brought news justifying the opinion of his advisers A force of Wu has been sent to oppose each of our three armiesLu Fan leads an army against Cao Xiu at Dongkou Zhuge Jin against Cao Zhen at Nanjun and Zhu Huan against Cao Ren at Ruxu Liu Ye pointed this out and again said Wu has prepared and no success can be expected Still Cao Pi was obstinate and marchedThe Wu leader Zhu Huan who had been sent against Cao Ren at Ruxu was a young man of twentyseven He was bold and resourceful and Sun Quan held him in great regardHearing that Cao Ren was going to attack Xianxi Zhu Huan led the bulk of his troops to defend it leaving only five thousand troops in RuxuThen he heard that the van of the enemy fifty thousand under Commander Chang Diao with the aid of Zhuge Qian and Wang Shuang had made a dash for Ruxu so he hastened back and found the officers were in great fearDrawing his sword he made a speech Success depends upon the leader rather than on the number of soldiersThe Art of War says that the value of one soldier who inhabits the place equals that of two soldiers who come from afar and those who are in possession however in small number can overcome those who come from afarNow the enemy is weary from a long march and I and you my men can hold this place together We have the Great River to defend us on the south and we are backed by the mountains on the north Success should be ours easily and we are as hosts at home awaiting the arrival of our weary visitors This will give us victory in every fightEven if Cao Pi comes we need feel no anxietyHow much less care we for Cao Ren and his troops Zhu Huan he issued orders to furl all the banners and to silence all the drums as if the city was empty of defendersIn time Chang Diao and his veterans of the van came to the city Not a person was visible and he hastened forward with all speedBut as he neared the city suddenly a bomb went offImmediately up rose a forest of flags and out dashed Zhu Huan with his sword drawn And he made for Chang DiaoIn the third encounter Zhu Huan cut down Chang Diao and the troops of Wu rushing to the attack thoroughly routed the invaders slaying innumerable soldiersBeside scoring a complete victory Zhu Huan took much spoil of flags and weapons and horsesCao Ren himself coming up later was attacked by the troops from Xianxi and was also routed He fled home to his master with the news of defeat and destructionAnd before the Ruler of Wei could decide what course to take in regard to this loss the news came of the defeat of his another armyCao Zhen and Xiahou Shang were besieging Nanjun when Zhuge Jin from within and Lu Xun from without attacked in concert The two generals suffered a great loss Immediately another report cameCao Xiu has been defeated by Lu Fan at Dongkou So all three had failed and were lost and Cao Pi sighed and said sadly This has come from my willfulness and neglect of advice of Jia Xu and Liu Ye The summer of that year was very unhealthy and a pestilence swept away the soldiers more than half the number So they were marched home to Capital Luoyang The two countries were at enmity though they were not fightingMeanwhile the First Ruler was failing He remained in his Palace of Eternal Peace and presently was confined to his couch Gradually he became worse and in the fourth moon of the third year of Manifest Might  his condition became serious He himself felt the end was near and he was depressed and wept for his two lost brothers till the sight of his eyes sufferedHe was morose and illtempered he could not bear any of his court near him drove away his servants and lay upon his couch sad and solitaryOne evening as thus he lay a sudden gust of wind came into the chamber almost extinguishing the candles As they burned bright again he saw two men standing in the shade behind themI told you I was worried said the First Ruler and bade you leave me why have you come backGo But they remained and did not goWherefore the First Ruler rose and went over to look at them As he drew near he saw one was Guan Yu and the other Zhang FeiAre you still alive then brothers said heWe are not men we are shades said Guan YuThe Supreme One has conferred spirithood upon us in consideration of our faithfulness throughout life and ere long Brother we three shall be together again The First Ruler clutched at the figures and burst into tears then he awokeThe two figures were no longer thereHe called in his people and asked the hour they told him the third watchI am not much longer for this world said he with a sighMessengers were sent to Capital Chengdu to summon the Prime Minister and other high officers of state to receive the Emperors last instructionsThey came Zhuge Liang bringing the two younger sons Prince of Lu Liu Yung and Prince of Liang Liu Li The eldest the heirapparent was left in charge of the capitalZhuge Liang saw at once that his master was very ill He bowed to the ground at the foot of the Dragon CouchThe dying Emperor bade him come near and sit beside him and he patted his Minister on the back saying The attainment of emperorship was your workLittle thought you that I should prove so stupid as not to follow your advice and so bring about the late disastersBut I am deeply sorry and now I shall not live longMy heir is a degenerate but I must leave him to do the best he can with the great inheritance And the tears flowed in streamsI trust Your Majesty will fulfill the hopes of the people by a speedy recovery said Zhuge Liang also in tearsTurning his head the First Ruler saw Ma Su Ma Liangs brother at the bedside He bade him retireWhen Ma Su had left the chamber the First Ruler said Do you think Ma Su is clever He is one of the ablest people in the world said Zhuge Liang I do not think soI think his words exceed his deeds Do not make much use of himWatch him carefully Having said this he bade them summon the high officers of state to the chamberTaking paper and pen the First Ruler wrote his testament He handed it to the Prime Minister with a sigh and said I am no great scholar and I only know the rough outlines of what should be known But the Teacher has saidA birds song is sad when death is near and a dying persons words are good I was waiting that we might aid each other in the destruction of the Caos and the restoration of the Hans but ere the work is complete I am called away and this last command of mine I confide to you as Prime Minister to be handed to my son and heir Liu Shan My words are to be taken seriouslyI trust that you will instruct and guide my son Zhuge Liang and all those present wept and prostrated themselves saying We pray Your Majesty repose yourselfWe will do our utmost whereby to prove our gratitude for the kindness we have received At the First Rulers command the attendants raised Zhuge Liang from the earthWith one hand the dying man brushed away the falling tears while with the other he grasped Zhuge Liangs hand and said The end is near I have something more to say as to a close general What holy command has Your Majesty to give You are many times more clever than Cao Pi and you must safeguard the kingdom and complete the great workIf my son can be helped help himBut if he proves a fool then take the throne yourself and be a ruler Such a speech almost startled Zhuge Liang out of his sensesA cold sweat broke out all over his body and his limbs threatened to cease to support him He fell on his knees saying I could never do otherwise than wear myself to the bone in the service of your son whom I will serve till death He knocked his head upon the ground till blood ran downThe dying man called Zhuge Liang closer and at the same time making his two sons come near he said to them My sons remember your fathers words After my death you are to treat the Prime Minister as you would your father and be not remiss for thereby you will fulfill your fathers hopes He made the two Princes pay to Zhuge Liang the obeisance due to a fatherSaid Zhuge Liang Were I destroyed and ground into the earth I should be unable to repay the kindness I have experienced Turning to the assembled officers the First Ruler said As you have seen I have confided my orphan son to the care of the Prime Minister and bidden my sons treat him as a fatherYou too Sirs are to treat him with deferenceThis is my dying request and charge to you Turning to Zhao Yun he said You and I have gone together through many dangers and difficulties Now comes the parting of our waysYou will not forget our old friendship and you must see to it that my sons follow my precepts I shall never dare to give other than my best said Zhao YunThe fidelity of the dog and horse is mine to give and shall be theirs Then the First Ruler turned to the others Noble Sirs I am unable to speak to you one by one and lay a charge upon each individual but I say to you Maintain your selfrespect These were his last wordsHe was sixtythree and he died on the twentyfourth day of the fourth month  A poem was written by Du Fu on his deathThe Emperor set out to destroy the land that lay through the Three Gorges Failed he and breathed his last in the palace of Eternal Peace The palace fair of his thoughts lay not this side the highlandsBeautiful chambers are vainly sought in his rural temple Now are the pines near his shrine nesting places for herons Through the courts aged peasants saunter enjoying their leisure Nearby often is found a shrine to this strategist famous Prince and ministers needs are now but offerings in seasonThus died the First Ruler All present lifted up their voices and weptThe Prime Minister led the procession that escorted the coffin to the capital and the heir Liu Shan came to the outskirts of the city as a dutiful son should to receive the remains with due respect The coffin was laid in the Great Hall of the palace wherein they lamented and performed the ceremonies appointedAt the end of these the testament was opened and readI first fell ill from a simple ailmentOther disorders followed and it became evident that I should not recoverThey say that death at fifty cannot be called premature and as I have passed three score I may not resent the callBut when I think of you and your brothers I regret Now I say to you strive and strive againDo no evil because it is a small evil do not leave undone a small good because it is a small goodOnly with wisdom and virtue people can be wonBut your fathers virtue was but slender and do not imitate After my death you are to conduct the affairs of the state with the Prime MinisterYou are to treat him as a father and serve him without remissnessYou and your brothers are to seek instructionsThis is my final and simple command When this had been read Zhuge Liang said The state cannot go a single day without a ruler wherefore I beg you to install the heir as successor to the great line of the Hans Thereupon the ceremony was performed and the new Emperor took his placeThe style of the reign was changed to Beginning Prosperity Zhuge Liang was made Lord of Wuxiang and Imperial Protector of YiazhouThen they buried the late Emperor at Huiling with the posthumous style of Liu Bei the Glorious EmperorThe Empress of the Wu family was formally created Empress DowagerThe late Consort Gan became the Glorious Empress and the Lady Mi was granted similar also posthumous rankThere were promotions in rank and rewards for all and a general amnesty was proclaimedBefore long knowledge of these things came to the Middle Land and a report was sent to Capital Luoyang and made known to the Ruler of WeiCao Pi felt relieved and was glad of the death of his rival saying Liu Bei is dead I am no longer worriedAn attack during the critical moment can bring a victory over Shu But Jia Xu dissuaded him saying Liu Bei is gone but surely he has confided the care of the state to Zhuge Liang who is indebted to him so deeplyHe will exhaust every effort to support his young lordYou may not hastily attack As Jia Xu tendered this remonstrance a man suddenly stepped out from the serried ranks of courtiers and said fiercely If you neglect this moment can you expect a more favorable opportunity All eyes turned to the speaker it was Sima YiThe interruption greatly pleased Cao Pi who at once asked how it was to be done He propounded his plan in the following speechIt would be very difficult to obtain success with our own resources Hence we must use five armies and attack all round at the same time so as to divide Zhuge Liang Where are the five armies to come from said Cao Pi Sima Yi went on The first is to be got from Liaodong from the Xianbi StateYou must write to King Kebi Neng and send him presents of gold and silks so that he may send one hundred thousand Qiang troops from Liaoxi to attack Xiping PassSecondly the king of the Mang Tribes Meng Huo must be persuaded to lead one hundred thousand troops to attack the south of Shu Yiazhou Yongchang Zangge and Yuesui Thirdly you must send an ambassador to Wu with fair promises of an increase of territory and so induce Sun Quan to march one hundred thousand troops to the attack of the Three Gorges making Fucheng his objectiveThe fourth army can be got from General Meng Da in Shangyong who can muster one hundred thousand troops to attack HanzhongLastly our own force of one hundred thousand troops may be placed under Cao Zhen who will attack by way of Yangping PassWith five hundred thousand troops making simultaneous attacks along five different directions it would be hard for Zhuge Liang to hold his own even if he had the talent of Lu Wang himself The scheme delighted Cao Pi who at once cast about for four glibtongued messengersHe also issued a commission to Cao Zhen as CommanderinChief with the order to take Yangping PassAt this time Zhang Liao and most others of the veterans who had served Cao Cao were keeping watch in various stations and passes and fords in Jizhou Xuzhou Qingzhou and Hefei They were not summoned for this expedition to the westAfter the accession of Liu Shan the Latter Ruler many of those who had served his father gradually died after the decease of their masterThe work of the administration of the country the choice of officials lawmaking taxation decision of legal cases was all done by the Prime MinisterAs the Latter Ruler had no consort the courtiers headed by Zhuge Liang proposed saying The daughter of the late General of the Chariot and Cavalry Zhang Fei prudent and she is now seventeen Your Majesty should make her Empress So Lady Zhang was married to the Emperor and so became Empress ZhangIt was in the autumn of the first year of Beginning Prosperity  that the Latter Ruler heard of the plans and intentions of Wei against his stateThe persons who told him gave him full details of the five armies and said they had previously told the Prime Minister But his conduct puzzles us said the informersWe do not know why he does not take some action instead of remaining shut up in his palace all the time The Latter Ruler became really alarmed and he sent one of his personal attendants to call the Prime Minister to courtThe servant was gone a long time and then returned to sayThe servants in the Prime Minister Palace said the Prime Minister was ill and not to be seen The young Emperors distress increased and he sent two high ministers Dong Yun and Du Qiongto Zhuge Liang saying they were to see him even if he was on his couch and tell him the dreadful news of invasion They went but they got no farther than the gate The keepers of the gate refused them admissionThen they confided their message in brief to the wardens of the gate who went inside with itAfter keeping them waiting a long time the wardens returned saying The Prime Minister is rather better and will be at court in the morning The two ministers sighed deeply as they wended their way to the Emperors palaceNext morning a great crowd of officers assembled at the gate of the Prime Ministers residence to wait for him to appear But he did not come outIt began to grow late and many of them were tired of waiting when at last Du Qiong went again to the Emperor and suggested saying Your Majesty should go in person and try to get Zhuge Liang to say what should be done The Latter Ruler then returned to his palace with the officials and told the Empress Dowager his trouble She was also alarmed What can he mean said sheThis does not look like acting in the spirit of the charge laid upon him by the late EmperorLet me go myself Oh no said Dong Yun Your Majesty must not goWe think all is well and the Prime Minister certainly understands and will do somethingBeside you must let His Majesty go first and if the Prime Minister still shows remissness then Your Majesty can summon him to the Temple of the Dynasty and ask him So it was left at thatAnd the next day the Emperor rode in his chariot to the gate of his ministerWhen the doorkeepers saw the imperial chariot appear they fell upon their knees to welcome the EmperorWhere is the Prime Minister asked heWe do not knowBut we have orders not to let in the crowd of officers The Emperor then descended and went on foot right in to the third gate Then he saw Zhuge Liang leaning on a staff beside a fishpond looking at the fishesThe Latter Ruler approached and stood behind him for a long time Presently the Latter Ruler said slowly and with dignity Is the Prime Minister really enjoying himself Zhuge Liang started and looked roundWhen he saw who the speaker was he suddenly dropped his staff and prostrated himself I ought to be put to death ten thousand times said Zhuge LiangBut the Emperor put forth his hand and helped him to rise saying Cao Pi threatens immediate invasion from five points why will you not come forth and attend to business Zhuge Liang laughedHe conducted the Emperor into an inner room and when he was seated Zhuge Liang addressed the Emperor saying Could it be possible that I was ignorant of these five armies I was not looking at the fishes I was thinking But this being so what shall we do I have already turned back that Kebi Neng of the Qiangs and Meng Huo of the Mangs and the rebel leader Meng Da and the army from WeiI have also thought out a plan to circumvent the army from Wu but I need a special sort of person to carry it out I want an envoy an able talker one capable of persuading other peopleIt was because I have not found such a person yet that I was so deeply in thoughtBut Your Majesty may set your mind at rest and not be anxious The Latter Ruler heard this half terrified and half glad Surely your superhuman devices are too deep for mortal humanBut may I ask how these armies have been made to turn back Since His late Majesty bade me take the best care of your welfare I dare not be remiss for a single momentSome officers in Chengdu are ignorant of that refinement of war which consists in not allowing the enemy to guess your plans How could I let them know anythingWhen I heard that Kebi Neng the king of Qiangs might invade I remembered that Ma Chaos forefathers were friendly with those tribespeople and they had a high opinion of Ma Chao thinking him a leader of supreme prestige So I sent orders by dispatch to Ma Chao to hold the Xiping Pass and to prepare ambushes in certain places and change them daily so as to keep the Qiangs off That settled themI sent hastily to the south to order Wei Yan to move certain bodies of troops about through the southwest territories to be seen and then to disappear to go in and come out and to march to and fro so that the Mangs should be perplexed The Mangs are brave but prone to doubts and hesitations and they would not advance in the face of the unknown Hence there is nothing to fear in that quarterI also knew that Meng Da and our Li Yan were sworn friendsI had left Li Yan in charge of the Palace of Eternal PeaceI sent Li Yan a letter and urged him to write to Meng Da so that Meng Da would feign illness and not move his armyI sent Zhao Yun to occupy Yangping Pass and all the strategic positions on the way by which Cao Zhen would march and bade him defend only and not go to the battleIf our troops refuse to come out Cao Zhen will certainly have to retireSo all those four are settledBut for greater security I have sent Zhang Bao and Guan Xing each with thirty thousand troops to camp at points whence they can quickly help any of the others who may need it And none of these arrangements are known here Now there is only Wu left to deal withHad the other four armies succeeded and Shu been in danger Sun Quan would have come to the attackIf the others fail I know he will not budge for he will remember that Cao Pi has just sent three armies to attack his country And this being so I want some one with a ready tongue and ingenious mind to go and talk plainly to Sun Quan So far I have not found such a person and I am perplexedI regret that I have given Your Majesty occasion to make this journey The Empress Dowager also wanted to come said the EmperorBut now you have spoken O Minister Father I am as one awakened from a dream I shall grieve no more They two drank a few cups of wine together and the Prime Minister escorted his master to his chariotA ring of courtiers were waiting and they could not help remarking the happiness that shone in their masters face The Latter Ruler took his leave and returned to his palace but the courtiers did not know what to thinkNow Zhuge Liang had noted a certain man among the crowd who smiled and looked quite happyZhuge Liang looked at him intently and then recollected his name which was Deng Zhi of Xinye a descendant of Regent Marshal Deng Yu of HanZhuge Liang sent a man privately to detain Deng Zhi and when all the others had gone Zhuge Liang led him into the library for a chat Presently he came to the matter near his heart The three states have become a fact said Zhuge LiangNow if our state wanted to absorb the other two and restore the condition of one rule which country should it attack first Though Wei is the real rebel yet Wei is strong and would be very difficult to overthrow Any move against it would have to develop slowlyAs our Emperor has but lately succeeded his father and the people are none too decided in his favor I should propose a treaty of mutual defense with WuThis would obliterate the enmity of His late Majesty and would have important results However you Sir may have another opinionWhat is it That is what I have been thinking of this long time but I had not the person for the taskNow I have found him What do you want the person to do said Deng ZhiI want him to go as envoy to Wu to negotiate such a treatyAs you understand the position so well you will surely do honor to your princes commission as envoyThere is no other who would succeed I fear I am not equal to such a taskI am not clever enough and too ignorant I will inform the Emperor tomorrow and beg him to appoint youOf course you will accept Deng Zhi consented and then took his leaveAs promised Zhuge Liang memorialized and the Latter Ruler consented that the mission should be entrusted to Deng Zhi And he startedThe din of war will cease in Wu When Shus desires are knownFor the success or failure of this mission read the next chapter CHAPTER Using Words Qin Mi Overcomes Zhang Wen Setting Fire Xu Sheng Defeats Cao PiAfter his recent exploits Lu Xun became the one hero of Wu He was given the title General Who Upholds the State was ennobled as Lord of Jiangling and received the Governorship of Jingzhou He became Supreme Commander of all the military forces Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong thinking the moment opportune for enhancing their lords dignity sent in a memorial proposing that his rule should be designated by a distinctive style and Sun Quan assumed Yellow Might as his reign style Then arrived a messenger from Wei and he was called in to an assembly and bidden to state his businessThe messenger said Recently Shu sent to Wei for help and the situation being misunderstood the Ruler of Wei dispatched a force against WuNow this action is greatly regretted In Wei it is thought desirable to set four armies in motion against Shu to capture it and if Wu will assist and success crown these efforts Wei and Wu will share the conquered territory Sun Quan listened but was not prepared to give a decided answerHe betook himself to his counselors Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong who said Lu Xun is the man of profound knowledge he should be consulted So Lu Xun was called and his speech ran thusCao Pi is too firmly established in the Middle Land to be upset now and if this offer of his be refused we shall provoke his enmityNeither Wei nor Wu so far as I see has any one fit to oppose Zhuge LiangWe must perforce consent and put our army in orderBut we can wait till we see how the four armies speed If Shu seems likely to fall and Zhuge Liang is outmaneuvered then our army can be dispatched and we will take Capital ChengduIf the four armies fail we shall have to consider So Sun Quan said to the envoy of Wei We are not ready at the moment so we will choose a day to start later And with this answer the envoy left Next they made careful inquiries about the success or failure of the four armies against ShuThe spies reportedThe western Qiangs under Kebi Neng have turned back when they saw Ma Chao in command at Xiping PassThe southern Mangs led by Meng Huo have been perplexed at the tactics of Wei Yan and have retreated to their territoriesThe Shangyong leader Meng Da have set out but half way have fallen ill and gone backAnd Cao Zhens army while marching toward Yangping Pass have been brought to a halt by the defensive preparations of Zhao Yun who has garrisoned every pass and occupied every point of vantage they have eventually retreated after being camped in the Xie Valley for some time Knowing all this Sun Quan said to his officials Lu Xuns words were indeed prophetic he made most perfect deductionsAny rash action on my part would place me on bad terms with Shu Just then the coming of an envoy from Shu was announcedSaid Zhang Zhao This mission is also part of Zhuge Liangs scheme to divert danger from Shu Deng Zhi has come as envoy That being so how should I reply asked Sun Quan I will tell youSet up a large cauldron and pour therein a quantity of oil Light a fire beneathWhen the oil is boiling choose a goodly company of your tallest and brawniest fighting guards arm them and draw them up in lines between the palace gate and your throne room Then summon Deng Zhi but before he can say a word forewarn him that he will have the same fate of being boiled in oil if being guilty of the same sort of treachery as Li Yiji when he was a persuader to the state of QiThen see what Deng Zhi will say Sun Quan followed this advice and prepared the cauldron of oil and had the strong guards ready Then he bade them introduce the envoyDeng Zhi came his ceremonial dress in perfect order and advanced as far as the gateSeeing the grim array of fighting men armed some with gleaming swords some with great axes some with long spears and some with short knives he understood at once what was meant but he never blenchedHe advanced quite steadily and bravely till he reached the door of the hallEven when he saw the boiling cauldron of oil and the savage executioners glaring at him he only smiledHe was led to the front of the curtain behind which sat the Prince of Wu and he made the ordinary salutation of raising his extended arms but he did not bow in obeisanceThe Prince bade his attendants roll up the curtain and called out Why do you not make an obeisance Deng Zhi boldly replied The envoy of the superior state does not make an obeisance to the ruler of a smaller country If you do not control that tongue of yours but will let it wag you will be like that fellow Li Yiji who went to talk to QiYou will soon find yourself in the cauldron Then Deng Zhi laughed aloud saying People say there are many sages in Wu no one would believe that they would be frightened of a simple scholar This reply only increased Sun Quans anger and he said Who fears an unmerited fool like you If you fear not the envoy why so anxious about what he may have to say Because you come here as spokesman of Zhuge Liang and you want me to sever with Wei and turn to your country is not that your message I am a simple scholar of Shu and I am come to explain matters to the state of Wu But here I find armed guards and a boiling cauldron all prepared against a simple envoyHow can I form any other opinion than that you will not allow me to speak As soon as Sun Quan heard these words he bade the soldiers go and called the envoy into the hallThere he invited him to a seat and said What is the real matter between Wei and WuI desire that you would inform me Then Deng Zhi replied Do you great Prince desire to discuss peace with Wei or with Shu I really desire to discuss peace with the Ruler of ShuBut he is young and inexperienced and ignorant and unable to carry a matter through Prince you are a valiant warrior just as Zhuge Liang is a great ministerNow Shu has the strength of its mountainous geography just as Wu has the protection of its three rivers If these two countries are at peace they are mutually protective They may swallow up the rest of the empire or they may stand secure aloneIf you send tribute to Wei and acknowledge yourself one of its ministers you will be expected to attend at court and your heirapparent will become a servant in that court and if you disobey an army of Wei will be sent to attack youShu also will come down the river and invade your country Then this country will be yours no longerAnd if you listen not to these words of mine and refuse my offer I shall commit suicide before your face and so justify the post I have as an envoy As Deng Zhi spoke these last words he gathered up his robes and marched down the hall as though he was just going to jump into the cauldronStop him cried Sun Quan and they did so Then he requested Deng Zhi to go into an inner apartment where he treated the envoy as a guest of the highest honorO Master said Sun Quan your words exactly express my thoughts and I desire to make a league of peace with your countryAre you willing to be the intermediary Just now it was you O Prince who wished to boil this poor servant now it is also you who wish to use himHow can such a doubtful person be trusted My mind is made up replied Sun QuanDo not doubt me Master Deng Zhi was detained and a conclave of officers gatheredSaid Sun Quan to the assembly Under my hand are all eightyone counties of the southeast and I have the lands of Jingzhou to boot yet I am not so well off as that little country of Shu for Shu has Deng Zhi for an envoy and he glorifies his lordI have no one to send to declare my wishes to Shu Then one stepped forth and said he would goThe speaker was Zhang Wen of Wucheng who held the office of Imperial CommanderSir I fear that when you reach Shu and are in the presence of Zhuge Liang you will not explain my real sentiments said Sun QuanZhang Wen replied Think you that I shall fear himHe also is but a man Sun Quan conferred great gifts on Zhang Wen and sent him on the return mission to Shu to negotiate the league of peaceWhile Deng Zhi was absent Zhuge Liang said to his lord This mission to Wu will succeed and of the many wise people in the east one will come as return envoyYour Majesty should treat him with courtesy and let him return to Wu to complete the leagueFor if we have an alliance with Wu Wei will not dare to send an army against us And if we are safe from those quarters I will lead an expedition to subdue the Mangs in the south country After that we can deal with WeiIf Wei is reduced Wu will not last long and the whole empire will again be under one ruler Presently the report reached the capital that Deng Zhi and Zhang Wen as envoy of Wu would soon arriveThe Latter Ruler assembled the courtiers to receive them honorably The envoy of Wu carried himself as one who had attained his desires and advanced boldlyHaving made his salute the Latter Ruler gave him to sit on a brocaded stool on his left hand A banquet followed at which Zhang Wen was treated with much honorAt the end of the banquet the whole court escorted the envoy to the guesthouse where he was to lodgeOn the second day there was a banquet at the Prime Ministers palace and Zhuge Liang broached the real businessHe said Our First Ruler was not on friendly terms with Wu But that is all changed as is demonstrated by these banquets and our present Emperor is disposed to be very friendly It is hoped that the former enmity may be entirely forgotten and the two countries swear eternal friendship and alliance in their common endthe destruction of WeiI look to you Sir to speak in favor of this league Zhang Wen said that he would support the planThe wine went merrily round and as the envoy became mellow he laughed freely and swaggered and put on a proud demeanorNext day the Latter Ruler gave Zhang Wen rich presents of gold and studs and prepared a parting banquet for him in the south guestchamber and all the court assembled to take leave of himThe Prime Minister paid him assiduous attention and pressed him to drinkWhile this banquet was in progress a man suddenly came in as if he were already drunk made a proud sort of salutation to the company and at once took a seatHis conduct seemed strange to Zhang Wen who asked Who is the new comer Sir Prime Minister He is a man named Qin Mi a Doctorate Academician of Yiazhou replied Zhuge LiangHe may be that said Zhang Wen with a laugh but I wonder if he has any learning at all inside him Qin Mi listened without changing countenance and said Since our children are all learned of course I am more so What may have been your special studies Sir said Zhang Wen Everythingastronomy on one hand geography on the other the three teachings and the nine systems all the philosophers history all through and all sacred books and traditionsThere is nothing I have not read Since you talk so big said Zhang Wen I should like to ask you a few questions on celestial mattersNow has the sky a head Yes it has a head Where is it In the western quarter the Odes say God turns his head kindly toward the west and further it follows from this that the head is in the west Well has the sky ears Oh yes The sky is above and listens to all things belowThe Odes say The crane calls from the midst of the marsh its cry is heard by the sky How could the sky hear without ears Has the sky feet It has the Odes say Heaven treads down difficulties If there were no feet how could it tread Has heaven a name Why not Then what is it Liu How do you know that Because the Emperors family name is Liu and he is the Son of HeavenThat is how I know Does the sun spring from the east Though it does yet it sets in the west All this time Qin Mis repartees had flashed back clear and perfect they came so naturally as to astonish all the guests Zhang Wen had no word to reply to themThen it became Qin Mis turn You are a famous scholar in your own land Sir and since you have asked so many questions about Heaven I take it you are I well up in all celestial mattersWhen original chaos resolved into its two elements negativity and positivity  the lighter portion rose and became sky and the grosser sank and solidified into earthWhen Gong Gongs rebellion was crushed his head struck the Imperfect Mountain the pillar which upholds heaven was broken and the bonds of earth were destroyed Heaven fell over to the northwest and earth sank into the southeastSince heaven was ethereal and had floated to the top how could it fall overAnother thing I do not know is what is beyond the etherI should be glad if you would explain Master Zhang Wen had no reply ready but he rose from his place and bowed his acknowledgment saying I knew not that there was so much ability in this landI am happy to have heard such a discourseNow all obstructions have disappeared and I see quite clearly But Zhuge Liang fearing lest the guest should feel mortified soothed him with fair words saying This is all play upon words the sort of puzzles one propounds at a merry feastYou honored Sir know that the tranquillity and safety of states are no matters to joke with The envoy bowedThen Deng Zhi was ordered to return to Wu and thank its ruler for his courtesy and he was to accompany Zhang WenSo both having taken leave of the Prime Minister set out on their journey to the east In the meantime Sun Quan was beginning to feel perplexed at the long delay of his envoyHe had summoned a council to discuss this question when the report came that his own envoy had returned and Deng Zhi was with himThey were brought in forthwith and Zhang Wen having made his obeisance began to discourse upon the virtue of the Ruler of Shu and Zhuge Liang and to lay before his lord the proposal for a league of peaceDeng Zhi the Chair of the Secretariat was empowered to discuss this matterTurning to Deng Zhi Sun Quan said Would it not be a happy result if tranquillity should be restored to the empire by the destruction of Wei and Wu and Shu should share its administration The sky knows not two suns replied Deng Zhi nor can the people recognize two kingsIf Wei be destroyed no one can say upon whom the divine command will devolveBut one who becomes a prince must perfect his virtue and those who become ministers must be wholly loyalIn this way strife will cease Sun Quan smiled saying And your sincerity is beyond question Deng Zhi was dismissed with rich gifts and after this Wu and Shu were good friends The negotiations between his two rivals were reported in Capital Luoyang without loss of time and Cao Pi was very angryIf they have made an alliance it can only mean that they cherish the intention of swallowing the Middle LandMy best move is to strike first He called a great councilThis council lacked the presence of Regent Marshal Cao Ren and High Counselor Jia Xu who had both diedIn the council Counselor Xin Pi stepped forward and said The country is extensive but the population so sparse that no successful army could be raised just nowMy advice is to wait ten years spending that period in forming an army and in cultivating the land till stores and weapons shall have been accumulatedThen both our rivals may be destroyed This is only the distorted opinion of a perverted pedant Having made this league Shu and Wu may fall upon us at any momentThis matter cannot be postponed for ten years said the Ruler of WeiAn edict appeared commanding the enlistment of soldiers and the formation of an army to subdue WuSima Yi then said Battleships are necessary as Wu is protected by the Great RiverYour Majesty must lead small and big vessels The navy can advance by way of River Huai taking Shouchun When you reach Guangling the river is to be crossed and Nanxu is to be capturedThen Wu will be subdued This plan was accepted and the construction of dragon ships was put in hand and went on day and night Ten were built two hundred spans long to carry two thousand marines each They also collected three thousand fighting shipsIn the autumn of the fifth year of Yellow Dawn  the various generals assembled and Cao Zhen was appointed leader of the first corps Zhang Liao Zhang He Wen Ping and Xu Huang were Chief Commanders Xu Chu and Lu Qian were guards of the center army and Cao Xiu commanded the rear guard the strategists were Liu Ye and Jiang JiIn all land and marine forces numbered over three hundred thousand troopsWhen the starting day was decided upon Sima Yi was made Chair of the Secretariat and left in the capital with the powers of Regent MarshalThe spies told the Prince of Wus attendants of the dangers and the latter hastened to inform the Prince They said Cao Pi is leading the dragon fleet and commanding three hundred thousand marines and ground forces against the South Land and the danger is very great When Sun Quan met his council Gu Yong said My lord you can call upon Shu for help according to the treatyWrite to Zhuge Liang and get him to send out an army through Hanzhong so as to divert part of Weis armyAlso you send an army to Nanxu to oppose them there I shall have to recall Lu Xun said the PrinceHe is the only man to undertake this great task Do not move him if you can help it he is necessary for the protection of Jingzhou Yes I know but there is no other strong enough to help me At these words Xu Sheng advanced saying I know I am not very able but I desire to be given an army to meet this dangerIf Cao Pi crosses the river in person I will make him prisoner and present him at the gate of your palaceIf he does not come over here I will slay so many of his soldiers that his army shall not dare even to look southward Sun Quan was pleased to find a willing volunteer and replied Noble Sir what anxiety need I feel if I have your protection Xu Sheng was given the title of General Who Protects the East and made Chief Commander of all the forces in Nanxu and JianyeAs soon as he had received his orders he retiredHe gave command to gather enormous quantities of weapons and had many flags and banners made for the protection of the river banksBut another impetuous young leader was anxious to take more vigorous measures and he stood forth saying My lord has laid upon you O General a heavy responsibility but if you really desire to destroy the invading force and capture Cao Pi you should send an army to meet him on the north side in the South of River HuaiI fear failure if you wait till the northern troops have come this far The young man was Sun Shao nephew of the Prince of WuHe had already the title of General Who Possesses Wide Prestige and was in command at GuanglingThough young and impetuous he was very valiantCao Pis army is strong and its leaders famousI hold that we may not cross the river to meet him but wait the arrival of his ships on the other sideThen I shall carry out my plan said Xu Sheng I have three thousand troops of my own and I know the country about Guangling thoroughly Let me go across the river and fight a battleI will willingly undergo the penalty if I fail said Sun ShaoHowever Xu Sheng refused and all the pleadings of his impetuous general were vainAnd when he still persisted the Commander grew angry and said What control shall I have if you are allowed to disobey orders Xu Sheng ordered the lictors to take Sun Shao out and put him to death They led him away and forthwith the black flag was hoistedBut one of Sun Shaos generals went off in hot haste to tell Sun Quan who came immediately to try to save his favorite Happily the execution had not been accomplished when the Prince appeared on the scene and he bade the executioners disperse The youth was savedSun Shao began to press his claim to the Prince saying I have been at Guangling and if we do not attack the enemy there but let him get down to the river there will be an end of Wu Sun Quan went into the camp and Xu Sheng came to receive himWhen the Prince was seated in his tent Xu Sheng said O Prince you placed me in command of the force to repulse WeiNow this general of mine Sun Shao is disobedient and should suffer deathI would ask why he should be pardoned He is naturally hot and impetuousHe has been guilty of disobedience but I hope you will overlook his fault The law is none of my making nor is it yours O Prince it is a state penalty and if relationship is enough to evade it where is discipline He has offended and you have the right to judge and punishBut although his real name is Yu Shao yet my brother Sun Ce loved him and gave him our family nameHe has rendered me good service and if he should be put to death I should fail in my fraternal duty Since you have intervened O Prince I remit the death penalty Sun Quan bade his nephew thank his chief but the youth would not make an obeisance On the contrary he loudly maintained the correctness of his viewI can only lead my troops against Cao Pi and so die cried Sun ShaoI cannot consent to the other plan Xu Shengs countenance changed The recalcitrant young man was ordered to leave the tent by Sun QuanHe will not be any loss said Sun Quan and I will not employ him again Then the Prince left and returned to his own placeThat night they reported to Xu Sheng that Sun Shao had gone secretly over the river with his own three thousand troops and the Commander who did not wish him to come to harm as evidently that would displease the Prince sent a force to support him Ding Feng was chosen to command this reinforcement and he was told what to doThe Ruler of Wei in his dragon ships reached Guangling and the van got to the river bank He came to survey the positionHow many soldiers are on the other bank asked Cao PiCao Zhen replied I have not seen a single one nor are there any flags or encampments That is a ruse I will go and find out So Cao Pi set out to cross the river in one of the dragon shipsHe anchored under the bank On his boat were displayed the imperial emblems of dragon phoenix sun moon and they shone out bravelySeated in the ship the Emperor looked up and down the south bank but not a man was visibleDo you think we should cross asked the Emperor of his strategistsIf the rules of war mean anything they ought to be preparedWe think Your Majesty should exercise cautionWait a few days and watchThen perhaps the van might be sent to make a reconnaissance So I think said the Ruler of WeiBut as it is now late we will pass the night on the river It was a dark night and the ships was brilliantly lighted up it seemed like day on boardBut all along the south bank there appeared no glimmer of light What do you think it means said Cao PiThe courtiers replied They heard that Your Majestys heavenly army was coming and ran away like so many rats The Ruler of Wei laughed to himselfWhen daylight came there came with it a thick fog so that nothing on the bank could be seenAfter a time a breeze blew off the fog and then to their immense surprise they found that the whole length of the South of the Great River as far as they could see was one battlement with towers at intervals while spears and swords glittered in the sun and flags and pennons fluttered in the breezeIn just a short time several reports came A long wall by the Great River has grown up in a night and stood there with carts and masts of ships lying along it stretching some one hundred miles from Shidou to Nanxu The fact was that the wall was an imitation and the warriors that manned it were bundles of reeds dressed in soldiers uniforms But the sight chilled the ardor of the invaders My hosts of troops are no use against such warriors we can do nothing against those talents of the South Land said Cao PiHe thought over this sadly enough But now the wind had increased in force and white combers began to heave up in the river and waters broke over his boat drenching the dragon robes The ship seemed as if it would roll right overSo Cao Zhen sent out small boats to rescue his master and his people But they were too affrighted to moveWherefore Wen Ping who was in charge leaped on board and helped the Emperor down into one of the smaller craft which then flew away before the wind and got safely into a creek Soon came a hasty messenger to reportZhao Yun is marching out through Yangping Pass and threatening Changan This frightened Cao Pi so badly that he decided to retreat and gave orders to retireThe whole army were in a mood to run away and moved off toward the north pursued by the troops of WuTo hasten the march the Ruler of Wei bade his soldiers abandon all the imperial paraphernalia and impedimentsThe dragon ships withdrew into River Huai one by one As they moved in disorder suddenly arose the sounds of an enemy force shouts and the rolling of drums and the blaring of trumpets and a cohort marched down obliquely on to their line And at the head was Sun ShaoThe troops of Wei could make no effective stand and many were slain while large numbers were driven into the river and drownedBy dint of great efforts the Emperor was saved and got away up the riverBut when they had sailed about ten miles they saw ahead a tract of blazing reeds The enemy had poured fish oil over the dry reeds and set them afireThe wind was spreading the flames down river toward the fleet of Wei and the heat was intense The dragon ships had to stopCao Pi was put into a smaller craft and taken on shore his larger ships were presently set on fire and destroyedThey mounted the Emperor on a horse and moved along the bank but soon they fell in with another body of troopsThis time it was the supports under Ding FengZhang Liao rode ahead to engage the leader but was soon wounded by an arrow of Ding Feng in the loins However he was helped away by Xu Huang and the Ruler of Wei was got safely out of the turmoilThe loss of soldiers was heavy and a huge booty of horses carts ships and weapons fell to the victorsSo the Wei armies went away north thoroughly beaten while Xu Sheng had scored a great successSun Quan richly rewarded him Zhang Liao got to Xuchang but only to die from the effects of his wound He was honorably buried by the Ruler of WeiIt has been said that Zhao Yun was threatening Changan but soon after he went through Yangping Pass the Prime Minister of Shu sent a dispatch to recall him because Veteran General Yong Kai in Yiazhou had joined himself with the Mangs and invaded the four southern territoriesSo Zhao Yun returnedMeanwhile Ma Chao was ordered to take command of Yangping Pass The Prime Minister was about to go to subdue the nations along the south border He was then preparing at Chengdu for this expeditionFirst Wu met Wei and drove them north Then Shu against the Mangs went southThe story of this campaign will follow in the next chaptersCHAPTER  Conquering The South Mang The Prime Minister Marches The Army Opposing Heaven Troops The King Of The Mangs Is Captured With Prime Minister Zhuge Liangs administration of affairs in the two Lands of Rivers began a period of happiness and prosperity for the peopleTranquillity prevailed and the state of society was well nigh perfect doors unbolted at night property left by the roadside remaining untouched till the owner returned for itMoreover the harvests were rich year after year and old and young with fair round bellies well lined simply sang with joy The people hastened to fulfill their state duties and vied with each other in the performance of all artsAs a natural consequence all military preparations were perfect the granaries bursting with grain and the treasury full to overflowingSuch was the state of things when in the third year of Beginning Prosperity  the news came from Yiazhou to the capital to report The Mang King Meng Huo leading one hundred thousand Mang tribesmen has invaded the south and is laying waste the country Yong Kai the Governor of Jianning a descent of the Han Lord Yong Chi of Shifang had joined Meng Huo to rebelZhu Bao and Gao Ding the Governors of Zangge and Yuesui have yielded to the invaders but the Governor of Yongchang Wang Kang is staunchly holding outThe three rebelsYong Kai Gao Ding and Zhu Bao who had joined the invaders are now acting as guides and assisting in the attack on Yongchang which has remained faithfulGovernor Wang Kang ably assisted by Lu Kai one of his subordinates is making a desperate effort to defend the city with only its ordinary inhabitants as fighting menThe position is very desperate When this news came Zhuge Liang went into the palace and thus memorialized to his lord The contumacy of the Mangs is a real danger to our stateI feel it incumbent upon me to lead an expedition to reduce the tribespeople to obedience But the Latter Ruler was afraid and said Sun Quan is in the east and Cao Pi the north if you abandon me and either of them comes what shall do Your Majesty need have no fearWe have just concluded a league of peace with Wu and I think they will be true to their pledgeLi Yan in Baidicheng is quite a match for Lu XunCao Pis recent defeat has taken the keenness out of his army so that he will not feel inclined to make any expeditions furtherMa Chao is in command at the passes between Wei and HanzhongI shall also leave Guan Xing and Zhang Bao with forces to reinforce any point where danger may appear I can assure Your Majesty that no untoward event will happen I am going to sweep clean the Mang country so that we may have a free hand to attack Wei when the day comesThus I shall be enabled to requite the honor paid me by your father the First Ruler who came thrice to seek me and who doubled my obligation when he confided to me the care of his son Indeed I am young and ignorant replied the Latter Ruler and can only exist with you to decide for me At that moment Counselor Wang Lian a man of Nanyang stepped forward crying No no Sir you may not goThe South Mang is a wild country reeking with malariaIt is wrong that an officer of state in such an exalted and responsible position should go away on a distant expeditionThese rebels and barbarians are but an irritation not a disease and an ordinary leader would be enough to send against themHe would not fail Zhuge Liang replied This country of the Mangs is distant and mostly uncivilized To reduce them to reasonableness will be difficult and I feel I ought to goWhen to be harsh and when to show leniency are matters to be decided on at the moment and instructions cannot be easily given to another Zhuge Liang steadily opposed all Wang Lians efforts to bring about a change of intention and he soon took leave of the Latter Ruler and made ready to startJiang Wan was Army Counselor of the expedition Fei Yi Recorder Fan Jian and Dong Jue Army Inspectors Zhao Yun and Wei Yan Commanders Wang Ping and Zhang Yi Deputy GeneralsBeside these were other half a hundred leaders and officers of Shu and the whole force was five hundred thousand troopsSoon after the force marched south to Yiazhou Guan Suo the third son of Guan Yu appeared and wished to see Zhuge Liang and he said After the fall of Jingzhou I was hidden by the Bao family from where I wanted to go to the Lands of Rivers to ask for a revenge for my father but I fell in illness which was long and severe and I only just recovered I was then traveling toward Chengdu to meet with the Emperor when I met the army in the south expedition I know that vengeance has been taken on the murderers of my fatherAnd now I want to present myself to the Prime Minster Zhuge Liang was greatly affected to see himHe sent news of the young mans arrival to the court and gave Guan Suo a post of Van LeaderThe army foot and horse marched in the best of order eating when hungry drinking when thirsty camping at night and moving by day No plundering was permitted and the people suffered not at allWhen Yong Kai and his fellow rebels heard that Zhuge Liang was marching against them they called their troops together and formed three divisions Gao Ding in the center Yong Kai on the left and Zhu Bao on the rightThey mustered about fifty thousand troops in each army and they went to oppose the march of the Shu armyGao Ding sent E Huan to lead the vanThis E Huan was nine spans tall in stature but savage of countenance His weapon was a twobladed halberd He was very valiant and could face many warriors He led his own cohort out in advance of the main body and fell in with the leading bodies of the Shu army immediately after they had got into YiazhouThe two sides drew up for battle and the arrays being complete Wei Yan rode out and vilified the rebels shouting O MalcontentBe quick to surrender Instead E Huan galloped out and fought with Wei YanAfter a few bouts Wei Yan seemed to be bested and fled But this was only a ruseAs E Huan followed the gongs clanged and from left and right poured out Zhang Yi and Wang PingWei Yan turned around and three generals besieged and captured E HuanHe was taken to the tent of Zhuge Liang who bade his attendants loose his bonds gave him wine and comforted himThen Zhuge Liang asked Whom do you belong to E Huan replied I am one of the generals under Gao Ding I know Gao Ding as a loyal and good sort but he has been led away by this Yong KaiNow I shall release you but you are to bring Gao Ding to his senses and see to it that he comes to surrender and avoids grave disaster E Huan thanked him and withdrew He went to his own side and soon saw Gao Ding He told Gao Ding what Zhuge Liang had said and Zhuge Liangs kindly feeling deeply affected Gao DingNext day Yong Kai came over to Gao Dings camp to visit himAfter the exchange of salutations Yong Kai asked How did E Huan manage to return Zhuge Liang released him out of pure kindness replied Gao DingThis is a ruse of his to separate you from mehe wishes to make us enemies Gao Ding almost believed this too and he was much perplexedJust then the watchers reported that the leaders of Shu had come up and were offering battle So Yong Kai led out thirty thousand troops to take up the challenge But after the third encounter he fled Wei Yan pursued him and smote for a distance of seven milesNext day Yong Kai challenged but the soldiers of Shu refused to fight and remained within their lines for three daysOn the fourth day Yong Kai and Gao Ding divided their troops into two parts and came to attack the campNow Zhuge Liang had told Wei Yan to wait for this double attack and so when it came to pass both divisions fell into an ambush and suffered great loss many being killed and more capturedThe prisoners were taken to the camp and the soldiers belonging to the two leadersYong Kai and Gao Dingwere confined separatelyThen Zhuge Liang told the soldiers to let it be known that only those belonging to Gao Ding would be spared the others would be put to death When time had been given for this story to spread among the prisoners Yong Kais troops were brought up to the commanders tentWhose soldiers were you asked Zhuge LiangGao Dings cried they all falselyThen they were all pardoned and after being given wine and food they were taken to the frontier and set freeNext the real Gao Dings soldiers were brought forward and the same question was put to themWe all really belong to Gao Dings command said theyIn like manner they were pardoned and refreshed with wine and foodThen Zhuge Liang addressed them saying Yong Kai has just sent a messenger to ask that he may surrender and he offers to bring with him the heads of Gao Ding and Zhu Bao as a proof of meritBut I will not receive him and you since you are Gao Dings soldiers shall be released and allowed to return to himBut let there be no ingratitude and fighting again for if there is I certainly will not pardon you next time So they thanked their liberator and went awayAs soon as they reached their own camp they told the whole story Then Gao Ding sent a spy to the camp of Yong Kai to find out what was doingThere the spy met those who had been released and they were all talking about Zhuge Liangs kindness and many of them were inclined to desert their own camp for the otherAlthough this seemed very satisfactory yet Gao Ding did not feel convinced and he sent another man to Zhuge Liangs camp to try to verify the rumorBut this man was captured and taken before the CommanderinChief who pretended that he thought the spy belonged to Yong Kai and said to him Why has your leader failed to send me the heads of Gao Ding and Zhu Bao as he promisedYou lot are not very clever and what are you come to spy out The soldier muttered and mumbled in confusionBut Zhuge Liang gave the man wine and food and then wrote a letter which he handed to the spy saying You give this letter to your commander Yong Kai and tell him to get the job done quickly The spy took the letter and got awayAs soon as he reached camp he gave the letter to Gao Ding and also the messageGao Ding read the missive and became very angry I have ever been true to him and yet he wants to kill me It is hard to be either friendly or reasonable Then he decided to take E Huan into his confidence and called himE Huan was much prejudiced in favor of Zhuge Liang and said Zhuge Liang is a most benevolent man and it would be ill to turn our backs upon himIt is Yong Kais fault that we are now rebels and our best course would be to slay him and betake ourselves to Zhuge Liang How could it be done asked Gao Ding Invite him to a banquetIf he refuses it means he is a traitor and then you can attack him in front while I will lie in wait behind his camp to capture him as he runs away They agreed to try this plan the banquet was prepared and Yong Kai invitedBut as Yong Kais mind was full of suspicion from what his returned soldiers had said he would not comeThat night as soon as darkness fell Gao Ding attacked his campNow the soldiers who had been released were imbued with the goodness of Gao Ding all quite ready to help him fightOn the other hand Yong Kais troops mutinied against him and so Yong Kai mounted his steed and fledBefore he had gone far he found his road blocked by the cohort under E Huan who galloped out with his halberd and confronted the fugitive Yong Kai could not defend himself and was struck down E Huan decapitated himAs soon as they knew he was dead his troops joined themselves to Gao Ding who then went and surrendered to Zhuge LiangZhuge Liang received Gao Ding sitting in state in his tent but at once ordered the lictors to decapitate Gao DingBut Gao Ding said Influenced by your kindness Sir I have brought the head of my colleague as a proof of the sincerity of my surrender why should I die You come with false intent do you think you can hoodwink me said Zhuge Liang laughing What proof have you that I am false Zhuge Liang drew a letter from his box and said Zhu Bao sent this secretly to say he wished to surrender and he said you and Yong Kai were sworn friends to death How could you suddenly change your feelings and slay himThat is how I know your treachery Zhu Bao only tried to make trouble cried Gao Ding kneeling Zhuge Liang still refused to believe him and said I cannot believe you without more solid proofIf you would slay Zhu Bao I could take that as proving you were sincere in your surrender Do not doubt meWhat if I go and capture this man If you did that my doubts would be set at rest Thereupon Gao Ding and his subordinate E Huan led away their troops to the camp of Zhu BaoWhen they were about three miles from his camp Zhu Bao appeared with a cohortAs soon as they recognized each other Zhu Bao hastily came forward to parleyBut Gao Ding cried out to him Why did you write a letter to the Prime Minister and so intrigue with him to get me killed Zhu Bao stared open mouthed and could not replyThen E Huan rode out from behind his chief and struck Zhu Bao with his halberd so that he fell to the groundThereupon Gao Ding shouted The soldiers should either yield or be slain And they yielded in a body Gao Ding then went back to Zhuge Liang and offered the head of the man just slain Zhuge Liang laughed againI have made you kill both these as a proof of loyalty Then he created Gao Ding Governor of Yiazhou and chief of three territories while E Huan was made GeneralThus the three divisions were disposed of and troubled the peace no moreGovernor Wang Kang of Yongchang then came out of the city and welcomed Zhuge Liang and when Zhuge Liang had made his entry into that city he called Wang Kang and asked Who has aided you in the defense of this city The Governor said The safety of this city is due entirely to Lu Kai So Lu Kai was calledHe came and bowedZhuge Liang said Long since I heard of you as a remarkable person of this area We are greatly indebted to you for its safetyNow we wish to conquer the Mangs have you any advice to offer Lu Kai then produced a map of the country and presented it saying From the time of my appointment I have felt certain that the southern tribespeople would rise against you and so I sent secret agents to map out the country and find the strategic pointsFrom that information I prepared this map which I call The Plan to Subdue the Mangs I beg you Sir to accept it as it may be of use Then Zhuge Liang took Lu Kai into his service as Military Adviser and GuideWith Lu Kais help Zhuge Liang advanced and penetrated deeply into the countryWhile the army was advancing there came a messenger from the courtWhen he appeared Zhuge Liang saw it was Ma Su and he was clothed in white He was in mourning for his brother Ma Liang who had just diedHe said I come by special command of the Emperor with gifts of wine and silks for the soldiers When the ceremonies proper on receipt of a mandate from the Emperor had been performed and the gifts distributed as instructed Ma Su was asked to remain to talk over mattersZhuge Liang said I have His Majestys command to conquer these MangsI hear you have some advice to offer and I should be pleased if you would instruct me Yes I have one thing to say that may be worth thinking overThese people refuse to recognize our supremacy because they think their country is distant and difficultIf you should overcome them today tomorrow they would revoltWherever your army marches they are overcome and submit but the day you withdraw the army and attack Cao Pi they will renew their attackIn arms even it is best to attack hearts rather than cities to fight with sentiment is better than to fight with weaponsIt will be well if you can win them over You read my inmost thoughts said Zhuge LiangThen Ma Su was retained with the army as Military Adviser and the army marched onWhen the King of the Mangs Meng Huo heard how cleverly Zhuge Liang had got rid of Yong Kai he called together the leaders of the Three Ravines to discuss mattersThe chief of the first Ravine was Jinhua Sanjie of the second Dongtu Na and of the third Ahui NanThese having come to the Kings place he said to them Zhuge Liang and his Grand Army has invaded our country and we must exert our united strength to drive out the invadersYou three must lead your forces and whoever conquers the enemy shall be chief of chiefs It was arranged that Jinhua Sanjie should march in the center division Dongtu Na on the left and Ahui Nan on the right Each division was fifty thousand tribesmenWhen the scouts made out that the Mang armies were coming they at once told Zhuge Liang who called Zhao Yun and Wei Yan to his side but gave them no ordersNext he sent for Wang Ping and Ma Zhong and said to them I cannot send Zhao Yun and Wei Yan against the Mangs because they do not know the countryYou two are to go one against each wing and the two veteran warriors shall support youGet your troops ready and start tomorrow at dawn Wang Ping and Ma Zhong took the orders and went out Then Zhang Yi and Zhang Ni were given ordersYou two are to march against the center army you are to act with Wang Ping and Ma Zhong tomorrowI want to send Zhao Yun and Wei Yan but I am still afraid they do not know the country well Zhang Yi and Zhang Ni also received the orders and went outZhao Yun and Wei Yan now began to feel hurtNoticing this Zhuge Liang said I have no wish to pass you over you two but I fear that if you get too deeply into the country and should fall victims to the Mangs it will have an ill effect on the others But what if we did know the geography of the country said Zhao YunAll I say to you is to be careful how you do anything replied Zhuge LiangThe two soldiers left and went together to the camp of Zhao Yun Zhao Yun said We are greatly ashamed at being put in the background because we do not know the country We cannot bear this Then let us ride out and survey said his colleagueLet us capture a few natives and make them show us the road and let us defeat these tribesmen They rode offBefore they had gone far they saw a cloud of dust in the distanceClimbing a hill to get a better view they saw a small party of mounted Mangs coming toward themThe two waited till they were near and then suddenly burst outThe Mangs taken entirely by surprise ran away all but a few who yielded themselves prisoners The two warriors returned to camp The prisoners were given wine and food and when they had satisfied their hunger they were questionedSaid they The camp of Chief Jinhua Sanjie is just in front just by the entrance to the mountainsNear the camp running east and west is the Five ValleysThe camps of the other two chiefsDongtu Na and Ahui Nanare behind Having listening to this information Zhao Yun and Wei Yan got together five thousand troops took the captured men as guides and marched out about the second watchIt was a clear night and the moon gave light to march byThe first camp was reached about the fourth watch The Mang soldiers were already awake and preparing their morning meal as they intended to attack at daylightSuddenly Zhao Yun and Wei Yan gave a signal of attack and their troops poured forward The vigorous and unexpected attack of the two generals threw the camp into confusionZhao Yun fought into the center of the camp and encountered Jinhua SanjieBoth leaders engaged and Zhao Yun slew Jinhua Sanjie by a spear thrust Then Zhao Yun dismounted and cut off the head of the ChiefThen Wei Yan took half the force and went west to the second camp while Zhao Yun marched east to the third oneBy the time they reached the camps day had dawned The Mangs also had news of Wei Yans coming and drew up the camp to opposeBut when they had got clear there was a great uproar behind them at the stockade gates and confusion followedThe reason was the arrival of Wang PingBetween the two bodies the Mangs were beatenTheir Chief Dongtu Na forced his way out and got away Wei Yans soldiers followed but they could not catch him When Zhao Yun led his troops east to attack the third camp in the rear Ma Zhong made an attack on the frontThey scored a success but the Chief Ahui Nan escapedThey returned to headquarters and Zhuge Liang said The three parties of Mangs have fled and Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan escaped where is the head of Jinhua Sanjie Zhao Yun produced it At the same time he reportedDongtu Na and Ahui Nan escaped by abandoning their horses and going over the hillsTherefore we could not be followed They are already prisoners said Zhuge Liang with a laugh The fighting men could not credit itBut soon after Zhang Ni brought out Dongtu Na and Zhang Yi Ahui NanWhen the Shu leaders expressed surprise and admiration Zhuge Liang said I had studied the map and knew the positions of the camps I taunted Zhao Yun and Wei Yan into making a supreme effort into the camp of Jinhua Sanjie at the same time that I sent other forces under Wang Ping and Ma Zhong with the purpose to support Zhao Yun and Wei Yan and to force Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan to fleeI felt certain the two chiefs would run away along those small roads and I set soldiers under Zhang Ni and Zhang Yi on those roads to wait for themThey also were supported They all bowed saying The Prime Ministers calculations are divine and incomprehensible The two captive chiefs were then calledAs soon as they appeared Zhuge Liang loosed their bonds gave them refreshments and released them bidding them offend no more They thanked him for their liberty and disappeared along a byroadThen Zhuge Liang said to his generals Tomorrow Meng Huo will come in person to make an attackWe shall probably capture him again Then he summoned Zhao Yun and Wei Yan and gave them orders They left each with five thousand troops Next he sent Wang PingAnd then he sat in his tent to wait for the resultThe King of the Mangs was sitting in his tent when the scouts told him that his three chiefs had been captured and their armies scatteredIt made him very angry and he quickly got his army ready to march Soon he met Wang Ping and when the armies were arrayed Wang Ping rode out to the front saber in his handThe flaunting banners of the array formation of his foes then opened out and he saw their ranksMany generals were on horseback on both sides In the middle was the King who advanced to the front He wore a golden inlaid headdress his belt bore a lions face as clasp his boots had pointed toes and were green he rode a frizzyhaired horse the color of a red hare he carried at his waist a pair of swords chased with the pine amber He looked haughtily at his foes and then turning to his generals said It has always been said that Zhuge Liang is a wonderful soldier but I see that is falseLook at this array with its banners all in confusion and the ranks in disorderThere is not a weapon among all the swords and spears better than oursIf I had only realized this before I would have fought them long agoWho dares go out and capture a Shu general to show them what sort of warriors we are At once a general rode toward the leader Wang PingHis name was Mangya Chang his weapon was a huge headsmans sword and he rode a dun pony Riding up to Wang Ping the two engagedWang Ping only fought a short time and then fledMeng Huo at once ordered his troops on in quick pursuit and the troops of Shu retreated seven miles or so before the Mangs were near enough to fightJust as the Mangs thought their enemies were in their power a great shouting arose and two cohorts appeared Zhang Ni from the left and Zhang Yi from the right and attacked The Mangs could not retreat and as the force under Wang Ping and Guan Suo also turned upon them the Mangs were surrounded and lost the dayMeng Huo and some of his generals fought their way out and made for the Brocade MountainsThe troops of Shu followed and forced them forward and presently there appeared in front Zhao YunMeng Huo hastily changed his route to go deeper into the mountains but Zhao Yuns soldiers spread around and the Mangs could not make a stand Here many were capturedMeng Huo and a few horsemen got away into a valley which however soon became too narrow for the horses to advanceMeng Huo then left his horse and crawled up the mountains but very soon he fell upon Wei Yan who had been sent with five hundred troops to lie in wait in that very valley Meng Huo tried to struggle but soon was captured The King and his followers were taken to the main camp where Zhuge Liang was waiting with wine and meat ready for the captivesBut his tent was now guarded by soldiers all well armed with snowglittering weapons beside the lictors bearing the golden axes a present from the Emperor and other insignia of rankThe featherhatted drummers and clarion players were in front and behind and the Imperial Guards were extended on both sides The whole was very imposing and aweinspiringZhuge Liang was seated at the top of it all and watched the captives as they came forward in crowds When they were all assembled he ordered their bonds to be loosed and then he addressed them You are all simple and welldisposed people who have been led into trouble by Meng HuoI know your fathers and mothers your brothers and wives and your children are anxiously watching from the doorways for your return and they are cut to dear suffering that the news of defeat and capture has reached their ears They are weeping bitter tears for youAnd so I will set you all free to go home and comfort them After they had been given food and wine and a present of grain he sent them all awayThey went off grateful for the kindness shown them but they wept as they thanked Zhuge Liang Then the guards were told to bring the King before the tentHe came bound being hustled forwardHe knelt in front of the CommanderinChief who said Why did you rebel after the generous treatment you have received from our Emperor The two Lands of the Rivers belonged to others and your lord took it from them by force and gave himself the title of EmperorMy people have lived here for ages and you and yours invaded my country without the least excuseHow can you talk of rebellion to me You are my prisoner will you submit or are you still contumacious Why should I submitYou happened to find me in a narrow place that is all If I release you what then If you release me I shall return and when I have set my army in order I shall come to fight you againHowever if you catch me once more I will submit The Kings bonds were loosed he was clothed and refreshed given a horse and caparisons and sent with a guide to his own campOnce more the captured chieftain is let go To yield tribesmen are ever slowFurther results of this war will be related in the next chapter CHAPTER Crossing River ScorpioThe Mang King Is Bound The Second Time Recognizing A Pretended SurrenderMeng Huo Is Captured The Third Time The officers did not approve of the release of the King of the Mangs and they came to the tent of Zhuge Liang and said Meng Huo is the most important personage of all the Mangs and his capture is the key to restoring order in the southWhy then O Minister did you release him I can capture him just as easily as I can get something out of my pocketWhat I want to do is to overcome and win his heart so that peace may follow of itself They listened but they had no great confidence in the success of the policy of conciliationIn the meantime Meng Huo had reached the River Lu and there he fell in with some of his defeated leaders who were trying to get news of their Kings fateThey were surprised but glad to see him and asked How were Your Highness able to get back The King lied saying They confined me in a tent and I broke out in the nightI slew more than ten guards and ranAnd then I met one of their sentries killed him and that is how I got this horse They never doubted his word and very joyfully they hurried him over the river to a camping placeThen all the notables assembled from the various ravines and the soldiers that had escaped death were mustered and got into shape as a fighting forceThe two leaders in the late campaign Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan were in one of the ravines and Meng Huo sent to ask them to comeThey were afraid but they could not disobey and they came with an escort When all had assembled the King proclaimed as followsI know Zhuge Liang is too full of ruses for us to conquer him in a fight we should only fall victims to other base devicesHowever we must remember that his soldiers have marched far and the weather is sultry which are factors in our favorBeside River Lu is our rampart We will have boats and rafts on the south side and we will build a mud wall With such good defenses we can afford to wait and see what the enemy intends His speech met with approval and his plan was carried outThe wall was supported by the hills and strengthened by fighting turrets upon which were placed large bows and crossbows and arrows and stones The defenses looked as if they were permanentMoreover each ravine sent supplies in plentyAnd having made these preparations Meng Huo felt comfortable and safe Zhuge Liang had advanced and his leading division was now close to the river Spies came back to reportNo boats or rafts can be found to cross and the current is too strong to think of fordingBeside we can see the formidable defenses on the farther bank the mud wall and the turrets all fully manned The weather was burning hot for it was the fifth mouth and the soldiers could not tolerate their armor nor even their clothing When Zhuge Liang had inspected the river he returned to his tent and assembled his officers to whom he read this order The enemy is securely established on the south bank ready to repel our attackYet having come so far we cannot return emptyFor the present you will all seek what shelter you can find in the forests and rest and refresh your people Then he sent Lu Kai to a distance to select a cool stretch of thirty miles and there he made four stockadesWithin the stockades he built huts for the soldiers and sheds for the horses so that they were sheltered from the intense heat The four camps were stationed by Wang Ping Zhang Ni Zhang Yi and Guan Suo However Jiang Wan observed these shelters and went to Zhuge Liang saying These shelters of Lu Kai are very unsuitable He has made the same mistake as that which led to the defeat of the First Ruler at the hands of WuHe has not taken into account the surroundings of the stockades and if the Mangs should come over and start a fire there could be no rescue Do not anticipate trouble said the CommanderinChief smilingI have provided against all such dangers Jiang Wan did not know what the chief meant to do but he said no moreThen Ma Dai arrived from the Lands of Rivers and he brought summer medicines and further supplies of grainHe saw Zhuge Liang and then proceeded to distribute the supplies he had brought according to ordersThen Zhuge Liang said What force have you brought Three thousand was the reply My people are weary and worn out I want to use yoursYou have no objections Of course not they are equally government troopsThey are ready even to die for you if you wish This Meng Huo is established on the river and we have no means of crossing But I am anxious to intercept his supplies so that his troops may mutiny How can you do it Some fifty miles lower down River Lu there is a place called Shakou where the current is slow you could cross there on raftsI wish you and your soldiers to cross and cut the road of suppliesAfter that you are to arrange with the two leadersDongtu Na and Ahui Nanwhose lives I spared to be your allies on the inside and we shall succeed Ma Dai went off gladly enough and marched his troops to Shakou where they set about the crossing at onceAnd as the water was shallow they did not trouble to make rafts but just tucked up their clothes and waded in But halfway across the men began to fall over and when they had been rescued and taken to the bank many of them began to bleed from the nose and mouth and diedIn great alarm Ma Dai sent hasty messages to Zhuge Liang who called in the native guides and asked what this meant They told him It happens so every yearIn the hot season poisonous miasma collects over the waters of the River Lu especially during the heat of the dayAnyone who drinks the water will surely dieTravelers who wish to cross have to wait till night because the cooler waters do not breathe out the poisonous vapors Further the crossing should be attempted on a full stomach Zhuge Liang bade the local guides point out the best crossing placeHe sent some wellseasoned soldiers to Ma Dai to lash together poles into rafts at Shakou and in the night the crossing was safely accomplished Further the guides then led the three thousand men of Shu over to where the grain road of the Mangs led through a narrow valley called Jiashan Gorge where for part of the way only single file was possible as the road was only wide enough for a soldier and a horseMa Dai at once occupied this valley and stationed a force thereAnd a stockade was put up with tents inside Presently a convoy of grain came along and it was captured more than a hundred wagons The guards ran off to Meng Huos great camp and told himMeng Huo thinking all was safe during the hot season was enjoying himself wine and music were the order of the day and military matters were far from his thoughts In his cups he admitted Zhuge Liang was ruseful but said his army had nothing to fear If I attempt to oppose Zhuge Liang I shall certainly fall a victim to some wile of his However my waiting policy is a safe oneWith our defenses and the river to back them we can wait for the heat to overcome these men of Shu who cannot stand the hot seasonThey will have to retreat and then we can harass themAnd we will capture this Zhuge Liang He lay back and laughed at the thoughtHowever one chief more prudent than the others stood forth and said Remember the shallows at Shakou it would be very serious if the soldiers of Shu got across there secretly It ought to be guarded You belong to these areasDo you not know that I want the enemy to try to get across thereWhy they will all perish in the water But what if the natives tell them to cross only in the night Do not be so anxious said Meng HuoOur own people will not help the enemy that far It was just then that intelligence cameThe troops of Shu unknown in number have crossed the river and moreover have seized the Jiashan Gorge The flags show the words General Ma Dai Who Pacifies The North Meng Huo affected indifferenceThis sort of fellow is not worth talking about said he He sent General Mangya Chang with three thousands troops to recapture the gorge and reopen the grain roadWhen Ma Dai saw the Mang soldiers approaching he placed two thousand troops in front of the hills and drew up the troops in formal array Then Mangya Chang rode out to give battleThis was but a small engagement as the general of the tribespeople fell at the first stroke of Ma Dais sword The Mangs ran away at once They returned to the Kings camp and told him what had happenedWhereupon he called up all his generals and asked for another to go up against Ma DaiI will go cried Dongtu NaThe King gave him three thousand troops After he had gone Meng Huo thought it would be wise to keep others from crossing the riverSo he sent a force of three thousand under Ahui Nan to guard ShakouDongtu Na duly arrived at the gorge and made a camp Ma Dai came out to meet himAmong the soldiers in his cohort were some who recognized the leader of the Mangs and told Ma Dai certain things about how he had been captured and liberatedSo Ma Dai galloped toward him shouting O you ingrate How could you forget the debt to the Prime MinisterHave you known no shame Dongtu Na was very greatly ashamed and turned red in the face and turned his horse before striking a blowMa Dai followed and fell on slaying many of the Mangs Then both sides withdrewDongtu Na went back and told the King that Ma Dai was too strong for him But Meng Huo was angry and cried You are a traitorI know Zhuge Liang was good to you and that is why you would not fight Meng Huo ordered Dongtu Na out to executionHowever the notables and chiefs interceded and the death penalty was remitted but the unhappy leader was severely beaten one hundred strokes with the heavy staff The chiefs were mostly on the side of the beaten general and against the Kings policyThey went to the tent of Dongtu Na and said Though we live in the Mang country we have never had any thoughts of rebellion against the Imperial Government nor has the Middle Empire ever encroached upon our landWe must own that Meng Huos superior power forced us into this rising and we could not help ourselvesZhuge Liang is too clever for us and no one can guess what he may do Even Cao Cao and Sun Quan fear him how much more must weMoreover we have received kindness at his hands and owe him our lives We ought to show our gratitudeNow let us at all risks slay this Meng Huo and submit to Zhuge Liang so that our people may not suffer Dongtu Na said I do not know your inner sentiments At this all those who had been prisoners and released cried with one voice We desire to go to Meng Huo Thereupon Dongtu Na took in his hand a sharp sword placed himself at the head of more than a hundred malcontents and rushed into the great camp At that moment Meng Huo was as usual intoxicated and lay in his tent The mutineers rushed in They found two generals on guardYou also received kindness from Zhuge Liang and ought to repay it cried Dongtu NaThey replied You do not have to slay him let us carry him a prisoner to the Prime Minister So they bound the King securely took him down to the river and crossed in a boat to the northern bank There they halted while they sent a messenger to Zhuge LiangNow Zhuge Liang knew what had been happening and he had issued orders for every camp to prepare their weapons All being ready he told the chiefs to bring up their prisoner and bade the others return to their campsDongtu Na went first and told the matter to Zhuge Liang who praised his zeal and gave him presentsThen he retired with the chiefs and the executioners brought in Meng HuoYou said once before that if you were captured again you would give in said Zhuge Liang smilingNow will you yield This capture is not your work replied Meng HuoIt is the work of these minions of mine who want to hurt meI will not yield on this If I free you again what then I am only a Mang I know but I am not wholly ignorant of warIf you O Minister let me return to my ravines I will muster another army and fight a decisive battle with youIf you capture me again then I will incline my heart and own myself beaten and yieldI will not go back on my promise again If you refuse to yield next time you are captured I shall hardly pardon you At Zhuge Liangs orders the cords were loosed and refreshments were brought for the prisonerRemember said Zhuge Liang I have never failed yet I have never failed to win a battle or to take a city I have assaultedWhy do you Mangs not yield Meng Huo only nodded his head he said nothingAfter the wine Zhuge Liang and Meng Huo rode round the camps together and the King saw all the arrangements and the piles of stores and heaps of weaponsAnd after the inspection Zhuge Liang said You are silly not to yield to meYou see my veteran soldiers my able generals my stores of all kinds and war gear how can you hope to prevail against meIf you will yield I will inform the Emperor and you shall retain your kingship and your sons and grandsons shall succeed as perpetual guardians of the Mang countryDo you not think it would be well Meng Huo replied If I did yield the people of my valleys would not be contentIf you release me once more I will see to it that my own people keep the peace and bring them round to unanimity of feeling and then they will not oppose any more Zhuge Liang was glad and they returned to the main camp to feast until dusk when Meng Huo took his leaveZhuge Liang ordered a craft and went to see him across River LuBut Meng Huos first act on his return to his own camp was to send one of his people to Dongtu Nas and Ahui Nans camps and pretend to ask them to come to meet a messenger from Zhuge Liang When the two generals came Meng Huo ordered assassins who had been placed hidden to do away with the two leaders Their corpses were thrown into a gully Then he sent his friends to guard the most important strategic points while he marched to fight a battle with Ma DaiBut when he got near the valley he saw no signs of the enemy and on questioning an inhabitant he heard that the Shu army with all their stores had recrossed the river and joined the main body in the northern bankMeng Huo then returned to his own ravine and discussed matters with his brother Meng You saying I know all the details of the enemys force from what I saw in their camp And Meng Huo gave his brother certain instructions which Meng You at once began to carry outMeng You loaded a hundred men with gold and jewels and pearls and ivory and rhinoceros horn crossed River Lu and was on his way to the main camp of the Shu army when he heard the sound of drums and a cohort under Ma Dai poured out to stop him Meng You did not expect to meet an enemy and was surprisedBut Ma Dai only asked what he had come for And when he had heard Meng You was detained while a message was sent to Zhuge Liang The messenger arrived while a council was in progress the matter under discussion being how to reduce the MangsWhen the messenger had announced that Meng You had come bearing gifts of gold and pearls and such things Zhuge Liang turned to Ma Su saying Know you why this man has come I dare not say plainly but let me write it said Ma SuWrite it then So Ma Su wrote and handed the paper to his chief who had no sooner read it than he clapped his hands with joy crying What you say is exactly what I thinkBut you may know I have already made arrangements for the capture of Meng Huo Then Zhao Yun was called and some orders were whispered into his earNext Wei Yan came and he also went off with secret ordersWang Ping Ma Zhong and Guan Suo also came and left with particular instructions All these things done the bearer of gifts was calledMeng You came and bowed low at the door of the tent saying The brother of my house Meng Huo having received great kindness at your hands in sparing his life feels bound to offer a paltry gift He has presumed to collect a few pearls and some gold and other trifling jewels by way of something to give your soldiersAnd hereafter he will send tribute to your Emperor Where is your brother at this moment asked Zhuge LiangHaving been the recipient of your great bounty he has gone to the Silver Pit Hills to collect some treasuresHe will soon return How many soldiers have you brought Only about a hundred I should not dare to bring any large numberThey are just porters They were brought in for Zhuge Liangs inspection They had blue eyes and swarthy faces auburn hair and brown beards They wore earrings their hair was fuzzy and they went barefoot They were tall and powerfulZhuge Liang made them sit down and bade his generals press them to drink and treat them well and compliment them Meng Huo was anxious about the reception that would be given to his brother and the treatment of his gifts so he sat in his tent expecting the messenger at any moment Then two men came and he questioned them eagerlyThey said The presents have been accepted and even the porters have been invited to drink in the tent and have been regaled with beef and flesh in plentyO King your brother sends the news that all will be ready at the second watch for the attackHe will support you from within This was pleasing news and Meng Huo prepared his thirty thousand troops ready to march out to the camp They were divided into three divisionsThe King called up his chieftains and notables and said Let each army carry the means of making fire and as soon as they arrive let a light be shown as a signalI am coming to the main camp to capture Zhuge Liang With these orders they marched and they crossed River Lu at sunsetThe King with a hundred generals as escort pressed on at once toward the main camp of Shu They met with no oppositionThey even found the main gate open and Meng Huo and his party rode straight in But the camp was a desert not a soldier was visible Meng Huo rode right up to the large tent and pushed open the flapIt was brilliantly lighted with lamps and lying about under their light were his brother and all his men dead drunkZhuge Liang had ordered Ma Su and Lu Kai to entertain Meng You and his men with wine and dance performances The wine they had been pressed to drink while the plays were going on had been heavily drugged and they had fallen down almost as soon as they had swallowed it One or two who had recovered a little could not speakthey only pointed to their mouthsMeng Huo then saw that he had been the simple victim of another ruseHowever he picked up his brother and the others and started off to return to his main army But as he turned torches began to flash out and drums to beat The Mangs were frightened and took to their heelsBut they were pursued and the pursuing cohort was led by Wang Ping The King bore away to the left to escape but again a cohort appeared in front of him Wei Yan was there Meng Huo tried the other side and was stopped by Zhao YunHe was in a trap and attacked on three sides and no fourth to escape by what could he doHe abandoned everything making one wild rush for the River LuAs he reached the river bank he saw a bark on the river with Mang soldiers on board Here was safety He hailed the boat and jumped on board as soon as it touched the bankNo sooner had he embarked than suddenly he was seized and boundThe boat which Ma Dai had provided and prepared was part of the general plan and the Mang soldiers therein were Ma Dais soldiers disguisedMany of Meng Huos troops accepted the chance of surrender held out by Zhuge Liang who soothed them and treated them well and did not injure one of themThe remains of the conflagration were stamped out and in a short time Ma Dai brought along his prisonerAt the same time Zhao Yun led in his brother Meng YouWei Yan Ma Su Wang Ping and Guan Suo also brought their prisoners chiefs or notables to the camp of the Prime MinisterZhuge Liang looked at the King and laughed That was but a shallow ruse of yours to send your brother with presents to pretend to submit to me did you really think I should not see through itBut here you are once more in my power now do you yield I am a prisoner owing to the gluttony of my brother and the power of your poisonous drugsIf I had only played his part myself and left him to support me with soldiers I should have succeededI am the victim of fate and not of my own incapacityNo I will not yield Remember this is the third time why not said Zhuge LiangMeng Huo dropped his head and made no answer Ah well I will let you go once more said Zhuge LiangO Minister if you will let me and my brother go we will get together our family and clients and fight you once moreIf I am caught that time then I will confess myself beaten to the ground and that shall be the end Certainly I shall scarcely pardon you next time said Zhuge LiangYou would better be careful Diligently tackle your Book of Strategy look over your list of confidants If you can apply a good plan at the proper moment you will not have any need for late regrets Meng Huo and his brother and all the chiefs were released from their bondsThey thanked Zhuge Liang for his clemency and went awayBy the time the released prisoners had got back to the river the army of Shu had crossed to the farther side and had captured the Mang defenses the Shu flags fluttering in the breezeAs Meng Huo passed the camp he saw Ma Dai sitting in stateMa Dai pointed his sword at the King as he passed and said Next time you are caught you will not escape When Meng Huo came to his own camp he found Zhao Yun in possession and all in orderZhao Yun was seated beneath the large banner with his sword drawn and as the King passed he also said Do not presume on the kindness of the Prime Minister because you have been generously treated Meng Huo grunted and passed onJust as he was going over the frontier hills he saw Wei Yan and a company drawn up on the slopes Wei Yan shouted See to it we have got into the inmost recesses of your country and have taken all your defensive positionsYet you are fool enough to hold outNext time you are caught you will be quite destroyedThere will be no more pardons Meng Huo and his company ran away with their arms over their heads Each one returned to his own ravineIn the fifth moon when the sun is fierce Marched the army into the desert land Marched to the River Lu bright and clear But deadly with miasmaZhuge Liang the leader cared not Pledged was he to subdue the south Thereby to repay the First Rulers deference with service Wherefore he attacked the Mangs Yet seven times he freed their captured king After the crossing of the river the soldiers were feasted Then Zhuge Liang addressed his officersI let Meng Huo see our camp the second time he was our prisoner because I wanted to tempt him into raiding itHe is something of a soldier and I dangled our supplies and resources before his eyes knowing he would try to burn them and that he would send his brother to pretend to submit that thereby he could get into our camp and have a chance to betray usI have captured and released him three times trying to win him over I do not wish to do him any harmI now explain my policy that you may understand I am not wasting your efforts and you are still to work your best for the government They all bowed and one said O Minister you are indeed perfect in every one of the three gifts wisdom benevolence and valor Not even Lu Wang or Zhang Liang can equal you Said Zhuge Liang How can I expect to equal our men of oldBut my trust is in your strength and together we shall succeed This speech of their leaders pleased them all mightilyIn the meantime Meng Huo puffed up with pride at getting off three times hastened home to his own ravine whence he sent trusted friends with gifts to the Eight Nations and the Ninetythree Sees and all the Mang quarters and clans to borrow shields and swords and warriors and braves He got together one hundred thousand soldiers They all assembled on an appointed day massing like clouds and sweeping in like mists gathering on the mountains each and all obeying the commands of the King Meng HuoAnd the scouts knew it all and they told Zhuge Liang who said This is what I was waiting for that the Mangs should have an opportunity of knowing our might Thereupon he seated himself in a small carriage and went out to watchO let our enemys courage glow That our greater might may showThe story of the campaign will be continued in the next chapter CHAPTER The Lord of Wuxiang Uses The Fourth Ruse The King of Mang Is Captured The Fifth Time Zhuge Liangs small carriage was escorted by only a few horsemenHearing that a sluggish river the Western River lay in the way and having no boat Zhuge Liang bade the escort cut down some trees and make a raft They did so but the raft sankSo Zhuge Liang turned to Lu Kai who said There is close by a mountain covered with bamboos I have heard of these bamboos and some are several spans in girthWe can make a bridge of them for the army to cross So thirty thousand soldiers were sent to the mountains where they cut down many thousands of bamboos and floated them down river Then at the narrowest point they made a bridge a hundred spans or so in lengthNext the main army was brought down to the river and camped in line along the bank The camp was protected by a moat crossed by a floating bridge and a mud rampartOn the south bank they constructed three large stockades so as to prepare for the coming of the Mang soldiers They had not long to waitMeng Huo was hot with rage and came quicklyAs soon as he got near the river he led out ten thousand fierce warriors armed with big swords and shield and challenged the first stockadeZhuge Liang went forth in simple state He wore a silk cap and a cranewhite robe and held in his hand a feather fan He sat in a fourhorse carriage and his generals rode right and leftThe King of the Mang was clad in mail of rhinoceros hide and wore a bright red casque In his left hand he bore a shield and his right gripped a sword He rode a red oxAs soon as he saw his enemies he opened his mouth and poured forth abuse and insults while his warriors darted to and fro brandishing their weaponsZhuge Liang at once ordered the army to retire within the stockades and bar the gatesThe Mangs came close up to the stockade and pranced about naked shouting in derisionWithin the stockade the Shu generals grew very angry and they went in a body to their leader to beg that he would withdraw the order to remain on the defensiveBut Zhuge Liang would not listenPresently he said These men are not submissive to the Empire Government and are naturally fierce and turbulent In that mood we are no match for themBut all we have to do is to remain on guard for a few days till their ferocity has spent itselfThen I have a plan that will overcome them Days passed and the army of Shu made no move they only maintained the defensive Zhuge Liang watched the besiegers from an eminence and saw the first vigor of their advance give way to careless idlenessThen Zhuge Liang called together his generals and asked Dare you give battle now They all rejoiced at the suggestion so he called them two by two or one by one and gave them secret ordersZhao Yun and Wei Yan went in firstWang Ping and Ma Zhong followedTo Ma Dai he said I am going to abandon these stockades and retire north of the riverAs soon as we have crossed you are to cut loose the floating bridge and move it down the stream so that Zhao Yun and Wei Yan may cross To Zhang Yi he said You are to remain by the camp and light it up at nightas if it is still occupiedWhen Meng Huo pursues then you are to cut off his retreat Last of all Guan Suo was to escort Zhuge Liangs carriageThe soldiers marched out of the camp at evening and the lamps were hung up as usualThe Mangs saw this from a distance and dared not attack But the next morning at dawn Meng Huo led his troops to the stockades and found all was quiet He went close up and saw they were all empty and bare not a soldier was there Grain and fodder lay about among empty carts all was in confusion suggesting hasty departureThey have abandoned the camp said Meng YouBut this is only a ruse Said Meng Huo I think that Zhuge Liang has important news from the capital that has made him leave without his baggage train like this Either Wu has invaded or Wei has attackedThey left these lamps burning to make us think the camps were occupied but they ran away leaving everything behindIf we pursue we cannot go wrong So the King urged his army onward himself heading the leading divisionWhen they reached the Western River bank they saw on the farther side that the camps were all in order and the banners flying as usual like a brightly tinted cloud of silkAlong the bank stood a wall of clothThey dared not attackMeng Huo said to his brother This means that Zhuge Liang fears lest we may pursue That is only a temporary halt and they will retire in a couple of days The Mangs camped on the river bank while they sent into the mountains to cut bamboos to make raftsThe boldest of the soldiers were placed in front of the camp till the rafts should be ready to crossLittle did Meng Huo suspect that the army of Shu was already within his bordersOne day was very stormyThen the Mangs saw great flames spring up around them and at the same time the rolling of drums heralded an attack The Mangs instead of going out to meet the enemy began to force their way out of the Shu attack Meng Huo became alarmed and fled with all his clans and dependents They fought their way through and made a dash for their former campJust as they reached it there appeared a cohort of the enemy led by Zhao YunMeng Huo turned off west and sought refuge in the mountainsBut he was fiercely attacked by a cohort under Ma DaiWith a small remnant of followers he got away into a valleySoon he saw in the west north and south clouds of smoke rising and the glow of torches so that he was forced to halt However the east remained clear and presently he fled in that direction As he was crossing the mouth of a gully he noticed a few horsemen outlined against a thick wood and saw they were escorting a small carriage And in that carriage sat Zhuge LiangZhuge Liang laughed and said So King of the Mangs has got here How does Heaven make you defeated soI have waited for you a long time Meng Huo angrily turned to his followers and said Thrice have I been the victim of this mans base wiles and have been put to shameNow chance has sent him across my path and you must attack him with all your energyLet us cut him to pieces and those with him The Mang horsemen with Meng Huo shouting to encourage them pushed forward in hot haste toward the wood But in a few moments they all stumbled and disappeared into some pits that had been dug in the way And just then Wei Yan emerged from the wood One by one the Mangs were pulled out of the pits and bound tight with cords Zhuge Liang returned to his camp where the captors of the King could bring in their prisonerZhuge Liang busied himself in soothing the other Mang prisoners Many of the notables and chiefs of the tributaries had betaken themselves to their own ravines and villages with their followersMany of those who remained came over and yielded to Shu They were well fed and assured of safety and allowed to go to their own They went off gladly enoughBy and by Zhang Yi brought up the Kings brother Meng You Zhuge Liang reproached him for his brothers behaviorYour brother is a misguided simpleton you ought to remonstrate with him and persuade him to change his courseHere you are a captive for the fourth time are you not ashamedHow can you have the effrontery to look anyone in the face A deep flush of shame passed over Meng Yous face and he threw himself to the earth begging forgivenessZhuge Liang said If I put you to death it shall not be todayThis time I pardon you but you are to talk to your brother So Meng You was loosed from his bonds and allowed to get upHe went away weepingVery soon Wei Yan brought up Meng Huo and to him Zhuge Liang simulated great rage saying What can you say now You see you are in my hands again I am again an unfortunate victim said Meng HuoOnce more I have blundered into your net and now I shall die with no one to close my eyes Zhuge Liang shouted to the lictors to take him away and behead himMeng Huo never blenched at the sentence but he turned to his captor and said If you freed me only once more I would wipe out the shame of all four captures Zhuge Liang smiled at the bold reply and bade the lictors loose his bonds and the attendants served him with wine Meng Huo was invited to sit in the commanders tentSaid Zhuge Liang Four times you have been treated generously and yet you are still defiantWhy Though I am what you call a barbarian I would scorn to employ your vile rusesAnd that is why I remain defiant I have liberated you four times do you think you can give battle again If you catch me again I will incline my heart to yield and I will give everything in my ravine to reward your armyI will also take an oath not to cause any further trouble Zhuge Liang smiled but let him goThe King thanked him and leftAs soon as he was set at liberty Meng Huo got together several thousand of his adherents and went away southwardBefore long he fell in with his brother Meng You who had got together an army and was on his way to avenge his brotherAs soon as they saw each other the brothers fell upon each others necks and wept They related their experiences Meng You said We cannot stand against the enemy We have been defeated several timesNow I think we would better go into the mountains and hide in some dark gully where they cannot find usThose soldiers of Shu will never stand the summer heat they must retire Where can we hide asked his brotherI know a valley away southwest from us called Bald Dragon Ravine and the King Duo Si is a friend of mine Let us take refuge with him Very well go and arrange it said Meng Huo So Meng You wentWhen he got there and talked to the chief King Duo Si lost no time but came out with his soldiers to welcome Meng Huo who then entered the valleyAfter the exchange of salutations Meng Huo explained his caseDuo Si said O King rest contentIf those men from the Lands of Rivers come here I will see to it that not one goes home And Zhuge Liang will meet his death here too Naturally Meng Huo was pleased but he wanted to know how his host could feel so secureDuo Si said In this ravine there are only two roads the one you came by and another by the northwest The road you traveled along is level and soft and the waters are sweet Humans and horses may both use itBut if we close the mouth of the ravine with a barricade then no one however strong can get inThe other road is precipitous dangerous and narrowThe only path is beset with venomous serpents and scorpions and as evening comes on there are malarial exhalations which are dangerous till past noon the next day The road is only practicable between two watches before sunsetThen the water is undrinkable The road is very difficultThen again there are four streams actually poisonous One is called The Dumb Spring Its water is pleasant to the palate but it makes people dumb and they die in a few daysA second fountain is called The Spring of Destruction and is hot But if a person bathes therein his flesh rots till his bones protrude and he diesThe third is The Black Spring Its waters are greenish If it be sprinkled on a persons body his limbs turn black and presently he diesThe fourth is The Spring of Weak Water ice cold If a person drink of this water his breath is chilled he becomes weak as a thread and soon diesNeither birds nor insects are found in this region and no one but the Han General Ma Yuan who was styled General Who Quells the Waves for this exploit has ever passedNow the northeast road shall be blocked and you may hide here perfectly safe from those troops of Shu for finding that way blocked they will try the other road which is waterless save for the four deadly springsNo matter how many they be they will perish and we need no weapons Now indeed I have found a place to live in cried Meng Huo striking his foreheadThen looking to the north he said Even Zhuge Liangs wonderful cunning will be of no availThe four springs alone will defeat him and avenge my army The two brothers settled down comfortably as guests of King Duo Si with whom they spent the days in feastingIn the meantime as the Mangs did not appear Zhuge Liang gave orders to leave the Western River and push southIt was then the sixth month and blazing hotA poet sang about the bitter heat of the south The hills are sere the valleys dry A raging heat fills all the sky Throughout the whole wide universe No spot exists where heat is worseAnother poem runs The glowing sun darts out fierce raysNo cloud gives shelter from the blaze In parching heat there pants a crane The whale swims through the hissing mainThe brooks cool margin now I love Or idle stroll through bamboo groveI would not march to deserts far In leathern jerkin donned for warJust at the moment of setting out southward the spies brought news of Meng Huos retreat into the Bald Dragon Ravine and the barricading of one entranceThey also said The valley is garrisoned the hills are precipitous and even impassable So Zhuge Liang called in Lu Kai and questioned him but he did not know exactly the conditionsThen out spoke Jiang Wan saying Meng Huos repeated captures have broken his spirit so that he dare not take the field againOur soldiers are exhausted with this intense heat and little is to be gained by prolonging the campaignThe best move would be to return to our own country If we do this we shall fall victims to Meng Huos scheme said Zhuge LiangIf we retreated he would certainly followBeside having advanced so far it would be fruitless to turn back now Wang Ping was sent on with the advanced guard and some of the Mangs as guides to seek an entrance on the northwestThey found the road and came to the first springthe Dumb Spring of which the thirsty men and horses drank freelyWang Ping returned to report his success but by the time he reached camp he and all his soldiers were speechlessThey could only point to their mouths Zhuge Liang knew they had been poisoned and was alarmed He went forward in his light chariot to find out the cause He came to the spring The water was very deep and dark green A mass of vapor hung about the surface rising and falling They would not touch the waterZhuge Liang went up the hills to look around but could see nothing except a rampart of mountains A deep silence hung over all unbroken by the cry even of a bird He was perplexedPresently he noticed an old temple away up among the cragsBy the aid of the lianas and creepers he managed to clamber up and in a chamber hewn out of the rock he saw the figure of an officer Beside it was a tablet saying the temple was dedicated to Ma Yuan the famous general who had preceded him in that country The natives had erected it to sacrifice to the leader who had headed the campaign against the Mangs Zhuge Liang much impressed bowed before the image of the great leader and said Your humble servant received a sacred trust the protection of the son of the First RulerThat son the present Emperor sent him here to subdue the Mangs that the land might be free from peril when he decided to attack Wei and take possession of Wu and thereby restore the glory of the HansBut the soldiers are ignorant of the country and some of them have drunk of a poisonous spring so that they have become dumbYour servant earnestly prays your honored spirit out of regard for the kindness and justice of the present Emperor to reveal your spiritual character and manifest your holiness by safeguarding and assisting the army Having prayed thus Zhuge Liang left the templeWhile seeking some native whom he might question he saw in the distance on a hill opposite an aged man leaning on a staff He approached and as he drew nearer Zhuge Liang noted his extraordinary appearanceWhen he had reached the temple Zhuge Liang asked the venerable visitor to walk in After the salutations the old man sat on the stones and Zhuge Liang opened the conversation with the usual questionsThe old gentleman replied Sir Minister I know you well by repute and am happy to meet youMany of the Mangs owe their lives to you and all have been deeply impressed by your kindness Then Zhuge Liang returned to the matter nearest his heart the mystery of the springThe old man told him That is the Dumb Spring that your soldiers have drunk and they will die in a few daysBesides that there are other three poisonous streams called Spring of Destruction Black Spring and Spring of Weak WaterAll miasma gathers there in the four streams and it only vaporizes during the two watch before sunset In short the Mangs cannot be conquered said Zhuge Liang when the old man had finishedAnd Wu cannot be repressed nor Wei overcome And the Hans cannot be restored So I fail in the task set me by my PrinceWish that I might die Be not so cast down O Minister said the aged oneI can lead you to a place where you may counteract all this I would ask for your instruction Venerable One said Zhuge Liang What exalted advice have you to confer upon meI hope you will instruct me West of this not far off is a valley and seven miles from its entrance is a stream called the Spring of Eternal Peace near which there lives a recluse known as the Hermit of the StreamHe has not left the valley these twenty yearsBehind his hut there gushes out a spring of water called the Spring of Peace and Joy This is the antidote to your poison Bathing in its waters is a cure for skin diseases and for malariaMoreover near the hut grows an herb called the garlicleaved fragrance Chewing a leaf of this safeguards one from malariaYou can do no better than go to the hut of the recluse forthwith and get these remedies Zhuge Liang humbly thanked his aged counselor and said Venerable Sir I am profoundly affected by your merciful kindness and compassionMay I ask again by what name may call you The old man rose and entered the temple saying I am the Spirit of this mountain sent by Ma Yuan to guide you As he said this he shouted at the solid rock behind the temple and it opened of itself and let him inZhuge Liangs astonishment was beyond words He made another obeisance to the Spirit of the temple and went down by the way he had come Then he returned to his campNext day bearing incense and gifts Wang Ping and his stricken men went west to the spot which the old man had indicatedThey luckily found the valley and followed its narrow road till they came to a small farmlike enclosure where tall pines and lofty cypresses luxuriant bamboos and gorgeous flowers sheltered a few simple hutsAn exquisite perfume pervaded the whole place Zhuge Liang rejoiced to recognize the spot and at once knocked at the doorA lad answered his knock and Zhuge Liang was telling his name when the host came out quickly saying Surely my visitor is the Prime Minister of the Han Dynasty Zhuge Liang saw at the door a man with a bamboo comb holding back his hair grass shoes on his feet and a robe of white girded in by a black girdle He had green eyes and yellowed hairGreat Scholar how did you know who I was said Zhuge LiangHow could I not have heard of your expedition to the south He invited Zhuge Liang to enter and when they had seated themselves in their relative positions as host and guest Zhuge Liang said My former Prince the First Ruler confided to me the care of his son and successorThat son now Emperor gave me a command to lead an army to this country get the Mangs on our side and spread our culture among themBut now to my disappointment Meng Huo the King has hidden himself in the Bald Dragon Ravine and some of my soldiers on the way to seek him drank of a certain fountain and are dumbBut last evening the former leader of an expedition Ma Yuan manifested his sacred presence and told me that you Exalted Sir had a remedy for this evil and I pray you of your pity to give me of the potent fluid whereby my soldiers lives may be saved The recluse replied I am only a worthless old man of the wild woods and unworthy of the visit of such as you O MinisterThe water you desire flows out at the back of my cottage and you may take what you will of it The serving lad then showed Wang Ping and his dumb companions to the Spring of Peace and Joy and he dipped up the waters for them to drinkAs soon as they had drunk they coughed up some poisoned mucus and could speakThe lad also led the soldiers to the Spring of Eternal Peace where they could batheIn the cottage the recluse regaled Zhuge Liang with tea made of cypress seeds and a conserve of pine flowersHe also told his guest saying In this region the lands are full of serpents and scorpions and the lily flowers blown into the springs by the wind make them unfit to drinkHowever if you dig wells you will find good water Then Zhuge Liang begged some of the garlicleaved herb as an antidote against malaria The recluse said the soldiers could pluck as much as they wantedAnd so every one put a leaf in his mouth and thus became malariaproofZhuge Liang with a low bow then begged to be told the name of his benefactor I am Meng Huos eldest brother said the recluse smilingMy name is Meng Jie Zhuge Liang started Do not be afraid said the recluse Let me explain We were three brothers of the same parents the eldest being myselfOur parents are both deadMy brother Meng Huo being headstrong and vicious has never been amenable to culture I have talked to him many times but he kept his own courseFinally under an assumed name I retired to this spotI am ashamed for my brothers rebellion which has put you O Minister to the trouble of making this expedition into a barren country but it has given me the privilege of seeing youFor my responsibility in this I deserve to die a thousand times as I own to your face and I beg your pardon Zhuge Liang sighed saying Now I believe that story of the robber Liu Zhi and the noble Liu Xiahui this is the same thing over againPeople renowned for villainy and virtue may come from the same stock Then he said to his host Would you wish me to represent your merits to the Emperor and get you created a king How can you think I desire honors or wealth when I am here because of my contempt for all such things Zhuge Liang then wished to make him certain presents but the recluse would have none of themSo taking leave of his host Zhuge Liang went back to his campIn the southern expedition when the Mangs were subdued Zhuge Liang found a highborn recluse in a shady solitudeUp till then the gloomy forests were thought destitute of men That no curling smoke wreath ever floated upwards from the glenAs soon as Zhuge Liang reached camp he set the soldiers digging for waterThey dug to a great depth but found none nor were they more successful when they tried other placesThey were very discouragedThen Zhuge Liang in the depths of the night burned incense and prayed to God Unworthy as is thy servant Zhuge Liang he has received favor from the Great Hans and now has been ordered to subdue the MangsNow our water is spent and my soldiers and animals are parched with thirstIf Thy will be to preserve the line of Han then give I beseech Thee sweet water but if their course is run then may Thy servant and those with him die in this place The morning after this prayer the wells were full of sweet waterThe Mangs must be conquered Zhuge Liang led a great array Though his skill was superhuman yet he held the righteous way As the wells gave forth sweet water when Geng Gongs head bowed full low So the reverent prayers of Zhuge Liang made the lower springs to flowThe soldiers spirits revived with the supply of water and the army soon advanced by hill paths to the Valley of the Bald Dragon where they camped When Meng Huo heard the news he was greatly taken abackThese troops do not appear to have suffered either thirst or fever said heOur springs have lost their power King Duo Si heard it but doubted He and Meng Huo ascended into a high hill whence they could see their enemiesThey saw no signs of illness or distress all went on calmly and quietly in the camps water carrying and cooking eating and attending to the cattleDuo Sis hair stood on end as he looked at them These are not human soldiers said he shiveringThey must be sent from Heaven Our two brothers will fight one fierce battle with these troops of Shu and die therein said Meng Huo We cannot wait calmly to be put into bonds But O King if your army should be beaten my whole family will also perishLet us encourage the people of the ravines Let us kill bullocks and slaughter horses to feed them and urge them to go through fire and water to rush right up to the camp of the enemy and seize upon victory So there was great feasting before the Mangs took the fieldJust as this was going on there arrived one Yang Feng King of twentyone ravines in the west and he led thirty thousand troopsMeng Huo rejoiced exceedingly at this unexpected addition to his army and felt sure of victorySo he and Duo Si went out of their own valley to welcome Yang Feng who said I have with me thirty thousand troops in iron mail brave and intrepid warriors who can fly over mountains and bound across the peaks they of themselves are a match for the enemy even if the enemy numbered a hundred legionsAnd moreover my five sons all trained in arms are with me all to help you O Kings The five sons were brought in and presented They were handsome young fellows bold and martial looking Father and sons were entertained at a banquet Halfway through the feast Yang Feng proposed a diversion There is but scanty amusement in the field said Yang Feng and so I have brought along some native singing girls who have been taught fencing and such thingsIf you care for it they might give an exhibition The feasters hailed the suggestion with joy and soon thirty maidens came to the front of the tent Their hair hung about their shoulders and they were barefooted They danced and skipped and went through their performance outside The guests inside clapped their hands and applauded their skill and the soldiers joined in the chorusesPresently at a signal from their father two of Yang Fengs sons bore two goblets to Meng Huo and Meng YouMeng Huo and Meng You took the cups and were raising them to their lips when Yang Feng shouted a single word of command and instantly the cupbearers had the two brothers out of their seats and helpless in their handsAt this Duo Si jumped up to run away but Yang Feng gripped him and he was a prisoner tooThe Mang maidens ranged themselves in a line along the front of the tent so that none dared approachWhen the hare dies the fox mourns said Meng Huo One sympathizes with ones own as a rule We are both chiefs and have been friendsI know not why you should injure me I had to repay Zhuge Liang the Minister for his compassion on me and my people and there was no way till you rebelledWhy should I not offer up a rebel in propitiation Leaving Meng Huo Meng You and Duo Si in the hands of Yang Feng the Mang warriors dispersed each man returning to his own valleyYang Feng then took the prisoners to the camp of Shu where he bowed at the tent door saying I and my sons and the sons of my brother are grateful to you for much kindness wherefore we bring to you as an offering the persons of these rebels Zhuge Liang rewarded Yang Feng and bade them bring forward Meng Huo This time are you prepared to yield said the Prime MinisterIt is not your ability but the treachery of my own people that has brought me to thisIf you wish to slay slay but I will not yield You know you were the cause of my army entering into a waterless land where there were those four evil streams and yet my soldiers were not poisoned and came to no harm Does it not seem to you like evidence of a superior protecting powerWhy will you follow this misguided road and always be obstinate Meng Huo replied My fathers have long held the Silver Pit Hills and the three rivers and the two forests are their rampartsIf you can take that stronghold then will I and my heirs for ever acknowledge your power and yield I am going to liberate you once more said Zhuge Liang and you may put your army in order if you will and fight a decisive battleBut after that if you are my prisoner and are still refractory and unsubmissive I shall have to exterminate your whole family Zhuge Liang ordered the lictors to loose the prisoners bonds and let him goAfter he had gone the other two Meng You and Duo Si were led in and they also received their liberty They were given wine and food but they were confused and could not look Zhuge Liang in the faceThey were given horses to travel on The way has been long and now danger is near But faith in their leader banishes fearThe next chapter will tell how Meng Huo reorganized his army and whose the victory was CHAPTER Chasing Off Wild Beasts The Prime Minister Defeats The Mangs For The Sixth Time Burning Rattan Armors Zhuge Liang Captures Meng Huo The Seventh Time All the prisoners were released and Yang Feng and his sons were rewarded with ranks and his people were given presentsThey expressed their gratitude and returned to their own while Meng Huo and his brother hastened home to Silver Pit HillsOutside this ravine were three riversRiver Lu River Gannan and River XichengThese three streams united to form Three RiversClose to the ravine on the north was a wide and fruitful plain on the west were salt wellsThe River Lu flowed about seventy miles to the southwest and due south was a valley called the Liangdu RavineThere were hills in as well as surrounding the ravine and in these they found silver whence the name Silver Pit A palace complex had been built in the ravine which the Mang kings had made their stronghold and there was an ancestral temple which they called Family Spirits where they solemnized sacrifices of bulls and horses at the four seasonsThey called these sacrifices Inquiring of the Spirits Human sacrifices were offered also humans of Shu or of their own people belonging to other villagesThe sick swallowed no drugs but prayed to a chief sorcerer called Drug Demon There was no legal code the only punishment for every transgression being deathWhen girls are grown and become women they bathe in a stream Men and women are kept separate and they marry whom they will the parents having no control in that particular There was no formal vocational trainingIn good seasons the country produces grain but if the harvest fails they make soup out of serpents and eat boiled elephant fleshAll over the country the head of the family of greatest local consideration is termed King of the Ravine and the next in importance is called a Notable A market is held in the city of Three Rivers on the first day of every moon and another on the fifteenth goods are brought in and barteredIn his own ravine Meng Huo gathered his family and clan to the number of a thousand or more and addressed them I have been put to shame by the leaders of Shu many times and I have sworn to take revenge for the insultsHas anyone any proposal to make Thereupon a certain one replied saying I can produce a man able to defeat Zhuge Liang The assembly turned to the speaker who was a brother of Meng Huos wifeHe was the head of eight tribes of the Southern Mangs and was named Chief Dai LaiWho is the man asked Meng HuoChief Dai Lai replied He is Mu Lu King of the Bana Ravine He is a master of witchcraft who can call up the wind and invoke the rain He rides upon an elephant and is attended by tigers leopards wolves venomous snakes and scorpionsBeside he has under his hand thirty thousand superhuman soldiers He is very boldO King write him a letter and send him presents which I will deliverIf he will consent to lend his aid what fear have we of Shu Meng Huo was pleased with the scheme and ordered Dai Lai to draft a letterThen he ordered Duo Si to defend Three Rivers and make the first line of defense Zhuge Liang led his troops near the city of Three RiversTaking a survey of the country he noted that the city was surrounded by the three rivers and could only be reached by a bank on one face so he sent Wei Yan and Zhao Yun to march along the road and attackBut when they reached the rampart they found it well defended by bows and crossbows The defenders of the city were adepts in the use of the bow and they had one sort which discharged ten arrows at onceFurthermore the arrows were poisoned and a wound meant certain death The two generals saw that they could not succeed and so retired When Zhuge Liang heard of the poisoned arrows he mounted his light chariot and went to see for himself Having regarded the defenses he returned to his camp and ordered a retirement of three milesThis move delighted the Mangs who congratulated each other on their success in driving off the besiegers who as they concluded had been frightened away So they gave themselves up to rejoicing and kept no watch Nor did they even send out scoutsThe army of Shu made a strong camp in their new halting place and closed the gates for defenseFor five days they gave no signOne evening just at sunset a slight breeze began to blow Then Zhuge Liang issued an order Every man should provide himself with a coat by the first watchIf any one lacks he will be put to death None of the generals knew what was in the wind but the order was obeyedNext each man was ordered to fill his coat with earthThis order appeared equally strange but it was carried out When all were ready they were toldYou are to carry the earth to the foot of the city wall and the first arrivals will be rewarded So they ran with all speed with the dry earth and reached the wallThen with the earth they were ordered to make a raised way and the first soldier on the wall was promised a rewardThe whole of the one hundred thousand troops of Shu and their native allies having thrown their burdens of earth near the wall then quickly rushed up the incline and with one great shout were on the wallThe archers on the wall were seized and dragged down those who got clear ran away into the cityKing Duo Si was slain in the melee that followed on this attackThe soldiers of Shu moved through the city slaying all they metThus was the city captured and with it great booty of jewels which were made over to the army as a reward for their prowessThe few soldiers who escaped went away and told Meng Huo what had happened to the city and King Duo SiMeng Huo was much distressed Before he had recovered they told him that the army of Shu had come over and were encamped at the mouth of his own ravineJust as he was in the very depths of distress a laugh came from behind the screen and a woman appeared saying Though you are brave how stupid you areI am only a woman but I want to go out and fight The woman was his wife Lady ZhurongShe was a descendant of the Zhurong family of the Southern MangShe was expert in the use of the flying sword and never missed her aimMeng Huo rose and bowed to herLady Zhurong thereupon mounted a horse and forthwith marched out at the head of a hundred generals leading fifty thousand troops of the ravines and set out to drive off the troops of ShuJust as the host got clear of the Silver Pit Palace it was stopped by a cohort led by Zhang NiAt once the Mangs deployed and the lady leader armed herself with five swords such as she used In one hand she held an eighteenfoot signal staff and she sat a curlyhaired reddish horseZhang Ni was secretly troubled at the sight before him but he engaged the lady commanderAfter a few passes the lady turned her steed and boltedZhang Ni went after her but a sword came flying through the air directly at himHe tried to fend off with one hand but it wounded his arm and he fell to the groundThe Mangs gave a loud shout some of them pounced on the unlucky leader and made him prisonerThen Ma Zhong hearing his comrade had been taken rushed out to rescue but only to be surroundedHe saw the lady commander holding up her staff and made a dash forward but just then the Mangs threw hooks and pulled down his steed and he was also a prisoner Both generals were taken into the ravine and led before the KingHe gave a banquet in honor of his wifes success and during the feast the lady bade the lictors put the two prisoners to death They hustled the two generals in and were just going to carry out their orders when Meng Huo checked themNo five times has Zhuge Liang set me at liberty It would be unjust to put these to deathConfine them till we have taken their chief then we may execute them His wife was merry with wine and did not object So their lives were spared The defeated soldiers returned to their campZhuge Liang took steps to retrieve the mishap by sending for Ma Dai Zhao Yun and Wei Yan to each of whom he gave special and private ordersNext day the Mang soldiers reported to the King that Zhao Yun was offering a challengeLady Zhurong forthwith mounted and rode out to battle She engaged Zhao Yun who soon fledThe lady was too prudent to risk pursuit and rode homeThen Wei Yan repeated the challenge he also fled as if defeatedBut again the lady declined to pursueNext day Zhao Yun repeated his challenge and ran away as beforeLady Zhurong signaled no pursuitBut at this Wei Yan rode up and opened a volley of abuse and obloquyThis proved too much and she gave the signal to go after him and led the wayWei Yan increased his pace and the lady commander doubled hers and she and her followers pressed into a narrow road along a valleySuddenly behind her was heard a noise and Wei Yan turning his head saw the lady tumble out of her saddle She had rushed into an ambush prepared by Ma Dai her horse had been tripped up by ropesShe was captured bound and carried off to the Shu camp Some of her people endeavored to rescue her but they were driven off Zhuge Liang seated himself in his tent to see his prisoner and Lady Zhurong was led up He bade them remove her bonds and she was conducted to another tent where wine was laid before herThen a message was sent to Meng Huo to say that she would be exchanged for the two captive leaders The King agreed and they were set freeAs soon as they arrived the lady was escorted by Zhuge Liang himself to the mouth of the ravine where Meng Huo welcomed her half gladly half angrily Then they told Meng Huo of the coming of the King of the Bana Ravine and he went out to meet Mu LuMu Lu rode up on his white elephant dressed in silks and with many gold and pearl ornaments He wore a double sword at his belt and he was followed by the motley pack of fighting animals that he fed gamboling and dancing about himMeng Huo made him a low obeisance and then poured out his tale of woesMu Lu promised to avenge his wrongs and was led off to a banquet which had been preparedNext day the deliverer went out to battle with his pack of wild creatures in his trainZhao Yun and his colleague Wei Yan quickly made their array of footmen and then took their station in front side by side and studied their opponents The Mang banners and weapons were all extraordinaryMost of the warriors wore no armor and none wore any clothing Their faces were sunburnedThey carried four sharp pointed knives in their beltsSignals were not given by drum or trumpet but by a gongKing Mu Lu had two swords in his belt and carried a hand bell He urged his white elephant forward and emerged from between his flagsWe have spent all our life in the battlefields but we have never seen the like of that before said Zhao YunAs they talked to one another they noticed that the opposing leader was mumbling something that might be a spell or a curse and from time to time he rang his bellThen suddenly the wind got up stones began to roll and sand to fly and there was a sound as of a heavy shower of rainNext a horn rang out and thereupon the tigers and the leopards and the wolves and the serpents and all the other wild beasts came down on the wind snapping and clawingHow could the soldiers of Shu stand such a thing as thatSo they retreated and the Mangs came after them fiercely chasing and slaying their enemies as far as the city of Three RiversZhao Yun and Wei Yan mustered their defeated troops and went to their leader to confess their failure Zhuge Liang however was neither angry nor dejectedThe fault is not yours he saidLong ago when I was still in my rustic hut I knew the Mangs possessed certain powers over beasts and I provided against this adventure before we left ShuYou will find twenty big sealed carts in the baggage trainWe will use half of them now He bade his staff bring forward ten of the red boxcartsThey all wondered what would happen Then the carts were opened and they turned out to be carved and colored models of huge wild beasts with coats of worsted teeth and claws of steel each could accommodate ten peopleChoosing one hundred beasts he told off a thousand troops and bade them stuff the mouths of the beasts full of inflammablesNext day the army of Shu marched out to the attack and were arrayed at the entrance to the Silver Pit HillsThe Mang soldiers went into the ravine and told their king Mu Lu thinking himself perfectly invincible did not hesitate but marched out taking Meng Huo with himZhuge Liang dressed in the simple robe of a Taoist went out in his light chariot In his hand he held a feather fan Meng Huo who recognized his enemy pointed him out to Mu LuThat is Zhuge Liang in that small chariotIf we can only capture him our task is done Then Mu Lu began to mutter his spells and to ring his bellAs before the wind got up and blew with violence and the wild beasts came onBut at a wave of the simple feather fan lo the wind turned and blew the other way Then from out of the host of Shu there burst the horrible wild beastsThe real wild beasts of the Mang saw rushing down upon them huge creatures whose mouths vomited flames and whose nostrils breathed out black smoke They came along with jingling bells snapping and clawing and the real beasts turned tail and fled in among the host of their own side trampling them down as they spedZhuge Liang gave the signal for a general onset and his troops rushed forward with beating drums and blaring trumpets Mu Lu was killed in the meleeMeng Huos whole clan fled in panic and tore up among the hills out of the wayAnd thus the Silver Pit Hill was takenNext day as Zhuge Liang was telling off parties to search for and capture the King it was announced that the brotherinlaw of Meng Huo Chief Dai Lai having vainly tried to persuade the King to yield had made prisoners of him and his wife and all his clan and were bringing them to Zhuge LiangHearing this Zhang Ni and Ma Zhong were called and received certain orders upon which they hid themselves in the wings of the tent with a large body of sturdy warriorsThis done Zhuge Liang ordered the keepers to open the gates and in came Chief Dai Lai with Meng Huo and his people in custodyAs Dai Lai bowed at the entrance of the hall Zhuge Liang called out Let my strong captors appear At once out came the hidden men and every two of them laid hands upon a prisoner and bound himDid you think your paltry ruse would deceive me said Zhuge LiangHere you are a second time captured by your own people and brought before me that you might surrender The first time I did not hurt youBut now I firmly believe this surrender is part of a plot to kill me Then he called out to his guards to search the prisonersThey did so and on every man they found a sharp knifeDid you not say that if your family were taken prisoners you would yield How now said Zhuge LiangWe have come of our own will and at the risk of our lives the credit is not yoursStill I refuse to yield replied Meng Huo This is the sixth time I have captured you and yet you are obstinate what do you expect If you take me a seventh time then I will turn to you and never rebel again Well your stronghold is now destroyed What have I to fear said Zhuge LiangHe ordered the bonds to be loosed saying If you are caught again and lie to me once more I shall certainly not be inclined to let you off Meng Huo and his people put their hands over their heads and ran off like ratsThe defeated Mangs who had fled were of thousands and more than half of them were woundedThey fell in with their King who restored what order was possible and felt glad that he had still some leaders left Then he and the Chief Dai Lai took counsel togetherWhither can we go said Meng HuoOur stronghold is in the hands of the enemy Dai Lai replied There is but one country that can overcome these troops that is the Wugo Kingdom It lies two hundred miles to the southeastThe King of that state is named Wutu Gu He is a giant of twelve spans He does not eat grain but lives on serpents and venomous beastsHe wears scaly armor which is impenetrable to swords and arrowsHis warriors wear rattan armorThis rattan grows in gullies climbing over rocks and wallsThe inhabitants cut the rattans and steep them in oil for half a year Then they are dried in the sunWhen dry they are steeped again and so on many times Then they are plaited into helmets and armorClad in this the men float across rivers and it does not get wet No weapon can penetrate it The soldiers are called the Rattan ArmyYou may seek aid from this king and with his help you can take Zhuge Liang as easily as a sharp knife cleaves a bamboo Meng Huo went to the Wugo Kingdom and saw the KingThe people of this country do not live in houses but dwell in cavesMeng Huo told the story of his woes and obtained a promise of help for which he expressed great gratitudeWutu Gu called up two generals named Xi Ni and Tu An and gave them thirty thousand of the rattanarmored soldiers and bade them march northeastThey came to a river called the River of Peach Flowers on both banks of which grow many peach trees Year after year the leaves of these trees fall into the river and render it poisonous to all but the natives But to the natives it is a stimulant which doubles their vigorThey camped on the bank of this river to await the coming of the army of ShuNow Zhuge Liang was informed of the journey of Meng Huo and its results and he knew when the rattanclad army camped at the fordHe also knew that Meng Huo had collected all the soldiers of his own that he could helpZhuge Liang at once marched to the fordHe questioned the natives and they told him that the peach leaves were falling and the water of the river was undrinkable So he retired two miles and camped Only Wei Yan was left to hold the bank of Peach FlowersNext day Wutu Gu led the Wugo warriors across the stream and with a rolling of drums Wei Yan went out to meet themThe Wugo men approached bent doubleThe soldiers of Shu shot at them but neither arrows nor bolts penetrated their armors they rolled off harmlessNor could swords cut or spears enterThe enemy thus protected and armed with big swords and prongs were too much for the troops of Shu who had to run awayHowever they were not pursuedWhen on the retreat they came to Peach Flower Ford they saw the Mangs crossing as if walking on the waterSome of them were tired so they took off their rattan breastplates sat upon them and floated to the other sideWhen Zhuge Liang heard the report of his general he summoned Lu Kai and called in some nativesLu Kai said I have heard of the Wugo Kingdom as perfectly barbarous the people having no codes of law as they are understood in the Middle EmpireI have also heard of the rattan armor which can withstand all thrusts and the harmful River of Peach Flowers The Southern Mangs are so untameable that victory will mean littleWe would rather retreat No no said Zhuge Liang merrily we have had too much difficulty in getting here to go back so easilyI shall have a counterplan for these people tomorrow Having provided for the defense of his camp he gave strict orders to his generals not to go out to fight Zhuge Liang went to reconnoiter He rode in his light chariot with a few natives as guides He came to the ford and from a secluded spot in the mountains on the north bank he looked about himThe whole country was mountainous and difficult impassable for any carriage So he got out and went afootPresently from a hill he saw a long winding valley like a huge serpent The sides were very precipitous and bare However a road ran through the middleWhat is the name of the valley asked Zhuge LiangIt is called Coiled Serpent Valley said the guidesAt the other end you come into the high road to Three Rivers The road goes by a valley called Talang See The very thing cried Zhuge Liang Surely this is providence I shall score a great success here Having seen enough he retraced his steps found his chariot and returned to camp Arrived at the camp Ma Dai was called and put in charge of the preparations Zhuge Liang gave him an orderI will give you the ten black painted carts and you are to get a thousand long bamboo poles Open the carts and follow my instructions thereThen you are to keep the two ends of the Coiled Serpent ValleyHalf a month is the deadline and all of these must be performed with the most perfect secrecy under military law and punishment Next Zhao Yun was sent to a point on the Three River road Wei Yan to camp at the Peach Flowers FordZhuge Liang told Wei Yan If the Mangs come over the river you are to abandon the camp and march toward a certain white flag you will seeFurther in half a month you would have to acknowledge defeat some fifteen times and abandon seven campsOn no account are you to come to interview me even after fourteen defeats Wei Yan went off not a little hipped at the prospect but prepared to obeyNext Zhang Yi was sent to make a stockade at a certain indicated point and Zhang Ni and Ma Zhong was told to lead the Mang soldiers who had surrendered and other orders were givenMeng Huo had begun to have a real terror of Zhuge Liang and he warned King Wutu Gu of Wugo saying This Zhuge Liang is exceedingly craftyAmbush is one of his favorite ruses so you should warn your soldiers that on no account should they enter a valley where the trees are thick Great King you speak with reason said Wutu Gu I have always heard that the people of the Middle Empire are full of wiles and I will see that your advice is followedI will go in front to fight and you may remain in the rear to give orders Presently the scouts told them of the arrival of the troops of Shu on the bank of the Peach Flowers RiverWutu Gu sent his two generalsXi Ni and Tu Anto cross the river and engage themThe two sides met but Wei Yan soon suffered a defeat and left the fieldThe Mangs were afraid to pursue as they dreaded an ambushIn the meantime Wei Yan laid out another campThe Mangs crossed the river in greater force Wei Yan came out to meet them but again fled after a very short fightThis time the Mangs pursued but having lost their hold of the enemy after three miles and coming then to the late camp of the Shu army which seemed quite safe they occupied itNext day Xi Ni and Tu An asked their King Wutu Gu to come to the camp and they reported what had happenedWutu Gu decided to make a general advance to drive the troops of Shu before him They fled even casting aside their breastplates and throwing away their arms they were in such haste to fleeAnd the troops of Shu went toward a white flag that appeared in the distanceThey found a camp already made which they occupiedSoon however Wutu Gu came near and as he pressed forward Wei Yan abandoned this camp and fledWhen the Mangs reached the camp they took up quarters thereinSoon after they set out to renew the pursuit but Wei Yan turned back and checked them This was only a temporary check for he fled after three encounters going toward a white flag in the distanceThis sort of thing continued daily until the soldiers of Shu had been defeated and driven out of the field fifteen times and had abandoned their camp on seven different occasionsThe Mangs were now hot in pursuit and pressed on with all their might Wutu Gu being in the forefront of the pursuersBut then they came to a thick umbrageous wood and he halted for he saw flags moving about behind the sheltering trees Just as you foretold said Wutu Gu to Meng Huo The men of Shu like using ambush Yes Zhuge Liang is going to be worsted this timeWe have beaten off his troops now daily for half a month and won fifteen successive victories His troops simply run when they hear the windThe fact is he has exhausted all his craft and has tried every ruseNow our task is nearly done Wutu Gu was greatly cheered and began to feel contempt for his enemyThe sixteenth day of the long fight found Wei Yan leading his oftdefeated troops once more against the rattanprotected foe King Wutu Gu on his white elephant was well in the forefront He had on a cap with symbols of the sun and moon and streamers of wolfs beard a fringed garment studded with gems which allowed the plates or scales of his cuirass to appear and his eyes seemed to flash fire He pointed the finger of scorn at Wei Yan and began to revile himWei Yan whipped up his steed and fledThe Mangs pressed after himWei Yan made for the Coiled Serpent Valley for he saw a white flag calling him thitherWutu Gu followed in hot haste and as he saw only bare hills without a sign of vegetation he felt quite confident that no ambush was laidSo he followed into the valley There he saw some score of black painted carts in the roadThe soldiers said to each other The carts must be the commissariat wagons of the enemy abandoned in their hasty flight when they heard of the coming of Your Majesty This only urged the King to greater speed and he went on toward the other mouth of the valley for the soldiers of Shu had disappearedHowever he saw piles of timber being tumbled down across the track and great boulders rolled down the hill side into the roadThe pursuers cleared away the obstacles When they had done so and advanced a little they saw certain wheeled vehicles in the road some large some small laden with wood and straw which was burning Wutu Gu was suddenly frightened and ordered a retreat But he heard much shouting in the rear and they told himThe exit has been blocked with woodladen carts which on being broken open are found to contain gunpowder and they are all on fire However seeing that the valley was barren and devoid of grass and wood Wutu Gu was not in the least alarmed and merely bade his soldiers search for a way roundThen he saw torches being hurled down the mountain side These torches rolled till they came to a certain spot where they ignited the fuses leading to the powder Then the ground suddenly heaved with the explosion of bombs beneathThe whole valley was soon full of flames darting and playing in all directions and wherever they met with rattan armor the rattan caught fire and thus the whole army huddled and crowded together burned in the midst of the valleyZhuge Liang looked on from the heights above and saw the Mangs burned Many of the dead had been mangled and torn by the explosions of the mines The air was full of suffocating vaporZhuge Liangs tears fell fast as he saw the slaughter and he sighed saying Though I am rendering great service to my country yet I have sacrificed many lives My life may be shortened for this Those who were with him were also deeply affectedKing Meng Huo was in his camp awaiting news of success when he saw a crowd of Mang soldiers come along and they bowed before him and told him King Wutu Gu is fighting a great battle and is about to surround Zhuge Liang in the Valley of the Coiled Serpent But he needs helpWe are the natives of the local ravines and we ourselves had no alternative when we yielded to ShuBut now we have returned to your allegiance and are willing to come to help Your Majesty So Meng Huo placed himself at the head of his clansmen and those who had just come to him and lost no time in marching outHe bade them lead him to the spotBut when he reached the valley and saw the destruction he knew he had been made a victim again As he made to retire there appeared a body of his enemies on each side under Zhang Ni and Ma Zhong and they began to attack Meng Huo was making what stand he could when a great shouting aroseThe Mangs were nearly all disguised soldiers of Shu and they quickly surrounded him and his clansmen to make them prisonersMeng Huo galloped clear and got into the hillsPresently he fell upon a small chariot with a few guards about it and therein sat Zhuge Liang simply dressed and holding a fanWhat now rebel Meng Huo cried heBut Meng Huo had galloped awayHe was soon stopped by Ma Dai and lay a helpless prisoner bound hand and foot His wife Lady Zhurong and the other members of his family were also taken Zhuge Liang returned to camp and seated himself in the high place in his own tentHe was still sad at the thought of the sacrifice of life and he said to his officers There was no help for it I had to use that plan But it has sadly injured my inner virtueGuessing that the enemy would suspect an ambush in every thicket I sent people to walk about in wooded places with flags Really there was no ambushI bade Wei Yan lose battle after battle just to lead the enemy on and harden their heartsWhen I saw the Valley of the Coiled Serpent with its bare sides of smooth rock and the road in its depths I recognized what could be done and sent Ma Dai to arrange the contents of the black carts the mines which I had prepared long ago for this purpose In every bomb were nine others and they were buried thirty paces apart They were connected by fuses laid in hollow bamboos that they might explode in succession and the force was enormousZhao Yun prepared those carts laden with straw and rolled down the piles of timber and boulders that blocked the mouthWei Yan led Wutu Gu on and on till he had enticed the King into the valley when he took up a position to escapeThen the burning beganThey say that what is good for water is not much good for fire and the oilsoaked rattan excellent as a protection against swords and arrows was most inflammable catching fire at sightThe Mangs were so stubborn that the only way was to use fire or we should never have scored a victoryBut I much regret that the destruction of the people of Wugo has been so complete The officers were deeply movedThen Meng Huo was summonedHe appeared and fell upon his kneesHis limbs were freed from the bonds and he was sent into a side tent for refreshmentBut the officers told off to entertain him received certain secret ordersThe chief prisoners were Meng Huo Lady Zhurong Meng You and Dai Lai There were many of his clan as wellAs they were eating and drinking a messenger appeared in the door of the tent and addressed the King The Prime Minister is ashamed and does not wish to see you again SirHe has sent me to release you You may enlist another army if you can and once more try a decisive battleNow you may go But instead of going Meng Huo began to weepSeven times a captive and seven times released said the King Surely there was never anything like it in the whole worldI know I am a barbarian and beyond the pale but I am not entirely devoid of a sense of propriety and rectitudeDoes he think that I feel no shame Thereupon he and all his followers fell upon their knees and crawled to the tent of the CommanderinChief and begged pardon saying O Minister you are the majesty of Heaven We people of the south will offer no more opposition Then you yield said Zhuge Liang sighingI and my children and grandchildren are deeply affected by your allpervading and lifegiving mercyNow how can we not yield Zhuge Liang asked Meng Huo to come up into the tent and be seated and he prepared a banquet of felicitationAlso he confirmed Meng Huo in his kingship and restored all the places that had been capturedEveryone was overwhelmed with Zhuge Liangs generosity and they all went away rejoicing A poem has praised Zhuge Liangs actionHe rode in his chariot green In his hand just a feather fan Seven times he released a king As part of his conquering planHaving chosen a beautiful spot Where the valleys debauch on the plain Lest his kindness should ever be forgot The vanquished erected a faneThe High Counselor Fei Yi ventured to remonstrate with Zhuge Liang on his policyHe said You O Minister have led the army this long journey into the wilds and have reduced the Mang country and have brought about the submission of the king why not appoint officials to share in the administration and hold the land Zhuge Liang replied There are three difficultiesTo leave foreigners implies leaving a guard for them there is the difficulty of feeding a guardThe Mangs have lost many of their relatives To leave foreigners without a guard will invite a calamity this is the second difficultyAmong the Mangs dethronements and murders are frequent and there will be enmities and suspicions Foreigners and they will be mutually distrustful this is the third difficultyIf I do not leave our people I shall not have to send supplies which makes for peace and freedom from trouble They had to agree that the policy was wiseThe kindness of the conqueror was rewarded by the gratitude of these southern people and they even erected a shrine in his honor where they sacrificed at the four seasonsThey called him their Gracious Father and they sent gifts of jewels cinnabar lacquer medicines plowing cattle and chargers for the use of the army And they pledged themselves not to rebelWhen the feastings to the soldiers were finished the army marched homeward to ShuWei Yan was in command of the advanced column He marched to the River Lu But on his arrival the clouds gathered and a gale blew over the face of the waters Because of the force of the gale the army could not advanceWei Yan then returned and reported the matter to his chiefZhuge Liang called in Meng Huo to ask what this might meanThe Mangs beyond the border have yielded now at last The water demons raging mad wont let the Shu men go pastThe next chapter will contain Meng Huos explanation CHAPTER  Sacrificing At River Scorpio The Prime Minister Marches Homeward Attacking Wei The Lord Of Wuxiang Presents A MemorialMeng Huo at the head of the Mang Chieftains and Notables attended to do honor to the army of Shu on its departureThey reached the River Lu in autumn the ninth month But on trying to cross the river a tremendous storm came and hindered themWei Yan having reported his difficulty to Zhuge Liang Meng Huo was asked if he knew of any reason for such a stormMeng Huo replied Wild spirits have always troubled those who would cross this river it is necessary to propitiate them with sacrifices What is the sacrifice asked Zhuge LiangIn the old days when malicious spirits brought misfortune they sacrificed humans to the number of seven sevens and offered their heads They also slew a black ox and a white goat Sacrifice thus the wind will subside and the waters come to restThe same used to be done to secure a plenteous harvest How can I slay a single man without good reason now that fighting is done and peace has returned said Zhuge LiangZhuge Liang went down to the river to see for himselfThe north wind was blowing hard and the waves were high Both humans and horses seemed frightenedHe himself was perplexed Then he sought out some of the natives and questioned themThey said We have heard the demons moaning every night since the army crossed the riverThe cries begin at dusk and continued till dawnThere are many dark demons in the malarial vapors and no one dared cross The sin is mine said Zhuge Liang for more than a thousand soldiers of Ma Dai perished in these waters beside the southern people Their poor distressed souls are not yet freedTherefore I will come this night and sacrifice to them According to the ancient rule the number of victims ought to be fortynine then the spirits will disperse said the nativesAs the resentful demons are here because of the deaths of people where is the sense in slaying more humansBut this will I doI will make balls of flour paste after the manner of human heads and stuff them with the flesh of oxen and goatsThese shall be used instead of human heads for indeed they be called mantou or human heads By nightfall an altar had been set up on the bank of the river with the sacrificial objects all arranged There were also fortynine lamps Flags were flying to summon the soulsThe mantou were piled up on the groundIn the middle of the third watch at midnight Zhuge Liang dressed in Taoist garb went to offer the sacrifice in person and he bade Dong Jue read this prayerOn the first day of the ninth month of the third year of the era Beginning Prosperity of the Han Dynasty I Zhuge Liang Prime Minister of Han Lord of Wuxiang Imperial Protector of Yiazhou reverently order this sacrifice to appease the shades of those soldiers of Shu who have died in their countrys service and those of the southern people who have perished I now declare to you O ye shades the majesty of my master the Emperor of the mighty Han Dynasty excelling that of the Five Feudatories and brilliantly continuing the glory of the three ancient kingsRecently when the distant south rebelliously invaded his territory contumeliously sent an army loosed the venom of their sorcery and gave free rein to their savagery in rebellion I was commanded to punish their crimesWherefore my brave armies marched and utterly destroyed the contemptible rebelsMy brave soldiers gathered like the clouds and the insensate rebels melted awayHearing of the easy successes I won they were entirely demoralizedMy army consists of heroes from the Nine Regions and officers and people are famous in the empire all are expert in war and skilled in the use of arms they go whither light leads them and serve the Emperor All have exerted themselves to obey orders and carried out the plans for the seven captures of Meng HuoThey were wholehearted in their service and vied in loyaltyWho could foresee that you O Spirits would be sacrificed in the strategy and be involved in the enemies wicked wilesSome of you went down to the deep springs wounded by flying arrows others went out into the long night hurt by lethal weapons Living you were valorous dead you left behind a name Now we are returning home The victors song is in our mouths and our prisoners accompany usYour spirits are with us still and certainly hear our prayers Follow the banners come with the host return to your country each to his own village where you may enjoy the savor of the meat offerings and receive the sacrifices of your own familiesDo not become wandering ghosts in unfamiliar hamlets of restless shades in strange citiesI will memorialize our Emperor that your wives and little ones may enjoy his gracious bounty every year gifts of food and clothing every month donations for sustenanceComfort yourselves with this provisionAs for you Spirits of this place shades of the departed people of the south here is the usual sacrifice You are near homeLiving you stood in awe of the celestial majesty dead you come within the sphere of refining influence It is right that you should hold your peace and refrain from uttering unseemly criesWith bowed head I pray you partake of the sweet savor of this sacrificeAlas ye deadTo you this offering Zhuge Liang broke into loud lamentations at the end of this prayer and manifested extreme emotion and the whole army shed tearsMeng Huo and his followers also moaned and wept and amid the sad clouds and angry mists they saw the vague forms of many demons floating away on the wind till they disappearedThe material portion of the sacrifice was then thrown into the riverNext day the army stood on the south bank with a clear sky over their heads and calm waters at their feet the clouds gone and the winds hushed and the crossing was made without misadventureThey continued their way whips cracking gongs clanging spurs jingling and ever and anon the song of victory rising over allPassing through Yongchang Wang Kang and Lu Kai were left there in command of the four territoriesYiazhou Yongchang Zangge and Yuesui And then Meng Huo was permitted to leaveHe was ordered to be diligent in his administration maintain good control and soothe and care for the people left to him to govern and to see to it that agriculture was promotedHe took leave with tears rolling down his cheeks When the army neared Capital Chengdu the Latter Ruler came out ten miles in state to welcome his victorious ministerThe Emperor stood by the roadside as Zhuge Liang came up and waitedZhuge Liang quickly descended from his chariot prostrated himself and said Thy servant has offended in causing his master anxiety but the conquest of the south was long The Emperor took Zhuge Liang kindly by the hand and raised him Then the chariots of the Son of God and his minister returned to Chengdu side by side In the capital were great rejoicings with banquets and rewards for the armyHenceforward distant nations sent tribute to the Imperial Court to the number of two hundredAs proposed in a memorial the Emperor provided for the families of the soldiers who had lost their lives in the expedition and they were made happyAnd the whole land enjoyed tranquillity The Ruler of Wei Cao Pi had now ruled seven years and it was the fourth year of Beginning Prosperity in ShuHan calendarCao Pi had taken to wife a lady of the Zhen family formerly the wife of the second son of Yuan Shao He had discovered Lady Zhen at the sack of Yejun and had married herShe bore him a son Cao Rui who was very clever and a great favorite with his fatherLater Cao Pi took as Beloved Consort a daughter of Guo Yong in GuangzongLady Guo was a woman of exceeding beauty whom her father said She is the king among women and the name Female King stuck to herBut with Lady Guos arrival at court Lady Zhen fell from her lords favor and the Beloved Consorts ambition led her to intrigue to replace the Empress She took Zhang Tao a minister at the court into her confidenceAt that time the Emperor was indisposed and Zhang Tao alleged saying In the palace of the Empress has been dug up a wooden image with Your Majestys date of birth written thereonIt is meant to exercise a maleficent influence Cao Pi in his anger forced his Empress to commit suicide and he set up the Beloved Consort in her place But Lady Guo had no issueWherefore she nourished Cao Rui as her ownHowever loved as Cao Rui was he was not then named heirWhen he was about fifteen Cao Rui who was an expert archer and a daring rider accompanied his father to the hunt In a gully they started a doe and its fawnCao Pi shot the doe while the fawn fled Seeing that the fawns course led past his sons horse Cao Pi called out to him to shoot itInstead the youth bursts into tears Your Majesty has slain the mother how can one kill the child as well The words struck the Emperor with remorseHe threw aside his bow saying My son you would make a benevolent and virtuous ruler From this circumstance Cao Pi decided that Cao Rui should succeed and conferred upon him the princedom of PingyuanIn the fifth month the Emperor fell ill and medical treatment was of no avail So the chief officers were summoned to the bedside of the Emperor They were Commander of the Central Army Cao Zhen General Who Guards the West Chen Qun and Grand Commander Sima Yi When they had come the Emperors son was called and the dying Emperor spoke thus I am grievously ill and my end is nearI confide to your care and guidance this son of mine you must support him out of good feeling for me Why does Your Majesty talk thus said theyWe will do our utmost to serve you for a thousand autumns and a myriad years No I know that I am about to die said the EmperorThe sudden fall of the gates of Xuchang this year was the omen as I well knew Just then the attendants said that General Who Conquers the East Cao Xiu had come to ask after the Emperors health They were told to call Cao Xiu into the chamberWhen he had entered Cao Pi said to him You and these three are the pillars and cornerstones of the state If you will only uphold my son I can close my eyes in peace These were his last wordsA flood of tears gushed forth and Cao Pi sank back on the couch deadHe was forty years of age and had reigned seven years  The four ministers raised the wailing for the dead and forthwith busied themselves with setting up Cao Rui as the Emperor of Great WeiThe late Emperor received the posthumous style of Emperor Pi The late Empress the consort who had suffered death was styled Empress Zhen Honors were distributed freely in celebration of the new reignZhong Yao was made Imperial Guardian Cao Zhen Regent Marshal Cao Xiu Minister of War Hua Xin Grand Commander Wang Lang Minister of the Interior Chen Qun Minister of Works Sima Yi Imperial Commander of the Flying Cavalry and many others conspicuous and obscure were promotedA general amnesty was declared throughout all the landAbout this time a vacancy existed in the governorship of Xizhou and XiliangSima Yi asked for the post and got itHe left for his new office as soon as he had received the appointment In due time the news of all these doings reached Zhuge Liang and perturbed him not a little He was anxious saying Cao Pi is dead and his son Cao Rui has succeeded him But that is not my concern Only I am worried about Sima Yi who is very crafty and skillful in the art of war and who in command of all western forces of Xizhou and Xiliang may prove a serious danger to Shu This Sima Yi ought to be attacked at once Counselor Ma Su spoke of this matterYou O Minister have just returned from an arduous and exhausting expedition and you should take time to recuperate before you undertake such anotherHowever I have a scheme by which Cao Rui may be brought to work the destruction of Sima Yi May I lay it before you What plan have you said heThe young emperor has no confidence in Sima Yi although Sima Yi is a high minister of stateNow send someone secretly to Luoyang and Yejun to disseminate reports that Sima Yi is about to rebelFurther prepare a proclamation in his name and post it up so as to cause Cao Rui to mistrust him and put him to death Zhuge Liang adopted the suggestionWhence it came about that a notice suddenly appeared on the city gate of YejunThe wardens of the gate took it down and sent it to Cao Rui This is what it saidI Sima Yi Imperial Commander of the Flying Cavalry Commander of the Forces of Xizhou and Xiliang confident in the universal principles of right now inform the empire saying The Founder of this Dynasty Emperor Cao established himself with the design of recurring the empire to the Lord of Linzi Cao ZhiUnfortunately calumny spread abroad and the Emperor could not manifest himself for many yearsHis grandson Cao Rui does not follow a virtuous course though sitting in the high place and has not fulfilled the great intention of his ancestorNow I in accordance with the will of Heaven and favoring the desires of the people have decided upon a day to set my army in motion in order to secure the wish of the people and when that day arrives I call upon each one to gather to his lord and I will destroy utterly the family of any who shall disobeyYou are hereby informed that you may all know This document frightened the young Emperor and he turned pale At once he called a council of his officials to consider itHua Xin said That was the reason for his having requested the governorship of Xizhou and XiliangNow Emperor Cao the Founder of Great Wei frequently said to me that Sima Yi was ambitious and hungry and should not be entrusted with military authority lest he harm the state This is the first beginning of rebellion and the author should be put to death Wang Lang said Sima Yi is a master of strategy and skilled in tacticsMoreover he is ambitious and will cause mischief if he be allowed to live Wherefore Cao Rui wrote a command to raise an army which he would lead to punish the ministerSuddenly Cao Zhen stood forth from the rank of military officers and said What you advise is impossibleHis late Majesty Emperor Pi confided his son to the care of certain officers of state of whom Sima Yi is one wherefore it is certain that he felt sure of his probitySo far nothing is known certainly If you hastily send an army to repress him you may force him into rebellionThis may be but one of the base tricks of Shu or Wu to cause dissension in our midst so that occasion be found to further their own aimsAs no one knows I pray Your Majesty reflect before you do anything Supposing Sima Yi really contemplates a revolt what then said Cao RuiCao Zhen replied If Your Majesty suspects him then do as did Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor of Han when under pretense of taking a trip on the Lake Yunmeng he summoned his vassalsand seized Han Xin who had been denouncedGo to Anyi Sima Yi will assuredly come out to meet you and his actions and demeanor may be watched closelyHe can be arrested if needed Cao Rui changed his mindLeaving Cao Zhen to regulate the affairs of state the young Emperor went out with the Imperial Guards to the number of one hundred thousand and traveled to AnyiIgnorant of the reason of the Emperors coming and anxious to show off his dignity Sima Yi went to welcome his ruler in all the pomp of a commander of a great armyAs Sima Yi approached the courtiers told the Emperor saying Sima Yis defection is certain since such a large army can only mean that he is prepared to resist Whereupon Cao Xiu with a large force was sent in front to meet himSima Yi thought the Imperial Chariot was coming and he advanced alone and stood humbly by the roadside till Cao Xiu came upCao Xiu advanced and said Friend His late Majesty entrusted you with the heavy responsibility of caring for his son why are you in revolt Sima Yi turned pale and a cold sweat broke out all over him as he asked the reason for such a chargeCao Xiu told him what had occurredThis is a vile plot on the part of our rivals Shu and Wu to cause dissension said Sima Yi It is a design to make the Emperor work evil upon his ministers that thereby another may profitI must see the Son of Heaven and explain Ordering his army to retire Sima Yi went forward alone to the Emperors chariot bowed low and said weeping His late Majesty gave me charge of his son could I betray him This is a wile of the enemyI crave permission to lead an army first to destroy Shu and then to attack Wu whereby to show my gratitude to the late Emperor and Your Majesty and manifest my own true heart However Cao Rui did not feel quite convinced and Hua Xin said In any case withdraw his military powers and let him go into retirement And thus it was decidedSima Yi was forced to retire to his native villageCao Xiu succeeded to his command and Cao Rui returned to Luoyang Zhuge Liang rejoiced when they told him of the success that had attended the ruse Sima Yi and the forces he commanded in Xizhou and Xiliang have been the obstacles in my longwishedfor attack on WeiNow he has fallen I have no more anxiety At the first great assembly of officers at court Zhuge Liang stepped forth and presented to the Ruler of Shu a memorial on the expedition he contemplatedThe First Ruler had accomplished but half his great task at his deathAt this moment the empire is in three parts and our country is weak it is a most critical moment for usStill ministers are not remiss in the capital and loyal and devoted soldiers sacrifice their lives abroad for they still remember the special kindness of the First Ruler and wish to show their gratitude to him by service to Your MajestyTherefore it would be indeed fitting that you should extend your holy virtue to glorify his virtuous memory in the stimulation of the will of your purposeful officersYour Majesty should not lose yourself in the pursuit of mean things quoting phrases to confound the eternal principles of rectitude and so preventing remonstrance from honest peopleOne rule applies to the palace of the Emperor and the residence of a courtier there must be one law rewarding the good and punishing the evilEvildoers and lawbreakers as also true and good people should be dealt with according to their deserts by the officers concerned in order to manifest Your Majestys impartial and enlightened administrationPartiality is wrong as is one law for the court and another for the regionsThe High Ministers Fei Yi Guo Youzhi and Dong Yun are honest men devotedly anxious to be loyal to the last degree wherefore His late Majesty chose them in his testamentMy advice is to consult them in all palace matters great or small before taking action Your Majesty will reap the enormous advantage of having any failings correctedGeneral Xiang Chong is a man of wellbalanced temperament versed in military matters to whom after testing him the late Emperor applied the epithet capable The consensus of opinion is that he should be CommanderinChiefMy advice is to consult him in all military matters great or small whereby your military forces will yield their maximum each one being employed to the best advantageAttract worthy people repel mean ones This policy achieved the glory of the Former Hans while its reversal ruined the Latter HansWhen the late Emperor was with us he often discussed this with your servant and he took much to heart the story of Emperors Huan and Ling The Chair of the Secretariat Chen Zhen Commander Zhang Yi and Minister Jiang Wan are both incorruptible and enlightened people honest to the death I wish that Your Majesty should have them near and hold them in confidence If this be done then the glory of the House of Han will be quickly consummatedI was originally a private person a farmer in Nanyang concerned only to secure personal safety in a troubled age and not seeking conversation with the contending noblesHis late Majesty the First Ruler overlooking the commonness of my origin condescended to seek me thrice in my humble cot and consult me on the trend of events His magnanimity affected me deeply and I consented to do my utmost for himThen came defeat and I took office at a moment of darkest outlook and at a most difficult crisis This is twentyone years agoThe First Ruler recognized my diligent care and when dying he confided the great task to meFrom that day I have lived a life of anxiety lest I should fail in my trust and so dim his gloryThat is why I undertook the expedition to the lands beyond the River LuNow the Southern Mang has been quelled and our army is in good condition I ought to lead it against the north where I may meet with a measure of success in the removal of the wicked ones the restoration of Han and a return to the old capital This is my duty out of gratitude to the late Emperor and loyalty to Your MajestyAs to a discussion of the pros and cons and giving a true version of the whole matter that belongs to Guo Youzhi and Fei Yi and Dong YunI desire Your Majesty to confide to me the task of slaying the rebels and restoring the Hans If I fail then punish me by telling the spirit of the late EmperorIf you know not what restoration implies that is the fault of your advisersYour Majesty should take pains to be guided into the right path and examine carefully what is laid before you carefully remembering the late Emperors testamentI cannot express what would be my delight if you had the goodness to accept and act on my adviceNow I am about to depart on a distant expedition I write this with tears and clearly know what I have said The Emperor read it through and said My FatherMinister you have only just returned from a distant and fatiguing expedition against the Southern Mangs you are not yet refreshed and I fear this march to the north will be almost too much even for you Zhuge Liang replied The heaviest responsibility lies upon me the wellbeing of Your Majesty confided to me by the First RulerMy efforts may not be relaxed night or dayThe south is at rest at home is no anxiety what better time could be hoped for to destroy the rebels and recover the capital Forth from the ranks of courtiers stood Minister Qiao Zhou and said I have studied the aspect of the stars the northern quarter is brilliant and strongThe scheme will not speed Then turning toward the Prime Minister he continued You O Minister understand the mysteries of the skies why do you oppose the stars Because the stars are in infinite changes replied Zhuge Liang One may rely on the stars too muchMoreover I have already sent the army into Hanzhong where I shall act as soon as I have studied what is afoot Qiao Zhou pleaded in vain Zhuge Liang was too strongly set upon his purpose to yieldSo Guo Youzhi Dong Yun and Fei Yi were ordered to attend to matters in the palace Xiang Chong was to control all military affairs and forces Jiang Wan was made Military Adviser Chen Zhen became Chair of the Secretariat Zhang Yi Controller of the Prime Ministers palace Du Qiong Imperial Censor Du Wei and Yang Hong Ministers Meng Guang and Lai Min Libationers Yin Mo and Li Zhuan Academicians Xi Zheng and Fei Shi General Secretaries Qiao Zhou Imperial Recorder and others to the number of over a hundred all to manage the administration of Shu in the absence of Zhuge LiangAfter having received his Emperors command to lead an expedition against the North Zhuge Liang returned to his palace and summoned the officers of the army to listen to the ordersAnd they came and to each was appointed a duty in the great army of Zhuge Liang CommanderinChief of the Northconquering Expedition Prime Minister of Shu Lord of Wuxiang Imperial Protector of Yiazhou Director of Internal and External AffairsWei Yan was made Commander of the Front Army Li Hui Commander of the Rear Army Ma Dai Commander of the Left Army Ma Zhong Commander of the Right Army Liu Yan Deng Zhi and Ma Su Commanders of the Central Army Guan Xing Commander of the Left Guard Zhang Bao Commander of the Right Guard Zhang Ni Wang Ping Wu Yi Wu Ban Liao Hua Liu Ba Gao Xiang and others Marching Generals Yan Yan Hu Ji Cuan Xi Yang Yi and others Military Counselors Fan Jian Dong Jue Guan Yong and others Secretaries and Recorders Ding Xian and others Officers of the CommissariatLi Yan was given the task of guarding the passes against Wu All being ready a day was chosen for the startthe fifth year the third month on the day of tiger After the appointments had all been made there came forward a veteran who had listened in vain for the duty assigned himOld I may be said he yet have I still the valor of Lian Po and the heroism of Ma YuanWhy am I thought useless any more than these two who refused to acknowledge old age It was Zhao YunZhuge Liang said I have lost my friend Ma Chao by illness since I returned from the Southern Expedition and I feel as I had lost an armNow General you must own that the years are mounting upAny slight lapse would not only shake the lifelong reputation of yourself but might have a bad effect on the whole army Zhao Yun replied bitterly I have never quailed in the presence of the enemy from the day I first joined the First Ruler I have ever pressed to the frontIt is a happy ending for a person of valor to die on the frontier Think you that I should resent itLet me lead the van I pray Zhuge Liang used all his skill to dissuade the veteran but in vain he was set on it threatening suicide if this honor was refused him At last Zhuge Liang yielded an the condition that he would accept a colleague I will go to help the veteran leader cried Deng Zhi without a moments hesitationI am not worth much but I will help lead the attack on the enemy Accordingly five thousand of veterans were chosen for the advanced guard and with them to assist Zhao Yun went Deng Zhi and ten other generalsAfter the vanguard had set out the main body marched by the north gate the Emperor himself going to see his minister start The farewell was taken three miles from the gate in the face of the grand army with its banners and pennons flaunting in the wind and spears and swords gleaming in the sun Then they took the road leading to HanzhongNaturally this movement was duly reported in Luoyang at a court held by Cao Rui when a minister said A report from the border stations says that Zhuge Liang has marched three hundred thousand troops into HanzhongZhao Yun and Deng Zhi are leading the advanced guard The report alarmed the Emperor and he asked Who can lead an army to repel the advance At once out spoke one saying My father died in Hanzhong and to my bitter resentment his death is unavengedNow I desire to lead the army against Shu and I pray that the armies west of the Pass may be given me for this purpose I shall render a service to the state as well as taking vengeance for my fatherI care not what fate may befall me The speaker was Xiahou Yuans son Xiahou MaoHe was by nature very impulsive and also very miserly When young he had been adopted by Xiahou DunWhen Xiahou Yuan was killed by Huang Zhong Cao Cao was moved and married Xiahou Mao to one of his daughters Princess Qinghe so that he was an Emperors soninlaw As such he enjoyed great deference at courtBut although he held a military commission he had never been with the armyHowever as he requested the command he was made CommanderinChief to get the western army ready to marchThe Minister Wang Lang spoke against the appointment saying The appointment is wrongXiahou Mao the SoninLaw has never seen a battle and is unsuitable for this post especially when his opponent is the clever and crafty Zhuge Liang a man thoroughly versed in strategy I suppose you have arranged with Zhuge Liang to be his ally sneered Xiahou MaoEver since I was a boy I have studied strategy and I am well acquainted with army mattersWhy do you despise my youthUnless I capture this Zhuge Liang I pledge myself never again to see the Emperors face Wang Lang and his supporters were silencedXiahou Mao took leave of the Ruler of Wei and hastened to Changan to get his army in order He had two hundred thousand troops from the western areasHe would go to battle take the signal flags in grip But could he play the leader he a lad with callow lipThe next chapter will deal with this campaign CHAPTER Zhao Yun Slays Five Generals Zhuge Liang Takes Three Cities Zhuge Liangs army marched northward passing through Mianyang where stood Ma Chaos tomb In honor of the dead Tiger General Zhuge Liang sacrificed there in person Ma Chaos cousinMa Daibeing chief mourner for the occasionAfter this ceremony when the CommanderinChief was discussing his plans the spies came in to reportThe Ruler of Wei Cao Rui has put in motion all western forces under Xiahou Mao Then Wei Yan went in to offer a plan saying Xiahou Mao is a child of a wealthy family soft and stupidGive me five thousand troops and I will go out by Baozhong follow the line of the Qinling Mountains east to the Ziwu Valley and then turn north In ten days I can be at ChanganHearing of my intent Xiahou Mao will hasten to vacate the city Then he must flee by way of Royal GateI will come in by the east and you Sir can advance by the Xie ValleyIn this way and all west of Xianyang will be ours in just one move Zhuge Liang smiled at the suggestion I do not think the plan quite perfect said he You are gambling by thinking there is no northerner worth considering guarding ChanganIf anyone suggests sending a force across to block the exit of the mountains I am afraid we should lose five thousand troops to say nothing of the check to our elanThe plan will not do If you O Minister march by the high road they will bring against you the whole host within the passes and will thus hold you indefinitely you will never get to the Middle Land But I shall go along the level road on the right of LongyouI cannot fail if I keep to the fixed rules of war Wei Yan withdrew gloomy and dissatisfiedThen Zhuge Liang sent Zhao Yun orders to the advanced guard to moveXiahou Mao was at Changan preparing his forceThere came to him a general from Xiliang named Han De a man of great valor whose weapon was a mighty battleax called Mountain Splitter He brought with him eighty thousand of the Qiang tribesmen and offered his servicesThey were gladly accepted and his army was made the van of the attackThis Han De had four sons all very expert in archery and horsemanship They were named Han Ying Han Yao Han Qiong and Han Qi and they came to serve under their fatherHan De led his sons and the eighty thousand troops by the road to Phoenix Song Mountain where they were near the army of Shu and here they drew up the array When the battle line was in order the father with his four sons rode to the front and began to revile their enemy shouting Rebels and raidersHow dare you invade our territory Zhao Yun quickly lost his temper rode forward and challengedThe eldest son Han Ying accepted and galloped out but he was slain in the third boutImmediately his brother Han Yao went out whirling his swordBut now Zhao Yuns blood was up and the old dash and vigor came upon him so that the young man had no chance to win the battleThen the third son Han Qiong took his great halberd and dashed out to his brothers aidZhao Yun had now two opponents nevertheless he held his own nor blenched nor failed a strokeSeeing that his two brothers were nearing defeat the fourth son Han Qi went to join in the fray with his pair of swords that he had named Sun and Moon And there was the veteran warrior with three against him and he still kept them at bayPresently a spear thrust got home on Han Qi who fell Another general then coming out to take his placeZhao Yun lowered his spear and fledHan Qiong then took his bow and shot three arrows at the fugitive who turned them aside so that they fell harmlessAngry at this Han Qiong again seized his halberd and went in pursuitBut Zhao Yun took his bow and shot an arrow that wounded his pursuer in the face So Han Qiong fell and died Han Yao then galloped up and raised his sword to strike but Zhao Yun slipped past got within his guard and made Han Yao a prisonerZhao Yun quickly galloped into his own array with his captive dropped him and then dashing out recovered his spear which had fallen when he seized his manHan De was overwhelmed with the loss of all his sons and went behind the battle arrayHis Qiang tribesmen were too frightened at the prowess of Zhao Yun to be of any use in battle and no one dared to meet the old warriorSo they retired while Zhao Yun rode to and fro among them slaying at his willI thought of brave old people of Zhao Yun Who spite of numbered years three scores and ten Was marvelous strong in battle who one day Slew four opposing generals as great as When at Dangyang he had saved his lordSeeing the successful battle that Zhao Yun was waging Deng Zhi led on his troops to join in the fight This completed the discomfiture of the Xiliang army and they ran awayHan De seeing the danger of being captured threw off his armor and went on foot The soldiers of Shu drew off and returned to their campIn camp Deng Zhi felicitated his veteran colleagueFor a man of seventy years you are unique and wonderful said he You are as much the hero as you ever wereIt is almost an incomparable feat to have slain four generals in one day Yet the Prime Minister thought me too old and did not wish to employ meI had to give him a proof The captive Han Yao was sent to the main body with the messenger who bore an account of the victoryIn the meantime Han De led his defeated army back to his chief to whom he related his sad story with many tearsThen Xiahou Mao got angry and decided to lead his own army out against Zhao YunWhen the scouts reported his coming Zhao Yun took his spear and mounted his steedHe led one thousand troops out to Phoenix Song Mountain at the foot of which he made his arrayXiahou Mao was wearing a golden casque riding a white horse and carrying a huge swordFrom his place beneath the great standard he saw Zhao Yun galloping to and fro He was going out to give battle when Han De checked himIs it not mine to avenge my four sons said Han DeHan De seized his mountainsplitter ax and rode directly at the warrior who advanced with furyThe contest was but short for in the third encounter Zhao Yuns spear thrust brought Han De to the earthWithout waiting a moment he made for Xiahou Mao who hastily dashed in behind his ranks and so escaped Then Deng Zhi led on the main body and completed the victoryThe force of Wei retired three miles and made a camp This first battle having gone against him Xiahou Mao called his officers to consultHe said I have heard Zhao Yun long ago but have never met facetofaceNow though that warrior is old he still has incredible prowessThe story of Dangyang where he alone fought against a whole host and came out victor is really not fabricatedBut what to be done against such a champion Then Cheng Wu son of Cheng Yu said My opinion is that this Zhao Yun though brave in the field is lacking in the council chamber Really he is not greatly to be fearedGive battle again soon but first prepare a twopronged ambush You can retreat and so draw him into itThen go up on the hill top and direct the attack from that point of vantage so that he may be hemmed in on all sides and be captured The necessary plans for this were made and two parties of thirty thousand each led by Dong Xi and Xue Ze went into ambush right and leftThe ambush laid Xiahou Mao advanced once more to attack drums rolling and flags flyingAs soon as he appeared Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi went to meet himDeng Zhi said The army of Wei were beaten only yesterday This renewed attempt must mean that they are trying some trickYou should be cautious General I do not think this youth with the smell of mothers milk still on his lips worth talking about We shall surely capture him today Zhao Yun pranced out and Pan Sui came to meet him from the side of WeiBut Pan Sui made no stand and quickly ran awayZhao Yun plunged in to try to capture Xiahou Mao Then there came out to stop him no less than eight generals of Wei all of whom passed in front of Xiahou Mao But one by one they too fledZhao Yun pressed forward at full speed Deng Zhi coming up behindWhen Zhao Yun had got deeply involved with the battle raging all around him Deng Zhi decided to retireThis was the signal for the ambush to come out Dong Xi from the right and Xue Ze from the leftDeng Zhi was so hampered that he could not attempt to rescue his colleague Zhao Yun was thus entirely surroundedHowever he struggled on losing men at every dash till he had but one thousand troops leftHe was then at the foot of the hill whence Xiahou Mao was directing operations and observing his enemy from this point of vantage Xiahou Mao sent troops to check Zhao Yun whithersoever he wentZhao Yun decided to charge up the hill but was stopped by rolling bulks of timber and tumbling rocks The battle had lasted long and Zhao Yun was fatiguedSo he halted to rest a time intending to renew the struggle when the moon should be upBut just as he had taken off his armor the moon rose and with it his enemies began to attack with fire as well and the thunder of the drums was accompanied by showers of stones and arrowsThe oncoming host shouted Zhao Yun Why dont dismount and be bound However Zhao Yun did not think of that but got upon his steed to strive once more to extricate himselfAnd his enemies pressed closer and closer pouring in flights and flights of arrowsNo advance was possible and the end seemed very near I refused the repose of age sighed he and now my end will come to me here Just then he heard new shouting from the northeast and the array of Wei became disordered To his joy Zhao Yun saw Zhang Bao coming toward him the octaneserpent halberd in his hand and a mans head hanging at his bridleSoon Zhang Bao reached the veteran generals side and cried The Prime Minister feared some misfortune had befallen you so he sent me to your help I have five thousand troops here We heard that you were surroundedOn the way I met Xue Ze and slew him Zhao Yuns courage revived and he and the young general went on toward the southwest driving the soldiers of Wei before them in disorder Soon another cohort came in from the side the leader wielding the greendragon saberThis was Guan Xing and he cried The Prime Minister sent me with five thousand troops to your aid On the way I encountered Dong Xi and slain him Here is his head and the Prime Minister is coming up too But why not press on to capture Xiahou Mao since you have had such wonderful success cried Zhao Yun Zhang Bao took the hint and went forwardGuan Xing followedThey are as my own children said Zhao Yun to those who stood near And they press on wherever there is merit to be wonI am an old leader and high in rank but I am not worth so much as these two youthsYet will I risk my life once more for the sake of my old lord the First Ruler So he led the remnant of his troops to try to capture Xiahou MaoDuring that night the army of Wei was smitten till corpses covered the earth and gore ran in rivers Xiahou Mao was unskillful and young and inexperienced in battleHis army was in utter rout and he could not think but only flee At the head of a hundred cavalries he made for Nanan His army leaderless scattered like ratsZhang Bao and Guan Xing set out for NananAt the news of their coming Xiahou Mao closed the city gates and urged his soldiers to defendZhao Yun soon joined the generals and they attacked on three sidesDeng Zhi arrived also and the city was quite surroundedAfter vain efforts for ten days they heard the newsThe Prime Minister has stationed the rear army in Mianyang the left army in Yangping Pass the right army in Shicheng He himself is leading the central army toward Nanan The four generals went to visit Zhuge Liang and told him their failure at the cityHe got into his light chariot and rode out to view the city after which he returned and summoned the officers to his tentZhuge Liang said The moat is deep the walls are steep wherefore the city is well defended and difficult to take My present plan omits this placeIf you persist in the attack and the Wei armies march to try for Hanzhong our army will be in danger Consider what the capture of Xiahou Mao would mean said Deng ZhiHe is an Imperial SoninLaw and worth more than slaying a hundred ordinary leaders We have begun the siege and I do not like to raise it Zhuge Liang said I have other plansWest of this lies Tianshui and north Anding does any one know the governors of these two places Ma Zun is the Governor of Tianshui Cui Liang that of Anding replied a scoutZhuge Liang then called to him one by oneWei Yan Zhang Bao Guan Xing and two trusted subordinatesand gave each certain instructionsThey left to carry out their ordersNext Zhuge Liang ordered the soldiers to pile up beneath the walls heaps of firewood and straw saying he was going to burn the city The defenders on the wall derided him Cui Liang the Governor of Anding was much frightened when he heard that Xiahou Mao was besieged and began to see to his own defensesHe mustered his four thousand soldiers resolved to defend his city as long as possibleThen there came a man from the south direction who said he had secret lettersCui Liang had him brought into the city and when questioned the man said I am one of Xiahou Maos trusted soldiers and named Pei XuI was sent to beg for help from Tianshui and AndingThe city of Nanan is hard pressed every day we have raised fires to call the attention of your cities to our plight but our signals have all failed No one has comeI was ordered to fight my way through the besiegers and come to tell youYou are to give assistance immediately and our General will open the gates to help you Have you a letter from the General asked Cui LiangA letter was produced from inside the mans dress all moist with perspirationAfter the Governor had read it the soldier took it back and went on to TianshuiTwo days later a mounted messenger came to say Governor Ma Zun of Tianshui with his troops have already started for Nanan The troops of Anding should march at once to their aid Cui Liang took the advice of his officersMost of them said If you do not go and Nanan is taken we shall he blamed for giving up the Imperial SoninLawHe must be rescued Thereupon Cui Liang marched the civil officers were left in charge of the cityThe army took the high road to Nanan They saw flames shooting up to the sky all the time and the Governor urged the army to march faster When fifteen miles from the city there was heard the drums of an attacking force and the scouts came to say that the road ahead was held by Guan Xing while Zhang Bao was coming up quickly in their rearAt this news the soldiers scattered in all directionsCui Liang had a hundred men left with whom he tried to cut his way out that he might return to his own city He got throughBut when he came to his own city a flight of arrows greeted him from the wall and Wei Yan shouted to him saying I have taken the city you would better yield This was what had happenedWei Yan and his soldiers disguised as an Anding soldiers in the darkness of the night had beguiled the wardens of the gate into opening it and the men of Shu had got inCui Liang set off for TianshuiBut one march away a cohort came out and beneath the great flag he saw a light chariot In the chariot sat a man in Taoist robe with a feather fan in his handCui Liang at once recognized Zhuge Liang but as he turned up came Guan Xing and Zhang Bao who summoned him to surrender As he was entirely surrounded no other course was open to him so he gave inHe went to the great camp with Zhuge Liang who treated him with courtesyAfter a time Zhuge Liang said Is the Govenor of Nanan a friend of yours He is one Yang Ling a cousin of Yang FuBeing neighboring counties we are very good friends I wish to trouble you to persuade him to capture Xiahou Mao can you If you O Minister order me to do this I would ask you to withdraw your troops and let me go into the city to speak with him Zhuge Liang consented and ordered the besiegers to draw off seven miles and campCui Liang himself went to the city and hailed the gate He entered and went forthwith to his friends residence As soon as he had finished the salutations he related what had happenedAfter the kindness we have received from Wei we cannot be traitors said Yang LingBut we will meet ruse with ruse He led Cui Liang to the CommanderinChief and told the whole storyWhat ruse do you propose asked Xiahou Mao Let us pretend to offer the city and let the army of Shu in Once they are in we can massacre them Xiahou Mao agreed to plot the schemeCui Liang went back to Zhuge Liangs camp where he said Yang Ling wants to offer the Prime Minister the cityHe also wants to capture Xiahou Mao but he is so afraid of having few soldiers that he has made no hasty move That is simple enough replied Zhuge Liang Your hundred troops are hereWe can mix with them some of my generals dressed as your officers and so let them get into the cityThey can hide in Xiahou Maos dwelling and arrange with Yang Ling to open the gates in the nightAnd my grand army will come in to make the capture for you Cui Liang thought within himself If I do not take the Shu generals they will arouse suspicionI would rather take them and will kill them as soon as they get within the walls Then I will give the signal and beguile Zhuge Liang to enter and so dispose of him So Cui Liang consented to Zhuge Liangs proposal and Zhuge Liang gave him instructions saying I will send my trusty Guan Xing and Zhang Bao with you You will pass them off as the rescuers just to set Xiahou Maos mind at restBut when you raise a fire I shall take that as my signal and come in At dusk the two trusty generals having received their secret orders put on their armor mounted took their weapons and got in among the Anding troops Cui Liang led the small force to the gate Yang Ling was on the wall The drawbridge was hoisted He leaned over the guard rail and scanned those below Who are you asked heWe are rescuers from Anding Now Cui Liang shot an arrow over the wall to which a secret letter was bound saying Zhuge Liang is sending two generals into the city that they may help him to get in but do nothing till we get inside lest the ruse gets known and the game be spoiled Yang Ling went to show this letter to Xiahou Mao who said Then Zhuge Liang is going to be our victimPut a company of ax and bill men in the palace and as soon as these two generals get inside shut the gates and fall on Then give the signalAs soon as Zhuge Liang gets inside the gate seize him All arrangements being made Yang Ling went back to the wall and said Since you are Anding troops you may be allowed in The gate was thrown open and while Guan Xing followed close after Cui Liang Zhang Bao was a little way behindYang Ling came down to the gate to welcome themAs soon as Guan Xing got near he lifted his sword and smote Yang Ling who fell headless Cui Liang was startled and lashed his steed to flee Zhang Bao cried ScoundrelDid you think your vile plot would be hidden from the eyes of our Prime Minister With that Cui Liang fell from a spear thrust of Zhang BaoThen Guan Xing went up on the wall and lit the fireSoon the army of Shu filled the cityXiahou Mao could make no defense so he tried to fight his way through the south gateThere he met Wang Ping and was captured Those with him were slainZhuge Liang entered the city and at once forbade all plunder The various generals reported the deeds of valorThe captive CommanderinChief was placed in a prisoners cartThen Deng Zhi asked O Minister how did you know the treachery of Cui Liang I knew the man was unwilling in his heart to yield so I sent him into the city that he might have a chance to weave a counter plot with Xiahou MaoI saw by his manner he was treacherous and so I sent my two trusty generals with him to give him a feeling of securityHad he been true to me he would have opposed this but he accepted it gaily and went with them lest I should suspect himHe thought they could slay my two leaders and entice me inBut my two leaders already had orders what to doEverything turned out as I thought and as they did not expect The officers bowed their appreciation of his wonderful insightThen Zhuge Liang said I sent one of my trusty people to pretend he was a certain Pei Xu of Wei and so deceive this Cui LiangI also sent another to Tianshui to do the same but nothing has happened yet I do not know the reason We will take this opportunity to capture that place It was decided to take Tianshui next and thither they movedWu Yi and Liu Yan were to guard Nanan and Anding Wei Yan was ordered to move toward TianshuiWhen Ma Zun Governor of Tianshui heard of Xiahou Maos being besieged in Nanan he called a council at which one partyheaded by Yin Shang and Liang Xuwere strongly of opinion that a rescue should be attemptedIf anything sinister happens to the Imperial SoninLaw Golden Branch and Jade Leaf as he is we shall be held guilty of having made no attempt to save himWherefore O Governor you must march all the forces you have to his rescue said Yin Shang and Liang XuMa Zun found decision difficult and while thinking over what was best to do the arrival of Pei Xu a messenger from Xiahou Mao was announced Pei Xu was taken to the Governors residence and there produced his dispatch and asked for aidSoon came another man saying that the Anding troops had set out and calling upon Ma Zun to hastenThis decided him and he prepared his army Then an outsider came in and said O Governor you are the sport of one of Zhuge Liangs wiles All looked at him with surprise He was one Jiang WeiHis father was Jiang Jiong a former local official who had died in the Emperors service while quelling one of the Qiang rebellionsJiang Wei was well up in books seeming to have read everything and was also skilled in all warlike exercises He had studied books on warHe was a very filial son and much esteemedHe held military rank of GeneralJiang Wei said to the Governor I hear Zhuge Liang is attacking Xiahou Mao who is now in Nanan most closely besieged How then can this messenger have got outPei Xu is an unknown officer whom no one has heard of and the other messenger from Anding bears no dispatchThe fact is the men are imposters sent to beguile you into leaving your city undefended so that it may be the more easily captured The Governor began to understandHe said Were it not for you I would fall into a ruse Then Jiang Wei said But do not be anxious I have a scheme by which we can capture Zhuge Liang and relieve Nanan The fates all changing bring the man thats needed And warlike skill comes from a source unheeded The next chapter will unfold the ruse proposed by Jiang WeiCHAPTER Jiang Wei Goes Over To Zhuge Liang Zhuge Liangs Reviles Kill Wang Lang Jiang Wei propounded his scheme of defense saying Zhuge Liang will lay an ambush behind the city induce our soldiers to go out and then take advantage of its undefended state to capture itNow give me three thousand good soldiers and I will place them in ambush at a certain critical placeLead your troops out but go slowly and not further than ten miles and then turn to retireHowever look out for a signal and if you see one attack for the attack will be doubleIf Zhuge Liang is there himself we shall capture him The Governor adopted this plan gave the needed troops to Jiang Wei who marched at once and then Ma Zun went forth himself with Liang QianOnly two civil officialsLiang Xu and Yin Shangwere left to guard the cityZhao Yun had been sent to lie in ambush in a secret place among the hills till the Tianshui army left the city when he was to rush in and capture itHis spies reported the departure of the Governor and Zhao Yun sent on the news to those who were acting with him Zhang Yi and Gao Xiang that they might attack Ma ZunZhao Yun and his five thousand troops then quickly marched to the city wall and called out I am Zhao Yun of Changshan you have fallen into our trap but if you will surrender quickly you will save many lives But instead of being alarmed Liang Xu looked down and said On the contrary you have fallen into our trap only you do not know it yet Zhao Yun began his attack on the wallsSoon there was heard a roar and fire broke out all round and forth came a youthful leader armed with a spear riding a curvetting steedLook at me Jiang Wei of Tianshui cried heZhao Yun made at him but after a few bouts he found Jiang Wei was getting very eagerHe was surprised and wondered No one knows there is such an able man in Tianshui As the fight went on along came the two other forces under Ma Zun and Liang Qian now returningAs Zhao Yun found he could not prevail he set to cut an arterial alley through and lead off his defeated troopsHe was pursued but Zhang Yi and Gao Xiang poured forth to save him and he got away safely Zhuge Liang was surprised when he heard what had happenedWho is this said he who has thus seen into the dark depths of my secret plan A man of Nanan who happened to be there told him He is Jiang Wei from JichengHe is very filial to his mother Civil skill and military prowess wisdom and courage he has allTruly he is a hero of the age Zhao Yun also praised his skill with the spear which was superior to any othersZhuge Liang said I want to take Tianshui now I did not expect to find such a man as this The Shu army then advanced in forceJiang Wei went back to Ma Zun and said Zhao Yuns defeat will bring up Zhuge Liang with the main bodyHe will conclude that we shall be in the city wherefore you would better divide your force into fourI with one party will go into hiding on the east so that I may cut off our enemies if they come that wayYou O Governor and Liang Qian and Yin Shang will lie in ambush on the other sides of the cityLet Liang Xu and the common people go up on the wall to make the defense Ma Zun agreed to the plan and prepared everythingDue to Jiang Wei Zhuge Liang himself led the main army to Tianshui When they reached the city Zhuge Liang gave a general ordersAttacking a city must be proceeded as soon as the army reaches it and at the rolling of drums incite and urge the soldiers to advance with a rushThe keenness of the soldiers will be spoiled by any delay So this time also the army came straight up to the rampartBut they hesitated and dared not attack when they saw the flags flying in such good order and apparently such thorough preparationAbout the middle of the night fires started up all around and a great shouting was beard No one could see whence the Wei soldiers were coming but there were answering shouts from the wall The soldiers of Shu grew frightened and ranZhuge Liang mounted a horse and with Guan Xing and Zhang Bao as escort got out of dangerLooking back they saw many mounted troops with torches winding along like a huge serpentZhuge Liang bade Guan Xing find out what this meant and Guan Xing reportThese are Jiang Weis troops Zhuge Liang remarked An army owes more to its leading than to its numbersThis Jiang Wei is a true genius Zhuge Liang led the army back to camp and then he thought for a long time Suddenly he called up one of the Anding men and said Where is the mother of this Jiang Wei She lives in Jicheng replied heZhuge Liang called Wei Yan and said to him March off with a body of troops giving out that you are going to take JichengIf Jiang Wei comes up let him enter the city Then Zhuge Liang asked What is the most important place in connection with this place The man from Anding replied The storehouse of Tianshui is at Shanggui if that is taken the supplies are cut off This was good news so Zhao Yun was sent to attack Shanggui while Zhuge Liang made a camp ten miles south of the city The spies took the news of the movements of these three forces into TianshuiWhen Jiang Wei heard that one army was to attack his own place he pleaded with Ma Zun saying My mother is in Jicheng and I am worried about the attacking forceLet me go to its defense that I may keep the city and do my duty by my mother at the same time So Jiang Wei received command of three thousand troops and marched toward his home When Jiang Wei came near the walls he saw a cohort under Wei YanHe attacked After a show of defense Wei Yan retreated and Jiang Wei entered the city He closed the gates and prepared to defend the wall Then he went home to see his motherIn the same way Liang Qian was allowed to enter ShangguiThen Zhuge Liang sent for his prisoner Xiahou Mao and when he was brought to his tent Zhuge Liang said suddenly Are you afraid of death Xiahou Mao prostrated himself and begged for his life Well Jiang Wei of Tianshui who is now gone to guard Jicheng has sent a letter to say that he would surrender if only that would secure your safetyNow I am going to let you go if you will promise to induce Jiang Wei to come over to meDo you accept the condition I am willing to induce him to yield to you said Xiahou MaoZhuge Liang then gave his prisoner clothing and a horse and let him ride away Nor did he send anyone to follow him but let him choose his own roadHaving got outside Xiahou Mao wanted to get away but he was perfectly ignorant of the roads and knew not which to takePresently he came across some people apparently in flight and he questioned themWe are Jicheng people said theyJiang Wei has surrendered the city and deserted to Zhuge Liang The troops of Shu are looting and burning and we have escapedWe are going to Shanggui Do you know who is holding Tianshui Governor Ma Zun is in there said theyHearing this Xiahou Mao rode quickly toward TianshuiPresently he met more people evidently fugitives leading sons and carrying daughters who told the same storyBy and by he came to the gate of the city and as he was recognized the wardens of the gate admitted him and the Governor came to greet him and asked of his adventuresHe told all that had happened that Jiang Wei had surrendered and related what the fugitives had saidI did not think Jiang Wei would have gone over to Shu said the Governor sadlyIt seems he thought by this to save you Sir CommanderinChief said Liang XuI am sure he has made only a pretense of surrendering Where is the pretense when it is a fact that he has surrendered said Xiahou Mao They were all perplexedThen at the third watch the troops of Shu came to begin an attackThe fires round the wail were very bright and there in the glare was seen Jiang Wei armed and riding up and down under the ramparts calling out for Xiahou MaoXiahou Mao and Ma Zun ascended the wall whence they saw Jiang Wei swaggering to and fro Seeing the chiefs on the wall Jiang Wei called out I surrendered for the sake of you O General why have you gone back on your word Why did you surrender to Shu after enjoying so much of Weis bounty said Xiahou MaoAnd why do you talk thus What do you mean talking thus after writing me a letter telling me to surrender You want to secure your own safety by involving meBut I have surrendered and as I am a superior general in their service now I see no sense in returning to Wei So saying he urged the soldiers on to the attackThe assault continued till dawn when the besiegers drew offNow the appearance of Jiang Wei in this fashion was but a ruse Zhuge Liang had found among his men one who resembled Jiang Wei and had disguised him so that Jiang Wei appeared to be leading the attack on the ramparts In the smoke and fire during the night no one could penetrate the disguiseZhuge Liang then led the army to attack JichengThe grain in the city was insufficient to feed the peopleFrom the wall Jiang Wei saw wagons of grain and forage being driven into the Shu camp and he determined to try to secure someSo he led three thousand troops out of the city to attack the train of wagonsAs soon as he appeared the convoy abandoned the carts and fledJiang Wei seized them and was taking them into the city when he was met by a cohort under the command of Zhang Yi They plunged into battle After a short time Wang Ping came to reinforce Zhang Yi so that Jiang Wei was attacked on two sidesAll Jiang Weis efforts were vain and he had to abandon the spoil and try to reenter the cityBut as he drew near he saw the walls were decorated with Shu ensigns for Wei Yan had captured the place and was in possession By desperate fighting Jiang Wei got clear and set off for Tianshui But he only had a few score horsemen leftPresently the small force fell in with Zhang Bao and at the end of this engagement Jiang Wei found himself alone a single horseman He reached Tianshui and hailed the gateThe watchers above the gate knew him and went to tell the GovernorThis fellow has came to beguile me into opening the gate said Ma ZunSo Ma Zun ordered the defenders to shoot at the fugitiveJiang Wei turned back but there were the army of Shu close at hand He set off as fast as he could for Shanggui But when he got there Liang Qian hurled a volley of abuse at him You traitor cried Liang QianDare you come to try to cajole me out of my cityI know you have surrendered to Shu Liang Qians soldiers also began to shoot at the hapless fugitive Jiang Wei was helpless He could not explain the real truth to those who doubted himLifting his eyes to heaven while tears rolled down his cheeks he whipped up his steed and rode off toward ChanganBefore he had got very far he came to a spot where were many heavy foliaged trees From among these appeared a company of soldiers led by Guan XingWeary as were both horse and rider there was no chance of successful resistance and Jiang Wei turned backBut soon appeared a small chariot in which sat Zhuge Liang dressed simply as usual in a white robe and carrying his feather fanFriend Jiang Wei said Zhuge Liang is it not time to yield Jiang Wei stopped and pondered There was Zhuge Liang and Guan Xings troops were behind him There was no way out So he dismounted and bowed his head in submissionZhuge Liang at once got out of the chariot and bade him welcome taking him by the hand and saying Ever since I left my humble cottage I have been seeking some worthy person to whom I might impart the knowledge that my life has been spent in acquiringI have found no one till this moment and now my desire is attainedYou are the one Jiang Wei bowed and thanked him and they two returned to campSoon after their arrival the new recruit and Zhuge Liang consulted how to capture Tianshui and ShangguiJiang Wei had a schemeThe two civil officers in charge of the city Yin Shang and Liang Xu are excellent friends of mine said he and I will write a letter to each shoot it over the wall tied to an arrow and ask them to help by raising a revolt within the city They decided upon this and two secret letters were duly written and sent flying over the ramparts where they were found and taken to the Governor Ma Zun was doubtful what action to take and consulted with Xiahou Mao asking him to decidePut both the men to death Xiahou Mao repliedBut Yin Shang heard what was toward and said to Liang Xu The best course for us is to yield the city to Shu and trust to them to treat us well as our recompense That evening Xiahou Mao sent many times to summon the two officers to him but they thought it too great a risk to answer the callInstead they armed themselves and rode at the head of their own soldiers to the gates opened them and let in the troops of ShuMa Zun and Xiahou Mao fled by the west gate with a hundred faithful followers and sought refuge with the Qiang tribespeopleLiang Xu and Yin Shang welcomed Zhuge Liang who entered the city restored order and calmed the peopleThis done Zhuge Liang asked how he might capture ShangguiLiang Xu said My brother Liang Qian holds that city and I will call upon him to yield it Thereupon Liang Xu rode over to Shanggui and called out his brother to submitZhuge Liang rewarded the two brothers and then made Liang Xu Governor of Tianshui Yin Shang Magistrate of Jicheng and Liang Qian Magistrate of Shanggui Next the army prepared to advanceHis officers asked O Minister why do you not pursue and capture Xiahou Mao Zhuge Liang replied I let him go as I would release a duck in my friend Jiang Wei I recognized a phoenix Such awe and fear seized upon the country around when these exploits of Zhuge Liang were heard of that many other cities simply opened their gates without making any resistanceZhuge Liang brought all soldiers from Hanzhong horse and foot and marched on to QishanWhen the Shu army reached the west bank of River Wei the scouts reported their movements in Luoyang and at a court held in the first year of the era of Calm Peace  a minister told the Ruler of Wei of the threatened invasionHe said Xiahou Mao the Imperial SoninLaw has lost the three cities and fled to the QiangsThe enemy has reached Qishan and their advanced columns are on the west bank of River WeiI pray that an army be sent to repulse them The Emperor Cao Rui was alarmed and asked for some general to go out and drive off the enemyMinister Wang Lang stepped forward and said I observed that whenever General Cao Zhen was sent by the late Emperor on any expedition he succeeded why not send him to drive off these soldiers of Shu Cao Rui approved of the suggestion whereupon he called up Cao Zhen and said to him The late Emperor confided me to your guardianship you cannot sit by while the enemy ravages the country Cao Zhen replied Your Majesty my talents are but poor and unequal to the task you propose You are a trusted minister of state and you may not really refuse this taskOld and worn as I am I will use the little strength left me to accompany you said Wang LangAfter the bounties I have received I cannot refuse replied Cao ZhenBut I must ask for an assistant You have only to name him O noble One said the EmperorSo Cao Zhen named Guo Huai a man of Yangqu whose official rank was Lord of Sheting he was also Imperial Protector of YongzhouThereupon Cao Zhen was appointed CommanderinChief and the ensigns of rank were conferred upon himGuo Huai was appointed his second and Wang Lang was created Instructor of the ArmyWang Lang was then already old seventysixThe army of Cao Zhen consisted of two hundred thousand troops the best from both capitalsHis brother Cao Zun was made leader of the van with an assistant Zhu Zan General Who Opposes BrigandsThe army moved out in the eleventh month of that year and the Ruler of Wei went with it to the outside of the west gateCao Zhen marched by way of Changan and camped on the west bank of the River WeiAt a council which the CommanderinChief called to consider the best mode of attack Wang Lang asked that he might be allowed to parley with the enemyLet the army be drawn up in complete battle order and unfurl all the bannersI will go out and call a parley with Zhuge Liang at which I will make him yield to us without a blow and the army of Shu shall march home again Cao Zhen agreed that the aged counselor should trySo orders were given to take the early meal at the fourth watch and have the men fall in with their companies and files at daylight all in review order Everything was to be grand and imposing the flags fluttering and the drums rolling every man in his placeJust before this display a messenger was to deliver a declaration of warNext day when the armies were drawn up facing each other in front of the Qishan Mountains the soldiers of Shu saw that their enemies were fine bold warriors very different from those that Xiahou Mao had brought against themThen after three rolls of the drums Minister Wang Lang mounted his horse and rode out preceded by the CommanderinChief and followed by Guo HuaiThe two leaders of the van remained in charge of the armyThen an orderly rode to the front and called out in a loud voice We request the leader of the opposing army to come out to a parley At this an opening was made at the main standard through which came out Guan Xing and Zhang Bao who took up their stations right and leftThen followed two lines of generals and beneath the standard in the center of the array was seen a fourwheeled carriage wherein sat Zhuge Liang with turban white robe and black sash and the leather fan was in his hand He advanced with the utmost dignityLooking up he saw three commander umbrellas and flags bearing large white characters In the middle was an aged figure Minister Wang LangHe intends to deliver an oration thought Zhuge LiangI must answer as best I may His carriage was then pushed to the front beyond the line of battle and he directed one of his officers to reply saying The Prime Minister of the Hans is willing to speak with Minister Wang Lang Wang Lang advancedZhuge Liang saluted him from the carriage with raised hands and Wang Lang replied from horseback with an inclination Then Wang Lang began his orationI am happy to meet you noble Sir your reputation has been long known to meSince you recognize the decrees of Heaven and are acquainted with the conditions of the world why do you without any excuse lead out such an army Zhuge Liang replied How mean you no excuseI hold an edict to destroy rebels Wang Lang replied Heaven has its mutations and change its instruments from time to time but the supreme dignity comes at last to the person of virtue This is the inevitable and immutable lawIn the days of Emperors Huan and Ling arose the Yellow Scarves rebellion and the whole earth was involved in wrangling and warfareLater in the eras of Inauguration of Tranquillity and Rebuilt Tranquillity Dong Zhuo arose in revolt a revolt which Li Jue and Guo Si continued after Dong Zhuo had been destroyedNext Yuan Shu usurped the imperial style and his brother Yuan Shao played the man of might and valor in the land of YejunLiu Biao occupied Jingzhou and Lu Bu seized and held Xuzhou Thus rebels have arisen in the land like swarm of wasps and bold spirits have followed their own will to the danger of the supreme dignity and the peril of the peopleThen the Founder of Wei the Emperor Cao swept away rebellion purged the land and restored orderAll hearts turned to him in gratitude and the people of the four quarters admired his virtueHe gained his position by no manifestation of force it was simply the will of Heaven His son and successor Emperor Pi was wise and warlike adequate to the great heritage and fitted to wield supreme powerWherefore in accordance with the will of Heaven and the desires of humans and following the example of the earliest emperors he took his place as arbiter of the Central Government whereby the myriad countries are ordered and governedCan any maintain that it was not the desire of Heaven and the wish of the people Noble Sir you are a man of natural talent and acquired attainments worthy you say yourself to be compared with Guan Zhong and Yue Yi Why then place yourself in opposition to the decree of Heaven and turn away from the desire of humankind to do this thingYou cannot be ignorant of the wise old saying that he who accords with the Heavens shall flourish while he who opposes shall be destroyedNow the armies of Wei are countless legions and their able leaders are beyond numberCan the glowworm in the parched stubble rival the glorious moon in the skyIf you will turn down your weapons and throw aside your armors and dutifully yield you shall not lose your rankThe state will have tranquillity and the people rejoiceIs not that a desirable consummation Zhuge Liang laughed Said he I regarded you as an old and tried servant of the Han Dynasty and thought you would hold some noble discourse Could I imagine you would talk so foullyI have a word to say that all the armies may hear In the days of Emperors Huan and Ling the rule of Han declined the officers of state were the authors of evil the government fell into confusion and misfortune settled on the countryTrouble was rife in every quarter The rebels you mentioned arose one after another deposing the emperor and afflicting the peopleBecause the household officers were corrupt and foolish and the court officials were as brute beasts living only that they might feed because people wolfishly cruel in their hearts savagely mean in their conduct were in office one after another and slavish flatterers bending slavish knees confounded the administration therefore the Throne became as a waste heap and the people were trodden into the mire I know all about youYou came from the eastern seashore you got into office with a low degree you properly aided your sovereign and supported the state cared for the tranquillity of Han and magnified the LiusBut could one have imagined that you would turn and assist rebels and enter into a plot to usurp the ThroneIndeed your crime is great and your guilt heavyHeaven and earth will not suffer you the inhabitants of this country would devour youBut happily the design of Heaven is to retain the glorious dynastyThe late Emperor Bei continued the line in the Lands of Rivers and I have been entrusted by the present Emperor with the task of destroying you rebelsSince you are such a false and specious minister you have but to hide your body and cover your head concern yourself about your belly and your backDo not come out before the armies to rave about the decrees of HeavenYou fool and rebel Mark you today is your last day this day even you descend to the Nine Golden SpringsHow will you stand before the two scores and four emperors of Latter Han that you will meet thereRetire you rebelGo tell your rebellious companions to come and fight one battle with me that shall decide the victory Fierce wrath filled the old mans breastWith one despairing cry Wang Lang fell to the earth dead This exploit of Zhuge Liangs has been lauded in verseIn west Qin when the armies met in the field He the bold one singly faced a myriad warriors And with a simple weapon just his tongue He did to death an old and wicked manAfter Wang Lang had fallen Zhuge Liang waved the fan toward Cao Zhen and said As for you I leave you alone for this occasionGo and get your army in order for tomorrows battle The chariot turned and left the ground both armies retired for that dayTo Cao Zhen fell the melancholy duty of rendering the last services to the aged counselor and setting his coffin on its journey to ChanganThen said General Guo Huai Zhuge Liang will certainly think the army occupied with mourning and make a night attack Let us anticipate him and set out an ambush about our campLet two bodies of our troops be hidden outside and two others take the occasion to raid the camp of the enemy I thought of such a scheme myself said Cao ZhenIt exactly suits my plans So Cao Zhen gave order to Cao Zun and Zhu Zan You are to take ten thousand troops each get away by the rear of the mountain and look out for the passing of the soldiers of ShuWhen they have gone by you are to make for their campBut you are only to attempt a raid if they have left Cao Zun and Zhu Zan took the order and left Then the CommanderinChief arranged with Guo Huai each to lead a force and hide outside the camp to wait for the raid of ShuOnly a few soldiers were to be left within to make a fire if the enemy were seen to be comingAnd all generals set about the necessary preparationsWhen Zhuge Liang reached his tent he called to him Zhao Yun and Wei Yan and said to them You two are to make a night attack Cao Zhen is a man of experience and will be on the lookout ventured Wei Yan But that is just what I want I want him to know we shall attack tonightHe will then put some troops in hiding in rear of the Qishan Mountains who will make for our camp as soon as they see us pass toward theirsI am sending you to let yourselves be seen passing the hill but you are to camp behind it and at a distanceWhen the soldiers of Wei attack this camp you will see a signal Then Wei Yan will hold the approach to the hill and Zhao Yun will make his way back in fighting orderHe will meet the army of Wei returning and will let them pass The enemy will assuredly fall to fighting among themselves and we shall finish the battle These two having gone away to carry out their portions of the plan Zhuge Liang next called up Guan Xing and Zhang Bao You are to take each ten thousand troops and hide in the high road to the mountainWhen the troops of Wei come let them pass and then march along the road they came by to their camp that they have just left These two having left Zhuge Liang placed Ma Dai Wang Ping Zhang Ni and Zhang Yi in ambush about the campWithin the camp the tents and shelters were left standing as if the camp was occupied while wood and straw were heaped up ready to give the signalThis done Zhuge Liang and his officers retired to the rear of the camp to watch proceedingsOn the side of Wei the two vanleaders Cao Zun and Zhu Zan left at dusk and hastened toward the camp of ShuAbout the second watch they saw troops busily moving about in front of the hillCao Zun thought to himself Commander Guo Huai is an excellent strategist and of wonderful prevision Then he hastened the march and in the third watch reached the camp of Shu He at once dashed into the enclosure but only to find it totally deserted Not a man was visibleAt once he knew he had stumbled into a trap and began to withdrawThen the flames sprang upZhu Zan arrived already to fight and the two bodies of troops thrown into confusion fought with each other till the two leaders met when they found out they were fighting their own menAs they were restoring order on came the four bodies of troops of Shu under Ma Dai Wang Ping Zhang Ni and Zhang Yi who had lain in ambush ready for themCao Zun and Zhu Zan with more than a hundred of those nearest to them ran away to get to the high road But before long the rolling drums announced another body of their enemy and their flight was stopped by Zhao Yun Whither go ye O rebel leaders cried Zhao YunStop for here is death But Cao Zun and Zhu Zan still fled Then came up a force led by Wei Yan and completed the defeatThe soldiers of Wei were wholly beaten and ran away to their own campBut the guard left in the camp thought they were the enemy come to raid so they lit the fires and at this signal Cao Zhen rushed up from one side and Guo Huai from the other and a fierce fight with their own troops beganWhile this was going on three cohorts under Wei Yan Guan Xing and Zhang Bao arrived from three points and a great and confused battle beganThe soldiers of Wei were driven off and chased for three milesIn the fight Wei lost many leaders and Zhuge Liang gained a great successCao Zhen and Guo Huai got together their beaten troops and went back to their own camp When they discussed the fight Cao Zhen said The enemy are too strong for usHave you any plan to drive them away Replied Guo Huai Our defeat is one of the ordinary events of war Let us not be cast downI have a plan to suggest that will disorder them so that one body cannot help the other and they will all be compelled to flee Wei leaders fail and sadly send To pray tribespeople help to lendThe plan will be unfolded in the next chapter CHAPTER Zhuge Liang Defeats The Qiangs In A Snowstorm Sima Yi Quickly Captures Meng Da The scheme by which Guo Huai proposed to overcome the army of Shu he laid before his colleague saying The Qiang tribes have paid tribute regularly since the days of the Founder of Wei Emperor Pi regarded them with favorNow let us hold such points of vantage as we may while we send secret emissaries to engage their help in exchange for kindly treatment We may get the Qiangs to attack Shu and engage their attention while we gather a large army to smite them at another placeThus attacking how can we help gaining a great victory A messenger was sent forthwith bearing letters to the Qiang tribespeopleThe King of the western Qiangs was named Cheli Ji He had rendered yearly tribute since the days of Cao CaoHe had two ministers one for civil and the other for military affairs named respectively Prime Minister Ya Dan and Chief Leader Yue JiThe letter was accompanied by presents of gold and pearls and when the messenger arrived he first sought Prime Minister Ya Dan to whom he gave gifts and whose help he begged Thus he gained an interview with the King to whom he presented the letter and the giftsThe King accepted both and called his counselors to consider the letterYa Dan said We have had regular intercourse with the Wei nationNow that Cao Zhen asks our aid and promises an alliance we ought to accede to his request Cheli Ji agreed that it was so and he ordered his two chief ministers to raise an army of two hundred fifty thousand of trained soldiers archers and crossbowmen spearmen and swordsmen warriors who flung maces and hurled hammersBeside these various weapons the tribesmen used chariots covered with iron plates nailed on They prepared much grain and fodder and many spare weapons all of which they loaded upon these ironclad chariots The chariots were drawn by camels or teams of horsesThe carts or chariots were known as iron chariots The two leaders took leave of their King and went straightway to Xiping PassThe commander in charge of the Pass Han Zhen at once sent intelligence to Zhuge Liang who asked Who will go to attack the Qiangs Guan Xing and Zhang Bao said they would goThen Zhuge Liang said You shall be sent but as you are ignorant of the road and the people Ma Dai shall accompany you To Ma Dai he said You know the disposition of the Qiangs from your long residence there you shall go as guide They chose out five thousand of veterans for the expeditionWhen they had marched many days and drew near their enemy Guan Xing went in advance with a hundred horsemen and got first sight of them from a hill The Qiangs were marching the long line of iron chariots one behind another in close orderThen they halted and camped their weapons piled all along the line of chariots like the ramparts of a moated city Guan Xing studied them for a long time quite at a loss to think how to overcome themHe came back to camp and consulted with his two colleaguesMa Dai said We will see tomorrow what they will do when we make our array and discuss our plans when we know more So the next day they drew up their army in three divisions Guan Xings division being in the center Zhang Baos in the left and Ma Dais in the rightThus they advanced The enemy also drew up in battle order Their military chief Yue Ji had an iron mace in his hand and a graven bow hung at his waist He rode forward on a curvetting steed boldly enoughGuan Xing gave the order for all three divisions to go forwardThen the enemys ranks opened in the center and out rolled the iron chariots like a great wave At the same time the Qiangs shot arrows and bolts and the men of Shu could not stand against themThe wing divisions under Ma Dai and Zhang Bao retired and the Qiangs were thus enabled to surround the centerIn spite of every effort Guan Xing could not get free for the iron chariots were like a city wall and no opening could be foundThe troops of Shu were absolutely helpless and Guan Xing made for the mountains in hope of finding a road throughAs it grew dark a Qiang leader with a black flag approached his warriors like a swarm of wasps about himPresently the leader cried out to him Youthful general flee not I am Yue Ji But Guan Xing only hastened forward plying his whip to urge his steedThen he suddenly came on a deep gully and there seemed nothing but to turn and fightYue Ji come close and struck at him with the maceGuan Xing evaded the blow but it fell upon his steed and knocked it over into water Guan Xing went into the water tooPresently he heard a great noise again behind him Yue Ji and his troops had found a way down into the gully and were coming at him down the stream Guan Xing braced himself for a struggle in the waterThen he saw Zhang Bao and Ma Dai coming up on the bank fighting with and driving off the Qiangs Yue Ji was struck by Zhang Bao and he too fell into the gullyGuan Xing gripped his sword and was about to launch a stroke at Yue Ji as he came up when Yue Ji jumped out of the water and ran awayAt once Guan Xing caught the steed Yue Ji had left led it up the bank and soon had it ready to mount Then he girded on his sword got on the horse and joined the battle with his colleaguesAfter driving off the Qiangs Guan Xing Zhang Bao and Ma Dai gathered together and rode back They quickly gained the campI do not know how to overcome these men said Ma DaiLet me protect the camp while you go back and ask the Prime Minister what we should do Guan Xing and Zhang Bao started at once and made the best of their way back They told Zhuge Liang what had happenedHe at once sent off Zhao Yun and Wei Yan to go into ambushAfter this he went himself with thirty thousand troops and Jiang Wei Zhang Yi Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and soon came to Ma Dais campThe day after from the summit of a hill Zhuge Liang surveyed the country and the enemy who were coming on in a ceaseless streamIt is not difficult said Zhuge LiangHe called up Ma Dai and Zhang Yi and gave them certain ordersThey having gone he turned to Jiang Wei saying My friend do you know how to overcome them The Qiangs only depend upon force or courage they cannot understand this fine strategy was the replyYou know said Zhuge Liang smilingThose dark clouds and the strong north wind mean snowThen I can do what I wish The two leaders Guan Xing and Zhang Bao were sent into ambush and Jiang Wei went out to offer battle But he was to retire before the iron chariotsAt the entrance to the camp were displayed many flags but the soldiers that should serve under them were not thereIt was now full winter the twelfth month and the snow had comeThe army of Shu went out to offer battle and when the iron chariots came forward they retired and thus led the Qiangs to the gate of the camp Jiang Wei going to its rearThe Qiangs came to the gate and stopped to lookThey heard the strumming of a lute but there were no soldiers there the flags meant nothingThey told Yue Ji and he suspected some ruse Instead of entering he went back to Prime Minister Ya Dan and told himIt is a ruse said Ya DanZhuge Liangs base trick is the pretense of a pretense and you would better attack So Yue Ji led his troops again to the camp gate and there he saw Zhuge Liang with a lute just getting into his chariot With a small escort he went toward the back of the campThe tribesmen rushed into the camp and caught sight of the light chariot again just as it disappeared into a woodThen said Ya Dan There may be an ambush but I think we need not be afraid of these soldiers Hence they decided to pursueAhead of them they saw the division under Jiang Wei hastening off through the snowYue Jis rage boiled up at this sight and he urged his men to go fasterThe snow had filled in the roads among the hills making every part look like a level plainAs they marched one reported that some of the enemy were appearing from the rear of the hillsSome thought this meant an ambush but Ya Dan said it did not matter and they need not fear He urged them to hastenShortly after this they heard a roaring as if the hills were rending asunder and the earth falling in and the pursuers on foot fell one atop of the other into great pits that were invisible in the snowThe iron chariots being close behind and hurrying along could not stop and they went into the pits also Those still farther in the rear halted but just as they were facing about Guan Xing and Zhang Bao came up one on either side and attacked Myriads of bolts flew through the airThen three other divisions under Jiang Wei Ma Dai and Zhang Yi arrived and confusion was worse than everThe Qiang leader Yue Ji fled to the rear and was making for the mountains when he met Guan Xing who slew him in the first encounterPrime Minister Ya Dan was captured by Ma Dai and taken to the main campThe soldiers scattered Hearing of the capture of one leader Zhuge Liang took his seat in his tent and bade them bring the prisonerHe told the guards to loose his bonds and he had wine brought to refresh him and soothed him with kindly wordsYa Dan was grateful for this kindness and felt more so when Zhuge Liang said My master the Emperor of the Great Hans sent me to destroy those who are in revolt why are you helping themBut I will release you and you will return to your master and say that we are neighbors and we will swear an oath of everlasting friendship and tell him to listen no more to the words of those rebels Ya Dan was released and so were all the soldiers that had been captured and all their stuff was given back to them They left for their own countryThe Qiangs being thus disposed of Zhuge Liang quickly marched again to Qishan He sent letters to Capital Chengdu announcing his successMeanwhile Cao Zhen anxiously waited for news of his expected allies Then a scout came in with the news that the army of Shu had broken camp and were marching awayThat is because the Qiangs have attacked said Guo Huai gleefully and the two made ready to pursueAhead of them the army of Shu seemed to be in confusionThe vanleader Cao Zun led the pursuit Suddenly as he pressed on there came a roll of drums followed by the appearance of a cohort led by Wei Yan who cried Stop You rebels But Cao Zun did not obey the summonsHe dashed forward to meet the attack He was killed in the third encounterHis colleague Zhu Zan in similar fashion fell in with a cohort under Zhao Yun to whose long spear he soon fell victimThe loss of these two made Cao Zhen and Guo Huai hesitate and they made to retire But before they could face about they heard the drums of an army in their rear and Guan Xing and Zhang Bao came out and surrounded themCao Zhen and Guo Huai made a stand for a time but were soon worsted and fledThe army of Shu pursued the beaten enemy to the banks of River Wei where they took possession of the Wei campCao Zhen was greatly chagrined at his defeat and sad at the loss of his generalsHe send a report of his misfortune to his master and asked for reinforcements At the court of Wei one of the ministers told the story of defeat of Cao Zhen and the allies and asked the Ruler of Wei to decide upon the next stepCao Rui was alarmed and asked for someone to say how to drive off the victorious foeThereupon Hua Xin said It will be necessary for Your Majesty to go in person You should call together all the nobles and each will have to exert himselfUnless this is done Capital Changan will be lost and the whole country be in danger But Imperial Guardian Zhong Yao opposed himSaid he The knowledge of every leader must exceed that of those led then only will he be able to control them Sun Zi the Strategist sums it up very brieflyKnow the enemy know thyself and every battle is a victory I know Cao Zhen has had great experience in the field but he is no match for Zhuge LiangStill there is such a match and I will pledge my whole family that he will succeedBut Your Majesty may be unwilling to listen to me The Ruler of Wei replied You are a minister of high rank and old If you know any wise person able to repel these soldiers of Shu call him without delay and ease my mind Then said Zhong Yao When Zhuge Liang decided to invade us he was afraid of the one man I will name Wherefore he spread calumnies concerning him raising suspicion in Your Majestys mind that you might dismiss him That done Zhuge Liang invadedNow employ this man again and the enemy will retire Who is it asked the Ruler of WeiI mean the Regent Marshal Sima Yi I have long regretted my action said Cao RuiWhere now is friend Sima Yi He is at the city of Wancheng idle An edict was prepared recalling Sima Yi and restoring him to his rank and titles and conferring upon him the new title CommanderinChief and General Who Pacifies the West All troops of Nanyang were set in motion and Cao Rui led them to ChanganAt the same time Cao Rui ordered Sima Yi to be there to meet him on a certain dayAnd the orders were sent by a swift messenger to the city of Wancheng At this time Zhuge Liang greatly rejoiced at the success he had hadHe was at Qishan busy with plans for other victories when Li Yan who was in command at the Palace of Eternal Peace sent his son Li Feng to the campZhuge Liang concluded that such a visit could only mean that Wu had invaded them and he was in consequence cast down However he summoned Li Feng to his tent and when asked the object of his mission Li Feng replied that he had joyful news to impartWhat is your joyful news said Zhuge LiangFormerly Meng Da deserted to Wei but only because he could do nothing elseCao Pi thought much of his capabilities treated him most generously kept him at his side gave him titles of General Who Establishes Strong Arms and Lord of Pingyang and appointed him to the posts of Governor of Xincheng and Commander of Shangyong and Jincheng and so on But when Cao Pi died all was changedIn Cao Ruis court were many who were jealous of Meng Das influence and power so that he enjoyed no peaceHe used to talk about being originally one of the Shu leaders and he was forced to do soandso Lately he has sent several confidants with letters to my father asking that he would state his case to you as to the happenings when the five armies came upon ShuNow he is at Xincheng and hearing you are attacking Wei he proposes to lead the army of the three counties about Xincheng Jincheng and Shangyong to attack Luoyang while you attack Changan whereby both capitals will be takenI have brought with me his messenger and his letters This was good news and the bearer was fittingly rewardedBut at that moment came the news that Cao Rui was leading an army to Changan and had recalled the banished Sima Yi to office This piece of bad news saddened Zhuge Liang not a littleHe told Ma Su who said Cao Rui should not be your worryIf he goes to Changan we will march there and capture him on the road and there will be an end of him Do you think I fear him said Zhuge Liang bitterlyBut the recall of Sima Yi is another matter that troubles meAnd Meng Das proposal will avail nothing if he comes across this manMeng Da is no match for himHe will he captured and if he should be the Middle Land will be hard to conquer Why not put Meng Da on his guard then said Ma SuZhuge Liang decided to write and the letter was dispatched immediatelyMeng Da was then at Xincheng anxiously expecting the return of his last confidential messenger when one day the man returned and gave him this letter from Zhuge Liang himselfYour last letter has convinced me of your loyal rectitude and I still remember with joy our old friendshipIf your plan succeeds you will certainly stand in the first rank of most worthy ministersBut I scarcely need impress upon you the extreme necessity for most perfect secrecy Be very careful whom you trust Fear everyone guard against everyoneThis news of the recall of Sima Yi and the proposed junction of armies at Changan is very serious and if a word reaches Sima Yi he will come to you firstTherefore take every precaution and do not regard this as a matter of unimportance They say Zhuge Liang leaves nothing to chance said Meng Da smiling as he readThis proves it He lost no time in preparing a reply which he sent also by a trusty messenger This letter was like thisI acknowledge your most valuable advice but is it possible that I should be remissFor my part I do not think the Sima Yis affair need cause anxiety for Wancheng is three hundred miles from Luoyang and four hundred miles from XinchengShould he hear anything it would take a month to send a memorial to the capital and get a reply My ramparts here are strong and my forces posted in the best positionsLet him come I am not afraid of the result so you O Minister need feel no anxietyYou have only to wait for the good news of success Zhuge Liang read the letter and threw it on the ground stamping his foot with rageMeng Da is a dead man said he a victim of Sima Yi Why do you say that said Ma SuWhat does the Art of War sayAttack before the enemy is prepared do what he does not expect What is the use of reckoning upon a months delay for sending up a memorialCao Ruis commission has already gone and Sima Yi may strike whom he will He will not have to wait to memorialize the ThroneTen days after he hears of Meng Das defection he will be upon Meng Da with an army and Meng Da will be helpless The others agreedHowever Zhuge Liang sent the messenger back again to say that if the matter had not yet actually started no other person was to be told of it for if anyone knew it would certainly come to nothingAnd the man left for XinchengIn his idle retreat in Wancheng Sima Yi had heard of his masters illsuccess against the armies of Shu and the news made him very sad He lifted up his eyes and sighedHe had two sons Sima Shi the elder and Sima Zhao both clever and ambitious and both earnest students of military booksOne day they were present when their father seemed very cast down and Sima Shi asked his father the reason You would not understand said the fatherI think you are grieving because the Ruler of Wei does not use you replied Sima Shi But they will send for you presently said Sima ZhaoThe prophecy was not long in fulfillment for even then the bearer of the command stood at the gate and the servant announced a messenger from the court bearing a commissionAs soon as he heard its terms Sima Yi set about ordering the armies of WanchengSoon came a messenger from Governor Shen Yi of Jincheng with a secret message for Sima YiThe messenger was taken into a private chamber and his message was that Meng Da was on the point of rebellionThe leakage of this news was due to Li Fu a confidential subordinate of Meng Da and Deng Xian Meng Das nephew Li Fu and Deng Xian went to confess the plot in exchange for a promise of amnesty Sima Yi smote his foreheadThis is the Emperors great good fortune high as heaven itselfZhuge Liangs army is at Qishan already and all peoples courage is at the brink of breakdownThe Emperor must go to Changan and if he does not use me soon Meng Da will carry out his plan his plot will succeed and both capitals will be lostMeng Da is surely in league with Zhuge Liang and if I can seize this Meng Da before he makes any move that will damp Zhuge Liangs spirits and he will retreat His elder son Sima Shi remarked It is necessary to memorialize the Throne No replied his father that would take a month and delay would mean failure Sima Yi gave orders to prepare to advance by doublerapid marches and threatened death to all loiterersIn order to avert suspicion he sent letters to Meng Da by the hand of Military Adviser Liang Ji to tell Meng Da to prepare to join the expeditionSima Yi quickly followed Liang JiAfter two days march Sima Yi fell in with an army of General Xu Huang over the hillsXu Huang got an interview with Sima Yi and he said The Emperor has arrived at Changan to lead an expedition against ShuWhither is the CommanderinChief going Sima Yi in a low voice said to him Meng Da is on the verge of rebellion and I am going to seize him Let me go as your vanleader said Xu Huang So Xu Huangs troops were joined to the expedition and marched in the vanSima Yi commanded the center and his sons brought up the rearTwo days farther on some of the scouts captured Meng Das confidential messenger and with him Zhuge Liangs replySima Yi promised the man his life if he would tell all he knew So the messenger told all about the letters and messages he had taken from one to the otherWhen Sima Yi read he remarked All able people think the same wayOur plan would have been foiled by Zhuge Liangs cleverness unless by the good luck of the Emperor this messenger had been captured Now Meng Da will be helpless The army pressed on still more rapidlyMeng Da had arranged for his stroke with Governor Shen Yi of Jincheng and Governor Shen Dan of Shangyong and was awaiting the day he had fixedBut Shen Yi and Shen Dan were only pretending to abet him although they went on training and drilling their troops to keep up appearances till the soldiers of Wei could arriveTo Meng Da they pretended delay in their transport as the reason for being unable to startAnd he believed themJust then Liang Ji came and when he had been ceremoniously received he produced the order from Sima Yi and said The CommanderinChief has received the edict of the Emperor to call in all the forces in this area and he has sent me to direct you to hold your troops in readiness to march On what day does the CommanderinChief start asked Meng DaHe is just about starting now and is on the way to Changan replied Liang Ji Meng Da smiled inwardly for this being so he saw success before himHe gave a banquet to Liang Ji and after Liang Ji took his leave Meng Da sent to his fellow conspiratorsShen Yi and Shen Danto say the first step must be taken next day by exchanging the banners of Wei for those of Han and marching to attack LuoyangThen the watchmen reported a great cloud of dust in the distance as though an army was comingMeng Da was surprised and went up on the ramparts to see for himself Soon he made out the banner of Xu Huang leading He ran down from the wall and in a state of trepidation ordered the raising of the drawbridgeXu Huang still came on and in due time stood on the bank of the moatThen Xu Huang called out Let the traitor Meng Da yield quickly Meng Da in a rage opened upon him with arrows and Xu Huang was wounded in the foreheadHe was helped to a place of safety while the arrows flew down in great numbersWhen the soldiers of Wei retired Meng Da opened the gates and went in pursuit But the whole of Sima Yis army soon came up and the banners stood so thick that they hid the sunThis is what Zhuge Liang foresaw said Meng Da despairinglyThe gates were closed and barredMeanwhile the wounded general Xu Huang had been borne to his tent where the arrow head was extracted and the physician attended to himBut that night he died He was fiftynineHis body was sent to Luoyang for burialNext day when Meng Da went up on the wall he saw the city was entirely surrounded as with a girdle of ironHe was greatly perturbed and could not decide what to do Presently he saw two bodies of troops coming up their banners bearing the names of his fellow conspiratorsShen Yi and Shen DanHe could only conclude that they had come to his help so he opened the gates to them and went out to fightRebel stay cried they both as they came upRealizing that they had been false he turned and galloped toward the city but a flight of arrows met him and the two who had betrayed him Li Fu and Deng Xian began to revile him We have already yielded the city they criedThen Meng Da fledBut he was pursued and as he and his horse were both exhausted he was speedily overtaken and slain They exposed his head and his soldiers submittedSima Yi was welcomed at the open gatesThe people were pacified the soldiers were rewarded and this done a report of their success was sent to Cao RuiCao Rui ordered the body of Meng Da to be exposed in the market place of Luoyang and he promoted Shen Yi and Shen Dan and gave them posts in the army of Sima YiHe gave Li Fu and Deng Xian command of the cities of Xincheng and ShangyongThen Sima Yi marched to Changan and campedThe leader entered the city to have audience with his master by whom he was most graciously receivedOnce I doubted you said Cao Rui but then I did not understand and I listened to mischiefmakers I regret itYou have preserved both capitals by the punishment of this traitor Sima Yi replied Shen Yi gave the information of the intended revolt and thought to memorialize Your MajestyBut there would have been a long delay and so I did not await orders but set forth at onceDelay would have played into Zhuge Liangs hands Then Sima Yi handed in Zhuge Liangs letter to Meng Da and when the Emperor had read that he said You are wiser than both the great strategists of oldWu Qi and Sun Zi The Ruler of Wei conferred upon the successful leader a pair of golden axes and the privilege of taking action in important matters without first obtaining his masters sanctionWhen the order was given to advance against the enemy Sima Yi asked permission to name his leader of the van and nominated Zhang He General of the Left ArmyJust the man I wished to send said Cao Rui smiling And Zhang He was appointedSima Yi took his army off Changan and marched it to the camp of the Shu armyBy strategy the leader shows his skill He needs bold fighting men to work his willThe result of the campaign will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER Ma Sus Disobedience Causes The Loss Of Jieting Zhuge Liangs Lute Repulses Sima YiBeside sending Zhang He as vanleader of Sima Yi Cao Rui appointed two other generals Xin Pi and Sun Li to assist Cao Zhen Xin Pi and Sun Li each led fifty thousand troopsSima Yis army was two hundred thousand strong They marched out through the pass and made a camp When encamped Sima Yi summoned Zhang He to his tent and admonished him saying A characteristic of Zhuge Liang is his most diligent carefulness he is never hastyIf I were in his place I should advance through the Ziwu Valley to capture Changan and so save much timeIt is not that he is unskillful but he fears lest that plan might miscarry and he will not sport with riskTherefore he will certainly come through the Xie Valley taking Meicheng on the wayThat place captured he will divide his force into two one part to take Chi ValleyI have sent Cao Zhen orders to guard Meicheng strictly and on no account to let its garrison go out to battleThe generals Sun Li and Xin Pi are to command the Chi Valley entrance and should the enemy come they are to make a sudden attack By what road will you advance asked Zhang HeI know a road west of Qinling Mountains called Jieting on which stands the city LiliuThese two places are the throat of HanzhongZhuge Liang will take advantage of the unpreparedness of Cao Zhen and will certainly come in by this wayYou and I will go to Jieting whence it is a short distance to Yangping PassWhen Zhuge Liang hears that the road through Jieting is blocked and his supplies cut off he will know that Xizhou is impossible to keep and will retire without losing a moment into HanzhongI shall smite him on the march and I ought to gain a complete victoryIf he should not retire then I shall block all the smaller roads and so stop his suppliesA months starvation will kill off the soldiers of Shu and Zhuge Liang will be my prisoner Zhang He took in the scheme and expressed his admiration saying O Commander your calculation exceeds human Sima Yi continued However it is not to be forgotten that Zhuge Liang is quite different from Meng Da and you as leader of the van will have to advance with the utmost careYou must impress upon your generals the importance of reconnoitering a long way ahead and only advancing when they are sure there is no ambushThe least remissness will make you the victim of some ruse of the enemy Zhang He having received his instructions marched awayMeanwhile a spy had come to Zhuge Liang in Qishan with news of the destruction of Meng Da and the failure of his conspiracy Sima Yi marched rapidly in eight days to XinchengHe had Shen Yi Shen Dan Li Fu and Deng Xian plot against Meng Da from within Meng Da had not been able to do anything and was killedNow Sima Yi has gone to Changan when he has marched through the pass with Zhang He Zhuge Liang was distressedMeng Das destruction was certain said he Such a scheme could not remain secretNow Sima Yi will try for Jieting and block the one road essential to us So Jieting had to be defended and Zhuge Liang asked who would go Ma Su offered himself instantly Zhuge Liang urged upon him the importance of his taskThe place is small but of very great importance for its loss would involve the loss of the whole armyYou are deeply read in all the rules of strategy but the defense of this place is difficult since it has no wall and no natural defenses I have studied the books of war since I was a boy and I may say I know a little of the art of war Ma Su replied Why alone is Jieting so difficult to hold Because Sima Yi is an exceptional man and also he has a famous second in Zhang He as leader of the vanI fear you may not be a match for him Ma Su replied To say nothing of these two I would not mind if Cao Rui himself came against meIf I fail then I beg you to behead my whole family There is no jesting in war said Zhuge Liang I will give a written pledge Zhuge Liang agreed and a written pledge was given and placed on recordZhuge Liang continued I shall give you twentyfive thousand veterans and also send an officer of rank to assist you Next he summoned Wang Ping and said to him As you are a careful and cautious man I am giving you a very responsible positionYou are to hold Jieting with the utmost tenacity Camp there in the most commanding position so that the enemy cannot steal byWhen your arrangements are complete draw a plan of them and a map of the local topography and let me see itAll my dispositions have been carefully thought out and are not to be changedIf you can hold this successfully it will be of the first service in the capture of ChanganSo be very very careful After Ma Su and Wang Ping had gone and Zhuge Liang had reflected for a long time it occurred to him that there might be some slip between his two leaders so he called Gao Xiang to him and said Northeast of Jieting is a city named Liliu and near it an unfrequented hill path There you are to camp and make a stockadeI will give you ten thousand troops for this task and if Jieting should be threatened you may go to the rescue After Gao Xiang had left and as Zhuge Liang thought Gao Xiang was not a match for his opponent Zhang He he decided there ought to be additional strength on the west in order to make Jieting safeSo he summoned Wei Yan and bade him lead his army to the rear of Jieting and camp thereBut Wei Yan thought this rather a slight and said As leader of the van I should go first against the enemy why am I sent to a place where there is nothing to do The leadership of the van is really a secondrate taskNow I am sending you to support Jieting and take post on the most dangerous road to Yangping Pass You are the chief keeper of the throat of Hanzhong It is a very responsible post and not at all an idle oneDo not so regard it and spoil my whole planBe particularly careful Wei Yan satisfied now that he was not being slighted went his wayZhuge Liangs mind was at rest and he called up Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi to whom he said Now that Sima Yi is in command of the army the whole outlook is differentEach of you will lead a force out to Chi Valley and move about so as to mislead the enemyWhether you meet and engage them or not you will certainly cause them uneasinessI am going to lead the main army through the Xie Valley to MeichengIf I can capture that Changan will fall Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi took the orders and went offZhuge Liang appointed Jiang Wei as leader of the van and they marched to the Xie ValleyWhen Ma Su and Wang Ping had reached Jieting and saw what manner of place it was Ma Su smiled saying Why was the Prime Minister so extremely anxiousHow would the Wei armies dare to come to such a hilly place as this Wang Ping replied Though they might not dare to come we should set our camp at this meeting of many roads So Wang Ping ordered his soldiers to fell trees and build a strong stockade as for a permanent stay But Ma Su had a different ideaWhat sort of a place is a road to make a camp inHere is a hill standing solitary and well wooded It is a heavencreated point of vantage and we will camp on it You are wrong Sir replied Wang Ping If we camp on the road and build a strong wall the enemy cannot possibly get pastIf we abandon this for the hill and the troops of Wei come in force we shall be surrounded and how then be safe You look at the thing like a child said Ma Su laughingThe rules of war say that when one looks down from a superior position one easily overcomes the enemyIf they come I will see to it that not a breastplate ever goes back again I have followed our CommanderinChief in many a campaign and always he has carefully thought out his ordersNow I have studied this hill carefully and it is a critical point If we camp thereon and the enemy cut off our water supply we shall have a mutiny No such thing said Ma SuSun Zi says that victory lies in desperate positionsIf they cut off our water will not our soldiers be desperate and fight to the deathThen everyone of them will be worth a hundredI have studied the books and the Prime Minister has always asked my adviceWhy do you presume to oppose me If you are determined to camp on the hill then give me part of the force to camp there on the west so that I can support you in case the enemy come But Ma Su refusedJust then a lot of the inhabitants of the hills came running along saying that the Wei soldiers had comeWang Ping was still bent on going his own way and so Ma Su said to him Since you will not obey me I will give you five thousand troops and you can go and make your own camp but when I report my success to the Prime Minister you shall have no share of the merit Wang Ping marched about three miles from the hill and made his campHe drew a plan of the place and sent it quickly to Zhuge Liang with a report that Ma Su had camped on the hillBefore Sima Yi marched he sent his younger son to reconnoiter the road and to find out whether Jieting had a garrison Sima Zhao had returned with the information that there was a garrisonZhuge Liang is rather more than human said his father regretfully when Sima Zhao gave in his report He is too much for me Why are you despondent FatherI think Jieting is not so difficult to take How dare you utter such bold words Because I have seen There is no camp on the road but the enemy are camped on the hill This was glad newsIf they are on the hill then Heaven means a victory for me said his fatherAt night Sima Yi changed into another dress took a small escort and rode out to see for himselfThe moon shone brilliantly and he rode to the hill whereon was the camp and looked all round it thoroughly reconnoitering the neighborhoodMa Su saw him but only laughed If Sima Yi has any luck he will not try to surround this hill said he Ma Su issued an order to his generalsIn case the enemy come you are to look to the summit for a signal with a red flag when you shall rush down on all sides Sima Yi returned to his camp and sent out to inquire who commanded in JietingThey told him Ma Su brother of Ma LiangA man of false reputation and very ordinary ability said Sima YiIf Zhuge Liang uses such as Ma Su he will fail Then he asked if there were any other camps near the place and they told him Wang Ping was about three miles offWherefore Zhang He was ordered to go and check Wang Ping from coming to rescueThis done Sima Yi ordered Shen Yi and Shen Dan to surround the hill and to block the road to the water supplyLack of water would cause a mutiny and when that occurred it would be time to attack Zhang He marched out and placed himself between Wang Ping and the hillThen Sima Yi led the main body to attack the hill on all sidesFrom the summit of his hill Ma Su could see the banners of his enemy all round and the country about was full of soldiers Presently the hemming in was complete and the soldiers of Shu became dejectedThey dared not descend to attack although Ma Su hoisted the red flag signaling for them to moveThe generals stood huddled together no one daring to go firstMa Su was furious He cut down two generals which frightened the others to the point of descending and making one desperate rushBut the troops of Wei would stand firm against their attack and they reascended the hillMa Su saw that matters were going ill so he issued orders to bar the gates and defend till help should come from outside When Wang Ping saw the hill surrounded he started to go to the rescue but Zhang He checked him and after exchanging some ten encounters Wang Ping was compelled to retire whence he had comeThe Wei troops kept a close siege The Shu soldiers in the hill camp having no water were unable to prepare food and disorder broke outThe shouting was audible at the foot of the hill and went on far into the night The soldiers on the south side got out of hand opened the gates and surrenderedThe men of Wei went round the hill setting fire to the wood which led to still greater confusion in the beleaguered garrisonAt last Ma Su decided to make a dash for safety toward the westSima Yi allowed him to pass but Zhang He was sent to pursue and chased him for ten miles But then there came an unexpected roll of drumsZhang He was stopped by Wei Yan while Ma Su got pastWhirling up his sword Wei Yan dashed toward Zhang He who retired within his ranks and fled Wei Yan followed and drove Zhang He backward toward JietingThe pursuit continued for fifteen miles and then Wei Yan found himself in an ambush Sima Yi on one side and Sima Zhao on the other They went around the hill and closed in behind Wei Yan and he was surroundedZhang He then turned back and the attack was now on three sidesWei Yan lost many troops and all his efforts failed to get him clear of the press Then help appeared in the person of Wang PingThis is life for me said Wei Yan as he saw Wang Ping coming up and the two forces joined in a new attack on the force of WeiSo the troops of Wei drew off while Wei Yan and Wang Ping made all haste back to their own campsonly to find them in the hands of the enemyShen Yi and Shen Dan then rushed out and drove Wei Yan and Wang Ping to Liliu There they were received by Gao Xiang who had come out to meet his unfortunate colleaguesWhen Gao Xiang heard their story he at once proposed a night attack on the Wei camp and the recovery of JietingThey talked this over on the hillside and arranged their plans after which they set themselves to wait till it was dark enough to startThey set out along three roads and Wei Yan was the first to reach Jieting Not a soldier was visible which looked suspicious He decided to await the arrival of Gao Xiang and they both speculated as to the whereabouts of their enemyThey could find no trace and the third army under Wang Ping had not yet come upSuddenly a bomb exploded and a brilliant flash lit up the sky drums rolled as though the earth was rending and the enemy appeared In a trice the armies of Shu found themselves hemmed in Both Wei Yan and Gao Xiang pushed here and shoved there but could find no way out Then most opportunely from behind a hill rolled out a thunder of drums and there was Wang Ping coming to their rescue Then the three forced their way to LiliuBut just as they drew near to the rampart another body of soldiers came up which from the writing on their flags they read Wei Commander Guo HuaiNow Guo Huai had talked over Sima Yis recall with his colleague Cao Zhen and fearing lest the recalled general should acquire too great glory Guo Huai had set out to anticipate him in the capture of JietingDisappointed when he heard of Sima Yis success there he had decided to try a similar exploit at Liliu So he had diverted his march thitherHe engaged the three Shu armies at once and slew so many of them that at Wei Yans suggestion they all left for Yangping Pass which might be in dangerGuo Huai pleased with his success gathered in his army after the victory and said to his officers I was disappointed at Jieting but we have taken this place and that is merit of high order Thereupon he proceeded to the city gatesJust as he arrived a bomb exploded on the wall and looking up he saw the rampart bedecked with flags On the largest banner he read the characters Sima Yi General Who Pacifies the West At that moment Sima Yi himself lifted a board that hung in front of him and looked over the breasthigh railHe looked down and smiled saying How late you are friend Guo Huai Guo Huai was amazed He is too much for me said he So Guo Huai resignedly entered the city and went to pay his respects to his successful rivalSima Yi was gracious and said Zhuge Liang must retire now that Jieting is lostYou join forces with Cao Zhen and follow up quickly Guo Huai agreed and took his leave Sima Yi called to him Zhang He and said Cao Zhen and Guo Huai thought we should win too great merit so they tried to get ahead of us hereWe are not the only ones who desire to achieve good service and acquire merit but we had the good fortune to succeedI thought Wei Yan Ma Su Wang Ping and Gao Xiang would first try to occupy Yangping Pass and if I went to take it then Zhuge Liang would fall on our rearIt says in the books on war that one should crush a retreating enemy not pursue broken rebels so you may go along the byroads and smite those withdrawing down the Chi Valley while I oppose the Xie Valley armyIf they flee do not press them too much but just hold them up on the road and capture the baggage train Zhang He marched away with half the force to carry out his part of this plan while Sima Yi gave orders to go to the Xie Valley by way of Xicheng which though a small place was important as a depot of stores for the Shu army beside commanding the road to the three counties of Nanan Tianshui and AndingIf this place could be captured the other three could be recapturedSima Yi left Shen Yi and Shen Dan to guard Liliu and marched his army toward the Xie ValleyAfter Zhuge Liang had sent Ma Su to guard Jieting his mind was constantly disturbedThen arrived the messenger with the topography and plan prepared by Wang PingZhuge Liang went over to his table and opened the letter As he read it he smote the table in wrathMa Sus foolishness has destroyed the army he criedWhy are you so disturbed O Minister asked those nearBy this plan I see that we have lost command of an important road The camp has been made on the hill and if the Wei army come in force our army will be surrounded and their water supply interruptedIn two days the soldiers will be in a state of mutiny and if Jieting shall be lost how shall we be able to retire Here High Counselor Yang Yi said I am none too clever I know but let me go to replace Ma Su Zhuge Liang explained to Yang Yi how and where to camp but before he could start a horseman brought the news of the loss of Jieting and LiliuThis made Zhuge Liang very sad and he sighed saying The whole scheme has come to nought and it is my fault Zhuge Liang sent for Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and said Each of you takes three thousand of good soldiers and go along the road to Wugong HillsIf you fall in with the enemy do not fight but beat drums and raise a hubbub and make them hesitate and be doubtful so that they may retireDo not pursue but when they retire make for Yangping Pass He also sent Zhang Yi to put Saber Pass in order for retreat and issued instructions for making ready to marchMa Dai and Jiang Wei were told to guard the rear but they were to go into ambush in the valleys till the whole army would have retreatedTrusty messengers were sent with the news to Tianshui Nanan and Anding that the officers army and people might go away into HanzhongHe also sent to remove to a place of safety in Hanzhong the aged mother of Jiang WeiAll these arrangements made Zhuge Liang took five thousand troops and set out for Xicheng to remove the storesBut messenger after messenger more than ten of them came to reportSima Yi is advancing rapidly on Xicheng with an army of one hundred fifty thousand troops No leader of rank was left to Zhuge Liang he had only the civil officials and the five thousand soldiers and as half this force had started to remove the stores he had only two thousand five hundred left His officers were all frightened at the news of near approach of the enemy Zhuge Liang himself went up on the rampart to look around He saw clouds of dust rising into the skyThe Wei armies were nearing Xicheng along two roadsThen he gave orders All the banners are to be removed and concealedIf any officer in command of soldiers in the city moves or makes any noise he will be instantly put to death Next he threw open all the gates and set twenty soldiers dressed as ordinary people cleaning the streets at each gateWhen all these preparations were complete he donned the simple Taoist dress and attended by a couple of lads sat down on the wall by one of the towers with his lute before him and a stick of incense burningSima Yis scouts came near the city gate and saw all this They did not enter the city but went back and reported what they had seenSima Yi smiled incredulously But he halted his army and rode ahead himselfIt was exactly as the scouts had reported Zhuge Liang sat there his face with all smiles as he played the luteA lad stood on one side of him bearing a treasured sword and on the other a boy with the ordinary symbol of authority a yaks tail Just inside the gates a score of persons with their heads down were sweeping as if no one was about Sima Yi hardly believed his eyes and thought this meant some peculiarly subtle ruse So he went back to his armies faced them about and moved toward the hills on the northI am certain there are no soldiers behind this foolery said Sima ZhaoWhat do you retire for Father Sima Yi replied Zhuge Liang is always most careful and runs no risksThose open gates undoubtedly mean an ambush and if our force enter the city they will fall victims to his guileHow can you knowNo our course is to retire Thus were the two armies turned back from the city much to the joy of Zhuge Liang who laughed and clapped his hands as he saw them hastening awayThe officials gasped with astonishment and they asked Sima Yi is a famous general of Wei and he was leading one hundred fifty troopsBy what reason did he march off at the sight of you O Minister Zhuge Liang said He knows my reputation for carefulness and that I play not with dangerSeeing things as they were made him suspect an ambush and so he turned awayI do not run risks but this time there was no help for itNow he will meet with Guan Xing and Zhang Bao whom I sent away into the hills to wait for him They were still in the grip of fear but they praised the depth of insight of their chief and his mysterious schemes and unfathomable plansWe should simply have run away said they What could we have done with two thousand five hundred soldiers even if we had run We should not have gone far before being caught said Zhuge LiangQuite open lay the city to the foe But Zhuge Liangs lute of jasper wonders wrought It turned aside the legions onward march For both the leaders guessed the others thoughtBut if I had been in Sima Yis place I should not have turned away said Zhuge Liang smiling and clapping his handsHe gave orders that the people of the place should follow the army into Hanzhong for Sima Yi would assuredly returnThey abandoned Xicheng and returned into HanzhongIn due course the officials and soldiers and people out of the three counties also came inIt has been said that Sima Yi turned aside from the city He went to Wugong HillsPresently there came the sounds of a Shu army from behind the hillsSima Yi turned to his sons saying If we do not retire we shall yet somehow fall victims to this Zhuge Liang Then appeared a force advancing rapidly the banners bearing the name of Zhang BaoThe soldiers of Wei were seized with sudden panic and ran flinging off their armors and throwing away their weaponsBut before they had fled very far they heard other terrible sounds in the valley and soon saw another force with banners of Guan XingThe roar of armed troops echoing up and down the valley was terrifying and as no one could tell how many men there were bearing down on them the panic increasedThe Wei army abandoned all the baggage and took to flightBut having orders not to pursue Zhang Bao and Guan Xing let their enemies run in peace while they gathered up the spoils Then they returnedSeeing the valley apparently full of Shu soldiers Sima Yi dared not marched by the main road He hurried back to JietingAt this time Cao Zhen hearing that the army of Shu was retreating went in pursuit But at a certain point he encountered a strong force under Ma Dai and Jiang WeiValleys and hills seemed to swarm with enemies and Cao Zhen became alarmedThen Chen Zao his vanleader was slain by Ma Dai and the soldiers were panicstricken and fled in disorderAnd the soldiers of Shu were hastening night and day along the road into HanzhongZhao Yun and Deng Zhi who had been lying in ambush in Chi Valley heard that their comrades were retreatingThen said Zhao Yun The army of Wei will surely come to smite us while we are retreatingWherefore let me first take up a position in their rear and then you lead off your troops and part of mine showing my ensignsI will follow keeping at the same distance behind you and thus I shall be able to protect the retreat Now Guo Huai was leading his army through the Chi ValleyHe called up his vanleader Su Yong and said to him Zhao Yun is a warrior whom no one can withstandYou must keep a most careful guard lest you fall into some trap while they are retreating Su Yong replied smiling If you will help me O Commander we shall be able to capture this Zhao Yun So Su Yong with three thousand troops hastened on ahead and entered the valley in the wake of the Shu armyHe saw upon a slope in the distance a large red banner bearing the name of Zhao YunThis frightened him and he retiredBut before he had gone far a great uproar arose about him and a mighty warrior came bounding forth on a swift steed crying Do you recognize Zhao Yun Su Yong was terrified Whence came you he criedIs there another Zhao Yun here But Su Yong could make no stand and soon fell victim to the spear of the veteranHis troops scattered and Zhao Yun marched on after the main body But soon another company came in pursuit this time led by a general of Guo Huai named Wan ZhengAs they came along Zhao Yun halted in the middle of the road to wait for the enemyBy the time Wan Zheng had come close the other Shu soldiers had gone about ten miles along the roadHowever when Wan Zheng drew nearer still and saw who it was standing in his path he hesitated and finally halted Presently he turned back and retired altogether confessing on his return that he had not dared to face the old warrior who seemed as terrible as everHowever Guo Huai was not content and ordered him to return to the pursuit of the retreating armyThis time Wan Zheng led a company of several hundred horsemenPresently they came to a wood and as they entered a loud shout arose in the rear Zhao Yun is here Terror seized upon the pursuers and many fell from their horsesThe others scattered among the hills Wan Zheng braced himself for the encounter and went on Zhao Yun shot an arrow which struck the plume on his helmet Startled Wan Zheng tumbled into a water streamThen Zhao Yun pointed his spear at him and said Be off I will not kill youGo and tell Guo Huai to come quickly if he is coming Wan Zheng fled for his life while Zhao Yun continued his march as rearguard and the retreat into Hanzhong steadily continued There were no other episodes by the wayCao Zhen and Guo Huai took to themselves all the credit of having recovered the three countiesNanan Tianshui and AndingBefore the cautious Sima Yi was ready to pursue the army of Shu it had already reached HanzhongHe took a troop of horse and rode to Xicheng and there heard from the few people who had formerly sought refuge in the hills and now returned that Zhuge Liang really had had no men in the city with the exception of the two thousand five hundred soldiers that he had not a single military commander but only a few civil officers Sima Yi also heard that Guan Xing and Zhang Bao had had only a few troops whom they led about among the hills making as much noise as they could Sima Yi felt sad at having been trickedZhuge Liang is a cleverer man than I am said he with a sigh of resignation He set about restoring order and presently marched back to ChanganHe saw the Ruler of Wei who was pleased with his success and said It is by your good service that Xizhou is again mine Sima Yi replied But the army of Shu is in Hanzhong undestroyed therefore I pray for authority to go against them that you may recover the Western Land of Rivers also Cao Rui rejoiced and approved and authorized the raising of an armyBut then one of the courtiers suddenly said Your servant can propose a plan by which Shu will be overcome and Wu submits The generals lead their beaten soldiers home The victors plan new deeds for days to come Who offered this plan Succeeding chapters will tellCHAPTER Shedding Tears Zhuge Liang Puts Ma Su To Death Cutting Hair Zhou Fang Beguiles Cao Xiu The proposer of the great plan that was to reunite the empire was the Chair of the Secretariat named Sun ZiNoble Sir expound your excellent scheme said the Ruler of Wei And Sun Zi said When your great progenitor Emperor Cao first got Zhang Lu he was at a critical stage in his career but thenceforward all went wellHe used to say the land of Nanzheng is really a natural hellIn the Xie Valley there are one hundred fifty miles of rocks and caves so that it is an impossible country for an armyIf Wei be denuded of soldiers in order to conquer Shu then for sure we shall be invaded by Wu on the eastMy advice is to divide the army among the various generals and appoint each a place of strategic value to hold and let them train their forcesIn a few years the Middle Land will be prosperous and wealthy while the other two Shu and Wu will have been reduced by mutual quarrels and will fall an easy preyI hope Your Majesty will consider whether this is not a superior plan What does the General thinksaid Cao Rui to Sima YiHe replied Minister Sun Zi says well So Cao Rui bade Sima Yi draw up a scheme of defense and station the soldiers leaving Guo Huai and Zhang He to guard ChanganAnd having rewarded the army he the returned to LuoyangWhen Zhuge Liang got back to Hanzhong and missed Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi the only two generals who had not arrived he was sad at heart and bade Guan Xing and Zhang Bao go back to afford them assistanceHowever before the reinforcing parties could leave the missing men arrived Furthermore they came with their army in excellent condition and not a man short nor a horse nor any of their equipmentAs they drew near Zhuge Liang went out of the city to welcome themThereupon Zhao Yun hastily dismounted and bowed to the earth saying The Prime Minister should not have come forth to welcome a defeated general But Zhuge Liang lifted him up and took his hand and said Mine was the fault mine were the ignorance and unwisdom that caused all this But how is it that amid all the defeat and loss you have come through unscathed And Deng Zhi replied It was because friend Zhao Yun sent me ahead while he guarded the rear and warded off every attack One leader he slew and this frightened the othersThus nothing was lost or left by the way A really great general said Zhuge LiangHe sent Zhao Yun a gift of fifty ounces of gold and to his army ten thousand rolls of silkBut these were returned as Zhao Yun said All armies have accomplished nothing and that is also our faultThe rules for reward and punishment must be strictly keptI pray that these things be kept in store till the winter when they can be distributed among the army When the First Ruler lived he never tired of extolling Zhao Yuns virtues the First Ruler was perfectly right said Zhuge LiangAnd his respect for the veteran was doubledThen came the turn of the four unfortunate leaders Ma Su Wang Ping Wei Yan and Gao Xiang to render accountWang Ping was called to the CommanderinChiefs tent and rebuked I ordered you and Ma Su to guard Jieting why did you not remonstrate with him and prevent this great loss I did remonstrate many timesI wished to build a rampart down in the road and construct a solid camp but the Commander would not agree and showed ill temperSo I led five thousand troops and camped some three miles off and when the army of Wei came in crowds and surrounded my colleague I led my army to attack them a score of times But I could not penetrate and the catastrophe came quickly Many of our troops surrendered and mine were too few to standWherefore I went to friend Wei Yan for help but I was intercepted and imprisoned in a valley and only got out by fighting most desperatelyI got back to my camp to find the enemy in possession and so I set out for LiliuOn the road I met Gao Xiang and we three tried to raid the enemys camp hoping to recover Jieting but as there was no one soldier there I grew suspiciousFrom a hill I saw my colleagues had been hemmed in by the soldiers of Wei so I went to rescue themThence we hastened to Yangping Pass to try to prevent that from fallingIt was not that I failed to remonstrateAnd you O Minister can get confirmation of my words from any of the officers Zhuge Liang bade him retire and sent for Ma SuHe came bound himself and threw himself on the earth at the tent doorZhuge Liang got angry saying You have filled yourself with the study of the books on war ever since you were a boy you know them thoroughlyI enjoined upon you that Jieting was most important and you pledged yourself and all your family to do your best in the enterprise yet you would not listen to Wang Ping and thus you caused this misfortuneThe army is defeated generals have been slain and cities and territory lost all through youIf I do not make you an example and vindicate the law how shall I maintain a proper state of disciplineYou have offended and you must pay the penaltyAfter your death the little ones of your family shall be my care and I will see that they get a monthly allowance Do not let their fate cause you anxiety Zhuge Liang told the executioners to take Ma Su awayMa Su wept bitterly saying Pity me O Minister you have looked upon me as a son I have looked up to you as a fatherI know my fault is worthy of death but I pray you remember how King Shun employed Yu after executing his fatherThough I die I will harbor no resentment down in the depths of the Nine Golden Springs Zhuge Liang brushed aside his tears and said We have been as brothers and your children shall be as my own It is useless to say more They led the doomed man away Without the main gate just as they were going to deal the fatal blow High Counselor Jiang Wan who had just arrived from Capital Chengdu was passing inHe bade the executioners wait a while and he went in and interceded for Ma SuFormerly the King of Chu put Minister Chen Dechen to death and his rival Duke Wen of Jin rejoicedThere is great confusion in the land and yet you would slay a man of admitted abilityCan you not spare him Zhuge Liangs tears fell but he said Sun Zi maintains that the one way to obtain success is to make the law supremeNow confusion and actual war are in every quarter and if the law be not observed how may rebels be made away withHe must die Soon after they bore in the head of Ma Su as proof and Zhuge Liang wailed bitterlyWhy do you weep for him now that he has met the just penalty for his fault said Jiang WanI was not weeping then because of Ma Su but because I remembered the words of the First Ruler When in great stress at Baidicheng he said Ma Sus words exceed the truth and he is incapable of great deeds It has come true and I greatly regret my want of insight That is why I weep Every officer weptMa Su was but thirtynine and he met his end in the fifth month of the sixth year of Beginning Prosperity  A poet wrote about him thusThat was pitiful that he who talked so glib Of war should lose a city fault most grave With death as expiationAt the gate He paid stern laws extremest penalty Deep grieved his chief recalled the late Princes words The head of Ma Su was paraded round the camps Then it was sewn again to the body and buried with it Zhuge Liang conducted the sacrifices for the dead and read the orationA monthly allowance was made for the family and they were consoled as much as possibleNext Zhuge Liang made his memorial to the Throne and bade Jiang Wan bear it to the Latter RulerTherein Zhuge Liang proposed his own degradation from his high office Naturally a man of mediocre abilities I have enjoyed your confidence undeservedly Having led out an expedition I have proved my inability to perform the high office of leaderOver solicitude was my undoingHence happened disobedience at Jieting and the failure to guard Chi ValleyThe fault is mine in that I erred in the use of people In my anxiety I was too secretiveThe Spring and Autumn has pronounced the commander such as I am is blameworthy and whither may I flee from my faultI pray that I may be degraded three degrees as punishment I cannot express my mortificationI humbly await your command Why does the Prime Minister speak thus said the Latter RulerIt is but the ordinary fortune of war Minister Fei Yi said The ruler must enhance the majesty of the law for without law how can people support himIt is right that the Prime Minister should be degraded in rank Thereupon an edict was issued reducing Zhuge Liang to the rank of General of the Right Army but retaining him in the same position in the direction of state affairs and command of the military forces Fei Yi was directed to communicate the decision Fei Yi bore the edict into Hanzhong and gave it to Zhuge Liang who bowed to the decree The envoy thought Zhuge Liang might be mortified so he ventured to felicitate him in other mattersIt was a great joy to the people of Shu when you O Minister captured the four northwest counties said heWhat sort of language is this said Zhuge Liang annoyedSuccess followed by failure is no successIt shames me indeed to hear such a compliment His Majesty will be very pleased to hear of the acquisition of Jiang Wei This remark also angered Zhuge Liang who replied It is my fault that a defeated army has returned without any gain of territoryWhat injury to Wei was the loss of Jiang Wei Fei Yi tried againBut with an army of one hundred thousand bold veterans you can attack Wei again When we were at Qishan and Chi Valley we outnumbered the enemy but we could not conquer them On the contrary they beat usThe defect was not in the number of soldiers but in the leadership Now we must reduce the army discover our faults reflect on our errors and mend our ways against the futureUnless this is so what is the use of a numerous army Hereafter every one will have to look to the future of his countryBut most diligently each of you must fight against my shortcomings and blame my inefficiencies then we may succeedRebellion can be exterminated and merit can be set up Fei Yi and the officers acknowledged the aptness of these remarksFei Yi went back to the capital leaving Zhuge Liang in Hanzhong resting his soldiers and doing what he could for the people training and heartening his troops and turning special attention to the construction of apparatus for assaults on cities and crossing rivers He also collected grain and fodder and built battle rafts all for future useThe spies of Wei got to know of these doings in the Lands of Rivers and reported to Luoyang The Ruler of Wei called Sima Yi to council and asked how Shu might be annexedShu cannot be attacked was the replyIn this present hot weather they will not come out but if we invade they will only garrison and defend their strategic points which we should find it hard to overcome What shall we do if they invade us again I have prepared for thatJust now Zhuge Liang is imitating Han Xin when he secretly crossed the river into ChencangI can recommend a man to guard the place by building a rampart there and rendering it absolutely secure He is a ninespan man round shouldered and powerful a good archer and prudent strategistHe would be quite equal to dealing with an invasion The Ruler of Wei was very pleased and asked for his nameHis name is Hao Zhao and he is in command at Hexi The Ruler of Wei accepted the recommendation and an edict went forth promoting Hao Zhao to General Who Guards the West and sending him to command in the county of ChencangSoon after this edict was issued a memorial was received from Cao Xiu Minister of War and Commander of Yangzhou saying that Zhou Fang the Wu Governor of Poyang wished to tender his submission and transfer his allegiance and had sent a man to present a memorandum under seven headings showing how the power of the South Land could be broken and to ask that an army be dispatched soonCao Rui spread the document out on the couch that he and Sima Yi might read itIt seems very reasonable said Sima Yi Wu could be quite destroyedLet me go with an army to help Cao Xiu But from among the courtiers stepped out Jia Kui who said What this man of Wu says may be understood in two ways do not trust itZhou Fang is a wise and crafty man and very unlikely to desert In this is some ruse to decoy our soldiers into danger Such words also must be listened to said Sima YiYet such a chance must not be missed You and he might both go to the help of Cao Xiu said the Ruler of Wei Sima Yi and Jia Kui wentA large army led by Cao Xiu moved to HuanchengJia Kui assisted by General Man Chong and Governor Hu Zhi of Dongwan marched to capture Yangcheng and facing the East PassSima Yi led the third army to JianglingNow the Prince of Wu Sun Quan was at the East Pass in Wuchang and there he assembled his officers and said The Governor of Poyang Zhou Fang has sent up a secret memorial saying that Cao Xiu intends to invadeZhou Fang has therefore set out a trap for Cao Xiu and has drawn up a document giving seven plausible circumstances hoping thereby to cajole the Wei army into his power
