He may drink wine sing and dance in gatherings of men and women
He may cheerfully enjoy such pleasures all day long more and more often
He may outwardly ask and pray for happiness but inwardly welcome licentiousness
After being intoxicated may seek each other out as an expedient 
Furthermore they may engage in satisfying their licentious feelings
When they consummate sexual union their joy is beyond comparison
They indulge in sensuality which binds them There is nothing they recognize
At that moment there is only pleasure
They do not realize the stink and lth of impure bodily uids or the suffering and pain in hell 
First such men are laughable
Second they are pitiful
For instance they are just like crazy wild men who do not know their own faults
This is the fourth evil aspect of men
Men have these four evils by which they fall into the three evil realms
You must discern this deeply and then you will avoid suffering
Furthermore you will hear of womens evils The Buddha explained in verse are considered to be moved by desire They are unscrupulous and unable to be peaceful They are accustomed to illicitness How could they be considered to be wise
Out of desire they do the deeds of animals And out of desire they destroy themselves at the same time They are like maggots that create bad odors They do not know that they are in severe difculties Just like maggots in a dirty place They do not know the difference between east and west They are bound by licentious desire Probably are a kind of insect Because of licentiousness they cannot see the path They plant the roots of sin day and night Presently the relationship between sovereign and subject is in disorder The upper and lower classes are indistinct and mixed up together The laws of the land are confused State affairs are uncertain and troubled Farmers give up their normal occupations Merchants unite for the sake of valuables The present world is a prison to a greater degree After death enter Mount Tai Where they must suffer from a hundred kinds of poisons The pain is unspeakable Molten copper is poured into their mouths The mountain vehicle runs over their bodies  These kinds are counted in the hundreds It is difcult to explain them all one by one  They always remain in the three evil realms Into which they transmigrate just as if on a wheel Even if the Buddha exists in the world at that time They cannot hear  Women do evil to the extreme It is hard to give them causes and conditions Once they bind a man with kindness and affection They take him through the gate of sin What good points do women have They just have various impurities Why do they not attentively believe what is right Yet for these  go crazy and wild Inside they stink and are lthy Outwardly they look neatly and properly dressed In addition in their mouths is a poisonous insect They are as dangerous as a snake or dragon For instance are just like a lance wrapped in brocade Or the sharp point of a knife draped in silk crepe The ignorant sees the appearance  He nds pleasure in them inviting disaster  The wise is aware of and leave off from them  The shallow men cause casualties Carnal desire is like this too take knives in their hands and destroy themselves They see the new and then become tired of it Therefore their enjoyments are also impermanent speech is like cutting with a sword or ax Their smiles are like being pricked by a thorn  They harbor smelly and lthy poison inside the mind And decorate the outside beautifully and fragrantly The ignorant sees them joyfully He does not think of suffering from disaster he will receive later For instance is just like a poisonous drug That is mixed with nectar The shallow men covet the taste Those who have drunk it all fall at on the oor are also like rewood that catches re Or grass and trees covered by heavy frost Wherever face everything is demolished This is the most inauspicious Womens poison is worse than this No one can see their whole shape The surface is seen yet the hidden side is not Therefore if one has carnal desire His demeanor is very easily seen The shallow men do not cut off this feeling  Cut off desires in order to seek the Way You may diverge even a little from the Way People are originally clean and pure They are just like sh that live in an abyss Nets are pitched on all sides And the sh that are caught cannot return The net of desire is more strenuous than this Uniting with is more than just being strong The wise men are able to realize this by themselves And can escape from that condition are just like a hungry ape That sees ripe sweet fruit And throws itself into the thorny shrubs taking a risk Such men are numerous and fall into  are also like a sh that swallows a hook Or a moth that ies into a lamp Devotedly throwing itself into re seeking danger Without thinking it will later suffer from disaster The Buddha spoke in this way
King Udayana was greatly delighted
He promptly bowed his head to the ground and addressed the Buddha Since the time I was born I truly did not hear about these evil aspects of women and men following them go against and fall into evil
I just did not know about it Therefore I did not control my mind and intentions
From now on I will repent all through my life take refuge in the Three Revered Ones and will not venture to violate it again He bowed to the Buddha was joyful and withdrew
A book says
Zhongni said Women and mean men are difcult to manage
If you become acquainted with them they become haughty
If you stay away from them they become discontented  Therefore a sutra says
Women who bewitch men with seductive charms have eightyfour aspects
There are eight serious aspects which intelligent men hate
First is jealousy
Second is reckless anger
Third is using abusive language
Fourth is cursing
Fifth is suppressing others
Sixth is stinginess and greed
Seventh is loving to adorn themselves
Last is using poisons
These are the eight serious aspects 
 Because of these women have many and various seductive charms
I pray that you will reject their attering evils in order to seek the true Dharma
Attain renunciation of the world soon to benet yourself as well as others
Furthermore the zhidu lun says
As for womens characteristics if respects  she causes his spirits to be high
If she abandons the wish to treat respectfully she causes him to feel afraid of her
In this way women usually bring delement anxiety and fear to people
How can we be close to them or become intimate with them
As it is said a king had a daughter whose name was Kumuda
There was a sherman called Shuboqie
 While following a path he saw the princess on a top oor of a tall building in the distance
Seeing her face in the window he imagined her and developed attachment to her
He did not forget her even for a moment
As time passed he could not eat and drink
His mother asked him the reason
He replied to her with emotion I saw the princess and I cannot forget her The mother reasoned with him You are a poor commoner while the princess is noble
You cannot win her  The son said I think of her with happiness and I cannot forget her even for a moment
If it does not go as I wish I will not be able to go on living The mother went to the palace for her sons sake
She had frequently sent rich foods such as sh and fowl to present to the princess without receiving any money
The princess felt strange and asked  What do you seek The mother replied to the princess Please ask all the servants to leave the room
I must tell you my feelings
I have an only son who respects and loves you Princess He has become depressed because of his affection for you and is ill
Now his life will not last much longer
Please take compassion on him and save his life The princess told her You must leave now
On the fteenth day of the month  stand behind a god image in a certain shrine The mother returned and said to her son What you wish is already accomplished She told him as described above
The son bathed put on new clothes and went to stand behind the god image
When the time came the princess addressed her father the king There is something inauspicious 
I must go to a shrine in order to seek auspiciousness and happiness The king said Very good Five hundred vehicles were accordingly adorned The princess went out and soon arrived at the shrine
She ordered all her attendants to stay at the gate and entered the shrine alone
The heavenly god thought  This should be not so
The king is my donor
I cannot let this mean man defame and disgrace the princess immediately detested the man and put him to sleep and let him not wake up
The princess having entered  saw him sleeping deeply She pushed him but he did not wake up
Then she left him a necklace of precious stones as valuable as a hundred thousand taels of gold and departed
Later the man woke up and saw the necklace
He asked people 
Then knew that the princess had come
The vow of his affection was not fullled He felt sad and regretful remorseful and angry
The re of sensuality broke out within him and he burned up and died
From this testimony it is known that a womans mind does not choose what is noble and what is humble but only engages in desire
Furthermore the Sapoduo lun says
would rather be inside the mouth of a venomous serpents  because of his status Do not consort with women
A serpent has three ways to harm people When it is seen it causes harm to people
When it is touched it harms people
When it bites it harms people
Women have also three kinds of ways to cause harm
If sees a woman and produces the thought of desire he destroys the peoples wholesome Dharma
If he touches a woman he is guilty of the offense of probation and destroys the peoples wholesome Dharma
If he has sexual intercourse with  he is guilty of a grave offense and destroys the peoples wholesome Dharma
First if he is harmed by a venomous serpent only his body is harmed
If he is harmed by a woman numberless bodies are harmed
Second if he is harmed by a venomous serpent he attains a body of neither good nor evil  which has no reward or retribution from the injury
If he is harmed by a woman the body of the wholesome Dharma is harmed
Third if he is harmed by a venomous serpent the body of the ve kinds of consciousnesses is harmed
If he is harmed by a woman the body of the six kinds of consciousnesses is harmed
Fourth if he is harmed by a venomous serpent he can still join the community 
If he is harmed by a woman he cannot act with other monks
Fifth if he is harmed by a venomous serpent he will be able to be reborn in heaven and to meet wise ones and sages in the realm of human beings
If he is harmed by a woman he will enter the three evil realms
Sixth if he is harmed by a venomous serpent he is able to attain the śramaṇas four fruits of sainthood because of it
If he is harmed by a woman he cannot benet from the eightfold holy path
Seventh if he is harmed by a venomous serpent people kindly think of him and relieve and nurse him
If he is harmed by a woman the people altogether reject him and have no joy in their minds
Because of these causes and conditions would rather be inside of a venomous serpents mouth  because of his status
After all he should not touch a woman at all for these 
Moreover the Zengyi ahan jing says
Women have ve kinds of powers with which they are disrespectful to their husbands
What are the ve kinds
First is the power of female charms
Second is the power of their kinsmen
Third is the power of their farmlands
Fourth is the power of their sons
Fifth is the power of selfprotection
This means that women have these ve kinds of powers with which they are accordingly disrespectful to their husbands
If a husband has a power he will completely conquer his women
It is what is called the power of wealth and high position
The harmful Mārapāpīyān has ve kinds of powers too
They are what are called form sound smell taste and touch 
If ignorant people become attached to these ve elements they cannot attain liberation
If a disciple of the Sage attains a single power which is called the power of not being indolent he will not be restrained 
Then he will be able to discern the law of birth aging sickness and death and defeat the devil s ve powers
He will not fall into the realm of devils and will reach the place of wuwei  At that time the Worldhonored One accordingly spoke these verses The precepts are a path of nectar Being indolent is a path of death
If you are not greedy you will not die Losing the Way is to lose yourself At that time the Worldhonored One told all the bhikṣus Women have ve thoughts of desire
What are these ve 
First is to be born in an inuential and noble family
Second is to marry into a wealthy and noble family
Third is to cause her husband to follow her words and do what she says
Fourth is to have many sons
Fifth is to be able to do everything according to her own at home
This means that have these ve matters as their thoughts of desire Further the Daweide tuoluoni jing says
The Buddha told nanda For instance just as when in a great sandy place a drop of water moistens the sand will penetrate it
If a woman receives the good fortune of desire with a thousand men she cannot be made content
This woman has three things with which she does not know to be content
First she adorns herself
Second she receives the pleasures of desire from a nearby man
Third she loves attering compliments
nanda this woman has ve holes for worms while men do not have these
Her ve worms exit within her vagina
One hole has eight thousand worms
has two heads each of which has a mouth
are all like a pointed needles
Those worms continuously trouble her and eat in her
They cause her to make actions and to repeat them
Therefore she is caused to act
Therefore they are called annoyance
Licentious women thus do not work together with the Dharma
Through karmic retribution they give rise to the actions of desire and become greedily attached to men without knowing contentment
When these women see a man they immediately say ne things look up to him and gaze at him closely for a long time
After gazing at him they look at him again look up to him respectfully and observe him while thinking of a love affair in their minds
On their face an evil look is seen They wish to take on other looks
They bite their lower lips with the teeth Their faces turn bluishpurple
Because of their desires sweat beads on their foreheads
When they sit idly they do not want to stand up 
When they stand up they do not want to sit down again
Just as tree branches extend down to the ground playfully wave both of their hands
Some walk three steps and when they take the fourth step they look up to the left and right
At the door some frown moan or heave a sigh
They wiggle lift their garments with the left hand and pat their thighs with the right hand
In addition they rub their teeth with their ngernails or they pick their teeth with grass or a twig from a tree
They scratch lightly the back of their heads with the hand
They expose their calves and make other men whistle
They walk calmly but when they stumble and fall they anxiously look in all directions
From such characteristics you must know women only want to initiate a love affair
Detest and leave  Reject and abandon them Do not cause yourself to transmigrate and to be born in the great darkness Moreover the Zhengfanian jing says
A heavenly bird spoke for the sake of all the heavenly gods in verse Women are not eternal friends They are just like lamp ames that do not stay still They really frequently have illwill They are just like patterns on talc They are intimate only with wealthy men  If has no property they dislike him If has property women come close to him He who has no property is rejected by women Giving goods and offerings make various merit
 minds are just like a ame Which cannot grasp in their hands Men comply with in this way Just as what wish for in their minds are like this But women always delude men Just like a snake covered with owers Or a re covered with dust Form covers the mind in this way  Women are also like this Just as one sees a poisonous tree Which delights his eyes but is unwholesome Women are like poisonous owers The wise should reject them and part from them The Ahan koujie shier yinyuan jing further says
There was an arhat who discerned with the divine eye and saw that numerous women fell into hell
Then he asked the Buddha What are the reasons for this The Buddha said It is because of four causes and conditions
First it is because have numerous desires and are greedy for valuables treasures and clothes
Second it is because they feel jealous of each other
Third it is because they prattle
Fourth it is because they frequently have unrestrained manners and licentious intentions
Because of these causes and conditions who fall into hell are numerous Verses say The ve desires trouble the root of the spirit The six thieves confuse the state of our mind and body  Illusory ames oat in the air chasing our feelings The net of attachment is woven following our mind Even though the season has changed from autumn to winter Murderous schemes have not come to the end I look at a dove but I have nothing to debate at all An ape hangs on and rests here
 Entering the Way Introduction Delight and Revulsion Tonsure and Quoted Testimonies The clergy and secular people differ from each other in appearance Pure and impure are distinguished from each other in destination
Since good and evil are not equal to each other reward and retribution are not the same
When we would like to see the ways of benevolence justice and great virtue we should seek models of decorum and the profound rules
Accordingly we can give up what we have treasured part from our parents and reject honored and inuential positions
We are temperate in eating delicious foods adopt a vegetarian diet and practice asceticism
A plain robe covers the body We do not care for adornments to amuse ourselves
We use things complying with what we like and set our bodies at ease We do not seek fame and wealth
We suppress the three poisons and restrain desires
With the eight superior qualities of the Buddhas voice in the three thousand Buddhist rules of deportment and the manners of observing the ve hundred precepts our movements are proper They all have standards
There are twelve different divisions of eighty thousand sutras which are expounded and by which Buddhist practitioners minds unite with the Buddha
They benet sentient beings at all times
It can be said that they are a model for heavenly and human beings and a boat to enter the Way

O Mañjuśrī
If I were to revile those who remain householders and praise those who have renounced the world even if my words  ll the empty air my speech would still be inexhaustible
This is called the demerits of those who remain householders and the merits of those who have renounced the world Moreover the Nirvāṇasūtra says
Those who remain householders are pressed as if they are in prison
All delements arise because of this
Those who have renounced the world are as magnanimous and open as the empty sky
All good things increase and advance because of this
People who remain householders anxiously think of their spouses and children internally and outwardly they busily run about in the military services for a sovereign
If they are wealthy in a high position and very successful then they are selfindulgent
If they are povertystricken and humble then they lose their ambition because of hunger and cold
They are disturbed in public and private and work diligently day and night
Numerous duties drag and bind them How can they have spare time to cultivate themselves in the Way
Furthermore the Yuqie changzhe jing says
 Those who remain householders have numerous delements
They are bound by affection for their father mother wife and children
They always think of property or a love affair and greedily seek these things insatiably
When they obtain them then they have numerous worries about protecting them

In addition the Chujia gongde jing  says
 If one releases male and female slaves and other people and renounces the world his merit is immeasurable
For instance if one makes offerings to arhats who ll the four continents on all sides of Mount Sumeru for a hundred years such a person is not as good as someone who for the sake of nirvana renounces the world and receives the precepts even for a single day and night This persons merit is immeasurable
Moreover if one erects a high stupa of the seven treasures which reaches Trāyastriṃśa Heaven the merit is not as good as that of one who has renounced the world
Furthermore the Dayuan jing says  Because of renouncing the world for even one day and one night he will not fall into the three evil realms for twenty kalpas Moreover the sengqi l
Those who renounce the world for even a single day and night and who cultivate themselves in pure practice will leave behind the suffering of the three evil realms for six hundred six thousand and sixty years  Again the Chujia gongde jing says
If one causes those who have renounced the world to suffer disturbs their cultivation and restrains them that person precisely cuts off the seed of buddhahood
All evils gather upon him just as the ocean
He will get leprosy in his present existence and after death he will enter the dark hell
There is no chance for him to come out of it
 Furthermore the Jiashe jing says
 At that time the great king and the crown prince heard that the merit of renouncing the world is very deep
At the same time they all awakened the aspiration to renounce the world
On the four continents on all sides of Mount Sumeru there was not even a single sentient being who was remaining at home
 Everyone awakened aspiration and wished to renounce the world
Since all those sentient beings already renounced the world they did not need to plant 
On their land various nonglutinous rice and trees spontaneously grew and their clothes were all supplied by heavenly beings
Further the Fozang jing says
You must pursue the Way wholeheartedly and practice according to the Dharma
Do not think of food and clothing
There are necessary things in the white curl of hair between the Tathāgatas eyebrows One supply is enough for all generations to come All disciples who have renounced the world are also unable to exhaust them  Moreover the Xianyu jing says
It is just as even if there were a hundred blind men but there is an excellent doctor he can cure their vision and immediately cause them to see clearly
In addition even if there were a hundred people whose eyes should be gouged out as punishment if someone has the capability to rescue them from the punishment he will cause them to not lose their eyes
Even though the merit of these two people is immeasurable it is still not as good as a person who causes other people to renounce the world and who renounces the world for himself His virtue is boundless
First of all if you intend to renounce the world relying on the Vinayas invite two masters in advance
an upādhyāya and an ācārya
The Sapoduo lun says
Even if the upādhyāya has rst been invited but when one receives the ten wholesome precepts the upādhyāya has not yet appeared that person will still attain the ten wholesome precepts
If one learns of the death  then he is unable to receive the precepts
If he has not heard of the death  then he can complete receiving the precepts
As for the ācārya it is the same
Furthermore the Qingxinshi duren jing  says
 If you intend to take the tonsure rst sprinkle fragrant hot water all over the ground of the place for tonsure hang banners on four sides within a sevenchi circumference arrange a raised seat intended for the one who is renouncing the world to sit and then make two more distinctive seats intended for the two masters to sit
He who wishes to renounce the world puts on his regular secular clothes
He says goodbye to his parents and his esteemed relatives
After that he says in verse
While I transmigrate in the three realms of existence I cannot leave behind your kindness and love Giving up kindness and entering nirvana are True requital for kindness After reciting this verse he removes his secular clothes
The Shanjian lun says  should take a bath of fragrant hot water and remove the traces of a layman The Duren jing says
 Even though puts on monks clothes he can only put on the nivāsana and saṃkakṣikā robes he cannot yet put on the kaṣāya
When he enters a the Buddhist seminary he should go before his upādhyāya and kneel on his right knee
The upādhyāya should give rise to the thought a child and cannot give rise to a malicious or meanspirited intention
The disciple should give rise to the thought of his master as his father and esteem and serve him
The upādhyāya preaches the Dharma variously for  and admonishes and encourages his mind
Then goes before the ācārya and sits there
The Shanjian lun says
 In addition to being sprinkled with fragrant hot water is praised in verse
Good a real person You can understand the world is impermanent You abandon the secular world and go to nirvana It is very rare and beyond the mind and language
After this verse is spoken he is directed to bow to the buddha lands in the ten directions Again a verse of praise is uttered
You take refuge in the great Worldhonored One You can cross over the suffering of the three realms of existence You also wish that all sentient beings will Universally enter the happiness of nirvana
After this verse is spoken the ācārya then shaves his head
The Duren jing says
When he takes the tonsure bystanders chant hymns of renouncing the world for him You alter your appearance and abide by your ambition and moral fortitude
You give up what you have treasured and have nothing to love You forsake your home and enter the sacred way You wish to liberate all people
When he is tonsured he must leave a few hairs on the crown of the head unshaved come before the upādhyāya and kneel on his right knee
The upādhyāya asks him Now I will remove the hair on the crown of your head for you
Do you allow me to do so He answers Yes Then the upādhyāya puts a kaṣāya on him
At the moment when the is put on according to the Shanjian lun a verse of praise is recited
How great is the robe of liberation  It is the formless dress of the eld of merit You put it on as respectfully as practicing in accordance with the precepts And extensively liberate all sentient beings The Duren jing says
After putting on a kaṣāya bows to the buddha and then walks around it chanting a sutra
The Buddhist clergy and laypeople follow behind him and circumambulate three times
recites a verse developing the celebratory intention
Good fortune Of those who encounter the Buddha Who is not happy With my meritorious vow I meet him in this existence I now attain the merit of the Buddhist law
 After circumambulating while chanting a sutra he again bows to the gathering and the two masters
After that he goes to his seat and stays there He receives the respects his relatives of the six relations pay to him
Bearing the intention of renouncing the world and leaving behind the secular world he is happy in mind
His parents and relatives all bow to him and they are delighted with his aspiration for enlightenment 
Finally at the midpoint of or before the tonsure ceremony meals should be provided to the Buddhist monks
According to the Pinimu lun  He receives the tonsure and dons a kaṣāya
Then his upādhyāya gives him the Three Refuges the ve precepts and other teachings If one has never attended a Buddhist service  it is impossible to completely explain 
If one makes allowances for at the time of taking it his or her rebirth in a wholesome place will be more successful As the Zabao zang jing says
Formerly there was a woman who was especially goodlooking
She renounced the world and cultivated herself according to a nonBuddhist teaching
At that time someone asked her Your appearance is so beautiful
You should have stayed in the secular world
Why did you renounce the world The woman replied I was not bad looking just as I am today but I have detested licentious desire ever since I was young
Therefore I have renounced the world When I was living at my home I was disposed early in life because I was goodlooking and soon I gave birth to a boy
My son consequently grew up He is inimitably handsome
He came to feel emaciated and weak he looked like an ill person
I then asked my son about the reason and condition of his illness
My son was not willing to tell me
I did not stop asking him
He could not stop me and told me his mother I dare not speak honestly because I am afraid I will not escape from death
If I honestly explained all I would feel extremely ashamed Accordingly he told me his mother I wanted to possess you mother in order to secretly satisfy my carnal desire I cannot have you
Therefore I simply became ill I his mother immediately said Since ancient times on how could there have been such a matter Again I thought to myself If I do not subordinate  my son will possibly die
I would rather defy reason in order to keep him alive Then I called my son and intended to meet his will 
When my son was climbing onto my bed however the oor split open and my son instantly fell into alive
I was frightened I tried to pull him back and caught my sons hair in my hands
Therefore I still have my sons hair today which I keep in my bosom
I was keenly moved by this matter and because of this event I renounced the world Furthermore the zhidu lun says
In the Buddhist Dharma even if those who have renounced the world violate the precepts and are punished  they will attain liberation after their punishment comes to an end
Just as the Youboluohua biqiuni bensheng jing says  when the Buddha resided in this world a bhikṣuṇī acquired the six supernatural powers and attained the fruit of arhatship
She entered the residences of the nobility and always praised the teaching of renouncing the world She told all the women of distinguished families My sisters
You should renounce the world All the noblewomen said We are young and energetic and very beautiful in appearance
It is difcult to observe the precepts
Or we must now be violating precepts This bhikṣuṇī said If you violate the precepts then violate them
Just renounce the world asked Those who violate the precepts will fall into hell
Why would we violate them replied If you fall into hell then fall All the noblewomen laughed at this and said Hell is a place of punishment
Why should we fall into it The bhikṣuṇī said I recollect my former existences
At one time I was an actress and I wore various costumes and spoke miscellaneous languages
Then once I cracked a joke and laughed as I put on a bhikṣuṇīs robe
Because of this cause and condition I became a bhikṣuṇī at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha
Presuming on my distinguished family background and good looks I gave rise to haughtiness in mind and violated the Buddhist precepts
Therefore I fell into hell and suffered various sorts of punishments
After I had nished suffering from all the punishments I met ākyamuni Buddha I renounced the world and attained the path of arhatship
Even if I again violate the precepts I will be able to attain fruition of the Way  In addition when the Buddha resided at Jeta Grove Monastery a drunken brahman came to the Buddhas place and asked to make him a bhikṣu
The Buddha ordered nanda to have head shaved and to put a Dharma robe on him The brahman soon recovered from his drunkenness
Frightened that he had suddenly became a bhikṣu he promptly ran away
All the bhikṣus asked the Buddha Why did you allow this drunken brahman to become a bhikṣu The Buddha replied This brahman has had no ambition to renounce the world for immeasurable kalpas but now he got drunk Therefore he abruptly slightly awakened the aspiration
Because of this cause and condition later he will renounce the world and attain the Way
Through various sorts of causes and conditions like this the prots and merits of renouncing the world are immeasurable
Because of this even though laypeople have the ve precepts they are not as good as those who have renounced the world whose merits are great Further the Zabao zang jing says
In the past King Udāyi lived in the city of Roruka
He was sagacious and perspicacious and had great wisdom
He had a wife called Candraprabhā a rare beauty who had virtuous conduct as well
The king loved and respected her very much
In the laws of his country at that time sovereigns did not play the lute themselves
At that time was in an inner chamber happily playing together with the king
Presuming on being the kings favorite she sent a lute for the king to play and rose up and danced for him of her own accord
When she raised her hands at the beginning the king who was originally good at physiognomy saw that the shadow of death had already appeared on his wifes face
He counted the remainder of her life which was no more than seven days
The king immediately let go of the lute and sadly heaved a deep sigh
said to the king I receive your favor and dared to ask you king to play the lute in the inner chamber and I got up and danced for you of my own accord
By doing so we enjoyed ourselves
What discomfort do you feel that you put down the lute and sighed deeply
Please tell me The king was unwilling to answer was polite but did not stop asking
The king sincerely answered
When his wife heard  she became very anxious and afraid
She then said to the king I have heard from a bhikṣuṇī of the stone chamber that if one can renounce the world with faith for even one day he or she will surely be able to be reborn in heaven
I wish to renounce the world
Please king listen to me and allow me  The king loved his wife very much so he told her At the beginning of the sixth day I will allow you to leave me They both honored one anothers intentions
When the sixth day came the king said to his wife You have a wholesome mind and wish to renounce the world
If you are able to be reborn in heaven be sure to come and see me
I will then allow you to leave After taking this oath she was given leave
Then was able to renounce the world and received the eight precepts of abstinence
Accordingly on that same day she drank some syrup made of sugar candy which coagulated and formed a lump in her stomach
On the morning of the seventh day her life came to an end
Due to the advantage of her wholesome condition she was able to be reborn in heaven
remembered her original oath and went to visit the king
Light brightly illuminated the entire palace
At that time the king asked Who are you The heavenly being answered King I was your wife Lady Candraprabhā The king happily said Please come and be seated The heavenly being answered King I now see that you smell bad and are lthy I am unable to come close to you
Because of my previous oath however I came here to see you king On hearing this King Udāyi was fascinated and liberated in mind
He exclaimed This heavenly being used to be my wife
She renounced the world for one day and then was able to be reborn in heaven
Her spirit is lofty and profound so she now sees me to be vile
Why shouldnt I now renounce the world
I once heard it said that one ngernail of a heavenly being is worth one Jambudvīpa
This country is not worthy for me to covet After saying this abdicated the throne in favor of his son
He renounced the world cultivated himself according to the Way and attained arhatship
The zhidu lun therefore says in verse
Even though peacocks adorn themselves with colors They are not better than the wild swans and cranes that can y far Even though laypeople possess wealth high position and power They are not as good as those who renounce the world whose merits are deep Furthermore the Za piyu jing says
In the past two brothers lived in the world
They had wealth and rank their property was immeasurable
Their parents passed away and they had no one else on whom to rely
Although they were brothers their ambitions differed
The elder brother was fond of the Buddhist Dharma while the younger brother loved the family business
The younger brother saw that the elder brother did not love their family business and frequently despised it
We are brothers but our parents died early
I diligently think of livelihood while you go against and desert our family business
You chase after śramaṇas and receive the Buddhist scriptures through listening
How can śramaṇas give you clothing money and jewels
Our family has fallen into straitened circumstances Our property is diminishing day by day
We will become a negligent family laughed at by others
To succeed to our parents is nothing more than lial piety The elder brother responded to him
 the ve precepts and the ten wholesome acts making offerings to the Three Treasures and edifying our relatives with the Way are nothing more than lial piety
It is the fate of nature that the clergy and the laity are contrary to each other
What the clergy is delighted with is what the laity detests
What the laity values is what the clergy despises
The wise and the ignorant are not the same There are light and darkness in strategies
Therefore the wise leaves behind darkness goes to the light and reaches truth through the Way
What you are now delighted with is the counterfeit of distress
How do you know about hardship The younger brother was angry He tilted his head not believing 
The elder brother saw that was like this
Then he told his younger brother You are greedy for household affairs and consider property to be valuable
I am fond of the Dharma stated in sutras
I take wisdom to be precious
Now I want to leave home and take refuge in the eld of merit
Counting the amount of time one has to live in the world it passes as quickly as dust ies
is impermanent and suddenly arrives We will be bound in punishments
Therefore I will renounce the world avoid dangers and go to the secure place The younger brother seeing the elder brothers inclination for the Buddhist Dharma was silent and did not respond
The elder brother left home and became a śramaṇa
Day and night diligently sat in meditation and pondered
His practice suited the teaching and he achieved the realization of the fruition of the Way
The younger brother heard about this and his anger became more intense
He became even more greedy in the family business to a point to which he had never been
Later his life came to an end and he fell among the cattle and became a tremendously fat ox
A merchant bought him to carry raw salt to sell 
Coming and going several times the ox consequently became emaciated and worn out He could not advance further
When he tried to climb a slope he was exhausted crippled in both legs and he lay down and could not stand up The merchant beat him
Shaking his head then and only then moved
At that time the elder brother traveled around by ying through the air
He saw his younger brother in the distance and said to him You my younger brother used to live in a farmhouse Where are you now
You threw yourself down among cattle
Through my supernatural power I will illuminate and show you your original nature
Accordingly you will recognize it yourself and reproach yourself weeping
You acted with unwholesomeness you were stingy greedy and jealous
You did not believe in the Buddhist Dharma and you were disrespectful to the sangha
You did not trust in your elder brothers words and butted against me following only your own decisions disregarding others
Therefore you  among cattle and you are now worn out and weakened
Regret cannot mend matters
I your elder brother know your innermost thoughts I am brokenhearted and feel sorrow for you He accordingly told the owner of the ox the whole story of his brother
When the merchant heard it he gave 
took the ox back to his monastery
He caused to think of the Three Treasures
The ox had food at all times
After its life came to an end it was able to be reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven
At that time the merchant and the people all thought and said We make a living but we cannot make donations
We do not know the Buddhist Dharma Death is also fearful Then they all deserted their houses giving up their wives and children
They abandoned items of great value and became śramaṇas
They were diligent and not negligent They also all attained the Way
Observing from this worldly property and treasures are not benecial for people
Admire and respect the Three Revered Ones Cultivate yourselves and study the Way Then you will obtain peace generation after generation
Moreover the Fufazang jing says
In ancient times the arhat Sheyeduo  one of eminent virtue led all his disciples to visit the city of Takṣaśilā
After arriving in the city he felt saddened and unhappy
He went on for awhile and saw a crow in the road He then smiled with pleasure
His disciples asked their teacher Please tell us the story about this The eminent one replied When we rst arrived in the city I saw under the city gate a young spirit
He was starved and anxiously told me My mother entered the city to seek food for my sake
Five hundred years have passed since the time I was separated from my mother
I am impoverished with hunger and my stomach is empty My life is coming to an end before long
Eminent one when you enter the city if you see my mother please tell her about my hardship
Pray tell her to come back soon Only then did I enter the city Then I saw mother to whom I completely explained her childs wish
The spirit mother answered to me Five hundred years have passed since the time I came into the city
I have not been able to obtain even a single persons nasal mucus or saliva
My strength to produce is already weak and low
Even if I am able to produce a small amount of saliva all the other spirits snatch it from me
I met a person and happened to obtain a little saliva
I want to take it out of the city and share it with my child
Under the gate however there are many powerful spirits
I am afraid of them and do not dare go out
Please eminent one send me out of the city I am immediately going out
Let me eat together with my child I then asked the spirit When were you born The spirit replied I have seen the rise and fall of this city seven times I heard the spirit said I sigh over birth and death and suffering for a long time Therefore I was sad
As for the crow of that time 
Ninetyone kalpas ago a buddha appeared in the world called Vipassī
At that time I was the child of a wealthy man of virtue
I wished to attain renunciation of the world
If I renounced the world at that point I would have surely attained arhatship
My parents however did not listen to me and compelled me to marry a charming wife
Shortly after I married I again sought to renounce the world
My parents said to me If you have a son we will release you I subsequently received the teaching and later  had a boy
When he became six years old I again intended to leave home
My parents taught my boy to hang on to my legs crying and say Father if you desert me who will bring me up
You must rst kill me then later you may go At that time seeing I became attached to him
So I said to my son For your sake I will not renounce the world again Because of my child from that time on I have transmigrated in the ve realms for ninetyone kalpas and have been unable to see my son
Now with excellent discernment I observed that crowmy son from the previous existence
I take pity on the ignorance under which he has been experiencing the transmigration of birth and death for a long time
That is why I smiled
With this cause and condition if someone again hinders another person from renouncing the world that person will be retributively punished and continuously remain in evil realms where he will receive extreme suffering
There is nothing by which he may attain liberation
After nishing the punishment of the evil realms if he is reborn among human beings he will be blind with no eyes Therefore wise people when they encounter someone who wishes to renounce the world must exert themselves with expedient means to advise and help that person in his achievement
Do not put obstacles in their way
Again the Chujia gongde jing says
In ancient times when the Buddha resided in the world he entered the city of Vaiśālī together with nanda
At that time they had come and begged for alms
There was a prince called Vīrasena who amused himself with the court ladies on the top oor of a tall building
Hearing a musical sound the Buddha said to nanda I know that this person will most certainly die in seven days
If he does not renounce the world he will probably fall into hell After hearing this nanda went to edify and exhorted him to renounce the world
The prince listened to exhortation For the rst six days exhausted his intention to take enjoyment and on the seventh day he asked the Buddha to renounce the world
For one day and night he practiced and observed the pure precepts
Then when his life came to an end he was reborn in the realms of the four heavenly kings as a son of Vaiśravaṇa the heavenly king of the northern direction
Along with all his court ladies he enjoyed the pleasures of desires arising in connection with the ve senses
His life in that heaven was terminated after ve hundred years
Later he was reborn as a son of akradevānāmindra in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven
His life in that heaven was one thousand years
Next he was reborn as a prince of Yama 
His life span there was two thousand years
Afterward he was reborn in Tuṣita Heaven again as a prince
He died at the age of four thousand
Next he was born in Nirmāṇarati Heaven as the heavenly kings son and his life span was eight thousand years
When his life in Nirmāṇarati Heaven came to an end he was reborn in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven the sixth as a prince of the heavenly king
He received the ve desires along with all his court ladies
following were extremely wonderful
His life as a heavenly being was over after sixteen thousand years
He received pleasures in this way
He came and went seven times in the six heavens of the realm of desire and did not experience an early death
He who renounces the world for even one day will not fall into evil realms for a full twenty kalpas and will be continuously reborn in heaven where he will receive happiness spontaneously
He will be reborn last in the realm of human beings where he will completely possess wealth happiness family property and treasures
He will feel revulsion toward the world when he approaches old age after passing through the prime of life
Then he will renounce the world cultivate himself in the Way become a pratyekabuddha called Piliudili  and extensively liberate limitless heavenly and human beings
For this cause and condition the merit of renouncing the world is immeasurable boundless and beyond comparison
Suppose that there are numerous arhats lling the four continents on all sides of Mount Sumeru if a person completely exerts his mind to offer the four requisites to them without any shortage for a hundred years or if someone erects a stupa for them when they enter nirvana and offers various things such as owers incense and necklaces the merit they earn is still not as great as that of a person who seeks nirvana renounces the world and observes the precepts for even a single day and night
From this it is said that the virtue of renouncing the world is truly respectable
You must not greedily become attached to secular matters such as not having enough money or women wander about in the transmigration of birth and death and give yourself pain
The Zhong benqi jing speaks of Devadatta In the Qi dynasty he was called Tianre  When he was born heavenly and human beings were all amazed and enthusiastic
Therefore he was given this name Moreover the Wuxing she lun talks about Devadatta In the Tang dynasty he is called Tianshou or Tianyu  which means one who was obtained from heaven through entreating Therefore he is called Tianshou Further the Zengyi ahan jing says
Devadatta addressed the Buddha Please allow me to maintain the right path to attain the Way The Buddha said You should remain a householder and be kind enough to give us alms
It is really not easy to become a śramaṇa repeatedly asked the Buddha but  again told him You should not renounce the world Devadatta then gave rise to an evil thought This śramaṇa feels jealous of me
I now had better shave my head by myself and study moral practices well
Why do I have to take this śramaṇas words Devadatta later committed the ve rebellious sins
With an evil mind he intended to come to the Tathāgatas place
When landed on the ground a big re and wind arose from underground and swirled around Devadattas body
He was burned in the re
He then wished to repent and call out Namas Buddha 
However he was not actually able to nish it and subsequently he entered hell
nanda asked sorrowfully sobbing How long will Devadatta remain in hell The Buddha replied He will be there for a great kalpa 
After his life there comes to an end he will be reborn in the heaven of the four heavenly kings
He will wander from one heaven to another and come to Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven
He will pass through sixty kalpas without falling into the three evil realms
Finally he will be reborn and become a pratyekabuddha called Namas because he called out Namas when his life was coming to an end At that time Mahāmaudgalyāyana said I would like to go to Avīci Hell visit Devadatta and console cheer and offer congratulations to him The Buddha said The sinners in Avīci Hell do not understand human beings sounds Maudgalyāyana addressed the Buddha I understand sixtyfour kinds of sounds
I should go and talk to him using these sounds Maudgalyāyana came to above Avīci Hell as quickly as the time it takes to bend and stretch out ones arm
From the air he commanded Devadatta A hell warden replied In this section there are  Devadatta from the time of Krakucchanda Buddha and from the time of Kāśyapa Buddha as well
What do you command now Maudgalyāyana said I command Devadatta a son of ākyamuni Buddhas paternal uncle The hell warden burned body to wake him up and said You look up in the air saw that Mahāmaudgalyāyana sat on a lotus ower made of treasures
He asked Maudgalyāyana Eminent One why did you come down here Maudgalyāyana replied The Tathāgata explained that you intended to kill the Worldhonored One
Because of this condition you entered Avīci Hell
In the end you will become a pratyekabuddha called Namas After hearing this Devadatta happily said If today I lie down on my right side in Avīci Hell even for the duration of one kalpa I will have no fatigue and weariness at last Maudgalyāyana again asked him Is there an increase or decrease in pain Devadatta replied My body is run over by a hot iron wheel and destroyed
 Then my body is crushed with an iron pestle
 There is a black cruel elephant that treads on my body
Moreover there is a volcano ows and covers my face
My kaṣāya from the old days transforms into a copper metal plate Something extremely vigorous comes and attaches to my body The origins and conditions of my pain are like this
Now entrusting it to your care I will worship the Worldhonored One by bowing my head to his feet
Furthermore I will worship the Eminent One nanda Maudgalyāyana then used supernatural power to travel and return to the Worldhonored Ones place
Moreover the zhidu lun says
Devadatta and a disciple Kokālika slandered āriputra and Maudgalyāyana
When their lives came to an end they fell into Lotus Hell
Further the benqi jing calls Quheli 
What is more the baoen jing says As for Devadatta in the remotest past incalculable kalpas ago a buddha appeared in the world
His name was Yingxian 
 After this buddhas nirvana during the period of the semblance Dharma there was a meditation bhikṣu who lived alone in a grove
At that time the bhikṣu was always troubled by a louse
He made a pact  saying When I sit in meditation you should silently hide yourself and remain quiet The louse did as prescribed
Shortly after a local ea approached the louse and asked Why are your body and muscles so plump and healthy The louse said The master on whom I depend always cultivates himself in meditation
He taught me the time to eat and drink
Since I eat and drink as he taught my body has become bright and plump The ea said I also want to learn that method The louse said You can do as you please Soon after the bhikṣu sat in meditation
At that time the local ea smelled the odor of blood and esh and immediately to eat them
At that time distress arose in the bhikṣus mind and he immediately took off his robe and burned it in a re
The Buddha said The bhikṣu who sat in meditation at that time is now Kāśyapa
The local ea of that time is now Devadatta and the louse of that time is now myself
Devadatta injured me in order to enrich and nourish himself
Consequently today I attained buddhahood
Again since caused the Buddhas body to bleed in order to enrich and nourish himself he entered hell alive
Devadatta continuously harbored evil in his mind and injured the Tathāgata
If I were to speak more on this issue it would take kalpa after kalpa without coming to an end The Zabao zang jing says
The Buddha stayed in the kingdom of Kapilavastu He entered the city begging for alms and arrived at the house of his cousin Sundarananda
It happened that Nanda had adorned his wife and applied a fragrant cosmetic on the middle of her forehead
He heard that the Buddha was inside the gate and wanted to go out to see him
His wife made an agreement with him saying Go out and see the Tathāgata
Come back here before the cosmetic on my forehead has dried up Nanda promptly went out saw the Buddha and worshiped him
took a bowl went back to the house put food into the bowl and offered it to the Buddha
The Buddha did not take it and passed on it to nanda who did not take it either
nanda said From whom did you get the bowl
Go and return it to its original place Thereafter went after the Buddha holding the bowl
They arrived at the monastery of Nigrodhārāma
The Buddha then ordered a barber to shave Nandas head but Nanda did not agree
Shaking his st in anger said to the barber Can you shave the heads of all the people of Kapilavastu now The Buddha asked the barber Why did you not shave him  answered Because I am scared of him and I dared not shave him The Buddha along with nanda personally approached 
Nanda was afraid of  Therefore he did not dare to refuse to be shaved
Even though his hair had been shaved he always wished to return home but the Buddha always led him about and he was not able to get away
Later one day had to take turns to watch over the residential quarters
So was very happy for himself
Now it is truly my chance
I can return home
After waiting until the Buddha and the monks had all left I will go back home After the Buddha entered the city thought to himself I should draw water ll the water jars for them and then go home Subsequently he drew water  as soon as one jar was lled another jar was overturned
Time went by in this way and he could not ll the jars
Then he said It is impossible to ll all 
I will let the bhikṣus draw water for themselves after they come back
Now I will just put the jars in their room and leave them there He then closed the doors 
As soon as one leaf was closed the other leaf opened again
As soon as one door was closed the other door opened again
He further thought Since I cannot shut them all I will just leave as they are and go away
Even if all the clothes and belongings of the bhikṣus are lost I have abundant money and jewels enough to be able to compensate them then left the monks residential quarters but he thought to himself The Buddha will certainly pass this way
I will leave along a different path The Buddha knew intention and came along the different path that  too
saw the Buddha approaching from a distance and hid behind a big tree
The spirit of the tree lifted the tree up into the air exposing standing on the ground
The Buddha saw Nanda and took him back to the monastery
then asked him Do you think of your wife replied Yes I really do Immediately  taking Nanda with him headed toward the top of Mount Anabo
 again asked Nanda Is your wife beautiful answered Yes she is In the mountain there was an old blind monkey
Once again asked How beautiful is the countenance of your wife Sundarī compared with that of this monkey Nanda felt remorseful and angry and thought to himself My wife is a rare beauty among the people
Why does the Buddha now compare my wife with a blind monkey The Buddha then went to Trāyastriṃśa Heaven leading 
They went all over the heavenly palaces and saw them together
saw that all the gods and the goddesses entertained each other
He saw that in a palace there were ve hundred goddesses but no god
He sought out the Buddha to ask him 
The Buddha said Go and ask them yourself Nanda went and asked them In all the other palaces there are gods
Why is there not even a single god in just this  All the goddesses answered The Buddhas younger brother Nanda is in Jambudvīpa
 The Buddha compelled him to renounce the world
Because of the cause and condition of renouncing the world after his life comes to an end he will be reborn in this heavenly palace and become our god Nanda replied This is precisely myself and wanted to live there immediately
The goddesses said We are goddesses while you are now a human being
The paths of human beings and heavenly beings differ from each other
For the time being if you return and give up your human life and you are reborn in this place then you will be able to live here then returned to the Buddha and fully told the Worldhonored One about the things mentioned above
The Buddha said to Nanda Is your wife as beautiful as the goddesses Nanda answered Comparing the goddesses with is just like comparing her to the blind monkey The Buddha returned to Jambudvīpa leading Nanda
Nanda became more diligent in the observance of the precepts because he wished to be reborn in heaven
nanda at that time said to in verse
For instance just as a castrated ram struggles To go forth yet it retreats more You observe the precepts for your desires What you do is also just like that The Buddha led Nanda again and they arrived in hell
saw that all the boiling cauldrons without exception were lled with people
He saw one cauldron that bubbled up but it was empty
Wondering why he came and asked the Buddha
The Buddha told him Go and ask them yourself Nanda accordingly went and asked a hell warden Without exception all the cauldrons are boiling and punishing sinners
Why is this cauldron empty without anyone being boiled in it answered In Jambudvīpa there is a disciple of the Tathāgata called Nanda
Because of the merit he earned by renouncing the world he will attain rebirth in heaven because of the cause and condition of giving up the Way for desires he will fall into this hell after his life in heaven comes to an end
Therefore I stoke the cauldron waiting for Nanda  After hearing this Nanda became afraid that the hell warden might detain him
He said I will take refuge in the Buddha
I will take refuge in the Buddha
I only pray that you will protect me and take me back to Jambudvīpa The Buddha told Nanda Can you diligently observe the precepts and cultivate your heavenly merit Nanda replied I do not need to be reborn in heaven
Now I only pray that I will not fall into this hell The Buddha expounded the Dharma for 
In seven days he achieved arhatship
All the bhikṣus said in admiration It is very laudable and greatly distinguished that the Worldhonored One appeared in the world The Buddha said Not only today is like this but also the past was like this too All the bhikṣus said The past was just so too
What does this mean
Please explain it for us The Buddha said Formerly there was the king of Kāśi called Pūrṇamukha
In the kingdom of Videha there was a licentious woman who was extremely beautiful
At that time these two kingdoms continually held grudges against each other
At his side had a attering courtier who said with a sigh to the king of Kāśi In the other kingdom there is a licentious woman who is a rare beauty in the world The king heard these words and gave rise to deluded attachment in his mind
He sent a messenger to look for her
That kingdom did not give 
again sent a messenger saying I would like to see her for a short time
In four or ve days she will be returned
You must send her out The king of the other kingdom then instructed the licentious woman Your gure is completely equipped with all good qualities
Cause the king of Kāśi to become deluded and attached to you Then he will be unable to leave you even for a moment The king then sent her out and ordered her to go
Four or ve days passed Suddenly called out I would like to arrange for a grand sacrice I must get the woman back
Return and release her for a while Later I will send her again The king of Kāśi immediately sent her back
After the grand sacrice came to an end sent a messenger and asked to return to him
replied She will be sent tomorrow On the next day she was not sent back again
While he continued to lie in this way many days passed
The king had deluded attachment in his mind He wanted to go to the other kingdom taking only a few men with him
All his vassals remonstrated with him but he was not willing to accept 
At that time on Immortal Mountain there was a monkey king who was intelligent broadly learned with extensive knowledge
His wife accidentally died and he took a female monkey 
The whole group of monkeys became angry They scolded and blamed  This female monkey is our common property
For what reason do you monopolize her The monkey king then ed to the kingdom of Kāśi taking the female monkey with him and they stayed in the palace of the king 
The monkeys all chased him and soon arrived in the city where they broke the houses apart and destroyed the walls It was impossible to control them
The king of Kāśi said to the monkey king Why dont you now return this female monkey to all the monkeys The monkey king replied My wife has passed away
I would no longer have a wife O King
Why do you now want me to return her to them The king said  Your monkeys are ruining and throwing my kingdom into disorder
How can you not return her The monkey king said Is this matter not good The king answered No not good This went on again and again
Since the king said that it was not good the monkey king said In your palace there are eightyfour thousand ladies but you do not happily love them and want to go to another hostile kingdom chasing after a licentious woman
I have no wife now and take only this one but you say it is not good
All your people live looking up to you
Why do you abandon state affairs for one licentious woman
O great king You must know that licentious desires bring only small pleasure and great suffering
It is just like holding a aming torch against the wind
An ignorant person does not let go of and is surely burned
Desire is as impure as a heap of dung
Desire appears on the external gure and is merely covered by a thin skin
Desire has no requital of kindness just like a venomous snake daubed with dung
Desire like a harmful bandit is deceitful and intimately attaches to people
Desire is like a loan that must certainly be returned
Desire is detestable just like a ower growing in a toilet
Desire is like sores from scabies when one comes close to a re when they are scratched they become severe
Desire is just like when a dog gnaws a dry bone when his saliva mixes with  he thinks it is tasty and although his lips and teeth are completely broken he is never satised
Desire is like a thirsty man drinking saltwater his thirst increases more than ever
Desire is like a piece of meat that a ock of birds vie in chasing after
Desire is like being greedy for the taste of a sh or an animal that causes one to die
 It is a very serious disaster The monkey king of that time is me
The king of that time is Nanda
The licentious woman of that time is Sundarī
I at that time pulled Nanda out of the ditch of desires
Now again I will pull him out of the suffering of the transmigration of birth and death The Weizengyou jing says
Rāhula renounced the world and became a novice at the age of nine
The king ordered fty princes of powerful families and various lords all to renounce the world following Rāhula
āriputra was the upādhyāya and Mahāmaudgalyāyana was the ācārya and they gave the ten wholesome precepts
Rāhulas mother Yaśodharā was the Crown Princes wife
In less than three years she renounced the world Since matters concerning the other disciples are broad and numerous it is impossible to explain them all in detail A few important points will be presented As for novices the Biography of Buddhayaśas says
In the Sui dynasty it was called menial labor because cultivation in the Way is laborious
Moreover it was translated as xici which means to stop worldly deled feelings in order to deliver all beings through benevolence 
Additionally even though the Buddhist Dharma was founded worldly feelings still exist
So they must stop evil and do acts of benevolence Furthermore the Zengyi ahan jing says
The Buddha told all the bhikṣus There are four castes  in the world but those who have renounced the world have no original caste
It is said however that śramaṇas are the sons of ākyamuni
The reason is that they were born following my birth and they became śramaṇas following completion of the Dharma
They come out just as all the four great seas come out of Lake Anavatapta Moreover the Mishasai l
You bhikṣus have renounced the world from various family backgrounds
All of you gave up your original family names and call yourselves the son of ākyamuni śramaṇa Furthermore the Chang ahan jing says
When Maitreya appears in the world all bhikṣus and disciples will be also called the Benevolent Ones sons just as my disciples are now called the sons of ākyamuni  Maitreya is a family name It refers to the benevolent family When I observe the modest incarnate form of the Great Awakened One  his posture to edify the people is equal to that found in earthly literature
Therefore descendants succeed to his wisdom and his followers increase one after another
At the same time the conditions are revealed for innumerable kalpas Therefore we can assist and support his wonderful edication
Moreover when the four rivers enter the sea they are all called the sea When the four castes take refuge in the Way they are all called Buddhists
It can be said that after all the origin of these differences is the same only one taste
Verses say The divine help of the previous existence has consequently ripened
Now I attain renunciation of and transcendence from the world I gave up the secular world and banished delements Being detached I have joyfully realized Wisdom lies in a peaceful mind free from prejudice Wondrousness cannot be enumerated When I was inspired I encountered the Way I cut off affairs to restrain and restrict me
I am diligently eager for study I take this nectar My meritorious achievement is not reduced I sense the sacred excellent shelter Solemnly a spirit comes Gracefully a deity takes steps There are he and I without others Dharma mates meet each other Miracle Stories At Zhiyuan Temple in the metropolis of the Song dynasty there was Shi Zhiyan a man from western Liangzhou  He renounced the world at the Chinese age of twenty and became famous for his dedication and diligence
He traveled around the western countries for study and made inquiries into the ways of meditation He was extensively well versed in sutras and discourses
He returned from the Western Region with rare and precious scriptures
He had not yet translated and copied the sutras and discourses he had acquired but in the fourth year of the Yuanjia era of the Song dynasty he translated them together with such as Baoyun did not accept special invitations from laypeople who intended to make offerings only to him  He always supported himself by mendicancy 
He was completely accustomed to the Buddhist edication inspiration and the unseen and manifesting worlds
Someone who had seen evil spirits said Inside the Grand Shrine of Xizhou I have seen evil spirits speak to each other
They said When Eminent yan comes we must retreat This person did not understand it
yan suddenly arrived there
For the time being asked him his name Sure enough called himself Zhiyan
stayed silent but recognized  secretly applied the rites for nonhumans
Ne Liu the wife of Xiao Sihua Director of Lanling  suffered from a disease
She often saw evil spirits coming and cried out in fear
At that time welcomed yan for a sermon
yan had just arrived at the outer hall when ne Liu saw that a group of evil spirits scattered away
yan already advanced and spoke on a sutra for the wife
She was cured of the disease because of this
Accordingly she received the ve precepts and the whole family believed in 
yan was clean simple and unselsh He gave away things as soon as he received them
He roamed throughout the corners of the world when he was young and had no xed place to live
He was submissive by nature and never talked about himself
Therefore even though he had much virtuous conduct his virtue could not be fully transmitted in the world
Formerly before yan renounced the world he received the ve precepts on one occasion but he had a violation against them
Later he entered the Buddhist Way and received a complete set of precepts as a monk but he always doubted if he had not attained some precepts
He was often afraid of this
He meditated for years but could not understand it all by himself
Consequently he crossed over the sea and arrived in India again
He consulted with various intellectuals arhats and bhikṣus
He questioned them about the issues in detail
The arhats did not venture to conclude 
They then entered into meditation for yans sake and went to the palace of Tuṣita Heaven where they consulted with Maitreya
Maitreya replied He has attained the precepts yan was greatly happy
Thereafter he walked back and arrived in Kaśmīra  where he died without having a disease
At that time he was seventyeight Chinese years old
In that country there were various places to cremate monks both common and saintly
Even though yan was an expert on the precepts and moral principles he was not recognized for putting them into practice
His corpse initially was moved toward the graveyard for common monks but the corpse was too heavy to lift
Then they changed direction heading toward the graveyard of saintly monks then spontaneously became airily light
yans disciples Zhiming and Zhiyuan came from the west  They reported this auspicious sign and then returned together to the foreign country 
Judging from this yan truly attained the Way
It is however unknown if he was midway to fruition and how deep was 
At Qiyuan Temple in the metropolis of the Song dynasty there was Guṇavarman whose name translates as Armor of Merit here 
He was originally from the kṣatriya class
was of the royalty of successive generations ruling in Kaśmīra
He was smart and talented and had deep magnanimity
He was benevolent and extensively knowledgeable He respected virtue and strived after wholesomeness
He arrived at Jianye in the rst month of the eighth year of the Yuanjia era of the Song dynasty
Emperor Wen r him questions
Accordingly said I your disciple would always like to observe the precepts and try to not kill but I am compelled to follow  I cannot realize my determination
Since you Dharma teacher did not regard ten thousand li to be far and came to edify in this country how can you teach me about this Guṇavarman replied The Way lies in the mind not in affairs
The Dharma is up to oneself not up to others
Moreover a sovereign is different from ordinary people in what he must cultivate
The words and orders of ordinary people of humble status and inferior position do not have power
If they do not subdue and torment themselves how would they be saved
A sovereign takes the empire as a big family and the entire nation as his children
When he speaks ne words all the men and women are happy
When he governs well the people and the gods harmonize
If lives are not taken as punishment and there is no trouble with labor in the military services the wind and rain arise in a timely manner and heat and cold match the seasons
Then all kinds of grain will grow luxuriantly and the mulberry leaves and hemp will be thick
In observance of the precepts like this purication  is also great
In the precept of not killing there are many 
Would you rather discern that going without a meal for half a day causes an animal to escape from death and later will be a great salvation The emperor then touched a small table exclaiming Worldly people are confused about the profound principles
ramaṇas stagnate in common teachings
Those who are confused in profound principles say that the utmost way is false talk
Those who stagnate in common teachings adhere rigidly to books
Regarding what you Dharma teacher said I truly think that it is an enlightened and intelligent man
I should say it is the speech the ultimate heavenly being Then he issued an imperial decree and invited to live at Qiyuan Temple and he offered great kindness to 
Among princes and people of outstanding ability and virtue none did not believe in and serve him
His great translations of sutras and discourses are listed in full in the Biographies of Eminent Monks
 The meanings of his translations are also detailed and proper his Chinese do not differ from the Sanskrit 
At that time the nuns of Yingfu Temple such as Huiguo and Jingyin all invited Guṇavarman
They said Formerly in the sixth year  eight nuns came to the metropolis from Siṃhala  and said to us There has not been a nun before in the land of the Song dynasty
How could you two nuns receive the precepts  We are afraid that precepts is incomplete Guṇavarman replied The law of precepts originally came from multitudes of monks
If  is not an original form nothing hinders people from attaining the precepts
It is just like the condition of being fond of the Way All the nuns were furthermore afraid that term was less than and they earnestly wanted to receive his further 
Guṇavarman told them Good
If you wish to expand your understanding I will greatly help you It is my pleasure
Nuns of western countries  however are not yet old enough
Moreover the number of nuns is insufcient
Furthermore you have to teach them the language of the Song dynasty 
Additionally through the laypeople from Central Asia you should ask more foreign nuns to come  Ten or so more would be sufcient In summer of that year held a retreat at Lower Dinglin Temple
At that time some believers picked owers and spread them out seats
The colors of the owers under Guṇavarmans seat were brighter than the others
All the people worshiped him in the manner of worshipping a saint
At the end of the summer returned to Qiyuan Temple
On the twentyeighth day of the ninth month of that year before the end of the midday meal got up and returned to his room before everyone else
 His disciples came later  had suddenly passed away
He was sixtyve Chinese years old
After death he was held and seated on a rope couch
His facial appearance had not changed He looked as if he had entered into meditation
Both the clergy and laypeople who attended numbered more than one thousand
They all smelled something exceedingly fragrant and they all saw a being whose appearance was similar to that of a dragon or snake  which would measure about one zhang  long
It rose up beside corpse and rushed straight up to heaven
There was no one who could give its name
was cremated with fragrant rewood that had been sprinkled with fragrant oil
Fivecolored ames broke out and a vigorous atmosphere hung in the sky
The mournful voices of the four categories of Buddhists and the crowd of people moved heaven
They wept hopelessly unable to overcome their sorrow
Shi Tanhui a nun of the Song dynasty was a woman from Chengdu in Shu prefecture 
Her original family name was Qingyang and her rst name was Baiyu
At the age of seven she was delighted with sitting in meditation
Every time she sat in meditation she could perceive something but she had no idea of what it meant and she thought it was nothing but a dream
One time was sleeping with her elder sister
She entered into meditation at midnight
Her elder sister found her behind a screen her body was hard like a piece of wood or a rock and she was out of breath
Her elder sister was greatly astonished and shouted out in a loud voice to their family members
They nursed her by turns
Even at daybreak had not yet recovered consciousness
hurriedly went to sorcerers and asked them 
All said that was possessed by evil spirits
When was eleven years old a foreign meditation master called Kālayaśas came to Shu prefecture
Tanhui asked him for his opinion about 
Kālayaśas thought Tanhuis meditation had potential and he wished to encourage and edify her in order to cause her to renounce the world
At that time Tanhui was going to marry and the wedding date was already xed
Fayu who had not fully known and communicated with family secretly took back with her to the temple where she lived
Once her family realized this they were going to force to marry
Tanhui was unwilling and deeply swore an oath If my aspiration for the Buddhist Way is not achieved and consequently I am restricted and forced  then I must give up my lthy body by diving into a re or feeding it to a tiger
I pray all the buddhas in the ten directions to testify to my sincerity Regional Inspector Zhen Fachong who believed in and esteemed the true Dharma heard about Tanhuis ambition and conduct
So he invited her for a meeting and at the same time he summoned the magistrate the assistant magistrate and virtuous śramaṇas  He had them alternately put difcult questions to Tanhui
She replied to them without yielding
All the people present were struck with wonder
Fachong then approved her to leave the family into which she was going to marry and allowed her to enter the Buddhist Way
In the nineteenth year of the Yuanjia era King Kang of Linchuan invited her to a temple in Guangling
Zhao Xi of the Huainan area of the Song dynasty became Adjutant of the Palace Guard Armory in the twentieth year of the Yuanjia era 
He was ill for a while and felt anxious that he would not nd relief 
He always took refuge in the Buddha with sincerity
One night he dreamed that a man who looked like a holy man with a striking countenance granted him a small parcel and a razor from the top of a beam of the house saying Take this medicine use this razor and you will certainly recover from your illness Xi was surprised and woke up
Sure enough he found a razor and some medicine 
He immediately took the medicine and then became well
Xi renounced the world and was called Sengxiu
He passed away when he was over eighty years old The Lun family of Dongguan had two daughters
 In the rst year of the Yuanjia era of the Song dynasty the elder daughter was ten years old and the younger one was nine Their village was located in the Yue region which was a savage land
So they did not know about the Buddhist teaching
On the eighth day of the second month of that year both girls suddenly went missing
They returned three days later and spoke roughly that they had met the Buddha
On the fteenth day of the ninth month they again went missing and returned ten days later
They spoke foreign languages chanted sutras in Sanskrit and when they met a monk from the Western Region they spoke  and he understood
On the fteenth day of the rst month of the next year they disappeared again
A farmer working in a eld saw that they ascended into the sky on the wind
Their parents wept with sorrow and invoked spiritual beings aid
A month later they returned
They came back tonsured as nuns wearing Dharma robes and holding their shaved hair in their hands
said When we met the Buddha and bhikṣuṇīs said You will be my disciples due to relationships from your former existences Then he patted us on the head and our hair fell off
He gave us Dharma names
Fayuan for the elder daughter and Facai for the younger one
When we were sent back to home he said You should build a nunnery
You must give the Buddhist teaching  arrived at their house
Immediately they removed the altar for spiritual beings and built a nunnery where they performed worship and recited sutras every morning and evening
Every vecolored light appeared and oated over mountains
From this time on the girls became graceful and gentle in their movements and manners and their speech exactly conformed to the rules
Even the customs of the capital city were not above 
Regional inspectors such as Wei Lang and Kong Mo all welcomed them and admired their extraordinariness and so on Can and Kui  Introduction and Quoted Testimonies
We transmigrate in the three periods of existence going around in the six realms
Even if we possess spiritual intelligence there is no one who does not go through many places
Since nothing is xed in our natural dispositions there are those who are intelligent and those who are ignorant
Because the nature each one receives is distinct from that of others do good and do evil
They practice virtue Therefore they have can and kui
They do evil Consequently they have neither can nor kui
In the conventions of ordinary people however each one harbors delusions
If one has not been able to study the Way and remove  he should exert himself day and night and dedicate himself to learning can and kui In profound emptiness he excuses himself from this world as well as the netherworld
are ignorant from the beginning and do not know the highest truth
They come to act with delements and embrace multiple heavy delements
If they hope to avail themselves of a wholesome act and get rid of myriad nuisances they should expel and wash away serious confusion and be open clear clean and pure
Therefore the Great Sage attentively prevails with all the clergy and laypeople
Arhats who deeply feel can receive the title of a eld of merit at will
ramaṇas who revere kui assume the title of bhaikṣāka without bias
Bodhisattvas who advance to nonbeing concurrently have the ability to offer salvation 
rāvakas who retrogress have virtues with which to regulate themselves
Those who humiliate their teacher monks or who fail to live up to donors expectations are unworthy of traveling in the sovereigns land
If one has nothing with which to repay his parents kindness this matter is equal to breaking a bottle and its meaning is the same as scorching seeds
Also if a tāla tree has already been cut down how can it grow again
After a stone has been broken apart nothing can put the pieces back together in the end
Spirits always wipe out traces and cry We are evil ones The Tathāgata admonishes them saying You are not my disciples
You cannot become a eld of merit for the world How can spirits get the better of him and be worshiped
In a familiar example they hinder heavenly and human beings and in a farreaching example they obstruct the way of sages
If this sin is repeated what more can be said about it
Those who stay in the clergy are respectable and those who remain in the secular world would rather be delivered
Therefore once you lose your human body you will move  kalpa after kalpa
You will meet and use your original again you will return to the same and meet the original 
Now you must wash out the dust of your mind with the water of can and kui and taking the knife of expressing in your hands cut the net of what you hide
Ancient sages who revere kui deeply felt can for the merit of the future
They repent with the utmost sincerity thoroughly trace to the very source and come to the ultimate
When we look at all ordinary people and sages they equally respect the Buddhas thought
They regulate their minds and humble their thoughts as if they were inferior thoughts
If you have all faults in mind do not give rise to even a single thought and privately hide your mind
If you have all wholesomeness and always give rise to the intention to study briey explain this intention
This is what is called can and kui
As the Nirvāṇasūtra says
There are two wholesome elements that can save sentient beings
One is can and the other is kui
Can is to not commit a sin of ones own accord and kui is to teach others not to commit a sin
Can is to have a sense of shame inwardly oneself and kui is expressing it to others
Can is to feel ashamed before others while kui is to feel ashamed before heaven
These are called can and kui
One has can and kui and therefore he can be respectful to his parents and teachers
All clergy members and secular people as well as nonhuman beings can esteem the Three Treasures and exterminate all evil acts
Furthermore the Jiayan lun says
What is called wucan
The answer is
It is to not be ashamed of what one should be ashamed of to not prevent what can be prevented to not be virtuous and respectful and to not transmigrate in wholesome places
This is called wucan What is called wukui
It is to not be abashed at what one should be abashed at to not fear what one should fear and to not fear vices
Therefore it is called wukui
In addition to transmigrate in unwholesome places is called wucan
To not show fear of vices is called wukui
The terminology mentioned above when reversed are therefore called can and kui Moreover the Xin posha lun says
When sentient beings of the world see wucan they say it is wukui and when they see wukui they say it is wucan
Do not think that the essence of these two is one
 I would now like to demonstrate the differences of their essential natures and characteristics and to cause those who doubt this to attain an unfailing understanding
Question What differences are there between wucan and wukui
Answer In one of freedom no fear arises This is wucan
No fear is shown toward any vice This is wukui
Again in one of freedom there is no arising of fear This is wucan
In all vices fear is not shown This is wukui
Furthermore to be not respectful is wucan and to be not fearful is wukui
Moreover to not detest and despise delement is wucan
To not detest and despise evil deeds is wukui
Further to indulge in evildoing and yet not reect upon oneself is wucan and to indulge in evildoing and not feel ashamed toward others is wukui
Furthermore to indulge in evildoing and not have a sense of shame is wucan and to indulge in evildoing and be haughty and wayward is wukui
Moreover to commit a sin by oneself and not have a sense of shame is wucan and to commit a sin against others and not have a sense of shame is wukui
Again if one commits a sin against a small number of people and yet does not have a sense of shame this is wucan
If one commits a sin against a large crowd of people and does not have a sense of shame this is wukui
Furthermore if one commits a sin against sentient beings of evil realms and does not have a sense of shame this is wucan
If one commits a sin against sentient beings of good realms and does not have a sense of shame this is wukui
Further if one commits a sin against the ignorant and does not have a sense of shame this is wucan
If one commits a sin against the wise and does not have a sense of shame this is wukui
Again if one commits a sin against an inferior and does not have a sense of shame this is wucan
If one commits a sin against a superior and does not have a sin of shame this is wukui
Moreover if one commits a sin against those who remain householders and does not have a sense of shame this is wucan
If one commits a sin against those who have renounced the world and does not have a sense of shame this is wukui
Further if one commits a sin against those who are not his upādhyāya and ācārya and does not have a sense of shame this is wucan
If one commits a sin against his upādhyāya and ācārya and does not have a sense of shame this is wukui
Again if one does not feel ashamed of himself in the sight of heaven when he indulges in evildoing this is wucan
If one does not feel ashamed of himself in the sight of people when he indulges in evildoing this is wukui
Furthermore if one cannot be scolded and blamed in the matter of all evil causes this is wucan
If one cannot be loathed and feared in the matter of all evil effects this is wukui
Further the homogeneity of cause and effect in avarice is wucan
The homogeneity of cause and effect in ignorance is wukui
These are the differences between wucan and wukui
These two elements are merely bonds to the realm of desire and they are unwholesome
All unwholesome things are due to the functions of the mind
They everywhere comply with each other but only the selfnature is deducted Moreover the Yuqie lun says
What are wucan and wukui
They mean to inspect oneself or others but feel shame at nothing and then to intentionally violate the precepts and be unable to liberate oneself in accordance with the Dharma after the violation and to take pleasure in engaging in various kinds of conicts accusations disobedience and disputation
Furthermore the Yijiao jing says
Can is just like an iron hook
It can properly control peoples unlawfulness
Therefore bhikṣus should always practice can and kui and not neglect it for even a short time
If they leave behind can and kui they will lose all merits
For those who have kui there are wholesome things
If one does not have kui he is no different from birds and beasts
Again the zhidu lun says in verse Those who have entered the Way and practice can and kui Bless the sentient beings holding a bowl Why would they indulge in the dust of desire And sink in the ve feelings If one wearing armor and holding a sword and cane Sees his enemy and retreats by running  A timid person like this is Slighted and laughed at by all the people of the world A bhikṣu is one who begs for alms He shaves his head and puts on a kaṣāya If he is controlled by the horse of the ve feelings He will also be laughed at in this way
Moreover if just like a powerful highranking person He wears dress adorns himself And goes begging for clothing and food He will be laughed at by the multitude If a bhikṣu who has removed the beauty of ornaments And who disgures his appearance in order to regulate the mind Further seeks the pleasures of the desires He will also be laughed at in this way He has already given up the pleasures of the ve desires Abandoned them and does not pay attention to them Why would he still wish to obtain them Just as an ignorant person eats what he has vomited up A greedy person like this does not know to see the original vow Nor does he recognize beauty and ugliness He is wildly intoxicated with craving attachment  Can and kui is the teaching of respect All have already abandoned With virtuous and intelligent people are not intimate with And what ignorant and unintelligent people like to be close to All desires are suffering when one seeks And they are very dreadful when one obtains them When one loses them he bears depression and annoyance in his mind There is no happy time at all  All desires are troublesome like this How should you give them up If you attain the happiness of various meditations  Then you will not be deceived If you attach to the pleasure of the desires insatiably How can you wipe it out If you attain the contemplation on the impurity of the body This mind is spontaneously nothing Furthermore the Zhengfanian jing says
If you violate the precepts have many desires and do evil things you are not truly a śramaṇa
Even if you call yourself a śramaṇa you are just like a wild fox that disguised itself with a lions pelt or just like a spurious treasure that is empty within and holds nothing
Furthermore the zhuangyan lun says in verse Since you wear a motley robe You must cultivate yourself in the good Dharma With this garment you should be in nirvana You always think to regulate yourself to be exible and gentle Why do you wearing this robe Glare  with eyes opened wide Knit your eyebrows purse your cheeks together And make angry looks Anger is not suitable as a dwelling place For those who have renounced the world Grudges and hatred can be compared to a butchers cangue
Anger is really fear A house of meanness A seed of ugliness A companion of abusive language Raging ames that burn the grove of thoughts An act that indicates the evil realms The gate of conict dispute enmity and harm And the bed of an evil name  suddenly becomes the foundation of evil You must inspect yourself With the mark of those who have renounced the world Do your mind and appearance correspond to each other Or do they not correspond to each other The law of bhikṣus is To support themselves by begging alms from others Why do you eating donated by believers Give rise to serious anger While their food is in your stomach Why do you give rise to anger And come to snuff out the donations from believers This body is deled From its nine apertures lth is always discharged Its offensive odor and dirtiness are very detestable It is really a vessel of numerous sufferings This body is extremely humble It is the place where carbuncles gather If it is slightly touched  It gives rise to great distress The body is just like a target of an arrow When there is a target the arrow accordingly hits it When there is a body numerous sufferings are added When there is no body there is no suffering Mosquitoes gadies ies and poisonous insects All can sting and kill human beings You must diligently devote yourself to And maintain detachment from the body
Therefore you should know from what is recorded above that whether you are a monk or a layperson you must always be careful of yourself and see right mindfulness before your eyes
If you cannot understand even a small portion of the teaching you will give rise to haughtiness and you will not develop can and kui
Even though people like those in the four stages of sainthood  should not receive common retribution as human beings they will still receive individual retribution
Therefore the Xianyu jing talks about those such as Aṅgulimāla
Because he killed nine hundred and ninetynine people even though he met the Buddha and became an arhat he stayed in his room where the re of hell came out of pores of his skin and he was extremely distressed in pain not to mention ordinary people who are outside of enlightenment and who have not given rise to the mind to correctly remove 
According to how you perform one act it determines whether or not you will fall into the three evil realms
It is really difcult to obtain a human body
If you encounter evil causes and conditions then you will easily lose 
Because evil ourishes while wholesomeness is scarce one will have a hundred or a thousand evil thoughts and not one wholesome thought in a day
Furthermore the Jingdu sanmei jing  says
 Demerits and merits pile up against each other and they are often distinct
Later we will receive retributions or rewards for these demerits or merits
No one will avoid it
By one thought one receives a body
By a good thought one receives a body in heaven and the realm of human beings
By an evil thought one receives a body in the three evil realms
By a hundred thoughts one receives a hundred bodies
By a thousand thoughts one receives a thousand bodies
If one plants the root of transmigration of birth and death for even a single day and night he will later receive eight hundred and fty million miscellaneous kinds of bodies
If in a lifetime of a hundred years one plants a sapling for his next existences he will receive so many bodies It is hard to count them
His transient spirit complying with what he has planted will receive forms throughout the trichiliocosm bodies bones skin and hair are all over the trichiliocosm There is no space without them
Moreover the Pusa chutai jing ie Pusa cong doushutian jiang shenmutai shuo guangpu jing T  says in verse
From innumerable kalpas ago I have transmigrated in the path of birth and death Giving up one body and receiving another again I have not left behind the law of existence Counting what I have gone through I remember one life but not others I solely become a body of a white dog My accumulated bones ll Mount Sumeru If sharp needles were planted on the earth Every needle would pierce my body Not to mention those of motley dogs Whose number is innumerable Therefore I regulate my mind In order not to be greedy and selfindulgent Moreover the Tiwei jing says
 It is just as if someone were to hang a tiny thread from the top of Mount Sumeru while down below another person holds a needle to thread  and between them is a whirlpool of mist and a violent wind blows
It would be extremely difcult for the thread to go through the eye of the needle
To obtain a human body is exceedingly more difcult than this
Again in the Pusa chutai jing the Worldhonored One says in verse
A blind tortoise and a hole in a oating piece of wood Can still often happen to encounter each other Once a person loses his life It is difcult to recover even after a hundred million kalpas Seawater lies deep and vast Three hundred thirtysix fathoms If a pin were thrown into the sea And you sought for it you would still be able to get it Once you lose your human life It is more difcult to recover than  Furthermore the Dazhuangyan lun says in verse
It is also difcult to leave behind all difculties It is difcult to obtain a human body If you can already leave behind all hardships You must be continuously diligent in  I formerly heard that there was a little boy
A sutra ie the Za ahan jing T  says A blind tortoise happens the hole of a oating piece of wood
This matter is very difcult At that time the boy intentionally bored a hole in a wooden board through which he could put his head
He threw the board into a pond and then himself entered the pond
Lowering his head and then raising his head  he hoped to rise up through the hole 
Because the wooden board was drifting about in the water he could not do it
He then pondered to himself and gave rise to extreme loathsomeness
A human body is difcult to obtain
The Buddha explained it using the simile of the ocean
A hole in a oating piece of wood is small and a blind tortoise has no eyes
It may happen once in a hundred years
It is truly difcult to be able to happen 
Now in my case the pond is small and the hole in the wooden board is large
In addition I have both eyes  Even if I were to raise my head out a hundred times a day I would still be unable to happen how much less would a blind tortoise happen to do it Then he said in verse The great sea is extremely vast The hole in a oating piece of wood is moreover small It happens once in a hundred years It is very difcult to be able to meet Now in my case the water in the pond is but a small amount And the hole in the oating piece of wood is extremely large I often raise my head out Yet I am unable to encounter the hole in the wood The blind tortoise encounters the oating piece wood It is very difcult that both meet each other To recover a human body from the evil realms Is also as difcult as this I now happen a human body I must not be indolent There are buddhas as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River I have not been able to meet yet Today I can inquire and receive The words of the Worldhonored One of the ten powers The wondrous Dharma spoken by the Buddha I must learn and practice If I am able to learn it well Salvation from suffering will be extremely great It is not that I can obtain what other people have made Therefore I will make effort If I fall into the eight difculties How can I leave that condition behind Karma made in the world follows us And we will fall into the evil realms We must now run away from them And be able to leave the prison of the three transmigratory existences If I do not get out of this prison How will I attain liberation There are various different in the realm of animals To go through a kalpa is an extremely long time In hell and in the realm of hungry ghosts It is dark and the miseries there are deep If I do not study diligently How can I leave behind The dangers of all the evil realms Today I obtain a human body I have not exhausted the extremity of suffering I have not left behind the prison of the three transmigratory existences I must diligently practice with expedient means I will surely leave behind the prison of the three transmigratory existences Now I seek to renounce the world I will certainly attain liberation Furthermore the Zuiye baoying jing ie Zuiye yingbao jiaohua diyu jing T
 says in verse
Running water does not run permanently Raging re does not burn for a long time The sun rises and must set in a moment The moon after becoming full wanes again Those who are dignied honored outstanding and noble are more impermanent than these
Therefore you should know that the human body is difcult to encounter and easy to lose
Since it is easy to lose you must not become attached to life
You should know that the human body is approaching death every moment just like a hog or sheep being led to an abattoir
Accordingly the Nirvāṇasūtra says
Observe this life
It is always haunted by immeasurable illwill and grudges
It decreases every moment and there is no increase
It can be compared to raging water that cannot stop and also to drops of morning dew that do not last for a long time or to a convict who is heading toward the marketplace  approaching death step by step
Moreover the Moye jing says in verse
For instance it is just as a caṇdāla Drives cattle to an abattoir approach the jaws of death step by step Human life passes even faster than this Since the time of the Great Sage the essence has not yet been completely claried
Even though we partially realize nonarising we still transmigrate because of the three characteristics of phenomenal things  not to mention ordinary ignorant people who are far from the pure realm in the ultimate principle of the universe
Wholesomeness and unwholesomeness are disordered mixed and not clearly separate from each other
How can we avoid a fault due to delement or a loss due to attachment
Now when we hear the virtue of renouncing the world and entering the Way it cannot be said that  have no evil
When we hear of the faults of laypeople and those who remain householders we must not that they do not have any wholesomeness at all
If one internally cultivates practice then he will have virtue just like that of those who have renounced the world
If one internally goes against faith he will become a monk in vain
Those who remain householders have various dependents and public as well as private troubles
In providing for and treating with what they need they should not be stingy
ramaṇas abide by pure conduct and are solely independent
They require only the three kinds of robes and the six kinds of necessities for living or in an extreme case only one item from each category of the numerous necessities for monks
They shut themselves off from the conditions of the external world Why is it necessary for them to save up 
the sutras and Vinayas completely denounce this and it is claried in the sacred teachings
If are stingy with the wealth of the Dharma and do not give it to ignorant and poor people they do not accumulate intelligence and then they will lose the seed of buddhahood
Consequently even a minor offense is still a cause for great fear
They should always be modest respectful and deferential to both their elders and juniors
They must not be conceited and disrespectful to their predecessors
If they commit a great offense possess extensive livestock farmland and houses if they undeservedly store up or assiduously engage in secular business these are all prescribed as heinous offenses
It is unnecessary to explain this further
I now briey mention people of mediocre level and below
They are not well educated and have only supercial knowledge
Yet they think they surpass others in intelligence and give rise to great arrogance boast of their appearance offend and disdain all other people and lump heaven and earth together
They sit before their teachers stretching out both legs  or they revile someone near an esteemed one
The Way is originally harmonious and those who are obedient are monks
If mind and appearance already go against each other how can they become members of the sangha Treasures
Some exclusively read nonBuddhist texts amuse themselves the qin or playing qi  or they recite the Book of Odes and the Book of History  They spend their time in vain Buddhism is the Dharma medicine
Saving sentient beings is urgent
The literature is profound its principle is deep and its expression is splendid mysterious and abundant
If we can understand even one sentence we will develop it into immeasurable meanings
There are several thousands of fascicles of old and new sutras and discourses
Formerly I did not investigate or pick up the meaning of even a single sentence
NonBuddhist texts were not an urgent matter I diligently studied day and night
I was afraid laypeople would laugh at my ignorance I did not study worldly books
What would one think if I could not answer when a secular person asks me about the meaning of a sutra
If I continue Buddhism while being unfamiliar with nonBuddhist teachings this is not enough for me to be ashamed of myself If I continue Buddhism without understanding Buddhism my shame would be more serious
It is truly because our time is the last and decadent Dharma Human life hurriedly transmigrates
Impermanence is very close to us We fail to plan in the morning even for that very evening
I am afraid that once we enter dark paths it is difcult to come out of them for successive kalpas
Even if we encounter the Buddhist Dharma again we will think that we have no means by which to learn it
If we have some sutras and Vinayas studying nonBuddhist teachings is  to subdue the nonBuddhist Way
This is of the highest class
A wise man says First we are versed in the Buddhist teaching and concurrently we come to know nonBuddhist teachings
we can make a remonstrant argument as sharp as the tip of a lance and utter words related to authority
Those who are well versed in both Buddhist and nonBuddhist teachings are worthy of being skilled teachers
Those who can follow what the sutras say come to subdue the nonBuddhist Way
Now we measure ourselves and contact phenomenal objects incompetently
Our consciousness is continually covered up ignorant simple and dark
We have nothing on which to rely in order to save ourselves What is able to save sentient beings
Form and scent are not in common with each other How do you distinguish beans from wheat
I pray to retreat examine and study for myself
Therefore the Nirvāṇasūtra says The Buddha told all the bhikṣus Those who have renounced the world should cultivate wisdom by studying the Buddhist teaching and make insistent effort to nd out in sutras
They must not open and read nonBuddhist books such as those of the Lokāyatika school
They always stay out in the hills and valleys in quiet places or in meditation rooms cultivate in meditation recite sutras worshiping the Buddha cut off wrong and manifest rightness
These are what you fundamentally respect  Moreover the Shujia jing says
 ukaTodeyyaputra a brahmans son addressed the Buddha If laypeople who stay at home can practice meritorious virtue and good deeds they surpass those who have renounced the world
How is this so The Buddha replied I do not have a denite answer for this
Some of those who have renounced the world do not cultivate good deeds
Accordingly they are not better than those who remain householders
If those who remain householders can practice  then they surpass those who have renounced the world  In addition the sanqian weiyi says
Regarding the duties performed by those who have renounced the world rst is meditation second is recitation of the written Dharma in sutras and third is to convert people and advise them to donate 
If one completely conducts these three activities that monk follows the for those who have renounced the world
If he does not he will live and die in vain
He has only the cause to suffer from sin
Furthermore the Baiyu jing says
Formerly there was an incident of a person who used re and cold water 
Attending the re he put water into a washbowl and placed it on the re
Later he wished to take the re but all the ames had been extinguished
He wished to take the cold water but the water ended up hot
Both the re and the cold water were lost
People of the world enter the Buddhist Dharma renounce the world and seek the Way
They have already renounced the world yet they still miss their wives and children and the pleasures of the ve desires
Because of this they lose the re of their meritorious virtue and concurrently they lose the water of observance of the precepts
Those who long for desires are also just like this
Moreover the Nirvāṇasūtra 
The Buddha said After my nirvana some of my śrāvaka disciples will be ignorant violate the precepts cherish life ght reject the twelve kinds of scriptures read and recite various kinds of books compositions hymns and literary works of nonBuddhist teachings receive livestock or other impure things and they will say that these are all allowed by the Buddha
People like this will exchange good sandalwood for earthenware or wood gold for brass silver for pewter silk for coarse woolen cloth or nectar for evil poison Moreover the Yijiao jing says
Daytime is when you study and learn good things with a diligent mind and nothing causes you to lose them
During the rst and last parts of the nighttime do not lie down
In the middle part of the night recite sutras and sleep according to your wish
Do not allow yourself to spend your entire life in vain and to have nothing to attain through the cause and condition of sleeping 
Following this practice of the Way you can attain the śramaṇas four fruits of sainthood leading to highest wisdom
One who practices like this is worthy of being a master and a truly good eld of merit and can accept donations from laypeople
Again the piposha lun says
Just as when someone the sun his vision is not clear the wisdom eye used when one ponders and seeks nonBuddhist writings and discussions is not clear
Just as when someone looks at the moon and his vision is clear the wisdom eye used when one ponders and seeks the sutras and discourses of the Buddhist Dharma is clear
If we ponder and seek nonBuddhist or secular matters just like beating a rhesus monkey we only produce impurity
If we ponder and seek the Buddhist Dharma just like tempering true gold the more we temper the purer we will become
Furthermore the Pusa shanjie jing says
Of bodhisattvas those who neither read nor recite the Tathāgatas true sutras but who read and recite worldly books literature hymns writings or annotations commit an offense
Those who do not commit this offense can correct a wrong view if they enter into an argument
Take twothirds from the Buddhist scriptures and onethird from nonBuddhist scriptures
Because one knows that nonBuddhist scriptures are deceptive and wild teachings while the Buddhist Dharma is true
Because one knows worldly matters and therefore he is not disrespected by the people of the world
By this composition it is testied that if a person who studies the Buddhist Dharma once rejects the Buddhist teaching and seeks nonBuddhist teachings then he has committed a sin
If a person understands the principle and practices it he will quickly learn and subdue the nonBuddhist Way
He still must have revulsion for and renounce  To engage in advanced studies of Buddhist deeds causes him to increase his excellence
If he becomes attached only to one side he ruins the true Dharma
Therefore the dichi lun says
If a bodhisattva says at the Buddhas place I will give up and not study and will learn only wrong discussions of nonBuddhist teachings and worldly scriptures this is called committing numerous offenses
This is the offense of giving rise to delements
If the sharpest person can promptly receive learning he will attain the immovable wisdom
If daily or monthly he receives twothirds of his learning from the Buddhist Dharma and onethird from nonBuddhist books this is called a nonoffense
If he is interested in and happy with worldly books the nonBuddhist Way or paganism and neither rejects them nor thinks to reject them this is called committing numerous offenses
This is the offense of giving rise to delements
Verses say A fox in winter has abundant fur The string of a cocoon in spring is light silk
As the body changes one becomes distressed As the mind and consciousness turn back one deceives oneself At the age of shedding milk teeth I sang a song while drumming on my belly Formerly when I was young I drove a carriage following a man of chivalrous spirit And I poured wine while playing with a seductive charming girl I thought only of the pleasing things before my eyes How could I know of the sorrows of my next existence Once I felt prudently ashamed of this I left all attachments behind eternally I wish to discern the foundation of truth and falsity Then impurity and purity will spontaneously separate from each other I am ashamed of stagnating under the ve coverings How can I know are the same as the four reliances  Encouragement and Guidance Introduction Quoted Testimonies Giving Rise to Faith and Karma and Cause The noble and the humble are not constant rich and poor have no xed 
It can be compared to that water and re alternately become intense or that coldness and heat arise in turn
Accordingly we see wealthy people whose rooms are warm who have abundant clothing and enough food and who make a living without having to do hard labor These all spontaneously come to them
On the other hand we see those in poverty and hardship starving and exhausted by corve labor
They run about seeking from the early morning when they wake up until nighttime when they go to bed
Because of this their bodies are damaged and worn out and their hearts are troubled
Even if they obtain something it is scattered and lost in many ways
They wish all day long to have abundant wealth but they have never been even for a short time
Because of this suffering consequently I exhort and encourage you to exert yourselves to be kind enough to donate and I earnestly encourage you to do good deeds
If furthermore there are those whose garments necessary utensils and amusing things are all attractive splendid beautiful and clean the energy of the full cycle of the seasons properly rotates in order cold and warm repeats
The four seasons change each follows what awaits it without fail
In addition we see there are a lessthanonechi cloth or tattered silk fabrics as long as one zhang
They are lthy and dark covered with dirt they stink and are greasy decayed and rotten
They do not know of a hemp garment in the scorching heat of summer or silk or cotton fabric the ice and snow of winter
Or their bodies are covered by nothing both men and women are naked in mixed company This is not only shameful they also feel very ashamed of themselves
If you see such hardship how can you not keep away from it
Consequently I exhort and encourage you to exert yourselves to do good deeds
You should give clothing as well as houses to them
How can you not see that all other people have while you alone have nothing
Therefore you must be brave and erce in cultivation and learning
If moreover there are those who eat sweet things and are also offered rare delicacies and fully praise them small tables are put together and seat mats cover the oor
Aromatic tasty goodsmelling and fragrant are arranged in a line
On the other hand there are those for whom even a meal of plain brown rice is insufcient and a coarse soup is always lacking
For a long time there have been neither salt nor plums and both sh and vegetables have been lacking
Or such people can eat only on alternate days they have only porridge and rice bran again and again which are mixed with fruit or to which greens are added
They are weak fatigued and seriously in danger but they do not possess the right method to save themselves
If you see such hardship how can you not keep away from it
Consequently I exhort and encourage you to exert yourselves to do good deeds
You should give drink and food as well as mixed starches How would it be possible that all other people have sufcient while you alone have only hardship
Therefore you must be brave and erce in cultivating and learning
If again there are those of honorable rank who achieve prominence in ofcial positions who ride on wellfed horses wearing light garments and who act freely as they desire wherever they go heavenly and human beings look up to them and when they stop the spirits treat them with respect
On the other hand we see mean low and vulgar people who are not even spoken of
When they are born no one knows of their birth and when they die no one knows of their death
They exist on the side of a ditch full of mud and coals they hope to be sitting and lying about in loam
Even though they have loud voices with which to scold  they invite the suffering of being beaten
They are not respected by spirits and are also harmed by dogs
If you see such hardship how can you not keep away from it
Consequently I exhort and encourage you to exert yourselves to do good deeds
You should exterminate arrogance and uphold and practice modesty and courtesy
How could it be possible that other people are always of a noble class while you are always living in a lowly way
Therefore you must be brave and erce in cultivating and learning
In addition if there are those who have decent features and who speak the wind blows they always keep in mind to extensively benet 
They are benevolent with universal love and their words do not cause harm to others
On the other hand there are those who have ugly boils on their faces and whose words are mean and cruel
They know only how to benet themselves and do not consider others
Because other people bear with them they consequently attain victory but because many people become enraged with them they consequently invite evils
If you see such hardship how can you not keep away from it
Consequently I exhort and encourage you to exert yourselves to do good deeds
You should exterminate anger and uphold and practice forbearance
How could you cause other people to always achieve the place of excellence while you keep yourself eternally apart from the pure condition
Therefore you must be brave and erce in cultivating and learning
Moreover if there are those whose possess strong willpower and who seldom become ill they always sustain practice of the Way without hindrance
On the other hand there are those who are emaciated and distressed and are frequently ill They lose their vigor
Every time they move their troubles increase They are uneasy whether sleeping or sitting
If you see such evils you really had better go far away from them
Consequently I exhort and encourage you to exert yourselves to do good deeds
You should give them medicine and provide relief for them at any time
How is it possible that some people never have sickness or fatigue while you are eternally in a stagnant state
Therefore you must be brave and erce in cultivating and learning
All is just like this matter
I truly and strongly urge you 
If I do not urge you in this way I am not diligent as those who study 
As the Nirvāṇasūtra says Staying at home is just like prison
Ones wife and children are like shackles
Property is like a heavy burden
Relatives are like enemies  You however are able to receive and hold fast to the pure precepts for even a day and night circumambulate a buddha image chanting a sutra during the six periods of the day  and also to have the three purication months a year as well as the six purication days a month
Vegetables are moderately seasoned
You check on yourself bodily verbally and mentally not letting yourself go to other things
You focus your attention on leaving secular life and highly admire the Buddhist Dharma
There is nothing decient in your bending and lifting of the head and you have nothing to lose in sitting and lying 
Darkness is connected to the bright phase In the daytime you think of the pure Dharma deeply respect śramaṇas and benet secular people with a mind of compassion
If you can do things like these even if you remain a householder it is possible to cross over suffering Thus a sutra says
 the Buddhist Dharma is about to be exhausted laypeople protect the Dharma
If they cultivate wholesomeness they will rise up and be reborn in heaven as a snowake falling through the air
If a bhikṣu violates the precepts he will fall into evil realms just as rain falls from the sky
You must know that when you do good deeds while experiencing hardship those good deeds are the greatest if you commit a sin while in a state of happiness that sin is not minor
Therefore if you enter happiness from hardship you have not known  happiness in happiness
If you go into hardship from happiness you know hardship in hardship
This saying is provable
It is my earnest hope that you will understand it
Moreover the Faju jing says in verse There is no greater heat than licentiousness
There is no stronger poison than anger There is no more intense suffering than a body There is no greater happiness than extinction  The Buddha after speaking this verse said to all the bhikṣus In the remotest past when there were innumerable worlds there was a bhikṣu who possessed the ve supernatural powers
His name was Atibalavīryaparākrama 
 Staying under a tree on the mountain he quietly and peacefully sought the Way
At that time there were four birds and beasts that always attained peace by relying on him and staying by his side
First was a dove second was a crow third was a venomous serpent and last was a deer
These four animals went out to seek food in the daytime and in the evening they came back to stay overnight 
One night the four animals asked each other Among the suffering of the world what is considered to be the most serious The crow said Hunger and thirst are the most serious suffering
When we are hungry and thirsty our bodies become weak everything we see goes black and our consciousness is not at ease
We throw ourselves into a net and ignore  the sharp points and edges of weapons
There is no other reason than this for us to lose our life
Because of this I would say that hunger and thirst should be considered the suffering The dove said Licentious desire is the most serious suffering
If sexual desires are vigorous we care about nothing else
There is no other reason except than this for us to be in danger and lose our life The venomous serpent said Anger is the most serious suffering
Once we give rise to a malicious intention we no longer have scruples about closeness and remoteness
We may kill a person or commit suicide as well The deer said Fear is the most serious suffering
While I am in the forests and elds I am continually afraid and cautious
I dread hunters and all ravenous and cruel beasts If I hear any sound of them I quickly throw myself into a hole in the ground or onto the bank of a river
Even a mother and her fawns give up each other and palpitate with terror from the bottoms of their hearts
Because of this I would say that fear is the suffering The bhikṣu heard and responded to them
What you have discussed is merely the tail 
You have not investigated thoroughly the foundation of suffering
In the suffering of the world there is nothing more than having a body
The body is the vessel of suffering in which anxiety and fear are immeasurable
For this reason I gave up the secular world to study the Way
I uproot my intentions cut off my thoughts and do not covet the four great elements I wish to destroy the foundation of suffering
I maintain my ambition nirvana Accordingly we know having a body is the great foundation of suffering
Therefore a book says that there is no greater trouble than having a body
 As the Naxian biqiu wenfo jing says
At that time King Milinda asked an arhat called Nāgasena Bhikṣu  a man does evil when he lives in the world
When he becomes a hundred years old and is about to die if he thinks of the Buddha he will be reborn in heaven after his death
I do not believe these words
Moreover it is said that if one destroys life when he dies he will enter hell
I do not believe this either Nāgasena Bhikṣu asked the king If someone were to place a pebble he holds onto the surface of water will the pebble oat The king replied No
The pebble sinks Nāgasena asked If he has a hundred large pieces of slate and puts them on a boat will the boat sink The king answered No it will not Nāgasena said A hundred large pieces of slate on a boat will not sink because of the boat
Even if someone possesses great evil if he thinks of the Buddha even for a moment because of this he will not enter hell and will be reborn in heaven
Why do you not believe this
The case where the pebble sinks is just like the case of a person who does evil without knowing Buddhist sutras will enter hell after he dies
Why do you not believe this The king said Good
Good Nāgasena Bhikṣu continued Suppose two people die at the same time and one of them is reborn in the heaven ruled by Brahma  while the other is reborn in the state of Kaśmīra
Even though there is a great distance between these two people when each dies they both reach  in an instant
It is just as when a pair of ying birds one of which perches on a high tree and the other on a low tree yet when the two birds y away together at the same time their shadows reach the ground at the same time Nāgasena Bhikṣu said If an ignorant person does evil he will have great misfortune
If a wise person does evil he will have only minor misfortune This is like the case in which a heated iron is placed on the ground
one person knows that it is heated iron but another does not both people pick up at the same time but the hands of the person who did not know are heavily burned while those of the one who did know this are only lightly burned
Doing evil is also like this
An ignorant person cannot repent by himself therefore his misfortune becomes heavy
A wise person does evil yet he knows he should not have done so
Everyday he is penitent therefore he has only minor misfortune Furthermore the Sipin xue jing says
Among ordinary people some are not as good as animals
Among animals some are better than human beings
What is the reason for this
Those who do not stop committing sin enter hell after they die
They become hungry ghosts only when their punishment is over
After punishment of hungry ghosts they are reborn as animals
After punishment of animals they come back to human status
Therefore they nish their punishment in of animals and only then they are able to become human beings
For this reason you should do good admire the teaching of the Three Revered Ones leave behind the three evil realms for a long time receive bliss as a heavenly and human being and later attain liberation for a long time
What is more the Sishierzhang jing says
The Buddha said There are ve difculties in the world
the difculty of making donations faced by povertystricken people the difculty in learning the Way faced by wealthy and distinguished people the difculty in controlling life in order not to die the difculty of being able to see Buddhist scriptures and the difculty of being reborn in the world where the Buddha resides Moreover the Za piyu jing says
There are eighteen matters as serious difculties in the world
First is the difculty of happening to be in the world where the Buddha resides second is the difculty of being able to be a human being even if one meets the Buddha third is the difculty of being reborn in the Middle Kingdom even if one becomes a human being fourth is the difculty of being reborn in the gotra family even if one resides in the Middle Kingdom  fth is the difculty of being completely possessed of four limbs and six sense organs even if one is in the gotra family sixth is the difculty of obtaining wealth even if one has four limbs and six sense organs seventh is the difculty of meeting a good virtuous friend or teacher who leads one to the Buddhist Way even if he obtains wealth eighth is the difculty of being endowed with wisdom even if he obtains a good virtuous friend or teacher ninth is the difculty of possessing a wholesome mind even if one attains wisdom tenth is the difculty of being able to donate even if one attains a wholesome mind eleventh is the difculty of intending to obtain a versatile good and virtuous person even if he can donate twelfth is the difculty of going to the place where the versatile good and virtuous person is even if one obtains him thirteenth is the difculty of getting a proper chance even if one goes to that place fourteenth is the difculty of being able to receive and listen to the speech even if one gets a proper chance fteenth is the difculty of attaining the wisdom to correctly understand even if one listens to the speech sixteenth is the difculty of being able to receive the profound teaching even if he can understand seventeenth is the difculty of being able to practice in accordance with the speech even if one receives the profound teaching and eighteenth is the difculty of being able to testify to the sacred fruition even if he receives the profound teaching and practices in accordance with the speech
These are the eighteen matters of difculties
The Foshuo taizi shuahu jing says
King Ajātaśatrus crown prince called Subāhu addressed the Buddha  Through what cause and condition does a bodhisattva obtain a beautiful countenance
Through what cause and condition is he reborn transformed in lotus owers without entering a womans womb
Through what cause and condition can he know about former existences The Buddha told the crown prince Since can be forbearing he is goodlooking

Reconcile people with one another when you see that they are ghting and make them happy
Because of this you will later be reborn as a human being who cannot experience separation Again  Through what cause and condition can obtain wealth and not lose it
Again through what cause and condition can never be robbed by others
Moreover through what cause and condition can achieve an esteemed lofty position The Buddha replied to the crown prince If one does not covet other peoples wealth because of this he will be wealthy and happy
If he is fond of making donations and not stingy because of this he will not lose his property
If he is not jealous because of this he will attain an esteemed lofty position at rebirth Again  Through what cause and condition can attain the divine eye and clairvoyance

Miracle Stories Regarding Zhu Changshu of the Jin dynasty his ancestors are from Central Asia
His family had property through successive generations they were wealthy
The Zhu family moved their residence to Luoyang during the Yuan kang era of the Jin dynasty Changshu believed in the Dharma wholeheartedly
He was particularly fond of reciting the Sutra on Avalokiteśvara 
Later his neighbor accidentally caused a re
Changshus house was entirely strawthatched and furthermore it was exactly leeward of the re
estimated that since the re was already so close to his house even if he tried to take out some household effects almost nothing would survive
He then ordered his family not to carry anything out on a cart
No one tried to extinguish the re by pouring water onto it they all simply chanted the sutra with sincerity
After a while the re burned up the neighbors house Changshus house at the distance of the bamboo fence the wind suddenly shifted
The re stopped just at the edge of house
At that time everyone thought this was a miracle
In the village there were four or ve frivolous and cunning boys
They ridiculed  saying The wind happened to shift
What kind of divine work would this be
Lets wait for a dry night and burn that house down
If it cannot be burned we will accept  After that when the weather was very dry and the wind rose up and howled the boys secretly got together and made torches which they threw onto the roof of house
They threw a lit torch three times and every time the ames of the torch died out
They were then greatly frightened and all ran back home
The next morning they all went together to Changshus house
They confessed what they had done the day before bowed their heads to the ground and apologized
Changshu replied I do not have supernatural powers at all
I just recite Avalokiteśvara It must be due to the help of awesome spiritual powers
Boys you should reform yourselves and take the path of believing in  From that time on all the people in the neighboring villages and local communities particularly revered 
Xing Huaiming of the Song dynasty was a man from Hejian 
He was the Adjutant GeneralinChief of the Song dynasty
He once followed Zhu Xiuzhi Governor of Nanjun  in an expedition to the north were all captured by the enemy
They then tried to catch the enemy off guard so they could all escape and go back
They traveled at night and did not move in the daytime
Three days passed but they were still afraid of their pursuers
So they sent out a man beforehand to observe the enemy scouts
Several days passed but the man had not yet returned
One evening in the darkness under the threat of rain the man who had been sent out suddenly returned at daybreak
He said in surprise A while ago I saw from a distance that the light from the campre was very bright so I dashed over here
After arriving however it is instead quite dark Xiu and other people were surprised and startled by this
Huaiming believed in the Dharma from early on
Since the time he went on the expedition he always placed the Sutra on Avalokiteśvara his head and never stopped reciting it
That evening he was reciting 
Everyone wondered if the supernatural power of the sutra
Thereafter they always also offered prayers 
Consequently they were able to escape from and they resided in the capital city
In the seventeenth year of the Yuanjia era  a śramaṇa visited Huai ming and said I see that particularly on this lane and in your house there is a bloody vapor lling the air
You should relocate in order to avoid it After saying this he left
Huaiming saw him off
As went out of the gate he disappeared
felt very displeased
Twenty days later Zhang Jingxiu neighbor injured his father and killed his fathers concubine
Huaiming thought that this was a sign of the bloody vapor and prayed that all would be well
At that time adjoined those of Liu Bin and Liu Jingwen and they all lived on the same lane
It is said that in that year all the people were considered to be partisans of Liu Zhan and they were punished with death
 Wang Qiu of the Song dynasty whose pseudonym is Shuda was a man from Taiyuan 
He was the Governor of Fuling  but in the ninth year of the Yuanjia era he had failed to defend his prefecture and was put in prison
Since then he was shackled with heavy chains
Qiu had earlier practiced vegetarianism and from the time he was imprisoned he was especially careful about his diet
There were more than one hundred people in the prison and most were starving Qiu shared every meal with others
Every day he observed the precept of not eating after noon and thought of Avalokiteśvara with sincerity
One night he had a dream in which he ascended a raised seat and saw a śramaṇa who gave him a onefascicle sutra
The title of the sutra was The was given together with all the bodhisattvas names Qiu took in hand opened it and read it
He forgot the rst bodhisattvas name but the second was Avalokiteśvara and the third was Mahāsthāmaprāpta Furthermore he saw one wheel of a vehicle
The śramaṇa said This is the wheel of the ve realms When Qiu woke up all the chains came off
He realized that this was due to supernatural powers He concentrated his attention on the prayer more and more
Because of this he was able to refasten the chains by himself
Three days later he was pardoned for his offense Speaker and Audience Introduction Quoted Testimonies Rites and Violation of the Dharma
The remaining ve parts of this The signicance of relationships between a teacher and his disciples is valued and the wisdom cultivated by studying is distinctive
Cultivating by righteousness adjusting ones actions and being erudite are wholesome
Therefore Aśvaghoṣa saved the large rope that was about to be cut and Nāgārjuna imparted large and small volumes of debates The wheel tracks of wisdom are evident
Pure expositions have been outstandingly put forth
Those who have faith can completely understand the names and numbers  numerous trainings and longstanding doubts
On the other hand to learn and to not speak are the concerns of Con fucius  while to not understand meanings is what ākyamuni admonishes against
Therefore sūtra says Worshiping the Dharma surpasses all worship  Consequently a nonBuddhist scripture says A good man is a teacher for a bad man A bad man is a help for a good man  If you receive statement without disobedience truth exceeds the storehouse of your feelings
If you listen to as stated and yet go against the foundation is rare it is difcult to remove hardships by explaining about the contradictions between various teachings
On this account once the Xiang  is entirely lost then the hexagrams will fail
Once you lose words you will suffer misfortune for successive kalpas
Therefore it is known that the transmission of the Dharma is not easy and receiving and following is extremely difcult
It is truly because we are apart from the Sage as time goes by the sublime words have gradually become obscure
It is also a difcult practice to rmly receive every statement 
Be wary of being concerned about fame and wealth and of hardship to purify deled feelings The Zhong lun says in verse
It is difcult for an audience to obtain The true Dharma and a speaker Therefore if things are like this The transmigration of birth and death is neither nite nor innite Moreover the Shidi lun says
Since both speaker and audience do not conform to the Dharma each of them has two faults
One is the fault of not speaking equally and the other is the fault that the Buddha does not feel happy 
Therefore the daji jing says in verse
If all sentient beings have no capacity to receive the Dharma The Tathāgata then cultivates nonattachment Sets up great expedient means and waits for a ripe opportunity to come This is because he causes them to attain true liberation The Dazhuangyan lun says in verse You attain realization following that you hear
If you have not yet heard it then exercise caution and do not slander Without hearing more than immeasurable things Disparaging will result in acts of folly The baoxing lun says in verse The ignorant and the selfconceited Are fond of practicing the lesser teaching
If they slander the Dharma and Dharma teachers They will be scolded in a loud voice by all buddhas Even though they may externally show a dignied mien They do not know the Tathāgatas teaching If they slander the Dharma and Dharma teachers They will be scolded in a loud voice by all buddhas I now see young laypeople and clergy in the beginning stage of learning 
They start with delusions
In regard to the meaning of a text they give rise to thoughts of selfsatisfaction
Relying on themselves they try to tower over others and shift humiliation onto others
Accordingly the Dichi lun says
 There are ve kinds of faults of taking the meanings in following texts
First is to believe incorrectly second is to retrogress in making heroic effort third is to delude sentient beings fourth is to slight the Dharma and fth is to libel the Dharma
Even one who can preach the Dharma still has delement in mind not to mention the question that listeners can give rise to faith
If he preaches the Dharma with a pure mind even if the transmigration of birth and death he transforms nirvana
On the other hand if he preaches with a deluded mind even if nirvana he transforms the transmigration of birth and death
Furthermore the Nirvāṇasūtra says The Mahayana is nectar
It is also called a poisonous drug
If it can eliminate  then it is nectar but if it cannot it becomes a poisonous drug
It is just like how putting a man into poisonous milk can kill him
 Therefore the Baoxing lun says in verse
 If one has neither knowledge nor a wholesome consciousness Bad friends will damage his right practice a spider falls into milk The milk is poisonous Moreover the shilun jing says
If caṇdāla people who belong to the kṣatriya class see those who have renounced the world relying on my Dharma from śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to the Dharma teacher who peaches the Mahayana teaching  and if they slander revile disgrace or deceive the true Dharma and interrupt the cultivation and confuse the mind of the Dharma teacher because of these causes and conditions they will fall into Avīci Hell
If you see one who has renounced the world relying on my Dharma and you frequently direct anger toward that person and revile and disgrace the Dharma I expound unwilling to faithfully receive it if you destroy a stupa resident priests quarters or temple buildings or if you kill a bhikṣu all the good deeds you had previously made will be completely wiped out
When you are about to die your four limbs and the joints of your bones will all ache as acutely as if they are being burned by re
Your tongue will be as if fastened and bound and you will be unable to speak for many days
After you die you will fall into Avīci Hell As the sanqian weiyi says
There are ve issues at the time of ascending the upper seat to chant a sutra
First must rst worship the Buddha second he must worship the Dharma of the sutra and a senior monk who is supervising the rite third he must rst take a step over the asengti  ascend and be correctly seated fourth he must face the senior monk who is supervising the rite and fth he must rst place his hands on the seat and then withdraw them
After being seated there are ve matters to which to attend
First the buddha must be placed on a seat second after the sound of the ghaṇṭā verses and hymns must rst be chanted third concerned with the service must be chanted fourth even if there is an offensive person present  cannot show anger while seated on the seat and fth if there is a person who has donated his possessions must be arranged in order and placed before 
Moreover there are ve issues for asking about the sutra
First you must rise up from seat and ask a question in accordance with the Dharma second you cannot ask a question while sitting together with  third if there is something you do not understand you must frankly ask a question about it fourth you cannot hold fast to your views and you should think in your mind that this is due to an external cause and condition and fth when you understand you bow your head to the ground face toward the opposite direction and depart through the door
Further the Shizhu piposha lun says When the Dharma preacher places himself on the lion seat  there are four kinds of laws
What are the four
First is that when he is ascending the raised seat he must rst respectfully bow to the assembly and then ascend the seat
Second is that if there are females in the assembly he must practice the contemplation on impurity
Third is that he have the seal of physical excellence of a great person in his deportment and his eyes and if he has a peaceful and happy countenance while expounding the Buddhist teaching every one of the audience will faithfully receive it he must not speak of nonBuddhist scriptures and he must have no fear in mind
Fourth is that in dealing with abusive language and difcult questions he must practice forbearance
In addition there are four more laws 
First is to give rise to the thought of beneting all sentient beings
Second is to not give rise to the thought of self as a real substance in all sentient beings
Third is to not give rise to the thought of things as real substances in all written languages
Fourth is to pray that all sentient beings will not retrogress from proceeding toward highest perfect enlightenment by hearing the Dharma from you
Again there are four more laws
First is to not slight yourself
Second is to not slight your audience
Third is to not slight what you speak
Fourth is to not benet and support yourself
Moreover the Wenshushili wen jing says
Mañjuśrī addressed the Buddha When can the four categories of your disciples not give voice or make sounds with their bodies or mouths a piece of wood a stone or any other thing The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī They cannot make any noise during the six periods of the day when worshiping the Buddha when listening to the Dharma when all the people assemble when begging for alms during meals and when relieving themselves Why must they not make noise during these time periods The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī During these time periods all heavenly beings come to us
All the heavenly beings continually have a pure mind a mind without delement a mind of emptiness a mind to follow prajñā and a mind to contemplate the Buddhist Dharma
Those noises make their minds unstable Since their minds become unstable they all return to 
Because all the heavenly beings leave us all the evil spirits come to us and cause unbenecial and disturbing things
They come in to this and cause various disasters
People starve and further mutually encroach upon each others rights
For this reason Mañjuśrī must be quiet when worshiping the Buddha The Buddha spoke in geya 
Do not make a noise whether with ones body or mouth Or any other noises by a piece of wood or a stone One who quietly worships the Buddha is Praised by the Tathāgata Furthermore the Fo benxing jing says
The Buddha said to all the bhikṣus From today on I will control all my disciples
You cannot invite those of stupid and dull faculties those who violate the precepts and those who do not possess all the precepts to deliver any teachings
From now on if you request someone to preach the Dharma you must invite only people of excellent conduct who completely possess the precepts or those who have accomplished wonderful bodhisattva conduct among all sentient beings
If there are who can clarify many sutras and Vinayas and who understand the people of the mātaṅga  you should choose those who can distinguish written language clearly and who fully possess the ability of eloquence and have them preach the Dharma
These bhikṣus will be sent one by one from a lower position to preach the Dharma for the people
If the rst one becomes tired the second one is invited If the second one is exhausted the third one should be requested
If the third one is weary the fourth one should be invited
If the fourth one is tired the fth one should be requested
Consequently some who are capable of preaching the Dharma should be invited one after another to expound the Dharma for the people At that time the people saw that the Dharma preacher possessed eloquence and could expound the Dharma
They then scattered incense and owers and over him
At that point none of the bhikṣus accepted these things and they gave rise to feelings of disgust and wished to leave
Why is this so
Because the Buddha had decided that those who have renounced the world cannot own powdered perfume and incense powder or any other incense or ower decorations
At that time all the people heard and saw this matter
They said abusively These bhikṣus are still not worthy of receiving offerings like this not to mention that surpasses them All the bhikṣus then went to the Buddha and closely questioned him about these facts
At that time the Buddha said to all the bhikṣus O bhikṣus
If there are all lay donors who with a joyful mind bring various offerings of incense owers powdered perfume incense powder and ower decorations and scatter them over the Dharma preacher because it is auspicious you must accept them At that point all the lay donors arrived bringing various items treasures and kaṣāya robes that they offered to the Dharma preacher
Those bhikṣus were all dreadfully overwhelmed with shame and did not accept the items
The people in the world said in an abusive and gossipy way The Buddhas disciples such as these śramaṇas are not worthy of receiving even a few unimportant offerings not to mention that surpasses them At that time the bhikṣus after hearing of this matter went to the Buddha and closely reported it to him
The Buddha then said to all the bhikṣus O bhikṣus
If there are secular people who bring various material goods and kaṣāya robes to offer to the Dharma preacher it is because they are happy I approve of their almsgiving
If there are useful things  I approve of you to accept them
If there are things that are not useful I approve of you to return them At one time a bhikṣu took the meaning of a summary of various sutras and spoke about it for others but did not follow the sequential order
On that occasion the bhikṣu felt ashamed of his conduct and was afraid He worried that he had disobeyed the sutras and precepts He closely told the Buddha
The Buddha then said to all bhikṣus I approve you to select and take important meanings from various sutras as you like and to preach the Dharma through examining and comparing phrases for the people
You however may not damage the text of a sutra by making out malicious meanings Again the Fo benxing jing says
Once the bhikṣus had gathered in a hall
There were two bhikṣus who preached the Dharma  and therefore they interfered with each other
Accordingly two halls were set up 
In each of the two halls the two monks separately preached the Dharma but they still obstructed each other just as before
of one hall went to the other hall leading his group
In the other hall there were various bhikṣus alternately lured and caused them to visit their hall
The promiscuous coming and going  intersected Consequently many people were disordered some people came and some left
The Dharma event was cut off
Some bhikṣus were not happy to hear the talk in this Buddhist teaching
So all the bhikṣus closely reported it to the Buddha
The Buddha told all the bhikṣus From now on two people cannot preach the Dharma in the same hall
Again two halls cannot be so close to each other that the preachers voices can be heard and interfere with each other
Once again the people of one cannot visit the people of the other and the people of the other cannot go over to that 
Again and again you cannot loathe the Buddhist teaching and you cannot be unhappy to hear the talk
If you loathe it you will have to be punished in accordance with the Dharma What is more the Sifen l does not allow for two Dharma preachers to speak in the same hall for the raised seats to be close to each other or for to speak while seated side by side The voices of singing praises and speaking and the chorus of chanting hymns are all entirely unapproved Other Vinayas do not allow for the Dharma preacher to receive owers scattered by laypeople If any owers touch his body he must brush them off Furthermore the Shanjianl
When the Dharma preacher expounds the Dharma for the people the females in the audience should cover their faces with a fan
Be prudent to not grin
If someone laughs drive that person out
what the Highest Perfect Enlightened One speaks with his golden mouth out of compassion for sentient beings
You must give rise to the mind of shame for your sins and listen
Why do you laugh Drive him out
Dharma As the Fozang jing says
The Buddha said āriputra in the future bhikṣus will be fond of reading nonBuddhist scriptures
When they preach the Dharma they will revise the diction to make the people happy
At that time devils will help confuse the people and hinder the wholesome Dharma
If there are those who are covetously attached to sounds and words and who skillfully elaborate on the diction  or those who are fond of reading nonBuddhist scriptures then all the devils will misguide the people and cause their minds to be agitated
All these people will be deluded by the devils
Their eyes of wisdom will be covered and obstructed and they will deeply covet what benets and nourishes them
Looking at various nonBuddhist books can be compared to a group of blind people who are deceived by a con man and who are all made to fall into a deep pit and die
Next āriputra an impure Dharma preacher does not know the Tathāgatas intention to comply with propriety
He does not properly understand himself and yet he speaks for others This person has ve faults in this existence
What are the ve
First at the time of preaching the Dharma he harbors fear and is afraid that the people will reprove him
Second he internally harbors anxiety and fear but externally he speaks for others
Third this is none other than an ordinary person who has true wisdom
Fourth what he speaks is impure and is merely words
Fifth there is no sequence to his words and in all respects he has extracted them 
Therefore he gives rise to fear among the people
An ordinary person like this has no wisdom and no unfailing attainment in mind He simply seeks a worldly reputation
Doubts and penitence consist in his mind and yet he speaks for others
For this reason āriputra if one sits on the raised seat before he has testied to the Dharma this is a case where one teaches others without having personal knowledge
By law he will fall into hell  Moreover the Zengyi ahan jing says
At that time the Worldhonored One said to all the bhikṣus You should know that there are four kinds of birds
What are the four 
First there are birds with good voices but whose appearance is ugly This called a kokila
Second there are birds with good appearance but whose voices are ugly
These are called birds of prey 
Third there are birds whose voices are ugly and whose appearance are ugly too
This is what is called an owl
Fourth there are birds whose voices are good and whose appearance is good as well
This is what is called a peacock
There are also four types of people in the world You should all be aware of this
What are the four 
First there are bhikṣus who have pleasant facial features and a perfectly dignied demeanor yet they are unable to skillfully chant the teachings in the beginning the middle and the nal parts
This means that these people have good appearance but a bad voice
Second there are people who have a good voice but an ugly appearance who are incomplete in every action and lack a dignied demeanor yet they are good at preaching and they are diligent observe the precepts well in the beginning the middle and the nal parts and have profound understanding of the principles
This means that these people have a good voice but an ugly appearance
Third there are people who have a bad voice and an ugly appearance It means that they violate the precepts and are not diligent
In addition they do not learn much and further they lose what they have learned
This means that these people have a bad voice and an ugly appearance
Fourth there are people who have a good voice as well as a good appearance
It means bhikṣus who have good facial features and who completely possess a dignied demeanor
Moreover they diligently cultivate the good Dharma and learn extensively without forgetting 
They can skillfully chant all the teachings in the beginning the middle and the nal parts
This means that these people have a good voice as well as a good appearance Again the Zengyi ahan jing says
At that time the Worldhonored One said to all the bhikṣus There are four kinds of clouds
What are the four 
First there are clouds that cause thunder without rain
Second there are clouds that cause rain without thunder
Third there are clouds that cause rain as well as thunder
Fourth there are clouds that cause neither rain nor thunder
These are the four kinds of clouds which resemble the four types of people in the world
First what does it mean that bhikṣus can cause thunder without rain
There are bhikṣus who learn the twelve kinds of scriptures by reciting aloud Reciting them they do not lose their meanings but they do not extensively preach the Dharma for people
This means thunder without rain
Second what does it mean that rain without thunder
There are bhikṣus who have good facial features and who entirely possess a dignied demeanor
However they do not learn much they do not learn the twelve kinds of scriptures by reciting aloud
Again they do not forget what they have received from others
They are fond of mutually accompanying virtuous friends or teachers 
They are fond of preaching the Dharma for others too
This means rain without thunder
Third what does it mean that neither rain nor thunder
There are bhikṣus who do not have good facial features and who do not possess a dignied demeanor
They do not cultivate the good Dharma and they do not learn much
Further they do not preach the Dharma for others
This means these people cause neither rain nor thunder
Fourth what does it mean that rain and thunder
There are bhikṣus who have good facial features and who entirely possess a dignied demeanor
They are very happy to study and fond of preaching the Dharma for others
They exhort others and cause them to receive 
This means that these people cause rain as well as thunder Speaker and Audience Selecting People Gradual and Sudden The Gift of the Dharma The Requital of Kindness and Benet
When the Dharma preacher ascends the seat he must rst respectfully worship the Three Treasures and purify his own mind
When he sees the virtuous selected he should generate the benevolent thought to save all sentient beings and benet the people
Then he should preach for them
Therefore the baoen jing says
If the audience is seated but the preacher is standing should not speak for them
If the audience asks the preacher to go beyond the proper limits should not speak for them
If the audience relies on a person but does not rely on the Dharma or if they rely on words but do not rely on the meaning or if they rely on a sutra that does not reveal the whole meaning of the Buddhist Dharma but do not rely on a sutra that reveals the whole meaning of the Buddhist Dharma or if they rely on cognition but do not rely on wisdom  should not speak at all
Because such people are unable to respect the pure Dharma of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas
If the preacher venerates the Dharma the Dharma audience also gives rise to reverence and listens to with sincerity They do not give rise to disrespect
This is called the pure preaching
Therefore the Ahan jing says in verse  The audiences correct mind is just like the craving for drink 
They absorbedly enter into the meaning of words By listening to the Dharma their minds leap with sorrow and joy should be preached for people like this Furthermore the Wufenl
 should remove his greed
He should establish states of mind such as a mind of no selfabasement a mind to not slight the masses a benevolent mind a joyful mind a mind to benet others and an immovable mind
Consequently he fully preaches a fourline verse
If he causes the people concerned to understand things as they really are then they will enjoy immeasurable comfort and benet for a long time
Successively the Nirvāṇasūtra says
 If you hold fast to recite copy or preach  do not preach at the wrong time in a wrong country or when you are not requested  if you preach recklessly slighting others pitying yourself or here and there or if you preach going against or destroying the Buddhist Dharma consequently you will cause immeasurable people to die and fall into hell
This is a bad friend or teacher for sentient beings
Moreover the Shisong l
There are ve types of people who ask questions should not be preached for all of them
First are those who ask for trials 
Second are those who ask without having any doubts
Third are those who do not ask for the reasons they should repent their offenses
Fourth are those who ask without receiving a preaching
Fifth are those who ask only in order to reprove
These cannot be entirely answered
If the people concerned really have goodwill they do not possess the intentions listed above
For those who wish to give rise to wholesomeness and destroy evil the Dharma preacher speaks for them according to their faculty through expedient means with goodwill
If has not clearly understood himself or has doubts about the Dharma then he cannot speak for others
I am afraid that he will cause the people concerned to have the fault of erroneous transmission
He will commit a sin in that case
Further the Baiyu jing and the Pitan lun ie Apitan piposha lun T There are four lines of arguments in questionandanswer form
First there is the determined answer 
For instance  if all sentient beings die
For this there is a determined answer
Second asks if one who dies will certainly have rebirth
This must be answered through discretion 
When ones attachment to existence is exhausted there is no rebirth but when one is still attached to existence he or she certainly has rebirth
This is called an answer through discretion
Third if someone asks whether or not human beings are the most wonderful you should rst question that person in return Are you asking the three evil realms or with all heavenly beings If that person asks  the three evil realms human beings are truly the most wonderful
If that person asks  all heavenly beings human beings are certainly not the most wonderful
connotations are called an answer through asking a question in return 
Fourth if someone asks about the fourteen difculties or if someone asks whether or not there is a limit to the world and sentient beings or whether or not there is a beginning and end of the world and sentient beings connotations are called an answer that remains open 
Arguments to such questions are similar to a argument Various nonBuddhists are ignorant but they consider themselves to be intelligent
They are not familiar with the four lines of argument 
They follow only one line of argument answer through discretion
Furthermore the Youposai jie jing says
The Buddha said Those who abide in accordance with the Dharma can benet themselves and others
Those who do not abide in accordance with the Dharma cannot be called those who benet themselves and others
Those who abide in accordance with the Dharma have eight kinds of undeled wisdom
What are the eight 
First is wisdom of the Dharma  second is the wisdom of reason  third is the wisdom of time  fourth is the wisdom of contentment  fth is the wisdom of self and others  sixth is the wisdom of the multitudes  seventh is the wisdom of spiritual faculties  and eighth is the wisdom of superiority and inferiority 
One who completely possesses the eight kinds of undeled wisdom like these generally has sixteen characteristics in his speech
First is to speak timely second is to speak with sincerity third is to speak in sequence fourth is to speak harmoniously fth is to speak following the meaning sixth is to speak joyfully seventh is to speak freely eighth is to speak without slighting the audience ninth is to speak without scolding the audience tenth is to speak in accordance with the Dharma eleventh is to speak in order to benet oneself and others twelfth is to speak without disorder thirteenth is to speak summarized meanings fourteenth is to speak true and correct things fteenth is to not give rise to arrogance after speaking and sixteenth is to not wish for a reward in a future life after speaking
One like this can listen to others
When he listens to others he possesses sixteen things
First is listening in a timely way second is to listen happily third is to listen with sincerity fourth is to listen respectfully fth is to listen without trying to nd fault  sixth is to listen not for the sake of argument seventh is to listen not to gain victory over  eighth is to not slight the speaker when listening ninth is to not slight the Dharma when listening tenth is to not slight oneself after listening eleventh is to leave far behind the ve coverings when listening twelfth is in order to hold fast to and recite when listening thirteenth is in order to remove the ve desires when listening fourteenth is in order to have complete faith when listening fteenth is in order to harmonize sentient beings when listening and sixteenth is in order to cut off stupid and dull faculties when listening
 Good people
Those who possess the eight kinds of undeled wisdom can speak and listen
People like this can benet themselves and others
Those who do not possess them cannot be called those who benet themselves and others
Next regarding those who can preach the Dharma there are two types
One is pure and the other is impure
There are ve issues regarding an impure 
First is to preach for prots second is to preach for reward third is to preach in order to surpass others fourth is to preach for worldly rewards  and fth is to preach with doubts
There are ve issues regarding a pure  too
First is to offer food rst and then preach after that second is to preach in order to enhance the Three Treasures third is to preach in order to cut off ones own delements and those of others fourth is to preach in order to discern unrighteousness and righteousness and fth is to preach in order for the audience to attain the supreme 
Good people
An impure preacher of the Dharma is called lthy one who betrays the Dharma a disgrace an erroneous preacher and one who is disappointed
Moreover the Faju yu jing says
Thereupon the Buddha spoke in verse
Even though one may recite a thousand chapters If the meaning of the sentences is not right This is no better than being able to annihilate a thought Through hearing the essential  Even though one may recite a thousand words If they are not righteous what advantage would they have This is no better than being able to be liberated Through hearing of a single righteousness and practicing it Even though one may recite a sutra many times If it is not understood what advantage would it have Through understanding a single Dharma phrase And practicing it one can attain the Way What is more the Dafaju tuoluoni jing says
If people who receive the Dharma wish to cause the Dharma to not be cut off through practicing dhāraṇī when all the Dharma preachers are about to expound the Dharma they carefully adjust their appearance sit properly and rst recite the dhāraṇī
Dadieta tuojiana ajiananjiana jiana jiana najia jiajianajia ajiajianajia jiana jiana jianaajiana jiajiana pobisha diyetapobisha yetaqieqiena duotapobishadi duotamojiashe najiashe jiajiashe
 At that time the Dharma preacher surrounded by his dependents can immediately achieve the expedient means of divine protection which causes that Dharma preachers mind to be undisturbed his preaching of the Dharma to not be cut off and desires and attachments to be exterminated
He causes all those in the audience including rākṣasīs to not be disturbed by devils in their cultivation
What the Dharma preacher needs is not to cause obstructions
As the Baiyu jing says
In the past there was a village ve yojanas from a capital city and in that village there was good tasty water
By imperial ordinance the king had the villagers regularly send some of the good water to him every day
The villagers were exhausted and suffered  They all wished to move away from and stay away from the village
At that time that village headman said to all the people You must not leave
I will address the king for your sake to change  from ve yojanas to three yojanas
If you can go and return for a shorter distance you will not be tired Then went and addressed the king
The king reformulated and pronounced that it was three yojanas and they were greatly happy after hearing this
Someone then said Since it is fundamentally ve yojanas this makes no difference Even though heard his words they were not willing to give up since they believed what the king had said
People of the world are like this too
As they cultivate the true Dharma in order to ferry over the ve realms and head toward the city of nirvana they give rise to fatigue in their minds and want to give up 
They are promptly driven by birth and death and they cannot move further
The Tathāgata the Dharma King has great expedient means
Dividing the Dharma of One Vehicle he speaks of three 
The people of the lesser vehicle hear this and are happy
They consider it to be an easy practice
Doing good acts and improving virtue they seek to ferry over birth and death
Later they hear someone say that there are not three vehicles therefore this must be the One Vehicle
Because they believe the Buddhas words they are not willing to give up at last
Like those villagers they are also just like this
Moreover the Garland Sutra says
O Buddhas disciples
For instance it is just as when the sun rises the light shines upon all the kingly big mountains next it shines upon all the big mountains and then it shines upon Mount Diamond Treasure
Afterward it shines all over the earth
The sunlight does not think I should rst shine upon all kingly big mountains and then shine upon one after another  leading up to all over the earth It is simply because there are variations of high and low in mountains and lands and there are things are rst and last in being shone upon
The Tathāgata Arhat Samyaksaṃbuddha is also like this
 He completed the sun of wisdom in the immeasurable boundless Dharma realm and always emits the immeasurable and unhindered light of wisdom
The light shines upon the kings of all big mountains such as bodhisattvas next it shines upon pratyekabuddhas next it shines upon śrāvakas and next it shines upon sentient beings who unfailingly attain good conduct and receive edication in accordance with each beings own way
Afterward it shines upon all sentient beings leading up to those who have an evil nature  For them makes benecial causes and conditions in the future
The Tathāgatas sunlight of wisdom does not think I must rst shine upon bodhisattvas leading up to those who have an evil nature simply emits the sunlight of great wisdom to universally illuminate all beings
O Buddhas disciples
For instance it is just as when the sun and moon appear in the lands leading up to steep mountains and deep valleys everything is shone upon
The sun and moon of the Tathāgatas wisdom are also like this
It shines upon all beings clearly
Sentient beings are simply not the same in terms of their hopes and good conduct
Therefore the Tathāgatas light of wisdom has various differences
the Dharma As the Shizhu piposha lun says
If a bodhisattva wants to give the Dharma to sentient beings he should study and comply with the Dharma preachers merits the meaning of preaching the Dharma and precepts just as is praised in the King of Determination the Mahayana scriptures
It means that he should conduct the four ways of preaching the Dharma
What are the four 
First is to learn extensively to be able to maintain all words chapters and sentences
Second is to attain unfailingly good knowledge of the characteristics of the arising and extinguishing of all phenomenal things in the mundane world as well as the world beyond the mundane world
Third is to attain meditation and wisdom and to comply with all the teachings stated in sutras without dispute
Fourth is to act according to what is stated  without increasing and decreasing
Furthermore the Zhengfanian jing says
If there is a sentient being who honestly practices good deeds and preaches the Dharma in a single verse for the sake of someone who has a wrong view thereby causing that person to purify his mind and believe in the Buddha after the death of he will be reborn in yingsheng Heaven  where he will receive various pleasures
Then after leaving that heaven he will transmigrate according to his karma
If one preaches the Dharma to others only in order to gain money or material goods does not benet sentient beings with compassion and takes the money or material goods 
If he drinks wine or drinks and eats together with a woman using  or if he sells himself to seek money just as an actor does then the reward for giving the Dharma in these ways is very small
He will be reborn in heaven and become a bird of wide information that can speak verses
This is called the lowest grade of giving the Dharma
What is called the middle grade of giving the Dharma
for others only in order to attain fame to surpass others or to surpass other great Dharma preachers
Or he expounds the Dharma for others with a jealous mind
The reward for giving the Dharma in these ways is small too
He will be reborn in heaven where he will receive the middle rank of reward or he will be reborn in the human realm
This is called the middle grade of giving the Dharma
What is called the highest grade of giving the Dharma
With a pure mind one wishes only to enhance sentient beings wisdom and expounds the Dharma not for money and prots because of this he causes sentient beings of wrong views to abide in the true Dharma
Giving the Dharma in this way benets himself as well as others
It is as superlative and supreme as nirvana Its merits are inexhaustible
This is called the highest grade of giving the Dharma
Moreover the Jiashe jing says  At that time the Worldhonored One spoke in verse If the trichiliocosm Were lled with jewelry and valuables And one uses them to make donations The merits one earns are few
If one expounds the Dharma in a single verse The merits of this are numerous If all the pleasant things of the three realms of existence were Entirely donated to one person This would not equal giving even a single verse The merit for this is supreme This merit surpasses that  And can cause all suffering to be left behind If worlds as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River Were lled with jewelry and valuables And one donates them to all the tathāgatas This is no better than giving a single the Dharma Even though giving valuables produces numerous merits It does not equal giving a single the Dharma The merit of a single verse is much better Not to mention that it is more difcult to surmise Again the Shizhu piposha lun says
Laypeople should practice giving material goods and clergy must practice giving the Dharma
Laypeoples gifts of the Dharma are no better than that of the clergy because those who listen to and receive the Dharma laypeople have shallow faith
Moreover laypeople possess much money and goods
The clergy recite and understand clearly all the teachings stated in sutras and explain them for the people
They have no fear among all the people
On this point laypeople cannot come close to them
In addition are inferior to the clergy in causing an audience to give rise to a respectful mind
Moreover are no match for the clergy in wishing to expound the Dharma and convincing an audience
Verses say
Cultivate and practice the Dharma for yourself rst Later teach other people Then you should speak these words You Follow what I have practiced If you do unwholesomeness personally How can you cause others to be wholesome If you do not attain tranquil complete extinction yourself How can you cause others to achieve extinguishment
Furthermore if the clergy practice giving material goods they will damage their remaining wholesomeness they will leave their hermitages far behind and they will certainly come to villages or towns where they will become engaged in with laypeople
will make many statements begin to give rise to the three poisons and slight the six pāramitās in their minds
Consequently they will come to greedily cling to the ve desires abandon the precepts and return to secular life
Therefore this is called death
Or they will go against the precepts and easily commit a felony
This is called the various delements and miserable perils including death
Because of this cause and condition for the clergy the giving of the Dharma is admired and for laypeople the giving of material goods is praised
Moreover the jinguangming jing Suvarṇaprabhāsasūtra T
In preaching the Dharma there are ve kinds of issues
First the gift of the Dharma benets both himself and others but the giving of material goods does not
Second the gift of the Dharma can cause sentient beings to escape from the three realms of existence but the giving of material goods cannot cause them to even get out of the realm of desire
Third the gift of the Dharma is benecial for the dharmakāya but the giving of material goods fosters and nourishes only the material body 
Fourth the gift of the Dharma inexhaustibly grows but the giving of material goods can certainly be exhausted
Fifth the gift of Dharma can break ignorance but the giving of material goods stops one from conquering greed
Therefore it is known that giving material goods is not better than  the Dharma
While giving the Dharma there is a spontaneous sequence
If one has within his understanding that which is not necessary for other people to know and being afraid that others are better than himself he keeps it unknown and does not speak of it then he will not be able to personally listen to the Dharma eternally in the future
The zhidu lun further says If one is stingy in the Dharma he will be eternally reborn in a remote place where there is no Buddhist Dharma Because of being stingy in the Dharma he hinders other peoples intelligence
This would be no better than betraying the Dharma
On the contrary other people would be superior to such a person
Moreover the Chengshi lun says
If a person can simply preach the Dharma for others this is called beneting others
Even if this person does not practice in accordance with the Dharma personally because he preaches for the sake of others he will also attain benet for himself
On this point regarding giving  there are briey three grades
The lowest of giving the Dharma is to preach the Dharma of donation but not wisdom
The middle of giving the Dharma is to preach observance of the precepts
The highest of giving the Dharma is to preach wisdom
In order to speak about wisdom one who teaches others has an insight into truth
Thus he can cut off deluded knowledge and the two kinds of hindrances  escape from the transmigration of birth and death and achieve the highest wisdom and the happy fruition of nirvana in the future
Even if he is merely able to offer only the Hinayana teaching he will edify one person and cause to observe that life is empty
To have faith and understanding is to rely on practices
Even if he has not attained the Buddhist Way  he excellently edies all sentient beings in Jambudvīpa and causes them to practice the ten wholesome acts
By having faith and understanding of the Buddhist teaching a person claries and cultivates the sacred Way
He then has the cause to go out from  He will certainly attain nirvana
Moreover the Zhufayongwang jing says
Suppose all sentient beings that exist on land and water and y in the air in Jambudvīpa attained a human body
If someone teaches all those people and causes them to peacefully abide in the ve precepts and the ten wholesome acts the merit that person earns is not equal to that of someone who teaches one person and causes to attain faith in and practice 
Again the Shizhu piposha lun says
There are four ways by which one can lose wisdom
These are what bodhisattvas must leave far behind
What are the four 
First is to disrespect the Dharma and the Dharma preacher
Second is to secretly hide important teachings and to be stingy with them
Third is to make hindrances for those who are delighted with the Dharma and to destroy their intention to hear 
Fourth is to be haughty selfconceited and to despise others
There are also four ways by which you can attain wisdom and which you should always cultivate and follow
What are the four 
First is to be respectful of the Dharma and the Dharma preacher
Second is to speak in accordance with the Dharma that you hear and which you recite for the sake of others with a pure mind without seeking prots
Third is to diligently and continually seek  just as you would brush off sparks of ame from your hair because of knowing how to attain wisdom by following the learned
Fourth is to hold fast to the Dharma in accordance with what you hear and to not forget to esteem to practice according to what is spoken and to not value language
Kindness As the Shangongjing jing says
The Buddha said to nanda If you hear a fourline verse from others either copy it or write down names on bamboo tablets or textiles
For several kalpas you will recall those such as upā dhyāyas and ācāryas and carry them on your shoulders or even sometimes on your back or continually carry them on your head
practitioners take all musical instruments to offer to these teachers
Even if you do these things you still cannot fully repay your indebtedness to your teachers
If in the life to come someone gives rise to disrespect for his teacher and upādhyāya and if he continually speaks of their faults I would say that such an ignorant one will have extreme suffering frequently and will certainly fall into evil realms in his future life
Therefore nanda I instruct you to always practice the mind of reverence
You must attain the supreme Dharma like this which is what is called the very profound Dharma of respectfully loving and valuing the Three Treasures Moreover the Fanwang jing says
O Buddhas disciples
If you see that a Mahayana Dharma preacher a companion who has the same views as yours or someone who practices alongside you is coming into the priests living quarters entering buildings or entering a city or if approaching from over a hundred li or a thousand li immediately welcome him and see off him  worship and give offerings to him
Make an offering at the three times every day
Daily meals three taels of gold drink and food of every taste and bedding and a seat mat are offered to the Dharma preacher
All necessities should be entirely given to him
Regularly ask the Dharma preacher to expound the Dharma during the three times every day
Worship at the three times every day
Do not give rise to a mind of anger or a troubled mind
Even if you would ruin yourself for the sake of the Dharma ask for the Dharma
If you do not do so you commit a minor offense of deling pure conduct
Again the Youposai jie jing says
After a layman receives and holds the six important precepts if there is a Dharma lecture in a place within a distance of forty li and he is unable to go and listen to it he commits a minor offense 
Furthermore the Dafangdeng tuoluoni jing says
The Buddha said to nanda If someone has parents a wife and children who will not let him go to a Buddhist seminary while facing those such as his parents he should burn various incense before them kneel upright with joined palms and make this statement I now wish to go to a Buddhist seminary
Please have compassion on me and accept  He also should admonish and explain to them in various ways He should expound the Dharma complying with propriety
He should make this request three times as well
If they will not grant his request then while staying in his house he should keep silent ponder by himself and recite and hold fast to sutra Again the Zhengfanian jing says
If someone makes an offering to the Dharma teacher who expounds the Dharma you must know that that person precisely makes an offering to the Worldhonored One of the present time
That person complying with what he offers in this way will achieve that for which he has made a vow
Consequently he will attain highest perfect enlightenment because he can make an offering to the teacher who expounds the Dharma
Since he hears the Dharma he can control his mind
Since he controls his mind he is able to break the darkness of ignorance and transmigration
If you depart from listening to the Dharma there is no chance to be able to control your mind by a single Dharma
Furthermore the Shengsiwei jing says To not give rise to an evil sinful act acts which produce merit and happiness or acts which cause an immovable mind is called an offering to the Buddha
 Moreover the Huashou jing says
If you offer things such as owers incense clothing food and decoctions of medicine to all the buddhas this is not called the true offering
If a person follows and is able to cultivate and learn the subtle Dharma he has attained in the place of enlightenment where the Tathāgata sits this is called the true offering
Therefore verses say
Flowers powdered perfume Clothing food and decoctions of medicine If these things are offered to all the buddhas This is not called the true offering In the place of enlightenment where the Tathāgata sits If a person can cultivate and learn The subtle Dharma he attained This is the true offering to the buddhas Again the Shizhu piposha lun says
The Buddha said to nanda Sending incense and owers from heaven is not designated as making offerings and paying respect to the Tathāgata
If bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās absorbedly without being selfindulgent intimately cultivate the sacred Dharma and accrue merit this is called the true offering to the Buddha Moreover the Baoyun jing says
Do not offer gifts of material goods to the Buddha
The Tathāgatas dharmakāya does not need gifts of material goods
Offer only the gift of the Dharma to the Buddha
In order to complete the Buddhist Way the offering of the Dharma is the best
Again the Shangongjing jing says
The Buddha said Suppose there is a bhikṣu who is unable to learn and understand a Dharma phrase like this even though he has had numerous summer retreats
He must rely on other for learning
What is the reason for this
He still does not understand for himself not to mention the case where he wishes to help others and become a teacher who supervises new monks
Even if he is a good senior elder bhikṣu who has experienced numerous summer retreats if he cannot understand the hidden matters of śramaṇas or if he does not understand things such as the Dharma and Vinaya he must speak only while relying on someone for learning too
If there are bhikṣus who have received the Dharma from another should give rise to a mind of reverence and to have high regard for that teacher
When you are about to receive the Dharma you must not smile even slightly bare your teeth cross your legs look at your feet move your legs nor walk with a limp before your teacher
Before the teacher begins questioning you cannot arbitrarily speak Generally if there is a duty for which you are employed you cannot disobey orders
Do not look at your teachers face
Keep three zhou away from the teacher  When you are ordered to take a seat sit down at that place
You cannot disregard his teaching
You should give rise to a merciful mind at the teachers side
If you have a doubt about some point you should rst inquire of him 
If you see that the teacher has listened to you ask him later about his judgment
You must know that at the three times of the day you should visit and ask him for instructions on your actions
If you do not visit to ask for instructions during the three times the teacher must punish you in accordance with the Dharma
When you go to visit your teacher but do not nd him you should take up a lump of earth a piece of wood or a blade of grass to mark and prove 
If you then nd the teacher in his room at that time you the student should give rise to sincerity circumambulate his room three times worship him by bowing your head to the ground and then depart
If you do not nd the teacher stop all duties You cannot do them
An exception is an order to answer the call of nature
Furthermore you disciples must not speak roughly in your teachers place
You should not refute him for whatever he may scold or blame you
The mat on which the teacher sits and sleeps should rst be spread out and cleaned You should make sure it has no dust stains insects or ants
When the teacher sits or lies down and also stands up you should cultivate the activity of reciting
At the time the sun rises in the east you the student should go to the teachers place
Keep track of the time very well and approach the teacher often and ask what he may need
What shall I do for you Moreover you disciples cannot shed tears or drip snot or saliva in front of your teacher
When walking within the temple out of respect for the teacher do not cover your shoulder with the kaṣāya
You cannot cover your head
If the climate is hot fan the teacher at the three times every day offer water three times and prepare a bath for him
Additionally you should offer a cold drink to the teacher at the three times
For everything the teacher does you should exert all your physical powers to help manage them for him The Buddha said to nanda If in the future world there is one among the bhikṣus who does not give rise to respect at the teachers place who speaks malicious criticism of his teacher monk that person is not the srotaāpattiphala
He is not even an ordinary person either
That ignorant person must be punished in this way
Even if a teacher really has a fault still cannot speak about it not to mention the case where certainly has no fault
If there is a bhikṣu who does not pay a respect to his teacher by his side I would say that there is separately a minor hell called Duipu  and that person will fall into it
After falling into that place he will have a body with four heads His entire body will be burned
In appearance will be just like a big ball of raging ames sending out violent blazes will burn vigorously without cessation after burning it burns again
In that hell there are also numerous insects called gouzui 
Those numerous poisonous insects will continually eat away his tongue
That ignorant person will then abandon his body from that and will be reborn in the realm of animals
This is all because he reviled and disgraced his teacher in the past Because of the fault committed by his tongue he will always eats excrement and urine
After abandoning that body he will be reborn in the human realm but will be always reborn in a remote place and possess only a wrong teaching
Even though he is able to obtain a human body he will not look like a human being he cannot possess a human appearance
He will be continually slighted slandered and maltreated
Away from the Buddha the Worldhonored One he will always lack wisdom
After he exhausts that and dies he will fall back into hell where he further receives the lessons of immeasurable and boundless suffering As the Zhengfanian jing says
There are ten merits in the exposition of the Dharma There are many benecial points
What are the ten
First is to possess time and place
Second is to discern and easily understand
Third is to correspond to the Dharma
Fourth is to act not for prots
Fifth is to control the mind
Sixth is to follow the exposition of the Dharma obediently
Seventh is to afrm that a donation has a reward
Eighth is to afrm that there are various hindrances in the law of birth and death
Ninth is to afrm that heavenly beings can fall down 
Tenth is to afrm that there are always results for what one has done in a previous existence
If a Dharma preacher has these ten ways he causes those who listen to the Dharma to attain much merit many benets and peace leading to nirvana
If you hear the Dharma you have merit You achieve the profound mind
The root of faith is puried You believe in the Three Treasures earnestly with a pure mind
You visit a place to listen to the Dharma Due to listening to the true Dharma every time you raise your foot to step you entirely give rise to the virtue of the king of Brahma Heaven 
Furthermore the Dapusa zang jing says  Give rise to deep affection and pleasure for all bodhisattvas just as you do for a great teacher
Give rise to affection and pleasure for the place of the true Dharma just as you do for your own body
Give rise to affection and pleasure for the Tathāgatas place just as you do for your own life
Give rise to affection and pleasure for a respectable teacher just as you do for your parents
Give rise to affection and pleasure for all sentient beings and see them just as you do your only child
Give rise to affection and pleasure for the place of the ācārya the teacher from whom you received the teachings and respect him just as you do your own eyes
Give rise to affection and pleasure for all right conduct just as you do for your ears eyes body and head
Give rise to affection and respect for the pāramitās just as you do for your hands and feet
Give rise to affection and pleasure for the Dharma preacher just as you do for many treasures of great value
Give rise to affection and pleasure for the true Dharma you seek just as you do for good medicine
Give rise to affection and pleasure for one who can name and recollect his sins just as you do for a good doctor
Moreover the Sengqiezha jing says
At that time Yiqieyong Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha O Worldhonored One
If there are sentient beings who hear this Dharma how many kalpas are their life spans The Buddha replied Their life spans are fully eighty kalpas Yiqieyong Bodhisattva asked How is a kalpa measured The Buddha replied For example suppose a large city of twelve yojanas both in length and width and three yojanas in height is abundantly lled with sesame seeds
There is a man who has lived a long time Every hundred years he takes one away
In this way even after all the sesame seeds in the city have been taken away a kalpa has not yet been exhausted
Moreover it can be compared to a large mountain twentyve yojanas in length and width and twelve yojanas in height
There is a man who has lived a long time Once every hundred years he comes and whisks with a light silk fabric
In this way the mountain is entirely removed yet a kalpa has not been exhausted
This designates the span of a kalpa Yiqieyong Bodhisattva then addressed the Buddha O Worldhonored One
Once a person makes a vow he attains multiple merits in this way and a life span as long as eighty kalpas let alone those who extensively cultivate all practices in the Buddhist Dharma Furthermore the Nirvāṇasūtra says
Even if one were to try to attain nirvana leaving behind the four teachings there is no case like this
What are the four 
First is to associate with good friends Second is to devote oneself to listening to the Dharma
Third is to ponder concentrating on one object
Fourth is to practice in accordance with the Dharma
For this reason through the cause and condition of listening to the Dharma one is able to draw close to great nirvana 
Because he opens the Dharma eye
There are three kinds of people in the world
First are those without eyes  Next are those with one eye  Last are those with two eyes  Those without eyes refer to the people who do not often listen to the Dharma
Those with one eye provisionally listen to the Dharma but their minds do not abide in it
Those with two eyes devote themselves to listening to and receiving and practice in accordance with what they have heard
Because of listening to the Dharma you can know of these three kinds of people in the world In addition the Faju yu jing says
In the past the Buddha stayed in the Jeta Grove Monastery in rāvastī where he expounded the Dharma for all heavenly and human beings
At that time King Prasenajit had a widowed called Vajrakumāri
parents felt pity for her so they built a separate good house for her and gave her ve hundred female entertainers to amuse her
Among the people in an elders there was a maidservant called Kubjottarā
She often went to a marketplace to buy cosmetics incense and owers
One time she saw numerous people both men and women holding incense and owers for offerings who were going out of the city to visit the Buddha
She asked some passersby Where are you all going They answered The Buddha has appeared in the world
He the Honored One in the three realms of existence liberates sentient beings and they will all attain nirvana On hearing this Kubjottarā was very happy Accordingly she thought to herself I am now old
It must be merit from my previous existences that I can see the Buddha She then took a portion of her money for incense with which she bought beautiful owers
Following the crowd she arrived at the Buddhas place She worshiped him withdrew and stood 
She scattered the owers burned incense and listened to the Dharma absorbedly
As she passed by the marketplace she bought some incense
Due to the merit due to listening to the Dharma and her karma from previous existences that followed her the fragrance of the incense oated and the weight  was double that of her last 
complained to her about her lateness and they all berated her
Because she respectfully served the Way Kubjottarā told them the bare facts
In the world there is a sage teacher the Honored One in the three realms of existence who beats the drum of the supreme Dharma and shakes the trichiliocosm Innumerable people go and listen to the Dharma
In fact I followed them and listened to the Dharma
That is why I was late Vajrakumāris followers heard say that the Worldhonored Ones Dharma and its meaning are profound and subtle not what is heard in the world
They felt terried and yet they were also pleased
They sighed to themselves and said What sins do we alone have that hinder us from hearing the Dharma Accordingly they asked Kubjottarā Please try to expound it for us Kubjottarā replied I am of humble origins and my mouth is lthy
I dare not easily propagate it  In the rule of expounding the Dharma rst prepare a raised seat Kubjottarā received the decree and closely propagated the sacred decree
All of the ve hundred maidservants were greatly joyful
Each of them took off a piece of clothing and piled them up to make a raised seat
Kubjottarā bathed received the Buddhas awesome power and expounded the Dharma properly
Vajrakumāri and the ve hundred maidservants all the doubts with which they had been fettered broke evils and attained the path of srotaāpattiphala
exposition of the Dharma was very good
So no one was aware that had accidentally caught on re
They were all burned to death in an instant and then reborn in heaven
The king came leading his men intending to save the people from re but he saw that they had been already burned
He cleared the ruins away had their bodies placed in cofns and completed burying them
then went to the Buddhas place and worshiped the Buddha
He addressed the Buddha joining his palms together in worship and said Vajrakumāri was unfortunately not aware of the outbreak of re All the people regardless of high and low positions were burned
The burials just ended
I am not convinced  What sin did they incur to have been killed by this re
I pray to you Worldhonored One to clarify to me what I have not yet heard The Buddha told the great king In a past world there was a city called Vārāṇasī in which a wealthy mans wife lived
She went outside of the city leading ve hundred maids and held a great worship ceremony
The teaching was difcult and rigorous
People of the other gender could not approach them
Regardless of their closeness or lack of closeness to the women if anyone came to them was thrown into a re
In the world at that time there was a pratyekabuddha called Kāla who lived in a mountain
He came out at daybreak to beg for alms and always returned to the mountain in the evening
Kāla came to a small shrine in the outskirts of a town begging for alms
The wealthy mans wife saw him and became furious with anger
Along with she caught Kāla and threw him into a re His entire body was scorched and broke out in sores
Then manifested supernatural power and soared up into the air
All the women were frightened and showed penitence with tears in their eyes
Kneeling upright and raising their heads they all said We women have been ignorant and silly We did not recognize an arhat
We are deluded and our haughtiness increased We abused and disgraced a divine spirit
We ourselves think that our faults sins and vices are as large as a mountain
We beseech you to grant us honor and virtue in order to remove our serious misfortune Shortly after they spoke came down and entered great nirvana
All the women erected a stupa and gave offerings to the relics The Buddha spoke in verse for the great king The ignorant and silly engaged in vice They cannot understand it themselves
Disaster chases them and they are burned Their sin becomes vigorous ames The ignorant do not wish for such a place  without thinking they arrive at suffering At the moment of falling into the place of adversity They then realize their unwholesomeness
The Buddha said to the great king The wealthy mans wife of that time is currently your daughter Vajrakumāri
The ve hundred maids are today the ve hundred female entertainers including Kubjottarā
Sin and merit follow after people Everything manifests over a long time
Good and evil follow people just as the shadow follows the form When this Dharma was expounded all people regardless of high and low position who had come there immediately attained the practice of the Way
Furthermore the Ayuwang jing says
In ancient times King Aśoka had a Buddhist teacher expound the Dharma when all the women were made to stay behind with a bamboo fence with curtains and were blocked from listening to the Dharma
At that time a Dharma preacher expounded the Dharma for all the women
He continually preached the discourse on offering donations the discourse on precepts and the discourse on rebirth in heaven
There was one woman who violated the kings law and came out from behind the curtain to face the Dharma preacher
She stepped forward to ask a question to the Dharma preacher When the Tathāgata the Great Awakened One realized all phenomenal things under the bodhi tree did he become aware of donations and precepts
Did he further realize other things The Dharma preacher replied The Buddha realized that all deled things are only suffering
It is just like melting iron
This suffering is associated with arising from causes
It is just like a poisonous tree
Cultivate the eightfold holy path in order to exterminate suffering and its cause This woman could hear these words and attained the path of srotaāpattiphala
She was put in the pillory under a blade and came to the kings place
She addressed the king Today I violated the kings important law
I pray that you O King will punish me according to the law The king asked her What matter did you violate She replied I broke the kings prohibition and went to the place of the Buddhist 
Just like a thirsty cow that does not avoid death I was really thirsty for the Buddhist Dharma
Therefore I imprudently offended against and listened to the Dharma  The king asked her When you listened to the Dharma did you gain much She answered Yes I attained the Dharma
I saw the Four Noble Truths understood the ve skandhas the twelve sense elds  and the eighteen realms and furthermore I understood that all great elements are nonself
 Consequently I attained the Dharma eye The king heard these words and was very happy
Immediately he bowed to her
Then he gave an order From now on do not make a fence and block anyone from hearing 
Those who are delighted with listening to the Dharma may hear it They can directly go to a Dharma teachers place meet face to face with him and listen to the Dharma He exclaimed Wonderful
From within my own palace a human treasure has appeared Because of this cause and condition you must know that listening to the Dharma has great benet
Moreover the Zabao zang jing says
At that time the state of Pañcāla made a present of ve hundred wild white geese to King Prasenajit
 The king ordered that they be sent to Jeta Grove Monastery
At the sanghas meal time beg food from the local people
When the geese saw the monks gathered they came and stood before 
Whenever the Buddha expounds the Dharma in one voice each sentient being understands in accordance with their species
Just at that time the ock of geese also understood the monks speech
They listened to the Dharma and were greatly delighted
Crying out in a chorus they returned to their pond
Later the birds migrated a long distance and arrived at another place where a hunter caught them all in a net and killed them
As  one goose cried out and all the other geese cried out in harmony
It is said that the sound they made when they heard the Dharma
Taking advantage of this wholesome mind they were all reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven
For the way to be reborn in heaven there are three thoughts in the Dharma
First is to think of the place from which you originally came
Second is to think and decide where you will be reborn
Third is to think what action you rst made that enabled you to attain a future rebirth in heaven
So thought to themselves When we see the causes we made in our previous existences we have no other wholesomeness
We only listened to the Dharma near the Buddha and the monks After had this thought ve hundred heavenly beings immediately descended to be near the Tathāgata
The Buddha expounded the Dharma for them and they all attained srotaāpattiphala
King Prasenajit happened to be at the Buddhas place
had often seen the ve hundred geese spread out before the Buddha but he did not see them on this day
So he asked the Buddha Where have all geese that used to be here gone The Buddha said You wish to see all the geese
Earlier the geese ew away to another place where they were killed by a hunter
They were reborn in heaven after death
All these ve hundred heavenly beings who are wearing good heavenly caps and who are well formed and extremely distinguished used to be 
Today they listened to the Dharma and they all attained srotaāpattiphala The king asked the Buddha What karmic conditions caused this ock of geese to fall into the realm of animals to be reborn in heaven after death and then to attain the Way today The Buddha replied Formerly at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha ve hundred women all together received the precepts but they were not rmly careful and they transgressed the precepts they had received
Due to the cause and condition of their violation of the precepts they fell into the realm of animals and became these geese
Because of having received the precepts however they were able to meet the Tathāgata listen to the Dharma and attain the Way
Because of the cause and condition of having listened to the Dharma while they were geese they were reborn in heaven Further the Jiu zapiyu jing says
In former times there was a śramaṇa who recited sutras day and night
A dog used to lie down under bed listening to the sutras wholeheartedly and it never thought of eating
was like this for years
After death obtained a human form and was reborn as a woman in rāvastī
When she grew up she saw a śramaṇa begging for alms
So she ran after him carrying food by herself and gave it to the śramaṇa She was delighted
Later she became a bhikṣuṇī and attained the path of arhatship
Verses say The Way of the sovereign administers the external  The Way of the Spirit soothes the internal  The imperial realizes the true Dharma This is the highest virtuous teacher
You respectfully receive the profound teaching The esteemed virtuous one stirs up brightness A teacher speaks and disciples receive Fragrant leaves brilliantly grow The Four Noble Truths are realized The three transcendental knowledges are amiable and cordial Open your mind and the sutras Expound and instruct the divine plan Emptiness and existence equal each other The profound truth penetrates subtlety Remove until there is nothing more to reserve The way to reach truth is not far from you Miracle Stories Zhu Daosheng of Longguang Temple in Changan during the Song dynasty was a man from Julu whose secular family name was Wei
He renounced the world when he was young He was sharp marvelous and outstanding
Therefore when he was at the age to dedicate himself to the pursuit of learning  he ascended the Dharma seat His questions and answers were as rhythmical as the musical notes of gong and shang
Both Buddhist monks and laypeople esteemed him and submitted to him
When he became the age to be ordained his caliber deepened day by day
His disposition was sharp and quickwitted His mind was pure and majestic
At rst he entered the Mount Lu and lived apart from society for seven years in order to abide by his spiritual ambition
He always considered realization through wisdom to be the foundation in the pivot of entering the Buddhist Way
Therefore he intensively studied numerous sutras with reverence and took miscellaneous discourses into consideration
He followed the Dharma endlessly through thick and thin
Later he traveled with Huirui and Huiyan to Changan where he received instructions from Kumārajīva
All the monks in Guanzhong  thought was a genius
He later returned to the capital city and stayed at Green Garden Temple 
The third emperor of the Song dynasty Emperor Wen  r
 assembly in which he the emperor casually sat on a bamboo mat spread on the ground in the same way as did the ordinary people
He dined with them for a while All the people wondered if it was the afternoon
 The emperor said Noontime has just begun sheng said The sun hangs in the sky
The emperor said Noontime has just begun How could it not be noontime He then took up his bowl and ate
Thereafter all the people followed him
Everyone praised Daosheng for his prudent and quick wit
Later examined absolute and relative reality and researched causality
He then advocated that those who do good conduct do not receive retribution and that buddhahood is attained through sudden enlightenment
Moreover he authored discourses such as the Discourse on the Twofold Truth  the Discourse on the Existence of Buddhanature  which completely cover old theories and have subtly profound purposes
Those who stuck to language however greatly gave rise to ill will and raised their voices in disorder for and against  vying with each other
Moreover the Nirvāṇasūtra in six fascicles was rst introduced to the capital city
sheng analyzed the doctrine of the sutra had an insight into what is profound and subtle and then elucidated that even icchantikas are able to entirely attain buddhahood
At that time the larger version had not yet been transmitted
alone announced the explicit statement rst but his unique view grated upon the people
Thereupon those of the old learning considered theory to be heretical giving rise to much slander and indignation toward him was put on public display to be exiled and driven away
sheng stood up straight before the masses and took an oath If my theory goes against the meaning of sūtra I request that a serious disease will immediately erupt on my present body
If is not contrary to ultimate reality I wish I will be able to occupy the lion seat when I pass away After nishing his speech he adjusted his robes and departed
He rst stayed on Mount Huqiu of Wu prefecture 
Within ten days he had several hundreds of disciples
In the summer of that year thunder shook the Buddha Hall of Green Garden Temple and a dragon ascended into the sky and the light  reected on the west wall 
Accordingly the name of the temple was changed to Dragon Light 
At that time the people lamented The dragon has already left us
sheng too must leave us Soon went to live in on Mount Lu and disappeared into a cave on the mountain peak
All the monks on the mountain admired him
Later the larger version of the Nirvāṇasūtra was introduced to Nanjing
As a matter of fact it afrms that all icchantikas have buddhanature thus agreeing with what had previously asserted just as two pieces of a tally t together
sheng had obtained this sutra and soon he explained it
On the gengzi day of the eleventh month in winter of the eleventh year of the Yuanjia era of the Song dynasty  ascended the Dharma seat at the monastery on Mount Lu
He was openminded and his virtuous voice profoundly rang out
Discussions were held several times His way of probing into the very root of things was completely wonderful
Everyone among the audience comprehended it with joy
When the Dharma assembly was about to end saw whisk suddenly fall down
He then sat properly straightened himself leaned on a small table and passed away
His countenance did not change he looked as if he was entering into meditation
Both the Buddhist monks and laypeople were in shock with grief People both those who were close to him and those who were far from him whimpered in lamentation
Thereafter all the monks of the capital city felt ashamed of themselves felt hatred toward themselves and admired after his death
The utmost degree of his marvelous insight manifested as an auspicious sign like this He was buried in a mound on Mount Lu
At the beginning was a fellow student of rui  yan and guan and attained fame equally with them
Therefore the people of that time commented sheng and rui displayed the pure nature given by heaven yan and guan attained awakening with unremitting zeal
Huiyi advanced with pride and smugness
Kou and Yuan stayed away from society and kept silent sheng and rui alone put a mark on the pure nature given by heaven
Therefore they were outstanding among many scholars
In an earlier time Sengzhao of Guanzhong  annotated the Vimalakīrtinirdeśasūtra for the rst time
All the people of the world appreciated it
sheng furthermore showed the profound purpose of the sutra and expressed a new and different interpretation
His annotations on various sutras were treasured by all the people of the world
Wang Wei compared sheng with Guo Linzong  and wrote a biography in order to make known inuence
The people of the time thought sheng deduced that even icchantikas attain buddhahood
His word on this has authority assertions sudden enlightenment and not receive retribution were also chartered
The third emperor of the Song dynasty gave an account of shengs doctrine of sudden enlightenment on one occasion and śramaṇas such as Sengbi all raised serious objections
The emperor said to them If I could bring the dead back to life would I be talked down to by you all In Dragon Light Temple there was also a śramaṇa called Baolin
At rst he stayed in Changan where he received the learning
Later he expounded various theories of sheng
The people of that time called him One who Befriends Profound sheng 
 He authored the Records of Nirvana and annotated the Discourse on Different Tenets  the Manifesto to Evil Spirits  and other texts
Fabao a disciple of lin studied both Buddhist and nonBuddhist teachings 
He authored the Discourse on Those Who Have Mastered Vajra and other texts
Moreover he also expounded shengs theories
Furthermore in recent times there is Shi Huisheng who also stays at Dragon Light Temple
He keeps a vegetarian diet and is well versed in many sutras
Concurrently he is skilled in cursive and clerical styles of calligraphy
The people of the day called the Great and the Young  the Two Shengs as they succeeded one after another in the same temple
 Fei Chongxian of the Song dynasty was a man from Wuxing 
He was an avid believer in the Dharma from the time he was young
When he was over thirty years old he became more devoted and industrious in 
In the third year of the Taishi era he received the bodhisattva precepts
He resided temporarily at Xie Huiyuans house and performed purication
For twentyfour days both day and night he was not negligent 
Every time he heard sutra chanting he always placed a longhandled incense burner in front of himself as he knelt
On the third evening of the purication he saw a man of outstanding appearance and clothing who came to him lifted up the incense burner and was about to leave
Chongxian looked at the incense burner in front of his knees which was still there
He again looked at the man in close detail and saw very clearly the man departing carrying 
Chongxian then realized that this was beyond human power
He thought that his personal clothing was freshly washed and there was nothing impure
There was however a spittoon at the side of his seat
After had the spittoon removed he saw again that the man returned the incense burner  in front of his knees
Before the one burner had been returned the two incense burners were still seen as separate but when the burner came back both burners united to become one
In this case was what the holy man carried a shadow of the incense burner
Moreover Chongxian heard some people say that in Fuyuan Temple there was a nun called Sengqin who was dedicated and diligent in and who had attained the Buddhist Way
He was delighted and wished to meet her Before he was able to go to see her his anticipation grew extremely
At one time he performed purication in other peoples house
At midnight he suddenly saw a nun whose deportment was upright and respectful
She wore a kaṣāya of red cloth and stood upright before the seats for the purication rite
Around meal time she disappeared
Later when Chongxian met the nun her appearance and clothing were exactly the same as what he had seen before the window 
During the YuanWei dynasty there was Ratna mati a śramaṇa from Central India
In the Wei dynasty he was called Baoyi 
 He was from a western state but it is unknown what clan 
He was versed in the entire Tripiṭaka and excellent in reciting dhāraṇīs
At the beginning of the Yongpin era of the Wei dynasty came all the way to Eastern China
Emperor Xuanwu asked him every day to lecture on the Garland Sutra
He read it dedicatedly and diligently he did not give up for even a single day
He sat straight on the raised seat 
Suddenly there appeared a man holding a ceremonial tablet and a title
His appearance was just like that of a highranking ofcial
He said I am here having received with respect the orders of akradevā nāmindra who asks you Dharma preacher to lecture on the Garland Sutra yi replied Now this Dharma assembly has not yet come to an end
Please wait for me to conclude the text of the sutra I should come and follow this order
Nevertheless a Buddhist service is done with assistance it cannot be done alone
The chief of the lecture meeting burns incense and lights a candle for the service and the Buddhist deacon chants hymns
This is all completely necessary
I must ask you to make them xed The messenger as had been asked saw the lecture and all the monks
The Buddhist service was already about to end
Again the aforementioned messenger said Since I have received the order of akradevānāmindra I came down to meet you yi then smiled amiably and cordially said goodbye to the people
He immediately passed away on the Dharma seat
The four monks including the chief of the lecture meeting all died at the same time
The monks and laypeople in the territory of the Wei dynasty learned of this extra ordinary incident Everyone grieved
In the Qi dynasty there was śramaṇa Sengfan at Dajue Temple in Yedong 
His secular family name was Li and he was a man from Pingxiang
He was good at understanding a multitude of books At that time he was called the treasury of archives In his later years he renounced the world
He was well versed in sutras and discourses His statements and deeds complemented each other Auspicious signs frequently appeared
Once the Regional Inspector of Jiazhou Du Bi was at Xianyi Temple in Ye and requested fan to hold a winter lecture meeting
When fan came up to the section of the sixth stage of the Garland Sutra a wild goose suddenly ew down From east of a stupa it came along and entered the hall
lay down on the oor right across from the raised seat  listening to the Dharma
When the lecture meeting adjourned slowly went out returning along the west side of the stupa and then soared away
Furthermore held a summer lecture meeting at this temple
A sparrow came and alighted in the southwestern  and it listened to  remaining for ninety days
Moreover once lived in Jizhou 
An owl ew into  and listened to too After the lecture ended it left
In addition there was a monk who harbored anger and slandered  calling him names Stubborn stupid old monk
What do you know On that very night a god struck  who almost died
Unless one harmonizes themselves with the Way and accords with the unseen world how could they have the Buddhas responsive activity in conjunction with their faith and meritorious acts like these
On the second day of the third month of the sixth year of the Tianbao era died at Dajue Temple at the Chinese age of eighty
At Yanxing Temple in the metropolis of the Sui dynasty there was Shi Tanyan whose secular family name was Wang
He was a man from Wanquan in Puzhou 
 His family was wealthy and inuential and they successively served as government ofcials in the Qi and Zhou dynasties
Moreover they were associated with books by nature The people of their local area lauded their deeds
investigated and awoke to the profound principles  He knew clearly without fail
He intended to write a great annotation on the Nirvāṇasūtra but he was afraid that he would stagnate in the delusions conceived by an ordinary person
He prayed sincerely every night before he went to bed and also every morning after he woke up wishing to attain good signs
One night he dreamed of a man wearing white clothes and riding a white horse the mane and the tail of which brushed the ground orally instructed on the purport of the sutra and yan holding the horses mane by hand asked to discuss it with him
After woke up he thought and said This must have been Aśvaghoṣa Bodhisattva who instructed me with a clue of the meaning
Since I held the mane and knew its purport it may be seen that I have reached the issue Even though he felt that this was an auspicious sign he was still afraid that it was illogical
Furthermore holding the sutra and the annotation to Chenzhou  He examined them in front of a stupa of the Buddhas relics at Renshou Temple
He burned incense and made an oath I yan respectfully fathomed your sacred thought with my ordinary ability
The evaluation and explanation have already been done All are just as you see in the separate fascicle
If it is a profound achievement and a subtle accomplishment I pray that you will display a supernatural wonder
If  does not move you I swear not to transmit it  After he nished speaking the axes of the scrolls of the Nirvāṇasūtra emitted light all at the same time
There were auspicious signs all through the night
Both clergy and laypeople congratulated him
The relics in the stupa also emitted light and the bright light did not cease for three days and three nights
It illuminated the Milky Way above and shone upon the mountains and rivers below
All the people of the local regions saw the light and everyone came to see and pay respects
All the people were moved by the auspicious signs and they were humbly instructed in 
The sovereign and subjects valued virtue  This is a rare man On the thirteenth day of the eighth month of the eighth year of the Kaihuang era of the Sui dynasty passed away at Yanxing Temple at the Chinese age of seventythree
At Jingying Temple of the metropolis of the Sui dynasty there was Shi Huiyuan whose secular family name was Ji
He was a man from Dunhuang 
Later he lived in Gaodu in Shangdang 
He was well versed in the Tripiṭaka and had clear knowledge of the nine schools
 He was sharp by nature and his manners were graceful
He led by lecturing on  this was his occupation The people of the world all counted on him
Formerly he resided in Qinghua  He raised a goose which attended and listened to lectures
In the seventh year of the Kaihuang era  he was summoned by imperial decree to the capital city
The goose was left behind in the original temple Its nest was in a small place in a corridor 
Day and night it honked and many felt pity for it
So it was sent along with a messenger and arrived at the capital city was released when they reached the great outer gate of Jingying Temple
It ew about in a lively way honking and then entered Huiyuans room
Just as before obediently listened to without shrinking from cold or hot weather
When it heard the sound of the bell for the Dharma assembly regardless of whether it was during the morning or evening entered the lecture hall together with all the other people quietly bowed down and listened
When the monks and laypeople left in an orderly way also went out of the hall and soared aloft honking
If there was a regular meeting of monks and other members of the order  even though heard the bell sound it did not enter to listen to a lecture 
At the time all the people thought this was strange
If yuan lectured and explained in the usual way quietly listened to it according with the Dharma
If offered an anecdote midway  however honked and ew out
It is truly known that the Way is propagated relying on the people and a sacred bird is a good response 
No one is allowed to ascend the Dharma seat except for one who has testied the Dharma
he will surely fall into hell
This is also a suggestion for the time of parting 
You cannot follow another blindly and reject all
passed away during the Kaihuang era at Jingying Temple
In the Sui dynasty there was Shi Fayan at the Zhenji Buddhist seminary of the Western Capital 
His secular family name was Zhang
resided in Luozhou  far from their original native place He was determined to cause the great Dharma to ourish
He was sharp well known and outstanding among his peers in the same generation
Even though he was versed in the entire Tripiṭaka he was well known solely for the Mahāprajñā pāramitāśāstra 
He was engaged in Dharma assemblies here and there No one dared to refute 
In the sixteenth year of the Kaihuang era an imperial decree was issued to appoint yan as the leader of the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra
He resided in Zhenji Temple
The town was led and edied for a long time Stupas were built during the Renshou era 
was again summoned to send relics to Ruzhou 
In the fourth year  in obedience to another imperial decree sent relics to Shanying Temple in Yizhou 
dug down more than one zhang under the foundation  where they obtained alluvial gold that was two sheng altogether after it had been rened into pure solid gold
 Its brightness dazzled peoples eyes
 Furthermore people became aware that a common Chinese ox came before the stupa bent its knees and forelimbs and stopped after bowing twice
turned around and again saluted Emperor Wen and reverently bowed to an image of the Buddha
When were placed into a stone container about thirty thousand people all saw a vecolored cloud in the sky more than ten zhang long and three or four zhang wide
It was surrounded by white clouds and looked like thin silk cloth
The cloud oated in the air just above the foundation It remained from  PM
and then it disappeared
After the vecolored cloud appeared again came back from the four directions
The situation was as auspicious as before
Moreover became aware that ve black cranes came from the northwest circled above the stupa four times and then left and came back again
They were also aware that white cranes ew around above and after a while they were gone
Furthermore they perceived that a vecolored snake coiled up outside of the container  it was about three chi long and its head faced toward the relics
were surprised but they were not afraid of it after all
Things like this happened several times
Regional Inspector Zheng Shanguo said in a memorial to the Throne
I have heard that when we respect Heaven and support all things celestial phenomena reveal their powers and when we follow Earth and nourish the people the Great Earth shows its virtues
Therefore when Tao Tang disciplined himself and was not negligent the hidden energy manifested auspicious omens
When Xiahou made achievements in controlling water and earth the black jade tablet was bestowed
We exactly know that the inuences between opportunities of time vouchsafed by Heaven and human affairs are like divine  I humbly think Your Majesty that you hold plans in your mind and act in a humble and gentle way
You accepted the mandate of Heaven became an emperor
No dust remains in your territory and you have completely unied the imperial cultural education for the people
You have the great virtue to encompass all things you are glorious and majestic you are benevolent and compassionate and you are vast and expansive
Heaven and all the buddhas show the model and sent down these honors and auspicious omens
At the six places under the stupa the extraordinary alluvial was obtained
dazzlingly shines and it is the same as all gold treasures
It has never been experienced from ancient times that an ox performs worship
Now we see that the clouds soar in the ve colors
Furthermore we perceived that a snake manifested with miscellaneous bright colors and coiled on the foundation of the stupa and that cranes both black and white ew around in the sky
Even though Xuanhuang had happy auspicious omens he vainly passed on the old system 
Emperors of the Han dynasty had signs of blessings which were written in books in vain
Except for one whose virtue makes the Three Treasures ourish and whose way stands alone above all kings who else can cause to perceive these good blessings and invite mysterious and extraordinary 
The emperor was greatly happy about this
It was written in a separate record
In the third year of the Daye era  passed away at  he resided at the Chinese age of sixty
In the Tang dynasty there was Shi Daozong at Shengguang Temple in the western metropolis
His secular family name was Sun
He was a man from Jimo in Laizhou 
He was versed in the Tripiṭaka and had a particularly thorough knowledge of the Mahāprajñā pāramitāśāstra 
Every time he lectured on the Mahāprajñā pāramitāśāstra numerous owers rained down from the sky
circled around the lecture hall then ew into the hall through the door
None of fell on the ground and after awhile 
All the people in the gathering exclaimed on seeing this rare auspicious occurrence
In the sixth year of the Wuda era passed away at  where he resided at the Chinese age of seventyone
In the Tang dynasty there was Shi Daosun at Renshou Temple in Puzhou 
 His secular family name was Zhang
He was a man from Yuxiang in Hedong 
He had a lofty air He was generous and guileless in mind
He had good knowledge of the pivot times and was procient in the way to govern 
Even though he was well versed in a large number of books he earnestly considered the Nirvāṇa and the Mahāyānasaṃgraha to be the foundation for his spirit to abide
In a month of the winter of the second year of the Zhenguan era  was asked to lecture on the Nirvāṇa
He knew beforehand that was coming to an end so he politely declined the invitation
The aforementioned person could not fathom and respectfully invited 
said I cannot excuse myself from your intention He went to he was invited and ascended the seat
He gave the subject and told all the four categories of Buddhists 
They lamented We personally think that the holy one will leave us far behind
The subtle words will be secretly cut off replied What I an ignorant person transmit is not worthy to be emulated
Devote yourselves earnestly to with faith and you should attain enlightenment by yourselves
Now I will stop lecturing here on the seat After saying some verses 
 The world will spontaneously come to an end in a short time
Since the time is coming closer I hope that everyone will exercise caution Consequently he expressed himself in written form
Just at the time when he came to the beginning of the verse he lost consciousness
He died without any suffering at the Chinese age of seventyve
In the twelfth month of that year was sent to a recess of the southern mountain in Ziwu Valley in the royal city
All the people of the area wailed together just as if they had lost their parents
That night it snowed all around within a distance of three or four li
So they cleared the road and passed through The corpse was placed in the mountain range After that night strange owers suddenly grew
Circling around burial site burst out from the ground
There were about ve hundred branches and they were around two chi high
They illuminated brightly and luxuriantly above and their color looked like that of a butterbur   but they were completely different in form and characteristics
The masses were astonished Sad and joyful people were clamorous on the mountain
They plucked the owers entered into the city and showed them to all the respected elders
Thereupon they put in a vase with water
still had not withered in the fth month of the next year
Except the case where were given through the divine help of a previous existence how could the people receive such a good and auspicious response from the unseen world
There was a man in Jinzhou who loved hunting by nature
At rst he did not believe in  Someone gave him information on the peoples receptivity 
Therefore he went to the mountain to see himself but he only found an empty place
He repented by himself and said weeping mournfully While was alive I did not receive an opportunity to believe in  and did not meet with auspiciousness after his death
Why do I alone have no receptivity 
There must be the Way of the Spirit I pray that hidden auspiciousness will be revealed After he spoke  a wonderful ower burst out of the ground two chi high as well
The man was gratied with the good response He awakened the aspiration and remained a strong thereafter Views  Introduction and Quoted Testimonies
The mind undergoes changes its noumenon is impermanent
Understanding and delusion overthrow each other What incarnation is the Sage
He pacies your spirit and shines with freedom from all preoccupation responding to your capability just like an echo
What is called nirvana is motionless You perceive it and consequently reach it
For enlightenment one needs the condition and the opportunity and later the divine edication
Therefore written language is utilized and spreads throughout the universe
The Sages transformation is in conformity with every place and completely contains the Dharma realm 
Except for the utmost Sage of the six supernatural powers who else could grant edication to those of the ve realms
As the Fenbie gongde lun says
The reason the Tathāgata extensively expounds the rst principle for each of the four categories is precisely for the future
In the Dharma left the four social classes and Buddhist monks have different views from each other
Together they discuss right and wrong and proclaim their own group to be superior and those of the others to be inferior
People like this are innumerable
Therefore prevents this from occurring and opens the selfsufcient path
It is just as among light sunlight is superlative among constellations the moon is superlative among owing water the ocean is superlative among the six heavens  Pāpīyas is considered to be superlative among the eighteen heavens of the realm of form uddhāvāsa is considered to be superlative among the ninetysix schools ākyamunis monks are considered to be superlative and among the ninetysix kinds  the Buddhist Way is considered to be superlative
Thereupon of the ve hundred śrāvaka disciples it is impossible to minutely list each of them separately according to their spiritual understanding
 First is precisely jñātakauṇḍinya Bhikṣu the rst disciple edied and given the Dharma  he was the rst monk welcomed 
Therefore he is called the foremost Then Gavāṃpati Bhikṣu was good at protecting from being slandered and loathed and he hid himself in heaven Therefore he is called the foremost
Therefore the gongde lun says
Gavāṃpati Bhikṣu could not reside in the world for two reasons
Because this bhikṣus feet looked like cows hooves and when he was full he chewed 
Because of these two matters he could not reside in the world
If nonBuddhists were to see him they would have thought that all śramaṇas have no xed time for eating and they woud give rise to a mind of slandering 
For this reason the Buddha sent to heaven and had him meditate in the Good Dharma Lecture Hall 
Suprabuddha Bhikṣu often went on errands to heaven for the sangha
After the Buddhas nirvana Kāśyapa tolled a bell and called monks from far and wide
He ordered Aniruddha to check all over the world and see if anyone was not coming
Aniruddha immediately saw the world and everyone had come
Only Gavāṃpati Bhikṣu remained in heaven
Accordingly Suprabuddha was sent to summon 
When Suprabuddha arrived in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven he saw that  had entered the meditation in which mental functions are completely annihilated in the Good Dharma Lecture Hall
snapped his ngers to wake and said Fourteen days have passed since the Worldhonored One entered nirvana
Kāśyapa has gathered all the monks and he ordered me 
You should come down to the world and go to the sanghas gathering place Gavāṃpati replied The world is already empty I cannot bear to return there
I would rather enter nirvana Accordingly he handed his robe and bowl over to Suprabuddha to return them to the sangha
Then he entered nirvana
Due to this cause and condition he is good at protecting and he peacefully placed himself in heaven
Therefore he is called the foremost
Second the lun says
The reason Uruvilvākāśyapa is called the foremost is that from the time of his previous existence he and his two brothers continually had a thousand disciples who followed them
Now that they have encountered the Buddha they have been liberated and altogether they have attained arhatship
offered the four requisites  Because of this he was happy
Since he helped and protected the Buddhas disciples he is the foremost in offering
Third the lun says
As for why āriputra is called the greatest in wisdom the Worldhonored One   If you want to know how much wisdom āriputra has imagine Mount Sumeru as an inkstone the water of the four great seas as ink all the bamboo trees and forests of the four continents as writing brushes the people lling the four continents as calligraphers and even then if you wished to record all of āriputras wisdom you would still not be able to complete it much less could you survey it with an ordinary persons ve supernatural powers
Therefore he is called the greatest in wisdom Fourth the lun says
As for why Mahāmaudgalyāyana is called the greatest in the supernatural power of travel the Worldhonored One has spoken this testimony
when the three calamities spread all the people were greatly famished intended to reverse the great earth and take the fertile soil from under the land in order to offer it to the lives of the people
The Buddha stopped him and would not allow him to do so because he was afraid  would harm the sentient beings 
also wished to hold the sentient beings by the hand and reverse the earth with his other hand
The Buddha would not allow this either
Therefore it is known that was the greatest in the supernatural power of travel
As the Miji jingang lishi jing says
 Maudgalyāyana received the Buddhas sacred decree
In the western direction there is a world called Flag of Light  where a buddha called King of Light presently expounds the Dharma
Maudgalyāyana arrived there and heard the buddhas speech
He saw that the buddha was forty li tall all the bodhisattvas were twenty li tall and the almsbowls in which those bodhisattvas have food were all one li in height
Maudgalyāyana walked on the edge of an almsbowl
At that time all the bodhisattvas addressed the Worldhonored One O Great Sage
From where has this insect come
It wears a śramaṇas robe and goes along the edge of a bowl On that occasion Buddha said Good people Be careful
Do not give rise to a mind of disrespect toward this virtuous man
Why is this
This elder is called Mahā maudgalyāyana
He is the greatest in the supernatural power of travel among ākyamuni Buddhas śrāvaka disciples Then Light Buddha said to Mahāmaudgalyāyana The bodhisattvas and all śrāvakas in my land see your small body and they have all given rise to disrespect
You virtuous one must manifest your supernatural power of travel and receive the inuences of ākyamunis awesome virtue Maudgalyāyana bowed his head to feet circumambulated him seven times and then jumped up and oated in the air
After extensively manifesting his supernatural power of travel again went before Buddha
All the bodhisattvas exclaimed at such an unprecedented event
The buddha said He wished to try to discover how far ākyamuni Buddhas voice travels
Therefore he came to this land You virtuous one should not try to discover the Tathāgatas voice travels
The Tathāgatas voice travels limitlessly without any xed distance
Its extent and range are immeasurable
It is incomparable The Worldhonored One said How did you reach this world by your supernatural power
Originally it was established by the awesome virtue of the Worldhonored One ākyamuni Buddha
If you worship ākyamuni Buddha who is far away in the distance you will return there spontaneously
Even if you intend to return to your homeland through your own supernatural power of travel you will not arrive there even after a kalpa Maudgalyāyana knelt with his right knee on the ground faced the eastern direction and worshiped ākyamuni Buddha
He joined his palms in salute and took refuge in  As quickly as the time it takes to bend and stretch out his arm he was able to return 
Therefore it is known that Maudgalyāyana is the greatest in the supernatural power of travel
Fifth the lun says
As for why Aniruddha is called the greatest  once when the Buddha was expounding the Dharma for a great assembly Aniruddha fell asleep on his seat
The Buddha saw him and said At present the Tathāgata is expounding the Dharma
Why did you fall asleep
Sleeping blocks the mind and intentions
It is no different from death Aniruddha felt ashamed of himself kept this in mind and took an oath to dare not fall asleep again
Consequently he did not sleep for a long time and he lost his eyesight
The causes require altogether six conditions
There are two conditions for the eyes one is to see forms and the other is sleep
There are also two conditions for each of the ve objects of the ve sense organs
When these conditions are obtained the six sense organs are then perfect
Since eyes did not receive a condition  he lost his eyesight
The Buddha ordered Jīvaka to cure  said Sleeplessness is incurable
has already lost his physical eyes He will be unable to see anything ever again All ve hundred disciples gave up on him and quickly scattered away
once hired someone to thread a needle and he mended his own clothing by touching lightly with his ngers The thread completely and repeatedly passed through 
There was no one he could hire so he said to some people nearby in a voice that was like chanting Someone who wishes to seek merit please thread a needle for me The Worldhonored One unexpectedly came before I will thread for you asked Who are you replied I am the Buddha said Buddha you already have sufcient merit
Do you seek more merit  Should seeking any merit be detestable Aniruddha pondered Even the Buddha still seeks merit to say nothing of an ordinary person became depressed so he quickly looked toward the Buddha
Due to his sincerity he suddenly attained the divine eye
He pondered this again and then attained arhatship
Generally all those who have attained arhatship have three types of eyes rst are the physical eyes second is the divine eye and last is the eye of wisdom
Those who see with all three types of eyes may become confused since the physical eyes compete with the divine eye for merit and renement and coarseness are mixed up
Therefore exclusively used only his divine eye observed the trichiliocosm and saw renement and coarseness completely
Therefore he is called the greatest in having the divine eye
Sixth the lun says
As for why kātyāyana is called the greatest in being good at discerning meanings he merely wanted to collect and write down the store of the Dharma
He thought Human beings are confused in their minds and agitated
They do not concentrate with profound thought So he hid himself in the earth for seven days After collecting and writing down the great Dharma he submitted it to the Buddha
said praising him Good
This is approved by the Sage and is considered to be a collection  The meaning of this is subtle and subdues nonBuddhists
Therefore he is called the greatest 
In addition the Buddha praised The virtuous one is the greatest in eloquence interpretation and elaboration of truth as well as understanding meanings Seventh the lun says
As for why Bakkula is called the one of extreme long life he gave offerings to sixtythousand buddhas in former times he continually acted with benevolence at various buddhas places he always offered kindness to tangible living creatures such as insects that y and wriggle and he never had even the slightest thought to kill them
The Buddha said to nanda As I celebrate my eightieth birthday today I the Tathāgata follow the world and intend to adapt myself to sentient beings I will not reveal any difference from them
Therefore I am eighty years old
Bakkula receives merit for the benevolence  his former existences
Therefore he is a hundred and sixty years old twice as long as 
In the past when Vipaśyin Tathāgata appeared in the world there was an elder who abided in knowledge who virtuously cultivated and whose natural disposition was good and modest
He invited the Buddha and all his disciples and offered the four requisites to them for ninety days
A bhikṣu came to ask for medicine
The elder asked him In what part are you suffering said I have a headache The elder responded to  This must be due to water upon the diaphragm
owed upward and is causing harm to your head
Therefore you have a headache then gave  a fruit called harītakī
After eating it illness was cured
Due to the meritorious reward   has never fallen ill for ninetyone kalpas nanda asked Bakkula Why do you not preach the Dharma for the people
Do you not preach because you do not possess the four kinds of unhindered speech and wisdom replied I am not decient in the four kinds of unhindered speech and I have a quick wit
I am simply delighted with tranquility and unhappy to feel confusion and agitation
Consequently I do not preach the Dharma is therefore the greatest in having a long life and avoiding trouble
Eighth the lun says
As for why Upāli is called the greatest in observance of the precepts he was the tonsure master for ve hundred boys of the ākya clan He did this duty neither lightly nor heavily he removed in a very smooth manner 
The Buddha said to him You are welcome bhikṣu  immediately became a śramaṇa
The Buddha then gave him the precepts and he attained arhatship
Next gave the precepts to the ve hundred boys of the ākya clan and made Upāli a senior monk All the ākya boys said This man was a servant of our family
Due to what condition must we now have to bow to him The Buddha said This is not so
There are no ranks in the Dharma A precursor is considered to be your elder brother
Bow down to him and look up to him incessantly They controlled their impulses and bowed to 
Immediately heaven and earth shook greatly
All the gods above said in praise Good
Today all  the ākya clan subdued their selfconceit
This meaning is beyond our perseverance
Therefore the earth shook for them At the very same time that the ve hundred boys of the ākya clan became Buddhist  there were ninetynine thousand people who also renounced the world and became Buddhist 
From the time Upāli received the precepts from the Buddha he did not violate them even to as small a degree as a hairbreadth
Therefore he is called the greatest in observance of the precepts
Again there was a bhikṣu who lived north of Jeta Grove Monastery
He became ill and did not get any better for a period of six years Upāli went and asked  In what part are you suffering
What is it that you want to use replied There is something I want to use but since it goes against the Buddhas teaching I should not say it said Just speak up
Then you will have no suffering said I think only of wine If I could obtain ve sheng then my sickness will be gone Upāli said Just stay here
I will ask the Buddha for your sake Upāli returned and asked the Buddha There is a bhikṣu who needs wine as medicine for his illness I do not know about this
Should he be able to drink or not The Worldhonored One said The rule I instituted excludes those who are suffering from illness Upāli then returned asked for some wine and gave it to the sick bhikṣu
His illness was gone at once
Additionally preached the Dharma for  who then attained the path of arhatship
The Buddha praised Upāli You asked me about this matter and enabled the sick bhikṣu to recover and to attain the path 
If he had not attained liberation later he would have fallen in the three evil realms and would never have had a chance to escape from there
 You can precisely establish an institution for future bhikṣus
You caused to gain knowledge to a degree of relative importance and were able to save him from a perilous difculty
You really observe the precepts
I will consign the collection of the precepts to you
Do not allow it to be neglected and lost
You must not show it to novices and laypeople Again Upāli is called the greatest 
Ninth the lun says
As for why Nandika Bhikṣu is called the bestlooking  all of the other bhikṣus have characteristics 
āriputra has seven characteristics and Maudgalyāyana has ve
nanda has twenty characteristics
Only Nandika has thirty characteristics
Nandika wore a goldencolored and nanda wore a silvercolored one their garments were radiant
Putting on shoes enchased with gold and holding an almsbowl made of lapis lazuli in his hands entered a city to beg for alms
Everyone who saw him was delighted
Except for the Tathāgata there was no one among all other disciples who could match 
Therefore he is called the bestlooking
mrapālī invited the Buddha
She saw Nandika outside and gave rise to a deep feeling of affection and enjoyment
She worshiped him by bowing her head to his feet and then rubbed with her hands
Even as saw beautiful gure he was peaceful without any feeling or thought 
When  sense each other they indulge in impurity
mrapālīs did not reach  however She doubted if had any thought of desire
The Buddha aware of her intention said to mrapālī Do not give rise to doubt
Nandika will attain arhatship seven days after returning For this reason it is said that knew mind did not change Therefore is called the best
Tenth the lun says
As for why Bhadra Pātaliputra Bhikṣu is called the greatest in dissolving peoples impediment of doubt all the buddhas of the three periods of existence together take the eightyfour thousand to be the way of practice
Sentient beings who have attained the Way do not necessarily practice everything
Among numerous practices they follow that to which they awake and consider it to be their foundation
The reason for this is because sentient beings delements differ from each other
There are more and less in illness and relative severity of delement
For this reason the Tathāgata established several ways to teach
There is a medicine that can cure many diseases or many medicines may be required to cure a single disease
It is just as the six pāramitās unify each other
when one practice is principal all other practices follow it
A single practice is not specialized When many diseases follow one upon another and break out the appropriate medicine should be given according to the cause of each disease
If someone thinks of permanent arising respond to it with impermanence
If one thinks of giving rise to the mind of attachment respond with the mind of emptiness
Just at the moment you undertake to practice with impermanence all practices are of impermanence
It is just as if someone donates to create eightythousand  all the are created through donation
It is also just as among the eight superior qualities of the Tathāgatas voice one quality unies all the eight sounds one sound unies a hundred teachings and one teaching unies a hundred principles
Each mutually undertakes another and reach a huge number
One voice rewards myriad numbers 
Its mutability is just like this
simply speaks and unies all practices His illustrations are also exactly like this
This bhikṣu solely considers simple speech to be the principal practice
Therefore  is called the greatest 
Eleventh the lun says
As for why DevaSubhūti is called the best dressed there were two men called Subhūti among ve hundred disciples one is a royal descendant and the other is from a wealthy family
DevaSubhūti is a royal descendant
He is called Deva because he was continually reborn in heaven for ve hundred generations and he descended from Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven and was reborn in a royal family
 He was spontaneously blessed with adequate food he has never gone hungry
When the Buddha returned to his original country he ordered  to renounce the world
You must live frugally keep your principles content yourselves with plain clothes and coarse goods and take a grass mat as a bed and feces and urine to be medicine This bhikṣu heard the Buddhas rigorous teaching withdrew and intended to return home
The Buddha accepted King Prasenajits invitation
then went to the Buddhas place excused himself from there and returned
nanda said  Just stay the night Subhūti replied How can I stay in a Buddhist facility
I will go to a laypersons house and stay overnight there
I should return home tomorrow nanda said Stay here
Now I must arrange it neatly and properly then went to the kings place
Various sitting mats streamers owers incense oil and solemn decorations were all provided
This bhikṣu was surrounded and stayed overnight
Because everything was suitable for his original intention mind attained concentration
He pondered the Four Noble Truths Late that night he attained arhatship
nanda addressed the Buddha DevaSubhūti has already attained arhatship
Now he can y and oat in the air The Buddha said to nanda There are two kinds in garments those to which you should be close and others to which you should not
If a good garment that you put on increases your aspiration for bodhi  that is what you should be close to
If it decreases your aspiration for bodhi that is what you should not be close to
For this reason nanda some people attain the Way through wearing good garments and some people attain the Way with coarse garments made of piece and scraps from various old clothes
What one realizes lies in his mind and is not restricted by his body and clothing Therefore it is said that DevaSubhūti is the bestdressed
Twelfth the lun says
As for why Rāhula is called greatest in the observance of the precepts without slandering  someone said Rāhula is fond of telling lies and Rāhula likes to get angry because the Buddha gave up the throne of a wheelturning noble king and became a śramaṇa
Shouldnt feel ashamed of himself for going from east to west begging for alms Rāhula disliked the Tathāgata so he made a false statement
If someone asked him about the Tathāgatas whereabouts even if was then in fact at Jeta Grove Monastery he answered  is in Andhavana or if was in fact in Andhavana he answered  is at Jeta Grove Monastery told repeatedly told lies  and deluded visitors
nanda addressed the Buddha Rāhula has told a lie The Buddha summoned Rāhula Did you really tell a lie replied Yes I did indeed The reason why I gave up the throne of the wheelturning noble king is because it is impossible to rely on  everything comes to impermanence
Even if one surely becomes akradevānāmindra or King Brahma it is entirely impossible to maintain  not to mention that of a wheelturning noble king
Would it be possible to rely on it The Buddha continued  O Rāhula
It is impossible to enumerate how many times I have given up this from beginning to end
Do you however still resent me at the present time The Buddha said to Rāhula Go get water and come back Rāhula immediately lled a bowl with water and gave it to the Tathāgata
Taking water from the bowl the Tathāgata said to Rāhula Do you see this water replied I have seen it The Buddha said The water that lls the bowl does not decrease
This can be compared to the observance of the precepts and the perfect possession of them without anything missing Further drained a half of water from the bowl and asked Rāhula Do you see this water replied Yes I do The Buddha said Losing half of this water can be compared to the incomplete possession of the precepts Again drained off the rest of the water completely and then showed the bowl to Rāhula saying Do you see this empty bowl answered I have seen it The Buddha said Violating the precepts completely can be compared to an empty bowl Again he placed the bowl facedown on the ground and showed it  saying Do you see this replied I have seen it The Buddha said One who has already violated the precepts completely must fall into hell
This can be compared to the opening of the bowl facing down into the earth After Rāhula was personally instructed and admonished in this way he never violated the precepts again even to as small a degree as a hairs breadth
Therefore he is called the greatest in observance of the precepts 
Rāhula is also the greatest in the practice of forbearance
Formerly āriputra entered rāvastī with Rāhula to beg for alms
At that time a brahman saw Rāhula following behind and gave rise to an evil intention
He attacked Rāhula hitting his head and blood owed down face
Rāhula immediately gave rise to a malicious thought
I must undertake expedient means and repay this enemy āriputra already aware of thought wiped away the blood and said to Rāhula You should recall your father 
In the past when he was a king a man came and asked him for his eyes so he gouged his eyes out and gave them 
When his hands and legs were cut off he did not feel remorse for that either
Again when he was an elephant he gave his tusks to a man and yet he did not get tired of it either Why do you now give rise to this malicious thought Rāhula heard what said and reproached himself rigorously
Why do I now face with an evil mind He maintained his forbearance as as the earth
He never gave rise to a harmful mind even to as small a degree as a hairsbreadth
At that time the man who attacked Rāhula fell into Avīci Hell
Due to this cause and condition is the greatest in observance of the precepts  and in the practice of forbearance
Thirteenth the lun says
As for why Cūḍapanthaka Bhikṣu who was extremely darkskinned is called the greatest in the ability of transformation  it is truly because the Buddha taught him and caused him to recite the words sao and zhou 
When he intoned zhou he forgot sao when he intoned sao he forgot zhou
For six years he concentrated with his whole mind on the recitation of these words Consequently he realized the meaning
He thought to himself Zhou is hui and sao is chu 
Hui can be precisely compared to the eightfold holy path and fen can be compared to the delements of the three poisons
Cleaning off the delements of the three poisons with the broom of the eightfold holy path is the meaning of sao and zhou
Does it precisely refer to this  He thought deeply about this reasoning his mind ashed and he understood He attained the path of arhatship
Furthermore a brahman called King of Brahma Heaven or Shidian 
He extensively read various books maps and secret books about omens and he was involved in studying everything including astronomy and geography
Therefore he was called Shidian
He considered himself to be highly virtuous So he commanded to debate with him
He said to Cūḍapanthaka Are you able to debate with me Cūḍapanthaka replied I can still debate your grandfather King of the Brahma Heaven let alone you an eyeless blind man The brahman seeking for what meant asked What difference is there between a blind man and an eyeless man Cūḍapanthaka stayed silent and did not answer
I have nothing with which to reply to him Then with his supernatural power of travel he responded to  He soared into the air and sat with crossed legs four zhang and nine chi above the earth
The brahman looked up at and respect arose in his mind
At that time āriputra knew that had exhausted his words and had responded to by manifesting an extraordinary event
If I do not go there will be humiliated and will not be liberated Immediately transformed himself into Cūḍapanthaka through his supernatural power of travel and then caused Cūḍapanthakas original body to disappear
In his transformed gure asked  Are you a heavenly being or a human being answered I am a human being asked again If you are a human being are you male answered Yes I am male Again asked What difference is there between a human being and a male answered There is no difference asked again A human being is a generic name and the word male is on the basis of the body
Why are they no different from each other
A blind man whom I previously mentioned means one who does not see the rewards or retributions for good or evil acts in present and later existences
An eyeless man means one who has no eye of wisdom to cut off delements The brahmans mind was liberated and he attained the pure Dharma eye 
Due to this cause and condition Cūḍapanthaka is called the greatest in transformation This arhat is called the greatest being partially on the basis of a single good point As it is discussed he is the greatest in all true virtue and spiritual liberation As the Zengyi ahan jing says
 One time the Worldhonored One expounded the precepts on the fteenth day when the entire bhikṣu sangha and a group of ve hundred bhikṣus visited Anavatapta from Jeta Grove Monastery
At that time the dragon king  came to the Worldhonored Ones place He worshiped by bowing his head to feet and then took a seat to one side
saw that many bhikṣus lled the place and said āriputra is not here The Buddha said to Maudgalyāyana Go quickly to āriputras place and give him my message Maudgalyāyana received instruction and went to rāvastī
He said to āriputra The Buddha summons you
The dragon king Anavatapta wishes to have a chance to see you āriputra took off the sash of his saṃkakṣikā by himself and put it before Maudgalyāyana
He said to Maudgalyāyana If you have the supernatural power of travel lift up this sash and tie it  Maudgalyāyana picked up the sash but he could not move it
When he exerted all his powers to lift it the entire earth shook greatly
āriputra then lifted  Maudgalyāyana fastened to the eastern continent Pūrva videha
Then bound to Mount Sumeru
Maudgal yāyana then lifted and moved Mount Sumeru
āriputra again bound the sash to the Tathāgatas seat
Maudgalyāyana consequently could not move it let go of the sash and returned to the dragon kings place
He saw āriputra in the distance who had already arrived and was sitting with crossed legs before 
Thinking continuously before  Maudgalyāyana addressed the Buddha Have I lost my supernatural power of travel
How did āriputra who left later than I did arrive here before I did The Buddha said  has not receded
It is only because āriputra has great wisdom The Buddha said to Maudgalyāyana Many bhikṣus have no respect for you
They say that āriputras supernatural power of travel surpasses yours
You should therefore reveal your awesome power here among the assembly of bhikṣus replied to  I receive your instruction He immediately rose from his seat and went to the summit of Mount Sumeru
He trod on the top of the mountain with his foot raised his other foot and placed it upon Brahma Heaven
He kicked Mount Sumeru and caused the earth to quake in six times
At that time all the bhikṣus exclaimed at the unprecedented event
When Maudgalyāyana spoke in verse because of this sixty bhikṣus exhausted their delements and their minds were liberated
Moreover the Wenshushili panniepan jing says
The Buddha said to Bhadrapāla Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī has great compassion
He was born in the Brāhṃapuṇyatva brahman family of Tāla village in this country
At the time of his birth his house transformed into one like a lotus ower
He emerged from his mothers right armpit and his body was purplishgold in color
When he descended to the earth he could already speak
Just like a heavenly youth a canopy of the seven treasures was suspended above him
All ninetyve types of debaters were incapable of responding to him
In the Buddhas place he renounced the world and studied the Way
He abided in the śūraṃgamasamādhi 
Four hundred and fty years after the Buddhas nirvana came to the Himalayas where he exalted the twelve kinds of scriptures for ve hundred hermits
After edifying and causing them to abide in the stage of nonretrogression on the path to realizing highest perfect enlightenment he returned to his birthplace
Under a nyagrodha tree in a marsh in an open eld he sat with crossed legs and entered the śūraṃgamasamādhi
Golden light radiated from all pores of the skin of his body and illuminated all over the worlds of the ten directions He liberated those who had created the conditions 
 his body was just like a purplishgold mountain
He was exactly one zhang and six chi tall
A halo manifested majestically Its surface equaled one fathom in diameter
Within the halo were ve hundred transformed buddhas and each of the transformed buddhas had ve transformed bodhisattvas as attendants The Buddha said to Bhadrapāla Mañjuśrī possesses immeasurable supernatural powers and transformations which are impossible to completely explain
If there are sentient beings who merely hear the name of Mañjuśrī their sin of transmigration in birth and death will be removed for one billion two hundred million kalpas
If there are those who worship and give offerings to him in every rebirth they will always be reborn in a buddha land
If someone has been unable to see  he must hold fast to recitation of the ūraṃgamasamādhi and call the name of Mañjuśrī for seven days and Mañjuśrī will certainly come to that person
If someone has hindrances due to actions committed in previous existences he will be able to see in a dream
Those who can see in a dream if they seek to become a śrāvaka in the present existence they will attain the srotaāpattiphala or anāgāmiphala because they have seen Mañjuśrī
If those who have renounced the world see  they will achieve arhatship in one day and night because they could see 
If there are those who deeply believe in the Mahayana sutras the Dharma Prince  will expound the profound Dharma for them in the midst of meditation
To those who are frequently deluded will speak the meaning of truth in their dreams and cause them to become stable and attain the stage of nonretrogression to proceed to the highest path
After my nirvana some sentient beings who can hear the name of Mañjuśrī or who see his image will not fall into evil realms for a hundred or a thousand kalpas
If there are those who hold fast to recitation of the name of Mañjuśrī even if they have grave hindrances they will not fall into the atrocious raging ames of Avīci Hell
They will be continually reborn in other pure lands meet a buddha hear the Dharma and attain the clear cognition of the unproduced nature of all existences  Furthermore the Xianyu jing says
The Buddha resided on Vulture Peak near Rājagṛha
At that time the king of Vārāṇasī was called Brahmadatta
The king had a prime minister who had just had a new baby boy
fully possessed all the marks of physical excellence and his body was purplishgold in color
appearance was remarkable and extraordinary
Seeing his son the prime ministers joy was redoubled
Previously the temperament of the mother was neither capable nor good
Since the time she became pregnant she felt sad and sorry for others hardships mercifully beneted people and protected and supported them with a mind of equality 
The father invited a physiognomist and asked him to foretell fortune through reading his physical marks and signs
When saw he was happy Accordingly he established an alias  his pseudonym was Maitreya
That boy was exceptionally praised circulated throughout the land
The king heard them and he was very afraid that usurp the throne
He learned that had not yet come of age and thought  must be put to death in advance immediately ordered the prime minister I have heard that you have a son whose appearance has extraordinary characteristics
You should bring him here
I would like to see him At that time someone in the palace came to the father
The father became aware of the kings avaricious scheme and he fell into great misery The boy had an uncle called Bāvarī the most reverend priest in Bopofuluo state
 He was sharp lofty learned intelligent prominent and very talented
Five hundred disciples always followed him sought his advice and received his commands
At that time the prime minister felt pity and love for his son and was fearful that his son would be killed
He secretly made a plan He dispatched a man to put on an elephant and send 
The uncle met and saw appearance was good
He raised with love paying special attention Looking at him with respect had a thought
The boy gradually grew up and got older taught and had him engage in study
the boys seeking advice and receiving instructions for one day surpassed those of other people for an entire year
In his studies before one year passed he had understood all the classic books
 At that time Bāvarī saw that his sisters son had mastered all the books even though he had not studied for a very long time intended to hold an assembly for to praise his virtue
sent one of his disciples to Vārāṇasī to talk with the prime minister and tell him what his son had studied
asked for jewelry and valuables with which he intended to arrange the assembly
That disciple had gone halfway when he heard that people spoke of the Buddhas immeasurable virtuous conduct
He longed for and wanted to go see him
Immediately went to the Buddhas place however before reaching the midpoint he was eaten by a tiger
Due to the advantage of his virtue he was reborn in the heaven of the four heavenly kings the rst 
Bāvarī then used all of his possessions to arrange the assembly for 
All the gathered and when the arranged assembly had come to an end the property was given to 
One person obtained ve hundred gold coins
After all the property and goods were exhausted a brahman called Raudrākṣa was the last to arrive 
 Only I alone was not able to have a meal
Just give me ve hundred gold coins Raudrākṣa further said I have heard that you planned offering property and food Why has all already been exhausted
If you surely reject me and I am not given anything more in seven days your head will break into seven pieces At that time Bāvarī fearfully  There are evil curses as well as other paths in which spells are cast over people
This matter should not be taken lightly He was deeply afraid of the threat
His former disciple who had previously served as a messenger and who had been reborn in heaven after death saw from far away that his teacher was unhappy and haggard and had nothing on which to rely
Immediately he descended from heaven and came before  and asked him Why are you so sad The teacher extensively explained 
The heavenly being addressed the teacher Raudrākṣa does not know of mūrdhaavasthā 
He is a stupid deluded evil man
What can he do in the end However you are worried about this
At present there is only the Buddha who superlatively elucidates mūrdhaavasthā
He is the innite Dharma King
Especially you should take refuge in him At that time Bāvarī heard the heavenly being speak of the Buddha so he again asked  What kind of a person is the Buddha The heavenly being explained The Buddhas merit and wisdom are incalculable
He currently resides on Vulture Peak near Rājagṛha When Bāvarī heard exclaimed the Buddhas virtue he thought to himself He must be the one recorded in my book as the sage who was born just when the constellation Puṣya appeared and heaven and earth greatly moved
Now everything matches this  He immediately ordered sixteen people including Maitreya Go and see the major and minor marks of his physical excellence
Think to debate him  How many marks of physical excellence do you think our teacher Bāvarī has
How old is he
What family background is he from
How many disciples does he have If can answer and he knows all he must be the Buddha
You must send one disciple to me and report the information to me Maitreya and the others went to Rājagṛha and approached Vulture Peak
They saw the Buddhas light various wonders and all of the astonishing marks of physical excellence of the Buddha
They were more and more delighted and respectfully carried out their teachers order From far away they tried to debate tacitly
The Buddha responded to them from the distance
Everything was correct
They gave rise to deep respect for him
After they had worshiped by bowing their heads to his feet the Buddha expounded the Dharma for them Fifteen people among attained the pure Dharma eye and sought to renounce the world
The Buddha said You are welcome  The beards and hair  spontaneously fell off and they donned Dharma robes
again expounded the Dharma achieved arhatship
Among the sixteen disciples there was a man whose alias was Piṅgiya
He was Bāvarīs elder sisters son and the one who was sent back to report the information 
He returned to his homeland and told everything that he had heard and seen
Bāvarī was happy to hear it
He got up from his seat and kneeled upright with palms joined
Facing toward Rājagṛha he sincerely begged the Buddha I pray only that you could oblige me by coming to see me and save me The Tathāgata was aware from the distance
As quickly as the time it takes to bend and stretch out ones arm appeared before 
On raising his head after bowing saw the Buddha and was pleasantly surprised
The Buddha expounded the Dharma for him attained the anāgāmiphala
At that time the Worldhonored One soon returned to Vulture Peak Only Maitreya alone did not accept the minor fruition Instead he made a vow for the great aspiration 
His purpose and interest were enlightenment The Buddha said to all the bhikṣus In the future this land of Jambudvīpa will be a regular square space at and wide without mountains and rivers
On the ground soft grass will grow will be just like a heavenly robe
At that time peoples life spans will be eightyfour thousand years They will be eight zhang tall
Their uprightness will be extremely wonderful
The people will be kind and peaceful in nature They will completely cultivate the ten wholesome acts
At that time there will be a wheelturning noble king called aṅkah
 On that occasion in a brahman family a boy will be reborn
The boys alias is Maitreya
His body is purplishgold in color and will possess all of the thirtytwo major marks and all minor marks of physical excellence The light will be particularly bright
He will renounce the world study the Way and achieve highest right perfect enlightenment
He will extensively turn the noble Dharma wheel for sentient beings
He will liberate a category of nine billion three hundred million sentient beings at his rst great assembly nine billion one hundred million at the second assembly and nine billion at the third great assembly
Those who are able to attain liberation through the Dharma preached in these three assemblies are all of the sentient beings who will plant seeds of merit in the Dharma left by me
All people will be able to be present at those three assemblies nanda addressed the Buddha I am not convinced
How was the name Maitreya established The Buddha replied In the remotest past he learned the concentration on benevolence 
His stable mind is soft and tender Moreover he has no malicious intent
Therefore his alias is Maitreya As for the Sanskrit name Maitreya it means the buddha family of benevolence
Maitreya is also a family name
Other sutras say that in the past there was a buddha whose alias was Maitreya
One who had met the buddha made a vow to have the same name Maitreya
As for the alias Ajita it means to be wusheng 
His intelligence goes beyond that of others
Therefore he is called Wusheng  Verses say  If virtuous ones follow the profound liberation Those who left home in their youth ascend into the air  If a teacher has thorough knowledge his disciples will give rise to aspiration by themselves Mystic light shines upon those related  In responding to wonders everyone differs The Sages book is the same as the signs and marks that portend good fortune takes advantage of heaven and accords to the virtue of heaven  His outstanding sound is clear throughout the trichiliocosm The Dharma drum rouses the profound teaching A dragon ies and responds to human and heavenly beings undisturbed wisdom is profound and extremely subtle Far and faintly he sings what is extremely profound He circumambulates the fortyninestoried Maṇi Palace  With good fortune he arrives at the central banner Sustaining his appearance with the thirtytwo major marks of physical excellence He will be shining and luxuriant in the Majestic Grove Garden 
Miracle Stories Just as in the school of Daosheng or Sengzhao or the class of Fotudeng or Daoan there are many great virtuous people who are discussed in a separate chapter in order to avoid complication and duplication Therefore just two stories are briey quoted here During the time of the Jin dynasty Kumārajīva was in Changan
He was called Tongshou here 
He was a man from India
His family had been ministers through successive generations
Kumārajīvas grandfather Kumāradatta  had the great aspiration and remained apart from others and his name was valued in his country
Kumārajīvas father Kumārayāna was sharp and had virtuous delity
When Kumārayāna succeeded to the position of minister he declined and renounced the world
He headed east and crossed the Pamirs
The king of Kucha heard that had given up his honorable  and revered him with admiration
went out to the outskirts of the capital city to personally meet him on arrival and asked him to become the Most Reverend Priest 
The king had a sister who had just turned twenty years old
She was talented and intelligent she could understand whatever she took in with a single glance and could recite from memory whatever she had heard only once
Furthermore she had a red mole on her body which indicates the fate of giving birth to a sagacious son
Royal families of various countries asked for her in marriage but she did not accept any of their offers
When she saw Ku māra yāṇa she wished with all her heart to take him as 
So forced him to marry her Before long she became pregnant with Kumārajīva
While Kumārajīva was in her womb the mothers intelligence and comprehensive faculties doubled
She heard that ahra Great Temple had already produced many eminent monks and moreover there were monks who had attained the Buddhist Way
 Along with noblewomen of the royal family and many nuns of virtuous conduct she held a religious service asked for purication and listened to the Dharma for many days
Kumārajīvas mother suddenly and spontaneously became procient in the Indian language
No matter how difcult the expressions of questions were she denitively mastered their profound principles
All the people admired her
Dharmaghoṣa Arhat said This lady must have conceived a sagacious child and he told her of the miracle of āriputra when he was in his mothers womb
After Kumārajīva was born however his mother forgot what she had been told previously
After a while she wished to renounce the world but her husband did not allow her to do so
Thereupon she gave birth to another boy called Puṣyadeva 
Incidentally later went out of town and traveled for sightseeing and she saw some driedout bones scattered here and there in a graveyard
She then pondered the origin of suffering and decided to seek to renounce the world
She made a vow to never eat and drink if she was not allowed to take the tonsure
On the night of the sixth day her energy was weak and exhausted and it was doubtful if she could live to the next morning
Her husband fearful of this then allowed her 
Since she had not yet received the tonsure she still would not eat
Accordingly ordered someone to shave her head and she nally took food and drink
The next morning she received the precepts and then began meditation practice and concentrated all her effort on the practice She was not negligent in her studies and attained the rst fruit of the four stages of sainthood
Kumārajīva renounced the world at the age of seven accompanied by 
Following a teacher monk he received sutras He recited one thousand verses in a day
There are thirtytwo syllables in a verse so he recited thirtytwo thousand syllables in total 
had already nished reciting the Abhidharma and a teacher gave him the meanings
He immediately mastered them nothing was obscure and everything was easily understood
At that time the people of Kucha offered much benet and support to since his mother was the kings sister
Accordingly his mother guided him in order to avoid 
When Kumārajīva was nine years old he followed his mother crossed the Indus River and arrived at Kaśmīra where he met the highest virtue Dharma teacher Bandhudatta a cousin of the king of Kaśmīra had profound and perfect knowledge and was broadminded
Talented sharp and erudite he was unrivaled at the time
He was completely versed in the Tripiṭaka and the nine kinds of scriptures
From morning until noon he handcopied one thousand verses and from noon until the evening he also recited one thousand verses
His name spread throughout the countries and the people regardless of where they were considered him to be their teacher
Kumārajīva came to and immediately revered with great courtesy as his teacher
received from him the Kṣudrakapiṭaka and two kinds of gama sutras the Madhya māgama and the Dīrghāgama altogether four million syllables  Bandhudatta always praised Kumārajīva for his outstanding talent
Consequently reputation reached the king 
The king immediately invited 
He gathered nonBuddhist disputants for to debate
When  rst began to exchange words with  they thought little of him since he was so young and their speech was very arrogant
Kumārajīva took advantage of their weakness and defeated them
The nonBuddhist disputers submitted to him Ashamed of themselves and regretful they were left with nothing to say
The king respected and marveled at more and more
He gave him the salted and dried meat of a pair of geese three pecks each of nonglutinous rice and our and six sheng of milk per day
This was a traditional votive offering of a foreign country 
The abbot of the temple where resided sent ve senior monks and ten novices to take care of and clean  just as if they were own disciples
He was greatly revered in this way 
When turned twelve years old his mother took him back to Kucha
All the various countries invited him offering good noble titles but Kumārajīva did not care about any of that at all
At that time Kumārajīvas mother led him to the Northern Hill of the Yueshi tribe
An arhat saw and felt that he was unusual The arhat told his mother You should protect this novice always
If he does not violate the precepts until the age of thirtyve he will cause the Buddhist Dharma to ourish greatly and will liberate innumerable people
He will be no different than Upagupta
 If he is unable to observe the precepts completely he will not be able to accomplish anything great and will be merely nothing more than a talented and superior scholar monk Kumārajīva further advanced and arrived at Kashgar
He carried a Buddhist almsbowl upon his head and thought This bowl is very large in size
Why is it so light Then  the bowl became too heavy 
So he unexpectedly cried out and put it down
His mother asked him why he had done so
He replied Because I have prejudiced views I merely feel that the bowl is light and then heavy After all Kumārajīva stayed in Kashgar for a year
That winter he recited the Abhidharma
Regarding various chapters such as chapters on The Ten Gates and The Cultivation of Intelligence  there was nothing he had to be instructed about and he mastered the marvelous principles
Moreover concerning all elds of the six fundamental discourses  nothing of them was unclear to him
In Kashgar there was a śramaṇa named Priyadarśana  who was well versed in all the three divisions of the Buddhist teaching
told the king You must not underestimate this novice
Your Majesty you should ask him to open the Dharma gate  for the rst time Generally there are two merits for this
First śramaṇas in this country will feel ashamed of themselves for being inferior to him and will certainly be encouraged 
Second the king of Kucha must be thinking  is from my country and is respected in that country 
This means that my country is respected He will then surely come to have a friendly relationship with this country The king approved of this
A great assembly was arranged and Kumārajīva was asked to ascend the raised seat and expound the Dharmacakrapravartanasūtra 
The king of Kucha as had been expected sent an envoy in order to reward for his friendship 
In between periods of expounding the Dharma Kumārajīva looked for nonBuddhist scriptures and learned the Vedaśataśāstra well
He claried many issues such as diction composition and question and answer
He read widely the scriptures of the four Vedas  and all of the commentaries on the ve elds of studies 
 He studied the arts of yinyang and astrology everything was investigated thoroughly
He was wondrously procient in fortunetelling what he said matched the fact just as two pieces of a tally t together
He possessed a generous nature
Kumārajīva rst learned Hinayana and later specialized in Mahayana 
He lamented I formerly learned Hinayana 
I was just like someone who does not recognize gold but considers brass to be wonderful Accordingly he widely sought the essence of principles
He received and recited the Zhong lun and the Bailun  as well as the Shiermen lun and others
Soon following his mother Kumārajīva moved on to Akush  the northern boundary of Kucha
At that time a brahman in Akush had a marvelous uent tongue and was outstanding his name pervaded various countries
He personally beat the drum of the royal palace and made an oath If anyone who debates bests me I will accept being beheaded to apologize to him Kumārajīva had already arrived examined the two principles thoroughly The brahman immediately became confused and dazed
He bowed his head to the ground and took refuge in 
Thereafter rose in fame in the area east of the Pamirs and his honor spread throughout the area beyond the Yellow River
The king of Kucha went to Akush in person greeted Kumārajīva and returned to the country with him
extensively expounded various sutras
Scholars in remote countries in the four directions held him in high esteem there was no one who could oppose him
At that time there was a princess who had become a nun
Her pseudonym was Akṣayamati
She read extensively many sutras In particular she had profound knowledge of the heart of meditation
She said she had been certied as having attained the second fruit 
When she heard the Dharma she was greatly happy
She then set up a great assembly and asked for the essence of the Mahayana sutras
Kumārajīva explained for that all phenomenal things are entirely empty and there is no self and that the discernment of in the sensory realm are merely provisional names they are not reality  At that time none among the audience in the assembly was not moved and impressed and all the people regretted that they had taken so much time to awaken
When turned twenty years old he received the precepts  in the royal palace
He learned the Shisong l from Vimalākṣa 
 Soon after Kumārajīvas mother was to leave for India
She said to Bo Chun the king of Kucha Your country is gradually declining
I am now leaving for India where I will advance up to the third fruit  Before departing she told Kumārajīva The profound teaching of Mahayana must be widely propagated in China To transmit it to the eastern land depends only on your power
There is however no benet for yourself in doing so
What do you think you should do Kumārajīva replied The way of the mahāsattva lies in beneting others without thinking of oneself
If I can surely transmit the great edication  and help enlighten ignorant people even if my body experiences the suffering of boiling in a cauldron over a re I will have no regrets So stayed in Kucha and resided at xin Temple
Later in the former palace near the temple the text of the Fangguang jing was found for the rst time
rst picked it up unrolled it and was reading it when a devil came and covered over some passages of the scripture so that it looked like a blank sheet of paper
Kumārajīva realized that this was the work of a devil and redoubled his vow
The devil left and the inscriptions reappeared
then repeatedly recited them
Again he heard a voice in the air You are a man who has plenty of knowledge
Why do you need to read this Kumārajīva answered You are a minor devil You should promptly leave 
My mind is as stable as the earth
You cannot move it stayed for three years during which time he extensively recited Mahayana sutras and discourses and he claried the secret principles 
The king of Kucha had a lion seat of gold made for and spread a cushion covered in Chinese brocade on it
bade Kumārajīva to ascend the seat and expound the Dharma
Kumārajīva said however My teacher has not yet understood Mahayana Buddhism
I would like to go in person and teach him with respect and courtesy
I will not be able to stay here Suddenly Great Master Bandhudatta came without reference to the long distance 
The king said O Great Master
Why did you come all this way from such a distance Bandhudatta replied First I have heard that what my disciple realized is uncommon
Second Your Majesty you propagate and praise the Buddhist Way
Therefore I traveled  braving difculties and dangers to come all the way to your country Kumārajīva was able to welcome his teacher and was glad that he could fulll his longcherished plan
He expounded for the Sutra on the Virtuous Womans Questions   and fully claried that arise from causes and conditions they are empty and false This was something that both he and his teacher had not believed in formerly
Therefore explained it rst
The teacher asked Kumārajīva What different characteristics did you nd in Mahayana by which you have come to esteem it Kumārajīva replied Mahayana Buddhism is profound and pure and claries that all existing things have no reality while Hinayana is onesided and is very much stagnant in name and form  The teacher said You explain that all things are entirely empty
This is a very frightening theory
Why have you given up the view that all things exist and stick to the view that everything is empty
You are just like the insane man of former times who ordered a spinning artisan to make beautiful yarn extremely thin and highquality yarn
The spinning artisan paid special attention and made yarn as thin as ne dust yet the insane man still resented that the yarn was too thick
The spinning artisan became very angry and said pointing into the air This is thin yarn The insane man asked Why is it invisible The spinning artisan said This yarn is extremely ne
Even a skilled worker of my studio cannot see it
How could other people see it The insane man was very happy and paid money to the spinning artisan who imitated  too
All the workers received a good payment but in fact they had produced nothing
Your teaching of emptiness follows this  Kumārajīva then explained it again giving similar cases in succession
They earnestly traded questions and answers
More than a month passed Only then was convinced
The teacher said in wonderment This is something that I your teacher could not master yet to the contrary you my disciple have opened up my determination I verify it right now He then bowed to Kumārajīva and had him for his teacher said O upādhyāya
You are my teacher of Mahayana  and I am the upādhyāyas teacher of Hinayana  All people in the countries of the Western Region completely admired Kumārajīvas excellent talent
Every time gave a talk all the kings of various countries knelt upright to the side of the raised seat requiring Kumārajīva to step on them in order to ascend the seat
He was valued in this way Kumārajīvas teaching owed throughout the Western Region and his reputation reached the Eastern River  At that time Fu Jian was a pretender to the throne in Guanzhong 
In the foreign regions there were the king of Qianbu and the younger brother of the king of Kucha They came together and offered a tribute to Jian who granted an audience to them
These two royal members said to Jian In the Western Region many rare and precious things are produced
Please dispatch troops and subjugate the region
Then we will submit ourselves to you In the rst month of the year of Dingchou the thirteenth year of Jianyuan  the Grand Astrologer reported to  A star appears in the celestial sphere above the foreign countries
There must be a person of great virtue and a wise person who will come to help China Fu Jian said I have heard of Kumārajīva in the Western Region and ramaṇa Daoan in Xiangyang
Could it mean these people He immediately sent messengers to nd them
In the second month of the seventeenth year  the king of Milan the king of Qianbu and others again talked to and asked him to dispatch troops to subjugate the Western Region
In the ninth month of the eighteenth year  Fu Jian sent Cavalry General L Guang and the Lingjiang General Jiang Fei who led the king of Qianbu the king of Turfan and others and commanded seventy thousand soldiers to subjugate the countries in the west such as Kucha and Karashahr
When departed Fu Jian held a farewell dinner for L Guang at the Jianzhang Palace
Jian said to Guang The sovereign rules over the world in accordance with the mandate of Heaven and considers his affection for the people as if they were his own children to be the foundation
How could he covet other lands and subjugate them
is precisely because he wants to nd one who has the true teaching in mind
I have heard of Kumārajīva in the Western Region who deeply understands the essential nature of things is well versed in yin and yang and is the head of the scholars of later generations
I admire him very much
Those who are outstanding in virtue and learning are the great treasures of the country
If you gain victory over Kucha swiftly send Kumārajīva by stagecoach to me Before L
Guangs troops arrived Kumārajīva warned the king of Kucha Bo Chun Fortune has deserted this country
There is a formidable enemy
The people of the national capital are coming from the east
You should respectfully cater to them Do not oppose their vanguard Chun however did not listen to him and fought against 
Guang consequently defeated Kucha killed Chun and made Zhen Bo Chuns younger brother the ruler
Guang had already obtained Kumārajīva but he did not infer how intelligent was
He saw that was still young
So he made fun of and treated him as an ordinary person
On the way back  Guang halted his troops at the foot of a hill where the ofcers and soldiers were already resting
Kumārajīva said  You should not stay here you will certainly nd yourself in a difcult position
You had better move your forces to the hilltop Guang however did not accept his admonition
When night came just as had warned it rained heavily and oods suddenly arose
The water became several zhang deep and the fatalities numbered in the several tens of thousands
Guang secretly thought for the rst time that was indeed extraordinary
Kumārajīva said to Guang This is an unfortunate place You must not stay here long I inferred our misfortune and foresaw our fate
You should promptly order  Go back  On your way back I am sure that there will be a land of good fortune in which you can reside Guang followed 
When they arrived at Liangzhou  they heard that Fu Jian had already been killed by Yao Chang  clothes and advance south of the city
then usurped the title of ruler outside of Hangu Pass and the era was named Taian
In the rst month of the second year of Taian  a gale blew in Guzang  Kumārajīva said This is an inauspicious wind
There will be a vicious riot but it will be spontaneously settled without much trouble Later Kumārajīvas prediction of this event was veried
Kumārajīva stayed in Liangzhou for years Since L
Guang and his son did not propagate the Way profound views were kept within him he had no chance to propagate the teaching
Fu Jian had already died so he and did not see each other after all
When Yao Chang usurped the throne in Guanzhong he also heard of high reputation and disinterestedly requested to come to 
Because Kumārajīva possessed deep tactical skill and understood various things L
s family was afraid that he would contrive plots to benet Yao  So was not allowed to go into the eastern land When Chang died and his son Xing succeeded the throne again made a sincere request
In the third month of the third year of the Hongshi era during Xings reign trees with interlocking branches sprang up in the imperial court and in the Peripatetic Garden scallions were transformed into leeks 
thought these were good omens saying A wise man must be coming In the fth month Xing dispatched Shide a lord of Longxi to subjugate L Long in the west Longs troops were utterly defeated
In the ninth month Long presented a memorial to Xing and surrendered
Finally could greet Kumārajīva who entered Guanzhong arrived at Changan on the twentieth of the tenth month of that year
 Xing treated with due honors as the Most Reverend Priest
was extremely favored
Whenever met they alked to each other for an entire day
When they examined the niceties to reach the ultimate they spent a year tirelessly
From the time the great Dharma reached the east and began during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Later Han dynasty it went through the Wei dynasty and the Jin dynasty  and the sutras and discourses gradually increased
Most of the texts translated by Zhi and Zhu  however were literally incomprehensible and regulated with the principles of Daoist philosophy
 Xing worshiped the Three Treasures from the time he was young
With an earnest intention he gathered people to talk 
After Kumārajīva arrived and stayed in Changan asked him to go to the Western Light Pavilion and the Peripatetic Garden and translate numerous sutras
Kumārajīva had already recited most of them from memory and there was nothing he had not thoroughly studied
He became  competent in the Chinese language and his transliteration was uent and appropriate
He looked at the texts of old translations and found many mistakes in meanings
This was entirely because the texts translated previously had failed to follow their purpose and did not correspond to Sanskrit texts
Xing arranged for more than eight hundred monks such as the śramaṇas Sengle Sengqian Faqin Daoliu Daoheng Daobiao Seng rui and Sengzhao to inquire and receive instructions on the doctrines from Kumārajīva
Furthermore he had the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra translated
Kumārajīva held the Sanskrit text in his hands Xing took the old translation sutra in his hands and they collated one with the other
The meanings newly translated  which were different from the old translation completely made sense
All the people were satised with them and submitted willingly to him everyone joyfully praised him
Xing thought The Buddhist Way is profound and all the practices are entirely wholesome
It is truly a good ferry to escape from suffering
It is the great law to govern the world Therefore Xing felt some inclination toward the nine kinds of scriptures and thought deeply about the twelve kinds of scriptures
He then composed the Discourse on Understanding Thoroughly the Three Periods of Existence in order to encourage  and show the law of cause and effect
All of the people under the princes respectfully praised his way of edication
Xian the Great General and Duke of Changshang and Song the Left Army General and Marquis of Ancheng deeply believed in the Buddhist Dharma
They often invited Kumārajīva to the Great Temple in Changan to speak on new sutras Kumārajīva translated both Mahayana and Hinayana sutras and discourses one after another more than three hundred ninety fascicles in total
The titles of his translations are listed in another biography of him
They all clearly reveal the mysterious origin of the teaching and illuminate the profound principles
At that time righteous people most certainly gathered from throughout the four directions regardless of distance
grand work lasts long it is still admired as the model today
Among the Buddhist monks and laypeople who came from every direction there were outstanding people such as Shi Huiyuan 
had learned numerous sutras thoroughly and was a leader of the edication of the teaching left by 
His time however was far distant from that of the Sage  and he could not settle some doubtful points of the doctrines
Therefore he wrote a letter and asked questions to 
When people have an audience with a sovereign  they certainly praise his virtue
In the rites to see the Buddha singing praises is considered to be valuable
The gāthās and ślokas used in sutras are all examples of this
Through merely translating Sanskrit texts into Chinese however much of the elegance and grace  is lost
Even though the gist is retained are very different from in their literary style
It is just as if one chews some food and then gives it to someone else not only loses its taste but also causes the other person to feel ill once composed verses and presented them to ramaṇa Fahe
The mind a mountain produces the highest virtue and oating fragrance spreads throughout ten thousand yojanas
The luan bird that cries sorrowfully perches alone on a paulownia tree and the clear sound of his cries reaches the highest point of heaven
ten verses in total
The literary style of all  was like this
Kumārajīva was originally fond of Mahayana Buddhism and his determination lay in promulgating it
He often lamented If I put pen to paper and write the Abhidharma of Mahayana  what Kātyāyanīputra wrote ie the Apitan bajieandu lun T  and the Apitan piposha lun T  will be nothing compared to it
At present in China those who have profound knowledge about this are few
I will give up writing here
What do I have left to discuss stopped writing sadly
He wrote only two fascicles of the Discourse on Ultimate Reality for Yao Xings sake and annotated the Vimalakīrti nirdeśasūtra
The words that came out of his mouth formed a complete composition there was nothing to correct and delete
His literary style was smooth and courteous and everything was profound and subtle
As for Kumārajīvas personality his frame of mind was clean and pure and his selfcondence stood conspicuous
He understood everything according to circumstances Few people could match him
He had a generous nature he was benevolent and generous He kept philanthropy in mind
He effaced himself and was good at inducing others  doing so tirelessly all day long
Lord Yao always said to Kumārajīva O Great Master
You are sharp and incomparably awakened There is none equal to you in the entire world
When you leave this world one day how can you depart with no one to inherit the Dharma seed Furthermore Beidu Bhikṣu who resided in Pengcheng heard that Kumārajīva was in Changan
He lamented It has been more than three hundred years since I separated from this boy for my amusement
I have heard nothing from him and I have not met him again
I only hope that I will have a chance to meet him in my next existence Before his death Kumārajīva realized that the four great elements would not recover from illness
He said I wish that all that I have translated will be transmitted and circulate in later ages and that it all will be greatly popular
Today before many people I make a sincere vow
If in what I have transmitted there is no mistake then my tongue will not be burned even after my body is cremated On the twentieth day of the eighth month of the eleventh year of Hongshi of the Later Qin dynasty passed away in Changan
This was the fth year of Yixi of the Jin dynasty
Immediately in the Peripatetic Garden following foreign customs his body was cremated
The rewood burned completely and his body was reduced to ash and bone but his tongue was not destroyed
In Xin Temple in Jiangling of the Song dynasty there was Shi Faxian whose secular family name was Gong
He was a man from Wuyang in Pinyang prefecture 
His determination and conduct were intelligent and diligent and in upholding the rules of deportment he was orderly and majestic
He frequently lamented the disorder and shortage of sutras and Vinayas So he became determined to seek them out
In the third year of the Longan era of the Jin dynasty along with his monk colleagues including Huijing Daozheng Huiying and Huiwei left Changan for the west and crossed the quicksand
There were no birds ying above and no animals running on land below
They saw nothing but emptiness all around there were no landmarks to help determine where to go
They conjectured the direction of east or west only by observing the sun and just indicated their course by human bones
There were frequent gusts of hot air and evil spirits
If anyone encountered them he would die
xian entrusted himself to  left himself to fate and passed through dangerous areas
After a while arrived at the Pamirs  where the snow accumulates all year round
There was an evil dragon that emitted a poisonous wind and rained down pebbles and grit
Crossing the mountain pass was dangerous and the cliffs stood a thousand ren high  There were roads that had been made in the past by cutting rocks alongside of which wooden stairways were attached
crossed altogether more than seven hundred such places
Furthermore they had to walk on a hanging braided rope bridge cross rivers at more than several tens of spots
All of these were places that Zhang Qian and Gan Fu of the Han dynasty had never reached
Subsequently they crossed over a snowcovered mountain where they encountered a freezing wind that suddenly came up
Huijing could not speak and shuddered   He could not advance
He said to xian I will die here
You should go on and leave me
We cannot die together As soon as he uttered these words he passed away
xian patted and said in tears It was his fate that he could not accomplish his original intention
What can I do now So he kept traveling alone through his own effort and passed through the dangerous mountain area
He traveled through more than forty countries altogether and was about to reach India
There was a temple more than thirty li from Rājagṛha was passing by there as the evening closed in
xian intended to visit Vulture Peak 
A monk of the temple warned him against going there and said The road is very difcult and there are many obstructions Moreover there are many black lions that have often eaten people
How will you be able to reach there xian replied I have already traveled over several tens of thousands of from a great distance and I made a vow to go to Vulture Peak
We cannot expect our life and we cannot keep breathing 
How could I give up when I have already come this far with sincerity I have cherished for many years
Even though there are dangers and difculties I am not afraid of them Many people tried to stop him but none could
Accordingly two monks  and they saw them off
xian had already arrived at the Vulture Peak in the dusk of the evening
So he intended to stay overnight
The two monks felt misgivings about this so they abandoned and went back
xian stayed alone on the mountain where he burned incense and worshiped
He longed dearly for the distant at the old site just as seeing the sacred image 
At midnight three black lions appeared and they approached and crouched down in front of xian They licked their lips waving their tails
xian chanted a sutra without cessation and thought of the Buddha wholeheartedly
The lions then lowered their heads dropped their tails and prostrated themselves at of xians feet
xian patted them with his hands and said an incantation If you want to kill me just wait until I nish chanting 
If you are here to test me you should withdraw from this place The lions left after a while
Next morning he returned 
The road was difcult and dark with many obstructions
There was only one path he could follow to pass through
Before he had walked one li or more he suddenly came across a monk about ninety years old
was shabbily dressed but he had a superior and profound air
Even though xian was aware that was elegant and lofty he did not realize that was a holy man
Moreover after that met a young Buddhist monk and asked him Who is the old man I saw earlier replied He is the great disciple  the dhūta Kāśyapa xian greatly regretted 
Following after he came to a mountainous place
There was a horizontal rock blocking the entrance to house and could not enter
xian wept and then left that place
went on and arrived at the Kāśi kingdom
There was a whiteeared dragon in the kingdom and every came to an agreement with many monks and caused the state to be prosperous
All the people had faith in and were devoted to 
ramaṇas set up a house for the dragon and arranged food of merit
At the end of the summer retreat every year the dragon was always transformed into a small snake with white ears
All the people knew that this was the dragon
They put some cheese on bronze plates and the dragon was placed in the center 
from the superior to the inferior performed this rite The dragon then turned into a small snake from head to tail and left there
This was performed once a year
xian saw with his own eyes too
Afterward arrived in Central India
At Heavenly King Temple south of King Aśokas stupa in Pāṭaliputra in Magadha he obtained the Mahāsāṃghikavinaya 
Furthermore he obtained the Extract of the Sarvāstivādavinaya  the Za apitanxin the Xian jing  the Fangdeng niyuan jing  and other texts
xian stayed there for three years studying the Indian language and scriptures
He transcribed in his own hand
Thereafter he entrusted sutras and images to merchants reached Siṃhala 
more than ten people had been traveling with xian
some stayed and some others had died
Looking at his shadow he was always alone and he lamented in his mind
When he unexpectedly saw a merchant offer a moonshaped silk Chinese fan before a jade image he unwittingly shed tears in sadness
stayed for two years
He obtained the Mahīśāsakavinaya  two gama sutras the Dīrghāgama and the Saṃyuktāgama and the Zazang  none of which had yet been introduced into China
entrusted all to some merchants on a big ship and then he crossed the sea to return 
There were about two hundred people on the ship They encountered a windstorm and the ship sprang a leak
All the people were uneasy and afraid
They grabbed up miscellaneous things and threw them 
xian was afraid that they might throw out his sutras and images so he wholeheartedly prayed to Avalokiteśvara and took refuge in all the Buddhist monks of China
The ship went on following the wind and sustained no damage
More than ten days later the ship reached Yepoti
 After staying there for ve months again followed the other merchant east to Guangzhou
More than twenty days after setting sail a sudden gale came up at night and the ship were terried
All the people discussed among themselves and said Having this śramaṇa on board puts us in a difcult position
We cannot allow all the people to die for the sake of one person They all wanted to push 
Faxians donor raised his voice and scolded the merchants in a loud voice If you throw this śramaṇa off the ship then drop me off too
Otherwise you will be killed
The sovereigns of China believe in the Buddha and respect Buddhist monks
If I reach there I will tell a ruler and surely you will be accused of the crime The merchants turned pale and looked at each other and they stopped the plot
They had already run out of water and all the provisions were used up as well
They did nothing and resigned themselves to the wind following the current
Suddenly they reached shore and saw the green of pigweeds and beans growing profusely
They knew Chinese land but they could not surmise what area it was
They immediately went on board and entered into a creek
They looked for a village and found two hunters
xian asked them What region is this The hunters replied This is the south shore of Laoshan in Changguan prefecture in Qingzhou  The hunters returned and reported  to Governor Li Yi who originally believed in  respectfully
He suddenly heard the śramaṇa arriving from a distance and personally came out to greet and showed appreciation of his efforts
xian carrying the sutras and images followed the governor to 
Soon thereafter intended to return to the south
The Regional Inspector of Qingzhou asked to stay over the winter
xian answered I cast myself into a land to which I had not expected to return
My resolution lies in spreading throughout the world I have not yet achieved what I had hoped to
I cannot stay here for a long time Consequently he left for the south and arrived at the capital city 
Following the foreign meditation master Buddhabhadra in Daochang Tem ple translated more than a million words of sutras Vinayas and commentaries on sutras 
were widely circulated for edication and they all helped learn 
A family whose name has been lost lived near the Zhuque Gate and had believed in the edication of the true from generation to generation
had copied a sutra with their own hands chanted it and offered to it
They did not have a room exclusively for the sutra was placed in the same room along with miscellaneous other books
Later wind and re abruptly started up and spread to their house All their property and goods were burned
Only the Nirvāṇasūtra remained completely untouched and was found undamaged amid the ashes There was no change in its physical condition
was passed on to all the people of the capital city and everyone sighed in wonderment at the marvel
Some other sutras and Vinayas 
 later came to Jingzhou  and passed away at Xin Temple at the age of eightysix Chinese years old
All the people grieved extremely and lamented 
There is a separate large biography about his pilgrimage to various countries ie Biography of the Eminent Monk Faxian T
Previous Existences Introduction Quoted Testimonies Habits from Former Existences and The Five Supernatural Powers Actions are diverse
Paths of relationships from previous existences are numerous
There is long and short in life span
The principle of brightness and darkness is transitory
Truly it is because of good or evil karmic causes
Due to these causes there is obscuration or clarity in reward or retribution a person has recollection for many kalpas or he thinks of an object generation after generation or he has remembrance in only one existence or he only knows present 
Therefore ordinary people and sages are far apart from each other and previous existence lengthens and shortens
Even if you entrust to divinity and are grateful for sacredness the habitual vapor remains
If you remove delusion and see the truth the playful mind still exists
Except for who ascend the ten stages in rank practice fully takes a trikalpaasaṃkhyeya 
 How can you eternally cut off the cause which brings about an effect of the same nature and gratefully receive a wonderful reward in the present 
First the posha lun says
In the heavenly realm there are also those who know others thoughts with the wisdom of knowing the locus of their former existence and that of others 
This however goes into particulars Therefore it is not explained separately here
It is just as I have already explained completely in reward and retribution in the height of the heavenly realm 
It is also the same as what is explained below about the realms of animals and hungry ghosts
Therefore the posha lun says
What is the reason for this
This is because they do not possess the ability of the eld of merit 
It is because have excellent wisdom such as that of seeing hearing and speaking which obscures and damages 
It is because they have the ability to know others thoughts and wisdom such as the wisdom that arises from a vow  and  is concealed 
Commenting on this I should make this explanation
In reason there is nothing wrong in that in the four realms  through the wisdom of knowing the locus of their former existence and that of others
Second someone asks In the human realm there is also a kind of wisdom that arises from innate thought  through which people should be able to know others thoughts
Why do you not explain about this I answer As for why I should explain it and yet do not you must know there is something incomplete in this meaning
Furthermore such instances are few Therefore I do not explain
That is to say since in the human realm there are very few who attain this wisdom I do not explain it The posha lun further explains
This wisdom originates from inoffensive conduct 
If there is a sentient being who can uphold bodily and verbal actions and who does not annoy others when he is in his mothers womb he must be magnanimous he is not troubled by the two tactile senses of cold and hot and he does not cause his mothers stomach to be troubled by impure vitiated blood when he comes out of the womb he is not pressed hard by  his mothers vagina and does not cause his mind to become distracted either
Because of these causes and conditions this person is clearly conscious and awakened He knows what happened in his previous 
If you do not know now  it is truly because you went against the matters mentioned above
Since you have forgotten  and are confused you cannot know it
Someone asks Do the beings in each realm know how many realms of existence there are I answer It is also just as the posha lun explains
Heavenly beings know about the ve realms human beings know about the four realms  ghosts know about the three realms animals know about the two realms and beings in hell only know about matters in hell
Beings in the upper realms are superior so they can know of the lower  but beings in the lower realms are inferior and therefore they cannot know of the upper  Someone asks If are inferior and therefore they do not know of the upper realms why do sutras say that dragon kings such as Susaṃsthita and Elāpattra can know what the eminent one akradevendra thinks I answer Just as the posha lun explains these are all inferences not right cognition
It is just as when akradevendra intended to ght against the asuras the bones on the back of the dragon king Susaṃsthita spontaneously produced a sound
He then thought to himself I have now produced a loud voice from the bones of my back
Surely I know that all heavenly beings will certainly ght against the asuras with me
They must need me After having this thought he immediately left to go to akradevendras side
Moreover it is just as when akradevendra wanted to play fragrant hands spontaneously appeared on the dragon king Elāpattras back
Then he thought to himself Now fragrant hands have appeared on my back
I surely know that akradevendra wishes to play in a garden
He must need me After having this thought he immediately transformed himself and created thirtytwo elephants there were altogether thirtythree 
On the head of each six tusks emerged
On each tusk seven great treasure ponds emerged
In each pond seven stems of lotus owers appeared
Each lotus ower produced seven leaves
On each leaf seven jeweled raised platforms showed themselves
On each raised platform seven jeweled screens arose
In each screen there were seven heavenly maidens
Each heavenly maiden had seven attendants
Each of the attendants had seven girl musicians
Every girl musician played heavenly music
After making this transformation in as brief a moment as it takes to ex and stretch out ones arm came before akradevendras palace where he stayed
After seeing  akradevendra ascended onto original head together with his dependents
Other assistant ministers from Trāyastriṃśa Heaven each leading their dependents ascended onto the heads of the remaining thirtytwo 
After every being  then ew up and traversed the sky and quickly went to a pleasure garden
With this testimony it is also known that these are inferences not right cognition
From this quoted incidence it is testied and known that  the upper realms know of the lower realms but the lower realms do not know of the upper realms
This reason however has not yet been settled
It is just as if a wolf of the lower realm was aware of the womans mental state and took her childs life
 This precisely indicates that  the lower realms can know of the upper realms
Why do you say that the lower realms do not know of the upper realms
On the basis of many cases it is said that the upper realms can know of the lower realms and the lower realms cannot know of the upper realms
If you seek to know more about this the upper and the lower realms may know each other in common
It is impossible to quote in detail Again as the Xin posha lun says
In Rājagṛha there was a butcher called Qiezha
 He was King Ajātaśatru Vaidehiputras intimate childhood friend
He had once addressed Crown Prince  When you ascend the throne which of my wishes will you grant me The crown prince told him I should grant you whatever you wish Later Ajātaśatru Vaidehiputra killed his own father and established himself 
Qiezha thereupon attended to the king and begged him to grant his wish
The king said Ask me whatever you like Qiezha addressed  I wish for you king to allow me to monopolize the butchering trade in Rājagṛha The king then said Why do you ask me now for this evil wish
Arent you afraid of suffering in future  The butcher addressed the king For all good and evil conduct there is entirely no effect
What are you afraid of The king thereupon asked him How do you know this Qiezha said to the king I recall that in my past six existences I always worked in the butchering trade here in Rājagṛha
In my last existence I was reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven where I received much pleasure and happiness
Following my death in that heaven I was reborn here in the human realm
I was able to have an intimate friendship with you king when I was a child
Accordingly I know that for good and evil conduct there is certainly no effect When the king heard this he gave rise to doubt
So went to speak to the Buddha
The Buddha said to the king This is not a lie
That butcher however once gave a meal to a pratyekabuddha
He made an evil vow Please let me always monopolize the butchering trade in Rājagṛha and later attain rebirth in heaven Due to the cause of his good conduct his wish was fullled
The fruition he was given for the previous distinctive conduct has now been exhausted 
In seven days he will surely die and will be reborn in Raurava Hell
He will receive the retribution of sufferings one after another for his previous conduct in the butchering trade
Therefore with this wisdom people may know of their seven existences at the maximum
Moreover someone said With this people are able to recall matters of their ve hundred existences at the maximum
Namely there was a bhikṣu who remembered that he had fallen in the realm of hungry ghosts in his past ve hundred existences
When he thought of the suffering of starvation he had endured sweat ran all over his body and he was terried and distressed deep in his heart
So he stopped all activities and vigorously puried himself
Later after a long period of time he attained the srotaāpattiphala Again there was a bhikṣu who remembered that he had fallen into hell for his past ve hundred existences
When he thought of the suffering he had received in hell blood poured out from the pores of his skin
His body and clothes became terribly lthy and stank
Every day he went to a river to bathe and wash his clothes
The people said He clings to a river and considers to be pure  Furthermore the Sapoduo lun says
Question What differences are there between the wisdom that arises from a vow and the wisdom of knowing former existences Answer
The wisdom of knowing former existences is about knowing the past while the wisdom that arises from a vow is about knowing the three periods of existence The wisdom of knowing former existences is about knowing delement  while the wisdom that arises from a vow is about equally knowing both the deled and the undeled
The wisdom of knowing former existences is about knowing ones past  while the wisdom that arises from a vow is about knowing  of both oneself and others
The wisdom of knowing former existences is about knowing from ones present existence to the next in order while the wisdom that arises from a vow is about knowing  skipping over a hundred kalpas in an instant
Regarding the reason why animals could talk in ancient times and why they cannot talk at the present time it is thought that at the beginning of a kalpa there were rst only human and heavenly beings and the three evil realms did not yet exist all were from the human and heavenly realms
Since had habits close to that of their previous existences  they could talk
Presently animals mostly come from the three evil realms
Therefore they cannot talk Moreover the Posha lun explains
 It is said that with selfnature wisdom of knowing the locus of ones former existence one is able to know past former existences as well as others thoughts
Even if people did not cultivate causes  at the place of their rebirth their selfnature knows
This wisdom spreads throughout the ve realms but there  strength 
In the four realms the three evil realms and the heavenly realms the operation is strong
In the realm of human beings it is weak
Why is this so
It is because in the realm of human beings there are wisdoms such as the wisdom of speaking and looking at each other  the wisdom revealed through cultivating meditation  up to the methods to know others thoughts 
is obscured and hidden by these wisdoms
Therefore even though  operates to some extent it is weak and obscure and does not reveal Just as the Xin posha lun says
If all sentient beings when they see a precipitous and narrow place repair and widen it thereby allowing passersby to have no difculty  due to the power of that karma they will not have the suffering from the pressure in their mothers womb
 Therefore they attain this wisdom
There are other views
If all sentient beings give various great wonderful food and drink to others due to the power of that karma they are able to attract this wisdom
If all sentient beings do not do actions that trouble and disturb others and always do things to plentifully benet others due to this karma they are not aficted by diseases such as a cold a fever asthma or a chest ailment when they are in their mothers womb
When they come out of the womb they have no suffering from pressure 
Therefore they can recall all the events of their former existences
Accordingly there is this view If all sentient beings do not receive suffering from numerous diseases and pressure when they are in their mothers wombs and when they come out of the womb they should all be able to recall the things that happened in their past existences
They however forget all of this due to their mothers diseases and the suffering of the pressure  Third In the realm of hungry ghosts there is the wisdom of knowing the locus of ones former existence and that of others and know others thoughts
How is this known
In olden times there was a woman who was bewitched by a spirit and was emaciated and about to die
A master of the black arts asked the spirit Why do you annoy this woman now The spirit replied This woman continually destroyed my life during my past ve hundred existences
During my past ve hundred existences I always destroyed her life as well
We have resentfully taken reprisal against each other and it has not yet come to an end
If she can give up I can do so too The master of the black arts consequently reported this to the woman If you hold your life dear you must give up your hatred  The woman replied I have already given it up The spirit saw that the woman had not given up the hatred in her mind at all that she was afraid of losing her life and that she had lied about having already given up
Thereupon killed her disregarded her and departed
Fourth How is it known that there is the wisdom of knowing ones former existences in the realm of animals The answer is found in the posha lun
In ancient times there was a woman who left her child in a place and then went to another place by chance
A wolf took her child away
The mother saw it happen and chased them saying Wolf
Why have you taken my child away The wolf replied You are my enemy
Formerly during ve hundred existences you continually ate my child
Now I also wish to kill your child for ve hundred existences
This is the resentment between foes mutual reprisal This must be due to natural law
Why do you bear anger After making this response further said If you can give up killing with hatred I will then let your child go The childs mother replied I give up my hatred At that time the wolf immediately stood up and pondered
observed the womans mind and then knew that she had not given up 
said Although you said  you still have not given it up in your mind After saying this swiftly took her childs life and left
This is the spontaneous cognition of former existences and is good testimony that knew the womans mind
other realms from spirits to heavenly beings also recognize their former existences and know others thoughts
It is thoroughly explained in all the chapters before and after in sutras and discourses
I do not trouble you by repeatedly explaining this
These two wisdoms however are not the seed wisdom 
Regarding the two kinds of wisdom that of knowing others thoughts and that of knowing ones former existences they arise and are attained only according to quiet thought or meditation is spontaneously acquired as a reward and exercised even in distracted thought
Therefore it is known are not 
Fifth How can those who have the selfnature wisdom of knowing their former existence and that of others be reborn in hell The answer is found in the Nirvāṇasūtra
 Five hundred brahmans came into hell after being killed by the king of the Xianyu kingdom
 They gave rise to the three kinds of wholesome thoughts and recalled what they had originally been
This is precisely a testimony for it
Moreover as a discourse explains sentient beings in hell are also able to know the hell wardens thoughts
This is also a testimony for it
Existences Just as the Foshuo shiziyue fo bensheng jing says
 The Buddha stayed in the Kalandaka Bamboo Garden near Rājagṛha together with great bhikṣus a thousand two hundred and fty bhikṣus and a hundred bodhisattvas
At that time among the crowd there was a bodhisattvabhikṣu called Vasumitra
He wandered around the bamboo garden and climbed up and down a tree
His voice sounded like that of a rhesus monkey
Or he did a performance spinning three bells
At one time various wealthy people and passersby gathered to watch 
When the people gathered his body was suspended in the air
He jumped to a branch of a tree and spoke in the voice of a rhesus monkey
Vulture Peak is a bodhisattvas place where eightyfour thousand goldencolored rhesus monkeys gathered
Bodhisattvas repeatedly performed various kinds of transformations which made happy
At that time all the people said These śramaṇas ākyamunis disciples are just playing like children confusing and deluding people
No one gives any credence to the evil they do
Moreover they do unlawful things with birds and beasts This bad reputation spread all over Rājagṛha
There was a brahman who reported this to Great King Bimbisāra and when the king heard this report he detested all ākyamunis disciples
Then he issued an imperial edict to Elder Kalandaka
He asked What are all of ākyamunis disciples and the numerous rhesus monkeys that gather in your garden doing
Does the Tathāgata know about this The elder reported to the king Vasumitra frequently performs transformations and makes all the rhesus monkeys happy for a moment
All the heavenly beings rain down owers which are used as offerings
I have no idea what they are doing At that time the great king leading in front and behind went to visit the Buddhas place
From the distance he saw the Worldhonored One whose body emitted light looked like a purplishgold mountain and caused all of the great assembly to be equally goldencolored
Reverend mitra as well as eightyfour thousand rhesus monkeys became goldencolored too
At that time all the monkeys saw that the great king was coming and they made various wonders
One among them picked owers and offered them to the great king
After seeing this the king together with the great assembly came to the Buddhas place
bowed to the Buddha circumambulated in a clockwise direction three times withdrew and sat to one side
addressed the Buddha What merit did these all rhesus monkeys make in their former existences that their bodies are now goldencolored
And what sin did they commit to have been reborn in the realm of animals
What merit moreover did Reverend Vasumitra plant in his former existences in order to be reborn in a wealthy family and to renounce the world and study the Way
Furthermore what sin did he commit by not practicing the observance of the precepts to now perform accompanied by rhesus monkeys to possess a singing and talking voice like that of a rhesus monkey to cause nonBuddhists to laugh at him even though he was reborn in the human realm and fully possesses all the faculties 
Please Heavenly Honored One discriminate for me and make me understand The Buddha said to the king Listen attentively
Think of this with good intentions
I will discern and explain it for you
In ancient times innumerable kalpas ago a buddha called Dīpaṃkara appeared in the world
After that buddha passed away all the bhikṣus practiced the Buddhist Dharma in hills and valleys
They observed the Buddhist precepts as rmly as a man protects his eyes
Because of this they attained arhatship
At that time there was a rhesus monkey in a desert valley came to an arhats place
When he saw the arhat sitting in meditation and entering into samādhi he grabbed the arhats sitting cloth and wore it like a kaṣāya
Following the śramaṇas way he bared his right shoulder lifted up a bronze censer and circumambulated the bhikṣu
At that time that bhikṣu emerged from samādhi and saw that this rhesus monkey had a good wholesome mind
He snapped his ngers and told the rhesus monkey O Dharma child
This very moment you should awaken the aspiration for highest bodhi The rhesus monkey heard this and jumped about in joy
prostrated respectfully worshiping the bhikṣu
He stood up picked owers and scattered them over the bhikṣu
At that time the bhikṣu explained the Three Refuges to the rhesus monkey Then the monkey immediately rose up and said with his paws clasped in prayer O Great Virtue
I would like to now take refuge in the Buddha Dharma and Sangha The bhikṣu endorsed the Three Refuges for him Next you must show repentance and completely confess your sinful acts
I attained arhatship and I can remove the immeasurable serious sins of sentient beings Politely in this way completed the  the monkeys taking the Three and repentance and said to it O Dharma child
You are now clean and pure
This is called a bodhisattva
You are now completing your life After receiving the ve precepts seek highest perfect enlightenment At that time relying on the teaching the rhesus monkey received  having already completed making a vow and jumped about in joy
 then ran up a high mountain and climbed up into a tree then fell down and died
Because he had received the ve precepts he terminated the karma of animal rebirth
He was then reborn in Tuṣita Heaven where he met a bodhisattva who takes up a buddhas place in the next life
spoke to him about the aspiration for highest bodhi
Then held heavenly owers and sent them down to the desert valley as an offering to the arhat
The arhat saw and immediately smiled
He said O Heavenly King
Reward and retribution for good and evil conduct are just like a shadow that follows a form They are not separate from each other after all He said in verse Karma can adorn you yourself In all places it follows your next existence The Dharma that is retained is just like a certicate Karma is just like a loan You are now reborn in heaven Because of the karma of the ve precepts Your former self fell down as a monkey Following the existence in which you violated the precepts The existence in which you observe the precepts is a ladder to heaven Violation of the precepts results in being boiled in a cauldron I see a person who observes the precepts Whose body is adorned with light In a wonderful tall pavilion of seven treasures All heavenly beings serve him His bed and curtains are made of many treasures He has maṇi gems owers and a necklace of precious stones He meets a future buddha Who gives him pleasure by speaking the excellent Dharma I see a person who violates the precepts He falls into hell His tongue is plowed by an iron plow He must lie on an iron bed Molten copper ows on all four sides of his body It burns and destroys his body Or he is placed on a mountain of blades In a forest of swords in boiling excrement In a river of ashes or in the cold icy hell He must eat iron pellets and drink molten copper Sufferings like these are Continually put on him just like a necklace of precious stones
If you want to leave behind numerous difculties Not fall into the three evil realms Wander about the path of heaven And go beyond and attain nirvana You must diligently observe the pure precepts Give donations and cultivate a pure life After speaking this verse the arhat remained silent
A son of Heaven the former rhesus monkey addressed him O Great Virtue
What sin did I commit to have been reborn in the realm of as a rhesus monkey in my former existence
And what merit did I have in order to have encountered you Great Virtue and to be able to escape from the realm of animals and be reborn in heaven The arhat replied In ancient times in this Jambudvīpa world a buddha appeared
He was called Baohui Tathāgata
 After he entered nirvana during the period of the semblance Dharma there was a bhikṣu called Padmagarbha
He often befriended sovereigns wealthy people and laymen
He lived a dishonest life he engaged in attery and perversion and did not practice observance of the precepts
After death he fell into Avīci Hell
Just like when lotus owers spread over  he fully covered the eighteen divisions where he received all sufferings
A life span is one kalpa
After the completion of one kalpa he was again reborn 
In this way he experienced all the great hells for fully eightyfour thousand kalpas
He came out of the hells and fell into the realm of hungry ghosts
He went through eightyfour thousand years  swallowing molten copper
He came out of the realm of hungry ghosts and again fell into the realm of  cows pigs dogs and monkeys
He experienced ve hundred rebirths into the bodies of each of 
Due to the condition of having previously made offerings observed the precepts and taken the vow as a bhikṣu that are essentially important you have now encountered me and attained rebirth in heaven
The bhikṣu who observed the precepts is precisely myself and the selfindulgent bhikṣu was exactly yourself
The son of Heaven the former rhesus monkey heard these words and was astonished his hair stood on end
He repented his former sin and then returned to heaven The Buddha told the great king  As for the rhesus monkey although he was an animal once he encountered the arhat he received and held the Three Refuges as well as the ve precepts
The merit conditioned by his former existence surpasses the extremely serious evil karma of a thousand kalpas
So he could be reborn in heaven and meet a bodhisattva who takes up a buddhas place in the next life
From this time on he will meet a buddha inumerable times purely cultivate moral practices possess the six pāramitās and abide in the stage of nonretrogression for realizing highest perfect enlightenment
In his very last existence he will come after Maitreya and later he will achieve highest perfect enlightenment and a buddha called Shiziyue Tathāgata The Buddha said to the great king If you wish to know who Shiziyue Buddha of that country is it is Vasumitra Bhikṣu who is here in this assembly now When the king heard this statement he promptly stood up and with joined palms
There was a sweat all over his body and he wept sorrowfully dripping tears He repented reproaching himself
Facing Vasumitra he bowed his head to the ground took feet in his hands and placed his head on them in worship He repented of the sin he previously made
The Buddha said to the great king If you wish to know what these eighty four thousand golden colored rhesus monkeys were in ancient times during the period of Krakucchanda Buddha there were altogether eightyfour thousand bhikṣuṇīs in the two states of Vārāṇasī and Kauśāmbī
They engaged in unlawful activities and violated various important precepts
They were as wildly stupid and ignorant as crazy rhesus monkeys
When they met a good bhikṣu they looked upon him as if he was a traitor
At that time there was an arhat bhikṣuṇī called Shananyin
 She preached the Dharma for at great length harbored indignation 
Then the arhat bhikṣuṇī saw that all the evil did not engender wholesome minds
Accordingly she gave rise to benevolence
She soared up into the air and made eighteen transformations
On that occasion all the evil  seeing the transformations took off their gold bracelets and scattered them over the arhat bhikṣuṇī  We pray that we will be reborn with a goldencolored living body
We now repent of all our former evils At that moment the bodies of all the evil bhikṣuṇīs broke down and they died and fell into Avīci Hell
They passed through in sequence for ninetytwo kalpas continually reborn in hells
Then they came out of the hells
For the next ve hundred existences they were always hungry ghosts
They came out of hungry ghosts
In the next thousand existences they were always rhesus monkeys 
Their bodies were goldencolored
O Great King
You must know that the eightyfour thousand bhikṣuṇīs who violated the precepts and who reviled the arhat bhikṣuṇī of that time are now all the eightyfour thousand goldencolored rhesus monkeys in this assembly and the one who made offerings to all the evil bhikṣuṇīs at that time is now you Great King
Because of the habits from former existences all the rhesus monkeys hold owers and incense and offer them to you Great King
Those corrupted bhikṣuṇīs at that time are now Kokālika and the kings ve hundred eunuchs The Buddha told the great king You must be careful in all your bodily verbal and mental acts At that time King Bimbisāra heard what the Buddha said
Facing the Buddha he repented and felt ashamed of and reproached himself
He was suddenly liberated in mind and achieved the anāgāmiphala The eight thousand men led by the king asked him for permission to renounce the world and They all accomplished arhatship
All the remaining sixteen thousand people awakened the aspiration for enlightenment 
All eighty thousand heavenly beings together awakened the aspiration for enlightenment too
When eightyfour thousand goldencolored rhesus monkeys heard the story of their past existences they felt ashamed and reproached themselves
They circumambulated the Buddha a thousand times and repented before the Buddha
They all awakened the aspiration for highest enlightenment
They follow each life span and after death they are reborn in Tuṣita Heaven meet Maitreya and attain the stage of nonretrogression for realizing highest perfect enlightenment
Furthermore after incalculable nayutas or asaṃkhyas  as many kalpas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River have passed they will be able to attain buddhahood
Eightyfour thousand will appear in the world one after another
Each of them will last a kalpa
The kalpa will be called great light 
They will all equally be called King Fujinguangming Tathāgata
Furthermore the chuchu jing says
The Buddha said Gavāṃpati who already attained the path of arhatship chews the cud A disciple asked the Buddha Why The Buddha replied In his former existences he was a cow for seven hundred generations
In the present world he attained the Way
Since the habit  has not yet come to an end he chews the cud  is also in accordance with the zhidu lun 
Someone asks Why was he a cow I answer It is because in the past he passed through someone elses grain eld took ve or six grains of millet tasted them and spit them out on the ground
Since he damaged another persons millet he a cow
Because he was a cow for many  he has a cows feet and chews the cud Powers Just as the Pusa chutai jing ie the Pusa cong doushutian jiang shenmutai shuo guangpu jing T  says
At that time Miaosheng Bodhisattva  addressed the Buddha O Worldhonored One
What Dharma does a bodhisattva who possesses the ve supernatural powers learn in order to attain the path of the supernatural powers The Buddha replied to Miaosheng All good men and women here in the realm of desire do not need the supernatural power of the eye
When they are born they clearly see all the species of sentient beings their roughness and neness their beauty and ugliness the inner and outer city walls and the trees in Jambudvīpa
Some peoples eyes can see two three or four worlds
They do not need the supernatural power of the eye when they are born they can see
Some people do not need the supernatural powers of the eye and the ear
They clearly and thoroughly hear male and female voices and all the sounds in the world
They can precisely distinguish and recognize them
They do not study the supernatural power of the ear at all yet they understand everything
Some people never learn the spontaneous cognition of former existences but they can completely distinguish and recognize from what place they came to be reborn here in the human realm and their parents clans and the rst and last names 
Certain people without learning the supernatural powers know others thoughts their good or evil conduct and their destination  the place of rebirth to which they are going They can completely know which sentient beings related to a buddha or bodhisattva in the past and which are not
Or certain people can go around or come and go by ying
Without studying the supernatural powers they can y
There is nothing to offend or obstruct them
They walk in the sky just as on land and they walk on land just as they do in the sky The Buddha said Good men and women
If you cultivate the sacred supernatural power of the eye you will remove objects of vision and cut off delements
By means of the concentration on three gates of liberation you can see a thousand worlds two thousand worlds and the trichiliocosm some people can hear all the various sounds of a thousand worlds two thousand worlds and the trichiliocosm
Good and evil as well as the six realms can be completely understood
Or certain people remove the cognitive delements Their inner and outer are free from blemish
They attain the sacred supernatural power of thoughts and the spontaneous cognition of former existences
They completely know their last existence the second from last up to innumerable kalpas ago the places from which they came their parents and dependents and the purity of the lands 
Some people cultivate the ten supernatural powers They understand the ultimate nature of things have a good memory and never forget
They are further able to know others thoughts
They completely know all their existences from the last the second from the last up to innumerable kalpas ago the places from which they came their parents and dependents the purity of the lands their rst and last names and the clans 
Or some people see things by means of pondering
They manage their bodies by their minds and their minds by their bodies
When they sleep or awaken from sleep their thoughts are just like emptiness
They can easily raise their bodies travel to another world two worlds  up to the trichiliocosm and enter into the earth just as they enter the sky
In mountains and rivers or upon precipices there is nothing to hinder them
Or some people are approaching the attainment of buddhahood
By the power of wisdom they have removed sentient beings delements
They are seated under a bodhi tree and do not rise from their seat
Therefore they can attain buddhahood and with the six supernatural powers they purely penetrate into things At that time the Worldhonored One said in verse Supernatural powers ordinary people attain are Just like those of all ying birds Some are close and some are far They do not leave behind the path of birth and death The Buddhas supernatural powers are of the unhindered Dharma They are truth and purity When he thinks they go to the ten directions When they come and go they are not weary
If you think of sentient beings with benevolence You will attain the supernatural powers that are unhindered A hermits wisdom of the ve supernatural powers Regresses and is not accomplished My supernatural powers are of the stable Dharma They are essential to enter the gate of nirvana At that time in the assembly there was a bodhisattva called Puguang
 He stepped forward and addressed the Buddha I have not discerned the law of consciousness of the six supernatural powers
Is it a single or an undetermined number 
If consciousness is single then the Tathāgata is goldencolored and  at the seminary of the supernatural power of travel one wanders about all buddha lands
He has consciousness that develops into a bodily or he has a bodily that develops into consciousness If a bodily develops into consciousness then there are not the six supernatural powers
If consciousness develops into a bodily  this is called a single 
If there is no body there is no consciousness
Please Worldhonored One respond to me regarding this meaning The Buddha said to Puguang Bodhisattva You ask a question about the rst principle 
This is a question about the meaning of the secular 
If the meaning of the secular is asked there are some types of consciousness but there is no xed characteristic
If the rst principle is asked then there is neither body nor consciousness
When we discriminate consciousness its selfnature is empty and tranquil
Nothing comes and nothing goes
There is no attachment either
You asked about golden color This is a thing of the phenomenal world accomplished by the ve skandhas
It is neither a spontaneous thing nor the rst principle
I will now explain for you the law of consciousness and conception
Bodhisattvas possess the six supernatural powers in both body and consciousness
It is neither that consciousness comes rst and the body comes later nor that the body comes rst and consciousness comes later
Characteristics of things are spontaneous
Consciousness does not separate from the body and the body does not separate from consciousness either
It is just like when two cows are yoked together
If a black cow comes before a white cow planting is not accomplished or if a white cow comes before a black cow planting is not accomplished either
If it is neither the former nor the latter case then planting is accomplished
The fruition in the path of the supernatural powers of travel is also like this
Both body and consciousness are accompanied by each other and there is neither front behind nor middle 
The physical form of the Tathāgata has front rear and middle This is a matter of the secular world but it is not the rst principle
In the law of emptiness and tranquility there is no divergence
Verses say Good and evil are habits implanted in former existences Receiving reward and retribution each one goes to a different destination One who was once a spirit kills his enemy Or one becomes a wolf and takes revenge with a misfortune A butcher recalls his butchery Vasumitra has fun at the monkeys village Those who removed troubles through divine help from their former existences Live and roam in paradise Establish a clean encounter by touching virtue See through the nonduality of things at the rst glance Ordinary people and sages respectfully have a happy assembly The wise and the stupid rejoice immortalizing their names Beings of the four modes of birth practice good deeds Beings of the six realms are grateful for mystic light Even though they differ from each other in their joys and sorrows They equally know the relative length of their life spans
Miracle Stories Yang Hu  the Grand Mentor of the Jin dynasty whose pseudonym was Shuzi was a man from Taishan prefecture  As a distinguished ofcial of the Western Jin dynasty he had the best reputation in China
When he was ve Chinese years old he importunately asked his wet nurse to get for him a ring he used to play with
The wet nurse said You do not have such a thing originally
From where shall I get it for you Hu replied In former days I played with it around the eastern fence and dropped it in a mulberry tree The nurse said You should look for it by yourself Hu replied This is not my former house
So I have no idea about that place Another day Hu took a trip and went straight toward the east
The nurse followed him
When they arrived at Lis house entered and went to the eastern fence where he searched in a tree and found a small ring
The Li family was surprised and said resentfully My son had this ring in the past and he often loved to play with it
When he was seven Chinese years old he died suddenly
After his death the ring was missing
This belongs to my deceased son
Why do you want to take it with you Hu grasped the ring and ran away
Li chased after him and asked why 
The nurse explained what Hu had told her
Li had a mingled feeling of joy and sorrow and consequently wanted Hu back to be his son The neighbors dissuaded 
Later they could stop him from doing so
Hu grew to adulthood but always suffered from headaches
A doctor intended to treat him
Hu said On the third day after I was born I lay with my head pointing to the north door and I felt the wind blow upon the crown of my head I was very worried about itI could not yet talk then however
Since the cause of my disease happened a long time ago it cannot be cured Later Hu became the CommanderinChief of Jingzhou and was garrisoned at Xiangyang 
He made donations to Wudang Temple more than to other monasteries
Someone asked the reason for this but Hu remained silent
After a time on the occasion of repentance he narrated the causality from his previous existence
Then he said In my previous existence I committed various sins
Through building this temple I nally could be relieved from the sins
Therefore I make my mind of offering much more courteous and serious Wang Lian of the Jin dynasty whose pseudonym was Xuanming was a man from Langye 
He was a palace attendant in the Song dynasty
His father Min  whose pseudonym was Jiyan was the Secretariat Director of the Jin dynasty
Among his acquaintances there was an Indian monk
 Every time looked at Mins appearance he was respectfully delighted with it
He always said to his fellow monks If I can be the son of this person in my next existence my present vow will be fullled Min heard this and said joking O Dharma Master
You have just good enough talent and conduct to be able to become my son Soon thereafter the śramaṇa died from an illness
More than a year after his death Lian was born
From the time was born he was able to speak he also understood foreign languages
Regarding rare and precious things such as silver instruments pearls and jewels from remote countries Lian had not seen these nor heard their names since the time of his birth but he immediately mentioned their names and recognized where they had been produced
Furthermore he spontaneously made friends with various Indian people more than with Chinese people
All the people thought that the śramaṇa was indeed former self
Therefore Min gave him the pseudonym Alian
 It is said that later became famous
Xiang Jing of the Jin dynasty whose pseudonym was Fengren was a man from Henei 
When he was residing in Wuxing prefecture he lost his young daughter
In the early days after the daughter fell ill she used to play with a small knife
Her mother tried to take it away from her but the child would not give it to her mother and wounded her mothers hand
One year after the childs death her mother gave birth to another daughter
When this daughter was four Chinese years old she asked her mother Where is my knife from former times The mother replied It is nowhere The daughter said In former days we fought for it and I wounded you on the hand because of it
Why do you say it is nowhere The mother was quite amazed and puzzled So she gave a detailed account of this to Jing
Jing said The knife of that time still exists doesnt it The mother replied Since it is painful to remember our deceased daughter I do not often take in my hand Jing told her You should look for several more knives put them together with the knife concerned in the same place and let our daughter choose one The daughter saw the knife with great joy
She immediately took the one formerly used and said This is what I expected Her parents and family members then realized that the deceased daughter was the former incarnation of this daughter
During the Song dynasty there was Shi Tandi on Mount Kunlun
His secular family name was Kang and his ancestors were people from Kangju 
They migrated to China during the reign of Emperor Ling of the Han dynasty
During the revolt of the end of Emperor Xians reign they relocated to Wuxing 
Tandis father Rong once served as the Mounted Escort of Jizhou
His mother ne Huang took a nap and had a dream that a Buddhist monk called her Mother and entrusted a whisk and two engraved iron paperweights to her
She woke up and found both of the objects were there
In virtue of this she became pregnant and gave birth to di
When di was ve Chinese years old his mother showed him the objects such as the whisk
di said Those are what the king of Qin presented to me as a gift His mother asked him Where did you put them He answered I do not remember When became ten Chinese years old he renounced the world
He studied without following a teacher and attained realization spontaneously
Later he went to Fandeng following his father where he came across the Buddhist monk Le from Guanzhong 
suddenly called Les name
Le asked him Boy why did you call the name of an elder monk di replied The reason I suddenly spoke to you earlier is that you upādhyāya used to be my novice
Once when you were harvesting vegetables for the monks you were hurt by a wild boar
Unconsciously I cried out Le had been Dharma Master Hongjues disciple
He gathered vegetables for other monks and had been injured by a wild boar
Le did not remember this in the beginning
So he visited dis father who completely retold the whole story and showed him the objects such as the paperweights and the whisk
Le then realized and said in tears My former teacher is Dharma Master Hongjue
My teacher discoursed on the Lotus Sutra for Yao Chang  when I was in charge of questioning him
Yao Chang gave my teacher these two kinds of objects
Consequently here they are now
Counting back to the date when Hongjue passed away today is precisely the day when these things were given  Moreover recollected the matter of gathering vegetables
He had deeper admiration with sadness
di later studied and read scriptures and found the record of this event
Afterward he entered Huqiu Temple in Wu where he discoursed on the Book of Rites  the Book of Changes  and the Spring and Autumn Annals  seven times each of them and the Lotus Sutra the Mahā prajñā pāramitāsūtra and the Vimalakīrtinirdeśasūtra fteen times each
Furthermore he was good at collecting literary writings There are six fascicles in the collection that have also been circulated in the world
His nature was of love for the forests and springs 
Later he returned to Wuxing and entered Mount Kunlun in Guzhang where he led a quiet life drinking water from a mountain stream for more than twenty years
He passed away at his mountain residence at the end of the Yuanjia era of the Song dynasty at the age of over sixty Chinese years old
During the YuanWei dynasty  there was the meditation master Sheng in Beidai
He always held fast to the Lotus Sutra He was devoted and industrious and not negligent
After he died in the intermediate state between death and the next life  he was consigned to the Xue family of Hedong  and born as the fth son Soon after he was born he was able to speak he related the good and bad deeds he had done in his past life
He was not willing to stay in the secular world
His father was appointed Regional Inspector of Dizhou  in the north
The fth son followed appointment went to Zhongshan and arrived at Qidi Temple
He looked for and found his disciple when he had originally been in his previous existence
said to  You remember that following me you crossed over a river and went to Mount Lang dont you
Meditation Master Sheng is precisely myself
The table before the altar in our room should be promptly removed disciple hearing this testimony embraced teacher was extremely grieved and mourned
All the people both clergy and laymen felt that it was a wonder and was a great sign
parents had love and fondness for him and they were afraid he would renounce the world So they kept him in their room
After that he forgot about the matters of his previous existence but he often gave rise to a feeling of revulsion for and the desire to leave 
He was always delighted with leading a tranquil life
 came to town on an inpection round
Astonished and pleasantly surprised he told his attendants Formerly I was once someones wife in this town
Now I know where the house was located On horseback he entered an alley followed its winding path and came to a house
He had knock on the door
The householder an old man ran out and paid his respects to 
Yanwu entered the house
He rst went to the hall and looked at the upper part of the east wall
There was a raised part six or seven chi from the oor The guest said to the householder I formerly concealed in this wall Lotus Sutra I used to read as well as ve golden hair clasps
The raised portion is the spot  The last part of the paper of the seventh fascicle has been burned and some of the text is missing
Even now every time I recite this sutra when I come to the last part of the seventh fascicle I always forget  I cannot recall it Accordingly ordered his attendants to bore a hole in the wall
As expected they found the sutra case and opened it The last part of the seventh fascicle that was burned and the golden hair clasps were all just as had described
The householder said weeping When my late wife was alive she often recited this sutra
The hair clasps were also hers Yanwu pointed to a locust tree in the courtyard When I was about to give birth I cut off my hair by myself and placed it in a hole in this tree He ordered someone to search for it in the tree as a test Sure enough the hair was found
So the householder had joy and sorrow
Yanwu left some clothes and other items as gifts of courtesy to the householder and departed
Minister Cui Dunli told me 
Later in the past when I met Lu Wenli he also told me almost the same  but he said that  the Regional Inspector of Qizhou and his full name was unknown
Since was not as detailed as Cuis I have relied on Cuis record  there was Shi Daochuo 
His secular family name was Wei and he was a man from Wenshui in Bingzhou
He was clean and modest in his daily conduct His intelligence and realization spontaneously were revealed
The successor of the past master luan devoted himself to respectfully learning the practices 
On the eighth day of the fourth month of the second year of the Zhenguan era chuo knew that his life was coming to an end
He notied of his situation
Those who heard about this and went to see him lled the mountain temple
All the people saw Master luan on a seventreasure boat and said to chuo Your hall in the Pure Land has been completed but the rest of your reward and retribution have not been exhausted In addition they saw that transformed buddhas abode in the air and heavenly owers scattered down
Men and women received them in the skirts and collars of their robes
were delicate smooth and lovely
Furthermore lotus owers were placed in dry ground and they did not wither even after seven days later
Moreover there were many other good signs that cannot all be recorded here
When was seventy Chinese years old suddenly a new set of his permanent teeth grew in were just like his former teeth  there was absolutely no difference
The power of his reward and retribution was reinforced
If his actions and receptivity had not been well comprehended  how could he have met these good responses
of the Tang dynasty was lovingly raised by his widowed mother when he was a child
His mother always learned and read Buddhist texts throughout her life and she was diligent in ascetic practice
She died in the twentyrst year of the Zhenguan era 
Shanjing was more consumed by grief than was customary
His tearful cries did not stop
The next year while in a trance Shanjing saw his mother who said I am able to receive a male body for the merit I earned by cultivation when I was alive
Now I will be reborn in the Song family of Shizhao village south of this county
If you wish to meet me you can immediately go there She disappeared after saying this
Shanjing went to the place she had mentioned and quickly arrived there without a moments delay
On that day a boy was born to the Song family
Shanjing accordingly presented clothes and other things He related the history in detail and entrusted with the boy he now saw before him
Shanjing always served him with the courtesy he had shown to his mother
Shanfu a śramaṇa of Xizhou  and Shanjing had been acquainted with each other for a long time
examined what Shanjing and the villagers said and had them relate to me
There is the monk Xuangao at Zhili Monastery in Fuyang county in Xiangzhou  whose secular family name is Zhao
His elder brothers son was a son of the Ma family of the same village as his former existence
The son of the Ma family died at the end of the Zhenguan era 
In his last moments the son looked at his mother and said I have a relationship from my former existence with the head family of Zhao
After death I will become a grandchild of the head family
The head is in the same village as  The mother did not believe this she marked her sons left side with a black spot a large mole
A wife of the Zhao family also had a dream in which this boy came to her and said I will be your son In virtue of this she became pregnant
What she saw in her dream was like a child of the Ma family
After childbirth the mole on the boys body was veried still in the same spot as on his former body
When the boy became three Chinese years old with no one leading him he went to the Ma familys house by himself and said This is my former house This boy still lives and has already reached the age of fourteen or fteen Chinese years old
Monks of Zhili Monastery in Xiangzhou such as Huiyong and Fazhen spoke of this
Greatest Sincerity Introduction Seeking Treasures Seeking the Precepts Seeking Forbearance Seeking Diligence Seeking Concentration Seeking Fruition and  Relief from Difculties On the occasion of being touched by greatest sincerity there is no deity who does not respond to it
Mahāsattvas feel some inclination toward  but without potential to receive the teaching they do not proceed encourage themselves and devote themselves to eternally
Consequently in all of the great vows there is none that does not comply with patience and knowledge 
Their minds are extensive and they all abide in the stage of nonretrogression for realizing highest perfect enlightenment 
Except for cultivating their minds through meditation they value immutable integrity make vows that are more rm than metal and stone protect and maintain the profound mind for relief until death propagate the Way in order to repay the four kinds of favors and nourish their virtue in order to help beings of the three realms of existence
This is merit spreads over incalculable time The fruition goes throughout the ten stages 
The Dazhi jing says
In ancient times in a country called Happiness   there was a layman called Mahājanaka and his wifes name was Sandaka
She gave birth to a boy who had ne features that were rarely seen in this world
he stood on the ground and spoke
He made a vow I will surely donate and give alms to the poor and benet them His parents accordingly called him Daiyi 
 When he turned seventeen years old he resolved for the sake of sentient beings to enter the sea and collect maṇiratnas  in order to aid them
After he entered the sea for the rst time he came to Silver City
A dragon king gave him a maṇiratna Twenty li farther on there is a treasure gem advanced and then came to Gold City
A dragon king gave him a maṇiratna There is a treasure gem in forty li Again went on and arrived at Shuijing City
 A dragon king gave him a maṇiratna  this gem for sixty li where there is a treasure gem again went on and came to Vaiḍūrya City
A dragon king gave him a maṇiratna  this gem for eighty li where there is a treasure gem
Later when you attain the Way I wish to be your disciple
I will make more offerings to you than I have today with a pure mind
Please cause me to advance and attain wisdom Daiyi received the gem and left
intending to return to his home country traveled through the sea
All the kings of the sea gods accordingly discussed among themselves and said Even though there are numerous precious valuable treasures in our sea there are no gems like these So they ordered a sea god to wrest at a key place
The god transformed into a man and met Daiyi
He said I have heard that you have obtained unusual things
Could I borrow and look at them Daiyi opened his hand and showed him the four gems
The sea god then shook hand and caused the gems to fall into water Daiyi thought to himself When the to me they said that it is difcult to keep them yet fortunately I obtained them
Now they have been snatched away by this boy
This is not a joke immediately said to the sea god I worked by myself diligently defying hardships passed through dangerous places in order to obtain these gems
You snatched them away from me Now they will not return to me
So I must completely remove the seawater The sea god understood and asked Your resolution is wonderful and lofty
The depth of the sea is three million three hundred sixty thousand yojanas Its width is boundless
What can you do to exhaust 
This would be like the sun not setting at all or like trying to grasp and restrain a strong wind
Even if the sun would set or the wind could be grasped it is impossible to remove all the water in the great sea and to cause it to be exhausted Daiyi answered with a smile I remember the sequence of receiving a body birth and death the decay  the bones that accumulate higher than Mount Sumeru and the blood that runs through the ve rivers
I still intend to cut off the root of transmigration of birth and death
This small sea is merely not worthy for me to drain
Formerly I made offerings to all buddhas took a vow and said  cause my resolution and conduct to be brave and that there will be no difculties in judging what is upheld in the Way I will surely be able to move Mount Sumeru and exhaust all the water in the great sea
I will not withdraw my intention until the end Then he attentively began removing the seawater with a utensil
his pure and sincere intention the four heavenly kings came and helped Daiyi
They removed twothirds 
Thereupon all gods in the sea became greatly alarmed
They discussed together and said If we do not return the gems to Daiyi now this will not be a minor matter
If the seawater is exhausted and even the mud  is taken out our mansions will be destroyed So the sea gods took out numerous treasures to give to Daiyi but Daiyi would not accept them
I want only to get back the gems  held back in the end they knew intention was rm So they took out gems and returned them to him
Daiyi took the gems and returned to his home country
He made a great donation as was his wish
From that time on in his area no one ever suffered from starvation or cold
The Buddha said to all the bhikṣus I am the one who formerly was Daiyi nanda addressed the Buddha Due to what merit was presented these four gems and the numerous treasures that followed them The Buddha replied Formerly at the time of Vipaśyin Buddha Daiyi erected a stupa with four treasures for that buddha made offerings to the Three Revered Ones and fasted after noon for purication for seven days
At that time ve hundred people built a temple together at the same time some installed silk canopies and lit lamps some burned incense and scattered owers some made offerings to the sangha and some recited sutras and explained and discussed them
Today everyone is able to meet the Buddha and they all attain liberation Therefore the sengqi l
At that time a sea god thought in this way Even if he draws out this seawater for a hundred years he will ultimately not be able to decrease it even as little as a hairs breadth was moved by devotion and diligence and immediately returned the treasure to him
At that moment the sea god uttered these verses for the brahman
With the power of devotion diligence and expedient means His resolution does not abate Because I was moved by his devotion and diligence Although he had lost  he got it back Just as the Za piyu jing says
 In earlier times there was a man called Sārthavāha
He heard that there were extraordinary treasures in a foreign country and wanted to go and make a living there
There were however troubles with rākṣasa demons between the two countries  So it was impossible to travel there
As Sārthavāha roamed he saw at the west gate of a marketplace a Buddhist seated on a couch without a mat
said I am selling the ve precepts Sārthavāha asked What are the ve precepts replied They are formless
They are received by your mind directly from my voice If you observe them later you will be able to be reborn in heaven
In this existence you can drive away the troubles caused by rākṣasa demons Sārthavāha wished to buy and asked how much he was asking for them
answered A thousand gold coins soon completed receiving 
said When you head toward a foreign country and come to the national border if a rākṣasa demon comes to you just say I am a disciple of ākyamunis ve precepts Sārthavāha shortly arrived at the border between two countries
He saw rākṣasa demons who were one zhang and three chi tall
Their heads were as yellow as straw and their eyes as red as a scorpions tail Their entire bodies were covered by hard scales
They one after another opened and closed their mouths just like the gills on a shshaped woodblock
When they looked up their height was close to that of a ying swallow When they trod on the earth they sank down up to their knees
Hot blood spilled from their mouths
There was a crowd of several thousands there directly took hold of 
Sārthavāha said I am a disciple of ākyamunis ve precepts The rākṣasa heard this yet he was not willing to release him for a long time
Sārthavāha struck lightly with the both sts
He was drawn into its hard scales and could not escape
He was able to step on it with his feet and butted it with his head but he still could not escape
His entire body was subsumed in the hard scales
He could move only his back
The rākṣasa said in verse
Your entire body hands and feet are Completely restrained You should just die What are you jumping about for Sārthavāhas willpower remained rm
He said to the rākṣasa in verse
My body hands and feet are Temporarily bound I however regulate my mind to be as rm as metal and stone I will not in the end be killed by you The rākṣasa again said to Sārthavāha
I am a king among demons With stronger physical powers than human beings Up to now I have eaten like you I cannot recall the number  You should just die What are your words of selfconsolation for
Sārthavāha was about to curse in rage but thought to himself I myself have been transmigrating in the three realms of existence I have not given to other people
By sacricing I will cause this rākṣasa immediately to eat to the full Then he said in verse
I have intended for long To be separated from this foulsmelling body If a rākṣasa captures me Take all of me as my donation I aspire and seek the Great Vehicle  I will achieve the fruit of allknowing wisdom The rākṣasa was sharp and understood what Sārthavāha said
then gave rise to a feeling of shame and let Sārthavāha go
He knelt upright with palms joined faced  and made his apologies
You are a master to liberate the people You are very rare in the three realms of existence You aspire and seek the Great Vehicle You will attain buddhahood certainly within a short time Therefore I will take refuge in you I will bow my head to your feet and worship you The rākṣasa nished his repentance and sent off Sārthavāha
arrived in the foreign country where he obtained many pieces of jewelry and valuables
He was again sent off and returned home
He greatly cultivated himself earned merit and consequently attained the truth of the Way
Therefore it is known that the power of precepts is miraculous
Those who diligently conduct all practices should rmly observe the Buddhist precepts and also just like this man they should set their resolution and be brave and erce
Just as the zhidu lun says
There was a poisonous dragon of great strength
A weak person would immediately die simply from the glance of  and a strong person will die simply from exhalation
At one time the dragon received the precepts for a day
It renounced the world and entered a wood
It sat pondering for a long time Then it became tired and negligent and fell asleep
In the manner of dragons when they sleep their form is just like that of a snake was made of seven treasures and multicolored
A hunter saw it and said in pleasant surprise Wouldnt this very rare and scarce pelt be good to present to a king for the decoration of a ship Then held down head with a stick and began aying it with a knife
The dragon thought to itself With my physical strength I could cause the land of a nation to collapse
How can this petty man trouble me
Since I now observe the precepts however I do not look to myself I must follow the Buddhas words therefore bore 
It closed its eyes and did not look at 
It stopped its breath without panting and felt compassion for the man Because observed the precepts while it was being ayed it never gave rise to the remorse 
It soon lost all its skin and the bare esh was on the ground
At that time the sun grew hotter
meandered across the ground intending to go to a large pond It saw various small insects come and eat its body
Because of its observance of the precepts it dared not move any further
Pondering to iself it said I now give my body to various insects because it is for the Buddhist Way
I now give my esh in order to nourish their bodies
Later I will expound the Dharma in order to benet their minds The dragons body was consumed and it died
It was then reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven
Even animals can rmly observe the Buddhist precepts
did not violate them right up until its death
how much more so should we human beings be
How could those who intentionally violate be forgiven
The wufen l
The Buddha said In ancient times there was a black snake that bit a calf and then returned to its burrow
A master of the black arts incanted using a black sheep through the incantation he tried to get to come out of the burrow but he could not do so
The master of the black arts then built a re in front of the calf and incanted to it
transformed into a re bee
entered the snakes burrow and bit and burned the snake
The snake felt unbearable pain and later came out of its lair
The black sheep then seized with its horns and placed it in front of the master of the black arts
The master of the black arts said You  Lick and take the venom back into yourself or I will throw you into this re The black snake then said in verse
Since I have already spit out the venom I cannot take it back after all Even if I come across a fatal event and die I cannot get back
Thereupon did not take the venom back and threw itself into the re The Buddha said The black snake of that time is now āriputra
Formerly he experienced the agony of death in this way and yet he did not take the venom back much less will he take the discarded medicine now Just as the Zabao zang jing says
The Buddha said In times past there was a great prairie between the two countries of Kāśi and Videha where there lived a demon called leṣaloma
damaged a road so that no one could pass through there
A chief merchant called Siṃha intended to pass through this road leading ve hundred merchants
They all feared and were afraid that they would not be able to pass through The chief merchant said Be careful but do not be afraid of it
Just follow me So they advanced and arrived at the demons place
said to the demon Have you not heard my name replied Yes I have heard your name
That is why I am here and wish to ght against you asked What can you do He then took up a bow and arrow and shot the demon
All ve hundred arrows he shot pierced the demons belly
His bow swords and weapons entered the demons belly too then advanced and directly struck with his st but his st also entered 
When he went to push with his right hand his right hand became stuck to 
When he trod on with his right foot his right foot also got stuck to 
When he stepped on with his left foot his left food was stuck to  too
Successively he butted with his head and his head became stuck to as well
The demon said in verse
You tried with your hands feet and head All these things were however just became stuck to me What else is not stuck to me The chief merchant replied in verse
I have tried with my hands feet head All money swords and weapons Although all these things were subsumed by you Only my diligence remains and it is not stuck to you If I persevere in being diligent The ght against you will continue to the end Now I persevere in being diligent I do not rouse awe in you to the end
At that time the demon responded and said Now because of you I will let all the ve hundred merchants pass Just as the Xin posha lun says
The king of devils nally found the Bodhisattva sitting under the bodhi tree Sitting to attention in an upright posture immovable made a vow to attain enlightenment
quickly went out of his palace and came to the Bodhisattvas place He said to the Bodhisattva You son of the kṣatriya class You should rise from your seat
Now is the time of corruption and evil when sentient beings are tough and strong
You denitely cannot testify to highest enlightenment
For the time being you should at present receive the throne of a wheelturning noble king 
I will offer the seven treasures to you The Bodhisattva said What you have said is like what is promised to induce a child
You can cause the sun the moon and Mercury to fall  and the mountains groves and the great earth to ascend into the sky
If you wish to cause me to not attain the great realization now and arise from this seat you denitely have no power of distinguishing right  Later devils led his military forces of thirtysix koṭi of devils 
 All appeared in various horrible forms
They had arms of innitely varied shapes and types and they covered an area over thirtysix yojanas in size
Then they all rushed to the bodhi tree and tried to disturb the Bodhisattva but they could not do so
In his body and mind the Bodhisattva was even more immovable than Mount Sumeru
 Just as the Zabao zang jing says
The Buddhist Dharma is extensive it saves and liberates limitlessly
Those who seek the Way with sincerity will invariably attain fruition Consequently they will be allowed to laugh and enjoy themselves in fun
Happiness is not vainly given up
It is just like a case in the past of an elderly bhikṣu
He was senile his spirit was confused and clogged
He saw that all the young bhikṣus preached the Dharma in various ways
When he heard them explained the four fruits  he gave rise to praise and respect for them in his mind
He said to the young bhikṣus You are intelligent
I wish you will give me the four fruits All the young bhikṣus said with a scornful laugh We have the four fruits
We need to obtain good food
Then we will give them to you At that time the elderly bhikṣu heard this and was greatly delighted
He immediately arranged for various kinds of dishes and food invited the young bhikṣus and begged them to give him the four fruits
The young bhikṣus nished eating the food
They all commanded the elderly bhikṣu mocking him saying O great virtuous one
You be seated at a corner of this building
We will surely give you the fruit When the elderly bhikṣu heard this he felt great delight
He sat as they had said
All the young bhikṣus then hit him on the head with a leather ball and said to him This is the srotaāpattiphala The elderly bhikṣu on hearing this focused his attention without becoming distracted
He then attained the rst fruit of the four types of sainthood
All the young bhikṣus again said mocking him Even though we gave you the srotaāpattiphala you still have seven more births and deaths
Move further to another corner
Next we will surely give you the sakṛdāgāmiphala At that time because the elderly bhikṣu had already attained the rst fruit his mind was developed and improved
He immediately moved and sat down
All the young bhikṣus again hit him on the head with a leather ball saying We give you the second fruit At that time the elderly bhikṣu focused his attention more and more
He accordingly testied to his attainment of the second fruit
All the young bhikṣus again said mocking him You have already attained the sakṛdāgāmiphala but you still have the difculty of the transmigration of birth and death
You move again and sit down
We will surely give you the anāgāmiphala Then the elderly bhikṣu just as he had been told moved and sat down again All the young bhikṣus again hit him with a leather ball saying We now give you the third fruit The elderly bhikṣu heard this and was greatly delighted
He doubled his sincerity and promptly testied to his attainment of the anāgāmiphala
You will however still receive the impure body in the realm of form and the formless realm 
Everything is impermanent it changes and is gone Every thoughtmoment is suffering
You again move and sit down Next we will give you the fruit of arhatship The elderly bhikṣu then moved and sat down just as he had been told
All the young bhikṣus again hit him on the head with a leather ball saying We now give you the last one the fourth fruit At that moment the elderly bhikṣu pondered with his whole heart and testied to his attainment of the fruit of arhatship
After attaining the four fruits the elderly bhikṣu was extremely happy
He arranged various dishes and foods and much incense and owers invited the young bhikṣus and rewarded them for their kindness
discussed with the young bhikṣus practices for attaining nirvana and the highest pure merit
When all the young bhikṣus comments grew stagnant and their speech was blocked the elderly bhikṣu simply said to them I have already testied to my attainment of the fruit of arhatship When all the young bhikṣus heard his words they repented and apologized to him for their sin of having made fun of him
Therefore those who are engaged in religious practice must think of wholesomeness
Even an who has been teased still attained a real reward not to speak of someone who has sincerity
Again the Zabao zang jing says
If a person seeks the Way a pivot lies in diligence and sincerity which move with each other and he will be able to attain fruition of the Buddhist Way 
It is just like the past of a woman who was bright and intelligent and deeply believed in the Three Treasures
She always invited a bhikṣu according to the sanghas seating order  and went to her house and received her offering
One time an elderly bhikṣu came to her house
He was old and dullwitted he originally had no knowledge for realization
At that time the meal in the Buddhist service had already ended and the woman asked the elderly bhikṣu to preach the Dharma for her
She spread out a mat for herself closed her eyes and was silent
The elderly bhikṣu aware that he himself was an imbecile and did not know how to preach the Dharma watched to see that she closed her eyes
 Then he deserted her and ran back to the monastery
The woman however ponder with sincerity on the truth that things in the phenomenal world are impermanent full of suffering and empty and therefore nothing exists by itself
She observed these things deeply in her mind and then attained the rst fruit of the four stages of sainthood
After she had already attained the fruit she sought out the elderly bhikṣu in order to repay his kindness
This elderly bhikṣu knew that he himself was ignorant had deserted her and had run away
His feeling of shame doubled He again abandoned her and hid from her
The woman however continued to seek for him earnestly
Just then appeared
The woman then told him in detail that she had received and had attained fruition of the Buddhist Way
Consequently she gave him a present and made an offering to him in order to repay his great kindness
At that time feeling extremely ashamed of himself the elderly bhikṣu deeply reproached himself He then attained the rst fruit of the four stages of sainthood
Therefore those who are engaged in religious practice must have sincerity
If you have sincerity you will certainly attain what you seek
Difficulties Just as the Sengqie luocha jing says
 Formerly the Bodhisattva was in the form of a parrot that always perched on a tree
The wind blew the tree which brushed against other trees and caught re
The re gradually became stronger and consequently burned up the entire mountain
The parrot pondered Just as a ying bird that perches on a tree must repeatedly give rise to gratitude for the tree so too must I myself who perched on it for a long night 
Can I extinguish the re He then went to the great sea and drew up some seawater with both his wings He ew above the re and sprinkled the water over it and let spill from his beak He rushed about from east and west
At that time there was a good deity who was moved by working so diligently despite hardship
then immediately extinguished the re for 
In addition the zhidu lun says
In the past a brush re burned a grove
In the grove there was a pheasant that industriously exerted itself to jump into a pond and then sprinkle the grove with water
went back and forth and became exhausted yet did not consider it as suffering
At that time akradevendra came and asked What are you doing replied I am trying to rescue this grove because I feel pity for sentient beings
This grove is a place to shelter and to nourish them They dwell here for a long time and it is a nice cool and joyful place
All the species of birds like me and all the members of the same ancestry as mine everyone entirely relies upon 
I have physical strength
Why would I stand around and not try to rescue it akradevendra asked For how long are you going to be so dedicated and industrious like this The pheasant replied I consider my death to be the limit akradevendra asked Who can testify to this for you immediately took an oath by himself
I have the greatest sincerity in my mind
If is true and not false I pray that the re will promptly extinguish itself At that moment the deity of uddhāvāsa Heaven knew of the pheasants great oath and immediately extinguished the re for 
From that time on the grove is always exuberant and never burns in a re Therefore a sutra says that when a person makes a good oath the deities certainly listen to it This saying is testied Verses say With determination and sincerity I embrace purity My life closes in just as the sun sets in the west I sigh over the swiftness of a raging river How sad is the limitation of life Here all my years have been harvested I am afraid to become emaciated at the close of my life With pure sincerity I seek the practices of giving  observing the precepts  Forbearance  diligence  meditation  and the eyes of wisdom  Making a friend and gathering together are both far from me At a wonderful spot however minds accord with each other The merchant did not fear death The rākṣasa could not yet transgress Seeking treasure a person drained the great sea The gods afraid offered maṇiratna to him
I will send a message to those who seek the Way Make a resolution Reward or retribution is not unreal Miracle Stories When we clarify things in ancient and modern times whether one is Buddhist clergy or a layperson one should have nothing but the greatest sincerity When people restrain themselves they will certainly perceive a sign Here I simply enumerate three cases from nonBuddhist sources and eleven cases from Buddhist sources I briey explain altogether fourteen stories of nonBuddhists and Buddhists  Emperor Ming of the Jin dynasty condemned the strongman Han Xuan to death
Xuan told the person who held the sword  I have many thick muscles in my neck
If you try to cut through it will immediately break
I will repay you  The executioner did not exercise caution and consequently he brought his sword down on  he had to make several blows before was severed
Shortly after he saw Xuan wearing a deep redcolored cap and vermilion garments With a red bow and a scarlet arrow shot 
The executioner cried Han Xuan paid me back belatedly Soon after he died
Xiong Qu of Chu state was traveling at night when he saw a rock which he thought was a tiger lying on the ground
He drew his bow to the full and shot at it
The arrow pierced so deeply that the arrowhead disappeared and the feathers on the shaft ew off
Only when he dismounted from a horse and looked did he realize that  was a rock Then he shot it again but the arrow broke and there was no trace that the arrow had hit the rock
At the time of the Han dynasty when Li Guang was governor of Wubeiping  he shot what he thought was a tiger but it was a rock just as in the case of 
Liu Xiang said With the utmost sincerity even metal and stone can be pierced to say nothing of a human being
If when you express your opinion no one agrees with you or when you take an action but no one follows you then you must have something incomplete in yourself
If the one who sits on the highranking seat wishes to reform the world he should rst improve himself Gan Jiang and Mo Ye 
tempered swords for the king of Chu
He took three years to complete the swords
The king became angry at him and intended to kill him There were a pair of swords male and female
His wife was in the last month of pregnancy
He said to her I took three years to make these swords for the king
He is angry with me If I go to see him he will certainly kill me
If you give a birth to a boy when he grows up tell him Go out of the house and look for the mountain to the south
There is a pine tree coming out of a rock The sword is placed behind it Thereafter took the female sword and went to be received in an audience with the king of Chu
The king of Chu was greatly angered He had investigate
It was found that the swords formed a male and female pair and that  the female sword without the male one
Furious the king killed 
After this incident Mo Ye a son and named him Chi
When he grew up he asked his mother Where is my father His mother replied Your father took three years to make swords for the king of Chu
The king became angry and killed him
Before he left home he asked me to tell you Go out of the house and look for the mountain to the south
There is a pine tree coming out of a rock The sword is placed behind it So the son went out of the house and looked to the south but he did not see a mountain
He only saw a pillar made out of a pine tree standing on a foundation stone in front of the main hall 
So he cut a hole in the back of with an ax and obtained the sword
He schemed night and day about how to retaliate against the king of Chu
The king of Chu had a dream in which a boy with a space one chi wide between his eyebrows intended to retaliate against him
The king immediately offered a thousand catties of gold for the boys arrest
The boy heard about this and ed into the mountains As he walked singing a song he came across a traveler
asked him You are still young Why are you crying so sadly answered I am a son of Gan Jiang and Mo Ye
The king of Chu killed my father and I wish to retaliate against the king The traveler said I have heard that the king has offered a thousand catties of gold for your head
I will bring your head along with the sword to him and avenge your fathers death for you The boy said I would be very much blessed if you would do so Then he immediately beheaded himself and holding his head and the sword in both hands he offered them  standing upright
The traveler said I will never let you down corpse then nally fell to the ground
The traveler carrying the head went to have an audience with the king of Chu
The king of Chu was very happy
The traveler said This is the head of a brave person
It must be boiled in a cauldron of hot water The king as instructed boiled the head three days and three nights but it was not yet completely cooked 
The head jumped up from the boiling water and its face had a maniacal expression of rage
The traveler said This boys head cannot be boiled to softness
Please king approach and see for yourself
Then it will certainly cook completely The king promptly came to and the traveler drew the sword and struck the king
The kings head fell into the boiling water
The traveler again raised the sword and severed his own head as well which also fell into the water
The three heads cooked together until they were dissolved and could not be distinguished from one another
The esh remaining in the hot water was divided into three portions and buried
Therefore these were collectively called the Three Kings Tombs which exist even today in the vicinity of Xuanchun county in the northern part of Runan prefecture 
During the time of the state of Song  Grand Master Han Ping married a woman
Because she was so beautiful King Kang stole her away from him
Ping bore a grudge against the king
Because of this the king captured and imposed on him the penalty of city wall construction work
Pings wife secretly sent a letter to him
She took precautions about the expressions writing There has been a long rain
The river is large and the water is deep The sun rises and illuminates my heart The king obtained the letter and showed it to his attendants but no one understood its meaning
A retainer called He gave an answer The expression there has been a long rain means to sorrowfully think 
The phrase the river is large and the water is deep means to be unable to see him
The words the sun rises and shines upon me means to have in mind the determination to die Soon after Ping committed suicide
His wife secretly damaged her clothes to make the fabric fragile
When she ascended a tower with the king she threw herself from there
Attendants tried to grasp her but they could not catch her clothes in their hands  So she died
Her will was written on her sash
It said King you took advantage of my body while I was alive
I will take advantage of my death 
I wish you will give my corpse to Ping and bury it along with his King  however was angry and would not consent to this He had the villagers bury both bodies so that that their graves faced each other
He said They husband and wife are endlessly in love with each other
If they can unite their graves then I will not stand in their way Soon from the end of each of the two graves two catalpa trees began to grow
In ten days each of the two trees grow larger than an arms width across The trunks of both trees bent and came close to each other
The roots mingled with each other below and the branches were entwined above
Furthermore a pair of a male and a female mandarin ducks always roosted on the trees They never left there from morning until night crying sadly and entwining their heads against each other
Their cries moved people
The people of the state of Song pitied  and they called the catalpa trees the trees that are in love with each other 
The term to be in love with each other  began with this
Today in Luoyang there is Han Pings city wall
The ballad  is still handed down to the present day
Fu Wanshou of the Song dynasty was a man from Pingchang 
In the nineteenth year of the Yuanjia era  he was Acting Administrator of the Imperial Garrison in Guangling 
As his vacation came to an end he was returning to his province 
Around the early part of the fourth period of the night he began to cross the Yangzi River
When he began to cross the rivers ow was calm and peaceful But as he reached midstream a wind as sharp as an arrow arose
Furthermore at that time it was extremely dark No one knew which direction was going
From his earlier days Wanshou believed in the Dharma very diligently
he took refuge solely in Avalokiteśvara wholeheartedly and prayed without stopping
Suddenly together with several other people on the boat saw a light on the north bank which looked like the lights of a village The people on the boat were glad and said to one another That must be the light of Ouyang  The boat veered and headed toward the light and it reached before daybreak
When asked the people of the village  they all said No one lit a re last night Only then they realized that it had been a supernatural power They all returned and arranged for a purication 
Gu Mai of the Song dynasty was a man from Wu prefecture 
He believed in the Dharma very diligently
He became Acting Administrator of the Imperial Garrison
In the nineteenth year of the Yuanjia era  he was returning from the capital city to Guangling
He started from Shitou City and went upstream on the lake A north wind howled turbulently
The winds power did not diminish but the boatmen strove hard pushing forward
When they reached the middle of the course of the Yangzi River the waves were haphazard and erce
Only Mais boat was sailing He was anxious and restless and felt powerless
He chanted the Sutra on Avalokiteśvara After he had recited it about ten times the wind gradually weakened and the waves became slightly smaller too
When was in the middle reaches smelled a wonderful fragrance that did not abate and he secretly praised it
Therefore he devoted himself to chanting the sutra without stopping
Consequently he was able to safely cross over
ramaṇa Huihe of the Song dynasty was a monk of Zhongzao Temple in the capital city
At the time of the coup during the Yijia era of the Song dynasty he was still a secular layman
He followed Liu Hu  as a subordinate
At one time Hu sent scores of ofcers and soldiers to the east as spies
Huihe also took part in the march
They arrived at Quezhu where they met the imperial army which was headed toward the west
The spies scattered and they all escaped into thickets
Huihe could only ee 
When he reached the area of Xinlin  he came across a rural old man whose clothes were worn to tatters
Huihe then exchanged his neat trousers and jacket for the old mans clothes
He disguised himself as a farmer holding a basket and carrying a load on his back
At that time mobile forces were out catching the scattered spies
They saw Huihes appearance and suspicious they questioned him
Huihes responses were incoherent
Because of this he was whipped and was soon to be beheaded
From the time Huihe had ed he constantly recited the Sutra on Avalokiteśvara
As he was about to be beheaded his prayer became the most sincere
When the soldier raised his sword  he made a wrong step again and again
He raised the sword three times and every time the sword broke
Astonished the people freed Huihe
After this Huihe renounced the world and consequently accomplished the attentive cultivation
As for Han Hui of the Song dynasty his original domicile was unknown
He resided in Zhijiang 
His uncle  Youzong became Adjutant of the Section for Inner Troops of the Xiangzhou ofce toward the end of the Song dynasty
In the rst year of the Shengming era  Shen Youzhi  Regional Inspector of Jingzhou raised an army and came to the east
Yu Peiyu Administrator of the Xiangzhou ofce relied on the troops under his command and guarded the area by himself
It was unknown how matters were going
Youzong came under suspicion and was killed
The death sentence included his wife and children
Because he was the son of Youzongs elder brother Hui was imprisoned in the prefecture
Iron and wooden implements of punishment covered his entire body and he was rmly bound in chains and shackles
had to thoroughly investigate the situation and the implicated parties with the intent to eradicate all the members
Hui was fearful and distressed but he was helpless
He could only await the day 
Hui originally served the Buddha and often chanted the Sutra on Avalokiteśvara
So he recited the sutra day and night several hundreds of times
Precisely at noon the chains suddenly began to jangle spontaneously sounding just like rocks or tiles that are burning and crackling
A little later he saw that the chains had fallen off by themselves
Hui was afraid that wardens might think he had removed them somehow or cut them off
So he hurriedly called out and told them 
The wardens surprised refastened the chains and shackles on him Hui chanted the sutra as usual
A day later the chains jangled and spontaneously came off again
The circumstance was just like that of the rst time
The wardens then reported in detail to Peiyu who took the chains and closely examined them
He was awestruck that Huis prayers had been answered and immediately released 
Hui is still in good health and is extremely diligent in religious service
Peng Ziqiao of the Song dynasty was a man from Yiyang county 
He was appointed as Assistant Magistrate of his home prefecture and served Crown Prince Shen Wenlong
In the rst year of the Jianyuan era he was imprisoned because of an offense
Ziqiao had once renounced the world when he was a young boy
Even though he had returned to secular life he still continually practiced recitation of the Sutra on Avalokiteśvara
At that time Wenlong was greatly angered Zigiaos imprisonment was very strict and Wenlong certainly intended to kill him
Anxious and fearful Ziqiao had no other alternative than to recite the sutra with sincerity He did so up to more than one hundred times then he became tired and took a nap
At that time there were about ten prisoners and they were all asleep
Du Daorong an ofcial of Xiangxi county was imprisoned too
He was off and on asleep and awake he was not able to fall into a deep sleep
Suddenly a pair of white cranes appeared and perched on Ziqiaos screen
Soon one of the cranes ew down to Ziqiaos side
At that time felt that looked like a beauty
Daorong got up and watched Ziqiao
A pair of the fetters came off from legs but the carbuncles caused by fetters were still there
Daorong was startled After he had been looking at for a while Ziqiao also awakened
inspected the fetters together and sighed 
asked Ziqiao if he had dreamed
Ziqiao replied No I did not Daorong told Ziqiao what he had seen a little while before
Even though Ziqiao knew he would certainly die he still was concerned that the wardens would doubt if he tried to escape So he put the fetters that had fallen off back on to his legs over the carbuncles
Four or ve days later was released
Lian Yans cousin who was closely acquainted with both Ziqiao and Daorong heard what they had talked about What each said individually was the same just as related above
There was a śramaṇa called Shan is either shan or shan  in the Zhao dynasty
His pseudonym was Daokai
His original domicile is unknown
In another biography it is said that he was a man from Dunhuang and his original family name was Meng
had renounced the world when he was young
Since he wanted to live in seclusion in a rocky valley he rst abstained from eating grains
At the beginning he took noodles Three years later he ate only a paste of pine resin Thirty years later he only swallowed a pebble every once in a while
When the pebbles went down  he then abstained from wine dried and seasoned meat and miscellaneous fruits
When he was concerned about catching a cold he took only pepper and ginger
He was feeble but his complexion was sleek
He walked as if ying
The mountain deity tried several times but he was never moved
Immortals frequently visited him but he could not stand it
So every time they visited him he chewed on garlic in order to drive them away
He sat upright calmed his mind and never slept day and night
He resided in Baohan for a long time
In the second year of the Jianwu era Shi Hu sent a messenger from Xiping to invite  So left for the city of Ye 
He did not travel on a boat or vehicle and yet covered more than seven hundred li a day
When he passed by Nanan  he ordained a boy and made him his novice 
The boy who was thirteen or fourteen years old also traveled as fast as Daokai
After arriving  they resided at Zhaode Buddhist Temple
garments were worn to tatters so his back and shoulders were always bare
A covered platform eight or nine chi high was constructed in a room with a curtain woven of cogon grass suspended from the ceiling
meditated in this  He abstained from eating grains for seven years
He usually took miscellaneous medicines in which there was a smack of pine resin or tuckahoe
He was an expert in curing eye diseases and often traveled around the countryside treating the peasants
Presents sent to him by princes from far and near accumulated He received them and gave them away to others not even a single item remained 
In the last year of Shi Hus reign he foresaw that turbulent times were coming
So he took refuge with his disciple in the south in Xuchang 
In the third year of the Shengping era  they came to Jianye 
Then they went to Panyu and resided on Mount Luofu
lay down in the shade of the woods joyful and contented with living in isolation
He passed away in the seventh month of that year
His last wish was for his body to be left exposed in the woods
His disciple followed his will
Yuan Yanbo  of Chen prefecture became Governor of Nanhai in the rst year of the Xingning era 
Together with his brother Ying he went up to and wandered about the mountain and paid respect to Daokais body worshiping it by offering incense
During the Zhenguan era of the Tang dynasty there was Dong Xiong in Hedong 
He became Aide in the Court of Judicial Review
From the time he was young he was faithful and respectful to 
He kept a vegetarian diet for ten years
In the fourteenth year he was implicated in the incident of Li Xiantong
 His Majesty in high dudgeon ordered Attendant Censor Wei Cong to conduct a rigorous judicial investigation
Accordingly several dozen men were imprisoned
The Aide in the Court of Judicial Review Li Jing xuan and the Rectier Wang Xin were also both implicated in the crime
Xiong was imprisoned and bound in fetters in a cell along with them Lotus Sutra
He could chant it three thousand times a day
One night as sat and recited the sutra his fetters suddenly fell off spontaneously and dropped to the ground
Xiong was surprised and related this to Xin and xuan
Both Xin and xuan saw that the fetters were intact on the ground yet the lock and fetters were separated from each other by several chi
promptly reported this to a jailkeeper
That night the Investigating Censor Zhang Shou  was on night duty
ordered an ofcial to unlock the fetters lit the area with a torch and saw that the fetters separated from before it had been unlocked
Greatly surprised at this  bind with the fetters again sealed with some paper on which he inscribed something and left
Xiong recited the sutra as usual
During the fth period of the night  his fetters again fell off and dropped causing a noise
Xiong again told Xin and xuan 
At dawn reported to Jingxuan and saw for himself
The seal and the inscription were just as they had originally been and the fetters had again spontaneously separated from each other
Jingxuan usually did not believe in the Buddhist Dharma
his wife reading a sutra he always thought Why does she read this scripture and be misled by a nonChinese deity When he came to see the incident with Xiong he deeply realized the fault of his impiety
Just then knew that the Buddha is the Great Sage
At that time Xin also recited the names of the eight bodhisattvas In the daytime when his recitation reached thirty thousand times his fetters fell off and dropped to the ground
He saw it was just as what had happened in Xiongs case
These incidents were completely related within and outside the imperial court
Soon both were released together
In the Tang dynasty there was Shi Daoji at Pujiu Temple in Puzhou 
He was from Anyi county in Hedong 
His secular family name was Xiangli and his rst name was Zicai
After he entered the profound Dharma gate he changed his name to Daoji
Regarding his ancestry he was probably a descendant of Zichan a high ofcial of Zheng state 
In the past when Zichan was born he emerged making a st
He opened his hand and saw that the Chinese characters xiang and li  were 
Because of this  the family name
father Xuanhui was broadminded and ambitious
was fond of studying and he was erudite and respectful toward his father
 From his youth ji studied the writings of Confucius as well as books by the Three Augusts 
He had an honest and virtuous air
Extensively versed in sutras and discourses he penetrated clearly major things as well as minor matters
He became a teacher of clergy and laymen enriching red and blue  at the same time
He formed his brief in the teaching of benevolence which diffused far and near without obstruction and he profoundly protected from delement
He repeatedly investigated doubtful points with care
From the beginning Daoji would not take into consideration allowing nuns to take refuge in him 
He often said Women are disgraceful to the precepts
The sacred scriptures frequently state that the Buddha liberated and allowed them to renounce the world but by doing so this damaged the true Dharma
Even by only hearing the word our minds will be stained
Moreover how could there be no delement if we meet them
Furthermore in the Way cleanness and clarity are valued If do not take part in it will not be abused
The common people value that I avoid suspicion while gentlemen calmly serve 
Even though I am inadequate if ask me  then I will comply with and deliver them
For this reason I give them the precepts and instruct them and yet I have never ascended to to have an audience with and now I am very old
When come to ask me questions I do not let them enter my room In this way was honest kept himself free from immorality was clean and pure and was aloof from the world
The distinguished and talented men of Hedong did not have the same manner as 
Before time at the beginning of the Sui dynasty   ramaṇa Baocheng had begun construction on a large image as tall as a hundred zhang at Pujiu Temple
All the workers could only reach as far as one part of it
Before he was able to fulll his vow to complete this  cheng died at a young age
The elders of the community asked ji to continue 
thought that the large image had not yet been completed
Leading seven noble people  completed the lofty 
It took ten years to repair and construct the elegant decorations were all complete
Both clergy and laymen happily relied on  They were drawn up with joy
At the beginning on the night ji was asked  he saw in a dream two lions on the side of a cliff They spit out maṇiratna gems beside a large image successively and ceaselessly
He soon awoke and thought to himself The king of animals is unrestricted
This shows that the current of the Dharma has not stagnated
The maṇi gems spontaneously appeared in succession
This also explains that nancial donation will not be exhausted
Unseen fortune secretly improves and my accomplishment is indicated Immediately ordered artisans to make an illustration in front of a great image of Maitreya what he had seen in the dream
still remain today
The temple is south of a hill in Puban  is high and is pleasant it is a gorgeous and abundant place
borders communities of numerous families to the east and commands a view of rivers and mountains to the south
The image is set up three stories with rock hallways surrounding it on all four sides
The upper building of monks residence and the lower building magnicently face each other
A garden large piles  rice elds and vegetable gardens surround  in harmony with it
is small but it forms is large This is all completely due to jis accomplishment
To brandish emptiness and establish existence are entirely due to jis ability
Moreover wore a wornout robe ate coarse food despised wealth valued life extensively saved all beings and kindly supported them
He withdrew to a calm life and returned to a peaceful life He acted and yet did not rely on 
 He maintained a reclusive life
Heaven held the idea to oppose him and stopped him from cutting off the mundane world
did not intend  but all the people spontaneously valued him highly
He did not go out but people came to him of their own accord
Vice Director Pei Xuanzhen was favored and occupied the position of prime minister
respected good reputation and frequently gave beautiful clothes to him
Regional Inspector Du Churong knew the signicance of personality
He visited and asked him for the Dharma
tenderly and wonderfully moved people entirely in this way
Living during the last year of the Sui dynasty  conned himself 
Yao Junsu Vice Governor of Hedong garrisoned troops in a desolate city and some of his troops committed atrocities
At that time people did not dare to even glance at 
were planning to summon all the śramaṇas to the city in order to guard them there
Those who dared to admonish were killed
All the monks and laypeople were anxious but no one could disobey him
ji felt anger and lamentation within himself
Disregarding his body and life he said to his subordinates There are ups and downs in  the times but there is no rising and falling in the Dharma
Here we have a law that Heaven has not lost
Moreover śramaṇas are guests from the world beyond this world
Their actions are virtuous and lofty in the world
How could they take up weapons put on armor and become soldiers to guard against insults  Consequently leading śramaṇas such as Dao sun and Shensu he went up on the road to the mail hall step by step
With a threatening look he admonished  I have heard this
If you were not afraid of death you could not frighten others by death
I now see death is just like living
I fear only that I will not attain death like that
Death has an advantage
This should be eagerly wished for
To strive for the fate of the city depends on your strategy Lord and the peace of the world depends on your destiny
How could the Five Thearchs and the Three Augusts save if they were untrue and lacking in courage
Formerly in the Han dynasty the Four Brilliant Old Men were respected  and the world was prosperous and peaceful
In the state of Wei Gan Mu was honored and all the nations were wellgoverned
Today you wish to detain the people in order to have them attend military services
You go against the convention of Heaven in order to assemble the deities of heaven and earth
I simply fear to accept this inauspicious sign
I dare to announce my true thoughts and feelings
I pray that you deeply consider it do not become a case similar to that of an empty shop that collapses spontaneously one day and later becomes the laughingstock of the world
We monks rely only on sacred and sincere words practice the Way worship and chant sutras
For the sake of the country we revere happiness and benet common people unobtrusively
Gods protect us and help us If you would rather demand my head I will give it to you
That is still my original vow
Surely if I am forced to devote my remaining life to being a foot soldier I have no idea of the meaning of birth why I was born or of the meaning of death why I am dying When ji spoke these words the bystanders felt their blood run cold 
su rst listened to the admonition and he valued the persuasive manner of jis speech He looked directly at with eyes wide open and said How extraordinary it is to meet this person
Why is his spirit so signicant and strong Then relented and let go
After was released he returned to his original temple
Later it was known that submitted to  he visited and expressed repentance 
Yao su had killed without restraint had given free rein to his malicious mind and furthermore had slighted and disparaged others
Therefore even though he stopped  at that time misfortune later revealed its omen and he was unexpectedly killed by Xue Zong a man of the city
Generally speaking Daojis nature was strong and brave
Once he determined  he never withdrew even if he unexpectedly encountered someones anger and was about  sh meat
After he had already renounced the world he blamed himself for his original condition and he controlled his original nature
He turned to peacefulness and forbearance and enhanced those qualities When he attained the Chinese age of sixty his practice was even more vigorous
It became his nature learning These words are infallible
On the seventeenth day of the ninth month of the tenth year of the Zhenguan era  passed away at his original temple at the age of sixtynine Chinese years old
At the onset of his illness ji mentioned it but he did not complain of any clearly
He himself knew that he was weakening
He told his disciple I am now seventyve years old
I will die this year His disciple replied Teacher you are sixtynine years old
Why do you suddenly say this said to him Death and birth are spontaneous workings of the universal law
I am not afraid of them
Moreover I am about to turn seventy years old
The Regional Inspector showed a respectful manner to me and added six years 
Therefore  Our life is transitory
You should deeply overcome your and exert yourself
Look at what I have practiced Furthermore he said Havent you learned from the sutras that the world is truly insecure and there is nothing stable For three days following his death the bell was not tolled
After passed away things were just as they had been All the people bemoaned  They admired him and showed love for him
Few people worked their lands  In the Tang dynasty there was Shi Facheng at Wuzhen Temple on Mount Zhongnan 
His secular family name was Fan and he was a man from Wannian county in Yongzhou 
renounced the world when he was a child and lived at Wangxiao Temple in Landian 
He served ramaṇa Senghe as his teacher
he was also supported by a group of villagers who respectfully believed him he was comparable to a sage
Once someone wanted to kill and went to his room at night
saw raging ames inside the door the ames rose up along a curtain
Thereupon he immediately repented 
hes nature was pure and clean 
 A person had tried to deceive him by secretly immersing a sheep bone in the water and then drank from it
he originally did not know this yet when he drank he vomited
His hidden perception and latent consciousness were like this
cheng received with respect and sustained his instruction He considered that encouraging himself to chant the Lotus Sutra every day was his regular activity
He eagerly upheld and practiced the lotus samādhi
He cleansed himself both inside and outside and was always gentle and modest
He perceived in a dream that Samantabhadra encouraged him to inscribe the great teaching
cheng said The great teaching is Mahayana  All the buddhas wisdom is what is called the great wisdom prajñā
I will immediately enter into purication and circumambulate a buddha image chanting a sutra
I will call on artisans and pay them well ordered to copy the eight volumes of the Prajñāpāramitāsūtra and incense burner stands and scrolls of the sutra were solemnly completed
Furthermore on a mountain ridge on the south side of the temple built the Garland Hall 
After the mountain was leveled and the valley lled in  the eaves laid in a row and the roof tted with tiles 
The front faces the high mountains above and looks out on a sloping gorge to the right
Clouds and fog come and go and a sudden peal of thunder can be heard from above
 and it is really a spectacular sight
In addition exhausting my attentive determination I copied the sutra and I hold fast to it
The Academician of the Institute for the Advancement of Literature Zhang Xiaojing is Zhang Zans father
At that time he was called Yingou  and few could surpass him
came to the mountain as he had been requested He was ordered to receive the precepts
He puried himself washed his body and cleansed his mouth rinsed his mouth with some fragrant juice and put on new clothes
jing had begun copying the sutra on his long journey but lled less than fty sheets of paper Nonethless cheng paid double the price
With admiration he inspired to work intensively and diligently
Taking advantage of the money  jing did his best to copy 
After each volume was complete everyday cheng burned incense and held a religious service before of a long table 
Between ink drops he recognized the external object with his mind and saw it with his own eyes There was almost no omission
Therefore he imprinted it on his mind and deeply studied it with concentration
Once he perceived an uncommon bird whose form and color were very rare
ew into the hall ew around and stirred up 
It ew down to the sutra table and then went to perch on an incense burner
It looked peaceful and watched  it was naturally tame and was friendly 
After a good while it soared away
Next year when the sutra project had been completed and were preparing the celebration  the bird returned
Just as the previous year it was tame and disported itself crying out mournfully
In the rst year of the Zhenguan era images of one thousand buddhas were made 
 The bird returned again and perched on one of the artists back
meals for the Buddhist monks were offered and all were celebrated  It was already noon
wondered why had not yet arrived
cheng gazing at the mountain peak said The bird will not come I cannot perceive it
will cause no auspicious sign since it detests all wicked acts and giving alms to frivolous beings Soon after he said this returned
It circled over the people singing entered into the fragrant water and swiftly took wing after bathing it departed
Before and after these events phenomena appearing as auspicious signs happened one after another It is difcult to describe them all
cheng was originally good at literary pursuits and the people living in rural areas knew this
Verses and wonderful phrases from sutras engraved on rocks in the mountains and in remote places with rough roads were copied by himself and he had recite them
These are all chengs writings
 Moreover copied the Lotus Sutra by his own hand and it was placed exactly in the middle of an open eld
He was engaged in a service somewhere else and forgot to take it back
Suddenly a huge rainstorm occurred and the ditches and mountain streams 
 ran out to look for 
Only  the table it was on were dry the other items had been completely washed away
He tried to block the streams by pulling a pine tree down sideways across them Consequently fell into the owing water had not gone down the mountain stream
did not realize it but these things had landed up on a high bank and no item not even an insignicant one had been damaged
We truly know that this was due to the power of the sutra
Furthermore there was an old Buddhist niche beside Qingni Temple
The Zhou family had lled in  and it has still not been revealed to the present day
One night cheng saw in a dream a large respectable gure there
He soon woke up and went there to open up  He found an image in the niche just as 
With the lapse of many years all had come off  it was damaged
was repaired right away
Monks and laymen praised his good conduct
This is entirely the merit due to protection from the unseen world which was developed by cheng
On the last day of the summer of the fourteenth year of the Zhenguan era felt a complication set in and he spontaneously knew that he would soon leave the world
He prayed for rebirth in Tuṣita Heaven
He asked for water and nished washing  and then again asked to repair to his sedan chair
At the side he examined it himself as he did not wish for a luxurious 
Precisely on the last day of the month as a bright sign was about to be revealed suddenly spoke with no warning I wished to come to and now I have just entered into it but I have not yet availed myself to play my lute and sing Looking at his attendants he said I have heard that all things are impermanent and birth and death go around incessantly
Rebirth in the nine grades will testify to these words
Now there is a boy who welcomes me He has stayed outside the door for a long while
I am leaving this world now
All of you live in good spirits
You have the Buddhas rightful precepts You must have no deciency 
Do not cause grief and regret later After he spoke these words a bright light came from his mouth and illuminated surrounded by pillars
Moreover a rare fragrance of superlative degree permeated
simply saw sitting upright and solemnly pondering
They did not realize that his spirit had already departed
He was seventyeight Chinese years old at that time
Regarding chengs practice of reciting sutras the number of his recitations of the Lotus Sutra was calculated at ve hundred times in one summer
 On leisure days he chanted  and as well he practiced it concurrently So he reached a couple more of times 
Even if a visitor came requesting to speak with him he would not speak with before nishing the recitation of the sutra
In brief the number of times  is calculated at more than ten thousand times over ten years
During the Wude period of the Tang dynasty there was a nun called Faxin who practiced for many years in the Hedong area 
She frequently recited the Lotus Sutra
She found a skillful calligrapher to whom she offered several times more than a normal wage 
She specially set up a pure room for the calligrapher to copy the sutra
On awakening rst bathed and his garments were perfumed with incense burned 
In addition made a hole through one wall of the sutracopying room and placed a bamboo tube into the hole
She bade the sutracopier to take the other end of the bamboo tube in his mouth when he wanted to exhale so that his breath would go out of the room
It took eight years to complete copying the seven fascicles of the Sutra With much enthusiasm held a special commemorative service to mark the completion of copying the sutra and exerted all her respects for the sutra
Faduan a monk of Longmen  frequently assembled large groups of people and expounded the Lotus Sutra
After the nun had made a copy of the sutra in an accurate recension he sent someone to ask her for it
The nun refused rmly and would not give the sutra to him
Faduan upbraided her
So the nun reluctantly brought the copy to Faduan herself
When Faduan and others opened  they could only see the yellow paper without even a single character
They then opened the remaining scrolls which were all the same
Faduan and others felt ashamed and fearful and immediately returned the sutra to the nun
received it in tears and washed the sutra container with fragrant water
After bathing she placed the sutra on her head and circumambulated a buddha image while chanting the sutra
For seven days and nights she did not rest even for a short time
Soon she opened the sutra and saw that the inscriptions had been restored just as before
It is known that since purication was particularly promoted for copying sutras this incident happened
The reason there is no miraculous virtue  is simply that is not as assiduously practiced


Thus have I heard Once the Buddha was staying in the city of Rājagṛha on the mountain called Gṛdhrakūṭa together with a great assembly of twelve thousand monks all of whom were arhats whose corruption was at an end who were free from the confusion of desire who had achieved their own goals shattered the bonds of existence and attained complete mental discipline 
Their names were jñāta kauṇḍinya Mahākāśyapa Uruvilvakāśyapa Gayā kāśyapa Nadī kāśyapa āri putra Mahā maudgalyāyana Mahā kātyā yana Aniruddha Kapphiṇa Gavāṃ pati Revata Pilinda vatsa Bakkula Mahā kauṣṭhila Nanda Sundarananda Pūr ṇa maitrā yaṇī putra Subhūti nanda and Rāhula 
All of them were great arhats known to the assembly 
There were in addition two thousand others both those who had more to learn and those who did not 
The nun Mahā prajāpatī was there together with her six thousand attendants and also the nun Yaśodharā Rāhulas mother together with her attendants 
There were also eighty thousand bodhisattva mahā sattvas all of whom were irreversible from highest complete enlightenment  
They had obtained the dhāraṇīs were established in eloquence and had turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma 
Each had paid homage to countless hundreds of thousands of buddhas planted roots of merit in their presence and had always been praised by those buddhas 
They had also cultivated compassion within themselves skillfully caused others to enter the wisdom of a buddha obtained great wisdom and reached the other shore 
All of them were famous throughout countless worlds and had saved innumerable hundreds of thousands of sentient beings 
They were Mañjuśrī Avalo kiteśvara Mahāsthāmaprāpta Nityodyukta Anikṣipta dhura Rat na pāni Bhaiṣajyarāja Pradānaśūra Ratnacandra Can dra prabha Pūrṇa candra Mahāvikramin Anantavikramin Trai lokya vikrama Bhadra pāla Maitreya Ratnākara and Susātha vāha There were altogether eighty thousand such bodhisattva mahāsattvas 
At that time akra king of the devas was also there attended by twenty thousand devaputras 
Candra Samantagandha and Ratnaprabha and the great devas of the four quarters were there together with a retinue of ten thousand devaputras 
The deva putras śvara and Maheśvara were there attended by thirty thousand devaputras 
Brahma the lord of the sahā world as well as the great Brahma ikhin and the great Brahma Jyotiṣprabha were there together with a retinue of twelve thousand devaputras 
The eight nāga kingsnamely Nanda Upananda Sāgara Vāsukin Takṣaka Anavatapta Manasvin and Utpalakawere also there each of them surrounded by several hundreds of thousands of attendants 
There were four kings of the kiṃnaras whose names were Dharma Su dharma Mahādharma and Dharmadhara and each had several hundreds of thousands of attendants 
The four kings of the gandharvas were there They were Manojña Manojñasvara Madhura and Madhurasvara each of them also with several hundreds of thousands of attendants 
There too were four kings of the asuras called Baḍin Kharaskandha Vemacitra and Rahu each with several hundreds of thousands of attendants 
Mahā tejas Mahākāya Mahā pūrṇa and Maharddhiprāpta the four kings of the garuḍas were there together with several hundreds of thousands of attendants 
Finally King Ajāta śatru Vaidehīs son was also there with several hundreds of thousands of his attendants 
Each of them after having bowed at the Buddhas feet withdrew and sat to one side 
At that time the Bhagavat was respectfully surrounded by the fourfold assembly  paid homage honored and praised 
He then taught the bodhisattvas the Mahayana sutra called Immeasurable Meanings  the instruction for the bodhisattvas and the treasured lore of the buddhas 
After having taught this sutra the Buddha sat crosslegged entered the samādhi called the abode of immeasurable meanings and remained unmoving in both body and mind 
Māndārava and great māndārava owers mañjūṣaka and great mañjūṣaka owers then fell like rain from the sky scattering upon the Buddha and all of his attendants and the whole buddha world quaked in six ways 
At that time that whole assembly of such humans and nonhumans as monks nuns laymen and laywomen the devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas kings and noble emperors having experienced something unprecedented were lled with joy and with their palms pressed together they gazed attentively at the Buddha 
Then the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows It illuminated all the eighteen thousand worlds in the east down as far as the lowest hell Avīci and up as high as the Akaniṣṭha Heaven 
All the sentient beings in those worlds living in the six transmigratory states became visible from this world The buddhas in those worlds were also seen and the Dharma they were teaching could be heard 
The monks nuns laymen and laywomen and those who had practiced and achieved the path were also to be seen while the bodhisattva mahāsattvas of various background causes and conditions endowed in various degrees with the willingness to understand and having various appearances were also seen practicing the bodhisattva path 
All of the buddhas who had achieved parinirvāṇa were seen as well as their relic stupas made of the seven precious treasures 
At that moment it occurred to Bodhisattva Maitreya The Bhagavat has now manifested the sign of great transcendent power What could be the reason for this marvel 
The Buddha the Bhagavat has now entered samādhi 
Whom should I ask about this wonderful marvel 
Who would be able to answer my question Then he thought further 
This Mañjuśrī Prince of the Dharma has closely attended and paid homage to innumerable buddhas of the past 
Now whom should we ask about the illumination and marvelous sign of this buddha Then Bodhisattva Maitreya wanting to clear up his own confusion and knowing the minds of the fourfold assembly of monks nuns laymen and laywomen and of the nāgas yakṣas and other beings in that gathering asked Mañjuśrī What is the reason for this marvelous sign this great ray of light that illuminates the eighteen thousand worlds in the east and renders visible the adornments of all the buddha worlds Thereupon Bodhisattva Maitreya wanting to elaborate the meaning of this further spoke to Mañjuśrī in verse 
Why has the Leader Emitted this great ray of light far and wide From the tuft of white hair Between his eyebrows Raining down māndārava and mañjūṣaka owers And gladdening the people With the fragrant winds of sandalwood 
For this reason The earth is completely adorned And this world quakes in six ways And the fourfold assembly Is completely enraptured Delighted in body and mind at the experience of Such an unprecedented marvel 
From the depths of the Avīci Hell Up to the summit of existence The ray of light from between his eyebrows Illuminates the eighteen thousand worlds Which shimmer like gold And throughout all these worlds The births and deaths of the living beings Of the six transmigratory states of existence And the good and bad deeds Through which they have received Good and bad consequences Are all to be seen from here 
The buddhas the Sage Lord  Who teach the subtle and supreme sutra Are also seen 
Uttering soft sounds With their pure voices They teach innumerable myriads Of koṭis of bodhisattvas With their voices deep and enticing Like the sounds of Brahma They make the people eager to hear them 
In each world they teach the True Dharma They illuminate the BuddhaDharma And enlighten sentient beings By means of various explanations And innumerable illustrations 
To those who are suffering And are cast down by old age illness and death They teach nirvana To extinguish their sufferings 
To those who have merit Have paid homage to the buddhas And seek the excellent Dharma They teach the ideal of the pratyekabuddha 
To those heirs of the buddhas Who have practiced in various ways And are seeking the utmost wisdom They teach the pure path 
O Mañjuśrī Abiding here I see and hear Thousands of koṭis of things in this way There are many such things I shall now explain them in brief 
In these worlds I see bodhisattvas Equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River Seeking the path of the buddhas According to their various situations 
Some undertake the practice of giving gifts Joyfully giving gold silver coral pearls Jewels conch shells agates diamonds Servants carts and ornamented litters They give these things joyfully Transferring the merit To the path of the buddhas Wishing to obtain this vehicle Which is the highest in the three worlds And praised by all the buddhas 
Other bodhisattvas give gifts Such as ornamented carts yoked with four horses And furnished with railings Canopies and decorated eaves 
Moreover I see bodhisattvas Who seeking for the highest path Give gifts such as their bodies esh hands And feet as well as their wives and children 
Moreover I see bodhisattvas Who are joyfully giving their heads eyes and bodies While searching for the wisdom of the buddhas 
O Mañjuśrī I see kings making pilgrimages to the buddhas Asking about the highest path Abandoning their prosperous lands Palaces subjects and harems Shaving their heads and beards And wearing the robes of the Dharma 
I see some bodhisattvas becoming monks Dwelling apart in tranquility Reciting the sutras with contentment 
I also see bodhisattvas Persistent and courageous Going into remote mountains And contemplating the buddha path 
I see some abandoning worldly desires Dwelling always in lonely places Practicing profound meditations And obtaining the ve transcendent powers 
I see bodhisattvas Meditating with palms pressed together Praising the Kings of the Dharma With thousands of myriads of verses 
I also see bodhisattvas Profound in wisdom and rm in resolution Asking the buddhas questions Listening carefully and retaining everything 
Furthermore I see heirs of the buddhas Endowed with concentration and wisdom Teaching the Dharma by innumerable illustrations For the benet of living beings Leading and inspiring the bodhisattvas By joyously teaching the Dharma Destroying Māra and his minions And beating the drums of the Dharma 
I also see bodhisattvas Who are tranquil and silent in ease And never exult Even in the homage paid by devas and nāgas 
I see bodhisattvas Dwelling in forests radiating light Alleviating the suffering of beings in the hells And causing them to enter the buddha path 
I also see heirs of the buddhas Who have never fallen asleep And are constantly wandering in forests In search of the buddha path 
I see some who are pure like jewels Endowed with integrity And faultless in behavior In search of the buddha path 
Furthermore I see heirs of the buddhas In search of the buddha path Who have the power of perseverance And patiently endure Those of excessive pride Who abuse them verbally and physically 
I see bodhisattvas Who have been searching for the buddha path For thousands of myriads of koṭis of years And who have renounced idlers and foolish companions And approached the wise Having singlemindedly rid themselves of inner confusion They are meditating in mountain forests 
I also see bodhisattvas seeking For the highest path Who are giving food and drink And a hundred kinds of medicine To the Buddha and the sangha 
They give superb garments and clothing Worth thousands of myriads And priceless robes To the Buddha and the sangha 
They give thousands of myriads of koṭis Of treasured monasteries made of sandalwood And various kinds of excellent bedding To the Buddha and the sangha 
They give clean garden groves Full of owers and fruits Fountains and bathing pools To the Buddha and the sangha 
Thus they give such various excellent things With joy and vigor Seeking the supreme path 
There are also bodhisattvas Who are teaching innumerable sentient beings The Dharma of tranquility In various ways 
Furthermore I see bodhisattvas Who have perceived the essential character Of all dharmas to be without duality Just like empty space 
I also see heirs of the buddhas Who are seeking the highest path Through this subtle wisdom Their minds free of attachment O Mañjuśrī 
There are bodhisattvas Who pay homage to the relics of the buddhas After their parinirvāṇas 
I also see heirs of the buddhas Who have built stupas As numerous as the sands of the Ganges River With which to decorate the buddha worlds These jeweled stupas are magnicent Five thousand yojanas in height and Two thousand yojanas in both length and width 
On each of these stupas Are one thousand banners ags and canopies And jeweled bells ringing harmoniously 
And devas nāgas humans and nonhumans Constantly give offerings of Perfume owers and music to them 
O Mañjuśrī The heirs of the buddhas Have decorated the stupas In order to pay homage to the relics These worlds have been spontaneously Made as extraordinarily beautiful As the king of the heavenly trees When his owers bloom 
Because the Buddha has emitted this ray of light I and those with me in the assembly can see These worlds of marvelous and varied beauty 
The wisdom and transcendent powers Of all the buddhas are extraordinary By emitting a single ray of light He has illuminated innumerable lands 
Seeing this we attain That which we have not met with before 
O Mañjuśrī Heir of the Buddhas 
We entreat you to rid us of our confusion 
The fourfold assembly is joyfully Looking up at you and me 
Why did the Bhagavat emit this ray of light O Heir of the Buddhas now answer 
Why is he emitting this ray of light 
Will the Buddha teach us the True Dharma That he obtained while he sat On the terrace of enlightenment  
Will he predict enlightenment to us 
It is not for a triing reason That all the buddha lands ornamented With various jewels And all the buddhas have been made visible 
O Mañjuśrī You should know that the fourfold assembly Nāgas and devas Look forward to hearing What you shall reveal 
Thereupon Mañjuśrī spoke to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mai treya and the other worthy beings O sons of a virtuous family 
I am very sure that the Buddha the Bhagavat will now teach the great Dharma rain down the great Dharma blow the conch of the great Dharma beat the drum of the great Dharma and reveal the meaning of the great Dharma 
O sons of a virtuous family 
I have seen buddhas in the past who have shown this marvel and have taught the great Dharma immediately after emitting a ray of light 
Therefore you should know that in the very same way the Buddha has now emitted this light and has shown this marvel in order to cause all sentient beings to hear and understand the Dharma which in all the worlds is difcult to understand O sons of a virtuous family 
In the past more than innumerable unthinkable incalculable kalpas ago there was a buddha called Candrasūryapradīpa a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat He taught the True Dharma that was good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end It was profound in meaning elegant in speech and endowed with the character of the pure path of discipline and integrity 
To those seeking for the śrāvaka vehicle he taught the Dharma with respect to the Four Noble Truths causing them to overcome birth old age illness and death and to attain nirvana 
He taught the Dharma with respect to dependent origination to the pratyekabuddhas and to the bodhisattvas he taught the Dharma with respect to the six perfections  causing them to attain highest complete enlightenment and perfect allknowledge  Then there was another buddha named Candrasūryapradīpa and after him another buddha also named Candrasūryapradīpa And so in this way twenty thousand buddhas all had the same name Candrasūryapradīpa They also had the same family name Bharadvāja 
O Maitreya You should know that these buddhas beginning from the rst up to the last all had the same name Candra sūrya pradīpa endowed with the ten epithets 
The Dharma that they taught was good in the beginning the middle and the end 
The last buddha fathered eight princes before he renounced household life The rst was called Mati the second Sumati the third Anantamati the fourth Ratimati the fth was called Viśeṣa mati the sixth Vimatisamudghātin the seventh Ghoṣamati and the eighth was called Dharmamati 
These eight princes were endowed with dignity and power and each of them ruled over four great continents 
Having heard that their father had renounced household life and obtained highest complete enlightenment all of them abandoned their kingdoms and also renounced household life Each caused the spirit of the Mahayana to arise within him practiced the pure path of discipline and integrity and became an expounder of the Dharma They all planted roots of good merit under many thousands of myriads of buddhas At that time the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa taught the Mahayana sutra called Immeasurable Meanings the instruction for the bodhisattvas and treasured lore of the buddhas 
Having taught this sutra he sat down crosslegged undisturbed in body and mind among the great assembly and entered the samādhi called the abode of immeasurable meanings Then māndārava and great māndārava owers mañjūṣaka and great mañjūṣaka owers fell like rain from the sky scattering over the Buddha and all of his attendants 
And the whole buddha world quaked in six ways 
At that time all in that assembly of humans and nonhumansmonks nuns laymen laywomen devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas kings and noble emperorshaving experienced such an unprecedented marvel were lled with joy and pressing their palms together they gazed attentively at the Buddha Then the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows which completely illuminated all the eighteen thousand worlds in the east in the same way that all of these buddha worlds are visible now 
O Maitreya You should know that at that time there were twenty koṭis of bodhisattvas in the assembly who wanted to hear the Dharma 
All of these bodhisattvas having seen all the buddha worlds completely illuminated by this ray of light were struck with wonder and wanted to know why it was emitted 
A bodhisattva named Varaprabha was there with his eight hundred disciples 
At that time the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa having emerged from samādhi remained sitting for sixty intermediate kalpas and revealed to Bodhisattva Varaprabha the Mahayana sutra called Saddharmapuṇḍarīka the White Lotus of the Marvelous Law  which was the instruction for bodhisattvas and the treasured lore of the buddhas 
The assembly also sat there undisturbed in body and mind listening to the Buddhas exposition for sixty intermediate kalpas as if only a single mealtime had passed during that time not a single person among them experienced fatigue of body or mind 
Having taught this sutra for sixty intermediate kalpas the Buddha Candra sūryapradīpa made this proclamation to the assembly of Brahmas māras śrāmaṇas brahmans devas humans and asuras saying On this day during the middle watch of the night the Tathāgata will enter nirvana without residue Then the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa gave this prediction to a bodhisattva called rīgarbha Addressing the monks he said 
After the Buddha passed into extinction Bodhisattva Varaprabha having preserved the Lotus Sutra taught it to humans for the full period of eighty intermediate kalpas 
Varaprabha led and inspired them and caused them to be rm in highest complete enlightenment 
After paying homage to innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas all these princes attained the path of the buddhas The last of these to become enlightened was named Dīpaṃkara 
Among the eight hundred disciples of Bodhisattva Varaprabha there was a man named Yaśaskāma who was attached to prot Even though he had repeatedly recited the sutras he never became versed in them and forgot the greater part 
That is why he was called Yaśaskāma Fame Seeker But because he had also planted various roots of good merit he was able to meet innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas whom he rendered homage to honored revered and praised 
O Maitreya You should know that Bodhisattva Varaprabha at that time was none other than myself and Bodhisattva Yaśaskāma was none other than you 
Therefore I am certain that today the Tathāgata will teach the Mahayana sutra called the Lotus Sutra the instruction for bodhisattvas and treasured lore of the buddhas Thereupon Mañjuśrī wanting to explain the meaning of this further spoke to the great assembly in verse 
I remember that in the past Innumerable incalculable kalpas ago There was a buddha the Best of Humans Called Candrasūryapradīpa 
This Bhagavat taught the Dharma Leading and inspiring innumerable sentient beings And incalculable numbers of bodhisattvas To attain the wisdom of the buddhas 
Before renouncing household life The Buddha fathered eight princes Having seen the Great Sage Renounce household life They also followed him And practiced the pure path of discipline and integrity 
At that time the Buddha taught And extensively illuminated the Mahayana sutra Called Immeasurable Meanings To the great assembly 
After having taught this sutra The Buddha sat down crosslegged On the seat of Dharma and entered the samādhi Called the abode of immeasurable meanings The heavenly māndārava owers Fell down like rain The heavenly drums resounded spontaneously 
All of the buddha worlds suddenly quaked greatly And the Buddha emitted a ray of light From the tuft between his eyebrows And manifested various marvels 
This ray of light illuminated The eighteen thousand buddha worlds in the east And revealed the conditions Resulting from the karma of each sentient being 
Through this light of the Buddha All the buddha worlds appeared As if they were decorated with various jewels Such as lapis lazuli or crystal 
All the devas humans nāgas Yakṣas gandharvas and kiṃnaras Were each seen paying homage to the buddhas 
All the Tathāgatas who had spontaneously attained The path of the buddhas Looked majestic and very beautiful With bodies like golden mountains 
Each Bhagavat appeared like a golden image In the midst of lapis lazuli Expounding the meaning Of the profound Dharma to the great assembly 
There were innumerable śrāvakas In each of the buddha worlds And they saw all the great assemblies Because of the light of the Buddha 
There were also monks Living in mountain forests Who through persistence possessed purity of conduct Which they protected like a precious jewel 
There were bodhisattvas As numerous as the sands of the Ganges River Practicing by giving  perseverance  and so on  Who also became visible through the light of the Buddha 
There were bodhisattvas who Having entered deep samādhi Were tranquil and undisturbed in body and mind And who were seen seeking for the highest path 
There were also bodhisattvas Who knowing the tranquil character of the Dharma Were seen teaching the Dharma And seeking the path of the buddhas In each of the buddha worlds 
At that time the fourfold assembly Having seen the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa Manifest these great transcendent powers Became delighted and asked each other What the reason for this could be 
The Noble One revered by devas and humans Then emerged from samādhi and Praised Bodhisattva Varaprabha saying You are the Eye of the World You are believed in by all and Possess the treasure house of the Dharma You are the only one who can understand The Dharma that I have taught 
This expounder of the Dharma Varaprabha Firmly and completely Preserved this most excellent Dharma That was taught by the Buddha 
After having taught this Lotus Sutra And having then gladdened the assembly On that very day The Buddha told the assembly of devas and humans I have already taught you the meaning Of the essential character of all dharmas Today I will enter nirvana In the middle of the night 
Exert yourselves attentively And rid yourselves of negligence The buddhas are extremely hard to meet And can be encountered only once In koṭis of kalpas All the sons of the Bhagavat On hearing that the Buddha was to enter nirvana Became sad thinking Why will the Buddha enter nirvana so soon 
The Noble Lord the King of the Dharma Consoled the innumerable beings saying Do not fear after I enter nirvana 
And then he will bring Innumerable sentient beings to the path And that night the Buddha entered nirvana Like a re that goes out when the wood is exhausted His relics were distributed And innumerable stupas were built 
There were monks and nuns As numerous as the sands of the Ganges River Who increased their efforts And sought for the highest path 
This expounder of the Dharma Varaprabha Possessed of the treasure house of the Buddha Extensively proclaimed the Lotus Sutra For eighty intermediate kalpas 
All of the eight princes Led and inspired by Varaprabha Became rmly established In the highest path And met innumerable buddhas 
After having paid homage to the buddhas And following them in their practice of the great path They all in turn received their predictions Becoming buddhas in succession 
The last Buddha the Highest of Devas Was called Dīpaṃkara And as the leader of all the sages Had brought innumerable sentient beings to the path 
This expounder of the Dharma Varaprabha Had one disciple who was lazy And attached to fame and fortune This disciple ceaselessly sought these things And amused himself from house to house He abandoned recitation of the sutras And forgetting them Never became versed in them 
For this very reason he was named Yaśaskāma 
But since he had also performed many good deeds He was able to meet innumerable buddhas He paid homage to all these buddhas And having practiced the great path after them Acquired all the six perfections and Now meets the Lion of the ākyas 
He shall subsequently become a buddha called Maitreya Who will extensively bring Innumerable sentient beings to the path 
After the parinirvāṇa of that Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa The lazy one was none other than you And the expounder of the Dharma Varaprabha Was no one but myself 
When I saw the Buddha Dīpaṃkara He also revealed this marvel of light That is why I know that this buddha Will now teach the Lotus Sutra This sign is just like the previous marvel 
It is the skillful means of all the buddhas The Buddha has now emitted this ray of light In order to reveal The essential character of dharmas 
Now it should be clear to everyone Wait attentively with palms pressed together Having rained the Dharma The Buddha will satisfy those seeking the path 
If there is anyone seeking the three vehicles Who still has any doubts The Buddha will completely remove them Extinguishing them with none left over 
Skillful Means At that time the Bhagavat arose tranquilly with insight out of samādhi and addressed āriputra Profound and immeasurable is the wisdom of the buddhas The gate to their wisdom is hard to enter and difcult to understand None of the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas may be capable of understanding it 
Why is this 
The buddhas have closely attended innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of other buddhas They have exhaustively carried out practices with courage and persistence under uncountable numbers of buddhas their names becoming universally renowned They have perfected this profound and unprecedented Dharma and their intention in adapting their explanations to what is appropriate is difcult to understand 
O āriputra 
After attaining buddhahood I expounded the teaching extensively with various explanations and illustrations and with skillful means led sentient beings to rid themselves of their attachments 
Why is this 
O āriputra 
The wisdom and insight of the Tathāgatas is extensive profound immeasurable and unhindered They are possessed of power fearlessness meditation liberation and samādhi that is profound and endless They have completely attained this unprecedented Dharma 
O āriputra 
The Tathāgatas can through various methods skillfully illuminate the Dharma with gentle speech and gladden the hearts of the assemblies 
O āriputra 
To put it briey the buddhas have attained this immeasurable limitless and unprecedented Dharma Enough O āriputra I will speak no further 
Why is this 
Because the Dharma that the buddhas have attained is foremost unique and difcult to understand 
No one but the buddhas can completely know the real aspects of all dharmasthat is to say their character nature substance potential function cause condition result effect and essential unity Thereupon the Bhagavat spoke these verses to explain this meaning again The Heroes of the World are inconceivable Neither devas humans nor any other sentient beings Are able to comprehend them 
No one is able to discern the power fearlessness Liberation samādhi and Other attributes of the buddhas 
Formerly under innumerable buddhas They have fully accomplished their practices And the Dharma which is profound and excellent Hard to perceive and difcult to understand 
Having pursued these practices For innumerable koṭis of kalpas I attained the result on the terrace of enlightenment And understood completely 
I and the buddhas of the ten directions Know such matters Such as the great results and rewards And the meaning of various aspects and characteristics 
It is impossible to explain this Dharma The powers of speech fail No other sentient being is able to understand it Except for those bodhisattvas Who in their belief are willing to understand 
Even the multitude of the Buddhas disciples Who have formerly paid homage to all the buddhas Who have put an end to all their corruption And are bearing their last bodies Are not able to understand it 
Even if this whole world Were lled with those such as āriputra And they tried together to comprehend it They still would not be able to understand completely The wisdom of the buddhas 
Again even if the worlds of the ten directions Were lled with such disciples As āriputra And they tried together to comprehend it They still would not be able to completely understand 
And even if the worlds of the ten directions Were lled with pratyekabuddhas As numerous as bamboo trees in a grove Who had keen wisdom And were bearing their last bodies Free from corruption Even if they tried together singlemindedly For innumerable kalpas To comprehend the wisdom of the buddhas Still they would not understand it in the least 
Even if the worlds of the ten directions Were packed as thick as stalks of rice Flax bamboo and reeds With bodhisattvas recent aspirants to enlightenment Who had paid homage to innumerable buddhas Though they fully understood the meaning And could expound the Dharma Even with this subtle wisdom If they tried together singlemindedly to comprehend For as many kalpas as the sands of the Ganges River They still would not be able to know The wisdom of the buddhas 
Even if bodhisattvas As numerous as the sands of the Ganges River Who had reached the stage of nonretrogression Tried together singlemindedly to comprehend it Still they would not be able to know 
The Buddha still speaking to āriputra said I have already attained the profound and subtle Dharma That is incorruptible And beyond all comprehension Only I and the buddhas of the ten directions know this 
O āriputra You should know that the words Of the buddhas are never inconsistent 
For what reason and on what grounds have you so earnestly praised the unique skillful means of the buddhas and the profound and subtle Dharma that is difcult to understand 
Never before have I heard such a thing from the Buddha 
Now Bhagavat I entreat you to explain this because the fourfold assemblies are confused 
O Bhagavat Why have you so earnestly praised the Dharma that is profound subtle and difcult to understand Thereupon āriputra wanting to further explain what he meant spoke these verses O Great Seer Sun of Wisdom 
Now after a long time You have taught this Dharma saying I have attained the inconceivable Dharma That is to say power fearlessness Samādhi meditation and liberation 
No one has ever questioned the Dharma That I attained on the terrace of enlightenment 
No one has ever questioned my intentions So difcult to conceive 
Without being asked You explained it by yourself And praised the path you have practiced saying The wisdom the buddhas have attained Is extremely subtle 
The arhats free from corruption And those seeking nirvana Have all fallen into confusion Why has the Buddha said this 
Those seeking to become pratyekabuddhas Monks nuns devas nāgas Yakṣas gandharvas and the others Glanced at each other in confusion And looking toward the Best of Humans asked O Buddha We entreat you to explain why this is so 
The Buddha has said that I am the foremost Among the śrāvakas yet now I am confused About my own knowledge and unable to understand Is it the ultimate Dharma 
Is it a path to be practiced 
The sons born from the mouths of the buddhas Stand waiting with palms pressed together Looking at the Buddha I entreat you to proclaim the truth Speaking in the nest voice 
The devas nāgas and others As numerous as the sands of the Ganges River As many as eighty thousand bodhisattvas Who are seeking buddhahood and noble emperors Who have come from myriads of koṭis of countries Are all standing respectfully with palms pressed together Asking how to accomplish the path 
Then the Buddha addressed āriputra saying 
Speak no more 
If I explained this matter the devas and humans in all the worlds would be astounded Then āriputra again addressed the Buddha O Bhagavat Please explain it 
I entreat you to explain it because in this assembly there are innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of incalculable sentient beings sharp in faculties and possessed of wisdom who have previously encountered the buddhas When they hear the teaching of the Buddha they will trust believe and accept it Thereupon āriputra spoke in verse to explain this again 
In this assembly there are innumerable sentient beings Who will trust and accept it 
Then the Buddha again tried to dissuade āriputra saying If I explain it the devas humans and asuras in all the worlds will be astounded and arrogant monks will certainly go to their downfall At that time the Bhagavat again spoke in verse 
Though the arrogant hear it They will never accept it 
And again āriputra addressed the Buddha saying O Bha ga vat 
Please explain it Please explain it 
In this assembly there are people like me and others numbering into the hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of beings who have been led and inspired by the buddhas in their former existences 
Such people will certainly trust believe and accept it 
Please illuminate and explain it Innumerable beings in this assembly Will certainly trust and accept this Dharma Because the Buddha in former existences Led and inspired such people All of them will attentively listen and accept Their palms pressed together To the words of the Buddha 
I entreat you to illuminate and explain it For the assembly of twelve hundred people like me And the others seeking buddhahood 
When they hear this Dharma They will bring forth great joy 
Then the Bhagavat spoke to āriputra saying You have now persistently asked me three times How could I possibly not explain it to you 
I will now illuminate and explain it When he said this ve thousand monks nuns laymen and laywomen in the assembly immediately got up from their seats bowed to the Buddha and left 
What was the reason for this 
Because the roots of error among this group had been deeply planted and they were arrogant thinking they had attained what they had not attained and had realized what they had not realized Because of such defects they did not stay 
And the Bhagavat remained silent and did not stop them 
Then the Buddha addressed āriputra My assembly here is free of useless twigs and leaves only the pure essence remains 
O āriputra 
Let the arrogant ones go 
Listen carefully and I will explain it to you Then āriputra replied 
Indeed O Bhagavat I greatly desire to hear it Then the Buddha addressed āriputra Only very rarely do the Buddha Tathāgatas teach such a True Dharma as this as rarely as the uḍumbara ower blooms 
O āriputra 
Trust and accept what the Buddha teaches My words are never false 
O āriputra 
The real intention of all the buddhas in adapting their explanations to what is appropriate is difcult to understand 
Why is this 
Because I have expounded the teachings with innumerable skillful means and various kinds of explanations and illustrations 
Yet this Dharma is beyond reason and discernment Only the buddhas can understand it 
Why is this 
Because the Buddha Bhagavats appear in this world for one great purpose alone 
O āriputra 
Now I will explain why I said that the Buddha Bhagavats appear in this world for only one great purpose 
The Buddha Bhagavat appear in this world to cause sentient beings to aspire toward purity and the wisdom and insight of the buddhas 
They appear in this world to manifest the wisdom and insight of the buddhas to sentient beings 
They appear in this world to cause sentient beings to attain the wisdom and insight of a buddhas enlightenment 
They appear in this world in order to cause sentient beings to enter the path of the wisdom and insight of a buddha 
O āriputra 
For this one great reason alone the buddhas have appeared in this world The Buddha addressed āriputra saying 
O āriputra 
A Tathāgata teaches sentient beings the Dharma only through the single buddha vehicle There is no other neither a second nor a third 
O āriputra 
The true nature of all the buddhas of the ten directions is exactly like this O āriputra 
All the buddhas of the past expounded the teachings for the sake of sentient beings using incalculable and innumerable skillful means and various explanations and illustrations These teachings were all for the sake of the single buddha vehicle 
All these sentient beings hearing the Dharma from the buddhas nally attained omniscience O āriputra 
All the future buddhas who will appear in the world will expound the teachings for the sake of sentient beings using incalculable and innumerable skillful means and various explanations and illustrations These teachings will all be for the single buddha vehicle 
All sentient beings who hear this Dharma from these buddhas will ultimately attain omniscience O āriputra 
All the Buddha Bhagavats of the present in immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddha worlds of the ten directions teach the Dharma to sentient beings using incalculable and innumerable skillful means with various explanations and illustrations to benet many of them and cause them to feel at peace These Dharmas are all of the single buddha vehicle 
All the sentient beings who hear the Dharma from these buddhas will ultimately attain omniscience O āriputra 
These buddhas lead and inspire only bodhisattvas because they want to teach sentient beings with the wisdom and insight of the Buddha to enlighten sentient beings with the wisdom and insight of the Buddha and to cause sentient beings to enter the path of the wisdom and insight of the Buddha O āriputra 
I too am now like this Having understood the various desires and deeprooted inclinations of sentient beings I teach the Dharma according to their capacities through the power of skillful means using various explanations and illustrations 
O āriputra 
I do this in order to cause them to attain the omniscience of the single buddha vehicle O āriputra 
Since there is no second vehicle in the worlds of the ten directions how could there be a third 
O āriputra 
The buddhas appear in the troubled world of the ve delements which are the delement of the kalpa the dele ment through desires confusion the delement of sentient beings the delement of views and the delement of lifespan 
Therefore O āriputra in the period of the decadent kalpa because sentient beings are lthy greedy jealous and develop roots of error all the buddhas illuminate the three with the power of skillful means in order to teach the single buddha vehicle 
O āriputra 
If any of my disciples declare that they are arhats or pratyekabuddhas and do not listen or comprehend that all the Buddha Tathāgatas teach only the bodhisattvas they are not disciples of the buddhas nor are they arhats or pratyekabuddhas Again O āriputra 
If there are any monks or nuns who would declare that they have attained arhatship that they are bearing their last bodies and are destined for complete nirvana and yet who have not sought highest complete enlightenment they should be considered arrogant people 
Why is this 
Because there is no case in which a monk who has actually achieved arhatship does not believe in this Dharma except after the Buddha has entered parinirvāṇa and there is no buddha present 
What is the reason for this 
Because after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha it is hard to nd people who preserve recite and understand the meaning of the sutras like this 
But if they should meet other buddhas they will immediately understand this teaching 
O āriputra You should wholeheartedly accept and preserve the words of the Buddha 
The words of the Buddha Tathāgatas are never false There are no other vehicles only the single buddha vehicle Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate the meaning of this further uttered these verses 
They did not see their own defects Being faulty in selfdiscipline And clung to their shortcomings These of little wisdom have already left Through the virtuous dignity of the Buddha The dregs of the assembly have departed 
Free of useless twigs and leaves Only the pure essence of this assembly remains 
O āriputra listen carefully 
All the buddhas teach the Dharma That they have attained Through the immeasurable power of skillful means For the sake of sentient beings 
Completely knowing their intentions Their various ways of practice Their wishes and capacities And the good and bad karma Of their previous lives The Buddha gladdens all sentient beings With the power of words and skillful means Using examples and illustrations 
The Buddha teaches nirvana To those with dull faculties Who are satised with lowly aspirations And attached to birth and death Who have not practiced the profound path In the presence of innumerable buddhas And are confused by suffering 
Having devised this skillful means I enable them to enter the wisdom of the buddhas But I have never said That all of you would attain The path of the buddhas 
I have never said this Because the occasion never arose Now is precisely the right time for me To teach denitively the Mahayana 
I apply these nine kinds of teachings According to the capacities of sentient beings I teach these sutras Because they are the basis for entering the Mahayana 
I teach the Mahayana sutras To those heirs of the buddhas Who are pure in mind mild and receptive Have keen faculties And who have practiced the profound path Under immeasurable buddhas 
I predict that such people Will attain the path of the buddhas In their future lives Because they keep the buddhas in mind With profound thoughts And practice pure conduct 
Hearing that they shall attain buddhahood They will be lled with great joy Because a buddha knows their intentions He teaches the Mahayana 
Those śrāvakas or bodhisattvas Who have heard even a single verse Of the Dharma that I have taught Will all become buddhas There can be no doubt about it 
In the buddha worlds of the ten directions There is only the Dharma of the single vehicle Apart from the skillful means of the buddhas There is neither a second nor a third  
A buddha merely uses provisional words In order to lead sentient beings All the buddhas appear in the world To teach the wisdom of the buddhas 
Only this one thing is real The other two are not true In the end A buddha does not save sentient beings Through an inferior vehicle 
The buddhas themselves Abide in the Mahayana The Dharma that they have attained Is adorned with meditation wisdom and power And through these they save the sentient beings 
I would be ungenerous If I were to lead and inspire even a single person Through an inferior vehicle Having attained the highest path The universal Dharma of the Mahayana This is simply not possible 
If anyone takes refuge in the Buddha The Tathāgata will not deceive him A Tathāgata has neither stinginess nor jealousy And has detached himself From the evils of the phenomenal world 
That is why the buddhas of the ten directions Are the only ones who have no fear 
Having a body adorned with the marks of a buddha Emitting a ray of light that illuminates the worlds And revered by immeasurable sentient beings I teach the signs of the true aspects Of the phenomenal world 
O āriputra You should now know That originally I made a vow To make all sentient beings my equal Without any difference 
Now I have already fullled this vow That I made in the past I will lead and inspire all sentient beings And cause them to enter the path of the buddhas 
If I met sentient beings And taught them till the end the path of the buddhas Those with little understanding Would be confused and perplexed And would not accept the teaching 
I know that these sentient beings Have never cultivated the roots of good merit 
They are attached to the desires of the ve senses Disordered by delusion and passion And have fallen into the three troubled states of being Because of these desires They are wandering through The six transmigratory states Tormented by every kind of suffering They are continually being born as tiny embryos In one world after another 
These people of few qualities and little merit Are aficted by various sufferings 
They enter into the jungle of sixtytwo false views Such as This exists or This does not exist They are so rmly and deeply attached to false teachings That they cannot get rid of them They are arrogant proud deceitful and dishonest They have heard neither the names Nor the True Dharma of the buddhas For thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas Such people are difcult to save 
That is why O āriputra I devised the method of teaching The way to extinguish all suffering through nirvana 
Even though I taught nirvana It is not the true extinction Every existing thing from the very beginning Has always had the mark of quiescence 
The heirs of the buddhas who practice this path Will thereafter become buddhas in the future With the power of skillful means I have presented the teachings of the three vehicles 
Yet all of the Bhagavats Teach the path of the single vehicle This great assembly Should now rid itself of confusion The words of the buddhas are not inconsistent There is only the single vehicle There is no other 
In the past innumerable kalpas There appeared immeasurable and incalculable buddhas Hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis in number Who have attained parinirvāṇa 
All the Bhagavats Taught the characteristics of all dharmas With the power of innumerable skillful means Using various examples and illustrations 
All these Bhagavats Taught the Dharma of the single vehicle Led and inspired immeasurable sentient beings And enabled them to enter the path of the buddhas 
Understanding the deepest desires of the entire world Of the devas humans and other beings The Great Sage Lord has illuminated The highest meaning With diverse skillful means 
All those sentient beings Who encountered and heard the teaching Of the buddhas of the past And who accumulated various merits Through acts of giving  integrity  perseverance  Diligence  meditation  and wisdom Have certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
And after the parinirvāṇa of the buddhas Those sentient beings with wellgoverned minds Have certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
After the buddhas attained parinirvāṇa All those who paid homage to the relics Who made myriads of koṭis of stupas Extensively and beautifully adorned with gold silver Crystal mother of pearl agate ruby Lapis lazuli and pearl Those who made rock stupas Stupas out of sandal aloe deodar and other woods As well as brick tile mud and other materials All those who made buddha stupas Out of piles of earth in desolate places And even children in play Who made buddha stupas out of heaps of sand All such people have certainly attained The path of the buddhas 
And all those who made images of the buddhas Carved with their extraordinary marks Have certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
All those who made buddha images Out of the seven treasures Decorated with brass copper pewter lead Tin iron wood mud glue lacquer and cloth Have certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
All those who made or had others make buddha images Painted with the one hundred embellishing Marks of merit Have certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
This even includes children in play Who have drawn a buddha image With a blade of grass or a twig Brush or ngernail Such people having gradually accumulated merit And perfected great compassion Have certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
Leading and inspiring the bodhisattvas They save countless sentient beings 
All those who paid homage to stupas Sculpted or painted images Honoring them with owers perfumes Banners and canopies Those who paid homage with all kinds of sweet music With drums horns conches pipes utes lutes harps Mandolins gongs and cymbals Those who joyfully praised the qualities of the buddhas With various songs or Even with a single lowpitched sound Have certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
Those who even with distracted minds Have offered a single ower to a painted image Will in time see innumerable buddhas 
Or those who have done obeisance to images Or merely pressed their palms together Or raised a single hand or nodded their heads Will in due time see immeasurable buddhas 
They will attain the highest path And extensively save innumerable sentient beings They will enter nirvana without residue Just as a re goes out after its wood is exhausted 
Those who even with distracted minds Entered a stupa compound And chanted but once Homage to the Buddha Have certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
Anyone who heard this teaching Either in the presence of a past buddha Or after their parinirvāṇa Has certainly attained the path of the buddhas 
The future Bhagavats Tathāgatas Immeasurable in number Will teach the Dharma with skillful means 
All the Tathāgatas Will save sentient beings With immeasurable skillful means Causing them to enter the wisdom of the buddhas That is free from corruption Of those hearing this Dharma There will be no one Who will not become a buddha 
The original vow of the buddhas Was to cause all sentient beings to universally Attain the very same buddha path That I have practiced 
Even though the buddhas of the future Will teach hundreds of thousands of koṭis Of innumerable paths to the Dharma Their teachings will actually be For the sake of the single vehicle 
All the buddhas the Best of Humans Know that all dharmas are ever without substance And that the buddhaseeds germinate Through dependent origination That is why they will teach the single vehicle 
Having realized on the terrace of enlightenment That the state of the Dharma Is permanent and unchangeable in this world The Leaders will teach with skillful means 
The present buddhas of the ten directions As numerous as the sands of the Ganges River Revered by devas and humans Appear in the world and teach this Dharma To make sentient beings feel at peace 
They know the utmost tranquility And although they teach various paths With the power of skillful means Their teachings are actually for the buddha vehicle 
Knowing the character of sentient beings Their deep intentions past acts Wishes persistence and strength Their keen or dull faculties The buddhas teach with skillful means Using various explanations illustrations and words In accordance with the capacities of sentient beings 
Now I too reveal the path of the buddhas Through various paths to the Dharma To make sentient beings feel at peace 
Through the power of my wisdom I know the dispositions and desires of sentient beings And explain various teachings with skillful means Enabling them all to obtain joy 
O āriputra 
You should know that through the buddhaeye I see beings wandering in the six states of existence Who are poor deprived of merit and wisdom Who are entering into the bitter path of birth and death And are suffering repeatedly and without end They are deeply attached to the desires of the ve senses Just as yaks are attached to their tails Obstructed by greed they are blind and cannot see 
They do not seek the buddha who has great power Nor the Dharma that cuts off suffering Deeply immersed in false views They try to eliminate suffering through suffering I feel great compassion For such sentient beings 
Sitting on the terrace of enlightenment for the rst time Looking at the bodhi tree And walking about During those twentyone days I was thinking thus The wisdom I have attained Is subtle and supreme 
But the faculties of sentient beings are dull They are attached to pleasures and blinded by delusion How can I save such beings 
Then Brahma and his devaputras akra The worldprotectors of the four quarters Maheśvara and the other devas Together with a retinue of hundreds Of thousands of myriads of attendants Paid their respects with palms pressed together And begged me to turn the wheel of the Dharma 
Then I thought If I only praise the buddha vehicles Those beings who are submerged in suffering Will not believe this Dharma 
Because they reject and do not believe the Dharma They will fall into the three troubled states of being 
I would rather not teach the Dharma And instead immediately enter nirvana 
Then I thought of the power of skillful means Practiced by past buddhas This path that I have attained Should now also be taught as the three vehicles When I thought this The buddhas of the ten directions appeared And with beautiful voices praised me saying O ākyamuni 
O Supreme Leader You have attained the highest Dharma And yet still use the power of skillful means Following all the other buddhas 
We too have attained the best and utmost Dharma And with discretion have explained the three vehicles For the sake of sentient beings 
Those with little wisdom Seek inferior teachings And do not believe that they will become buddhas That is why we use skillful means And with discretion teach of various results 
Although we teach the three vehicles It is just for the instruction of the bodhisattvas O āriputra 
You should know That when I heard this profound And beautiful roar of the Noble Lions I chanted with joy Homage to the buddhas And I thought 
Since I have been born in this deled world I will follow the other buddhas And expound what they have expounded After contemplating this I set out for Vārāṇasī 
All dharmas have the tranquil character Of the Dharma This could not be expressed in words So I taught the ve monks Through the power of skillful means 
This I named Turning the Wheel of the Dharma And immediately the word nirvana appeared in it And the different designations for Arhat  Dharma and Sangha 
From a great many kalpas ago I have always taught like this I have praised and illuminated The teaching of nirvana Saying that it ends the sufferings Of birth and death 
O āriputra 
You should know that I see Immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis Of the Buddhas heirs Who having set out for the buddha path And heard the Dharma explained with skillful means Have respectfully come before the Buddha 
Then I thought The reason why the Tathāgatas appear is To explain the wisdom of the buddhas Now is precisely the right time for this O āriputra 
You should know that Those who have dull faculties and little wisdom And those who are attached to mere signs and Are arrogant cannot accept this teaching 
Now I am happy and fearless Having openly set aside skillful means I will teach only the highest path To all the bodhisattvas 
Having heard this teaching The bodhisattvas and twelve hundred arhats Freeing themselves from the web of doubt Will all become buddhas 
Just as the buddhas in the three periods Of the past present and future Teach the true nature of the Dharma Now I too will expound the Dharma That is beyond conception 
All the buddhas Appear in worlds far away And are difcult to meet Even if they appear in this world It is difcult to hear their teaching 
Even in immeasurable innumerable kalpas It is difcult to hear this Dharma And those who are able to hear this Dharma Are also hard to nd 
They are just like the uḍumbara ower Which appears only once in a very long while And beloved by all Is considered a wonder among devas and humans 
Those who hearing this teaching Happily praise the buddhas By uttering even a single word Have already paid homage to all buddhas Of the three periods Such people are even more extraordinary Than the uḍumbara ower 
All of you have no doubts I the King of the Dharma Now proclaim to the great assembly I lead and inspire the bodhisattvas Only with the path of the single vehicle I am here without disciples 
O āriputra and all of you The śrāvakas and bodhisattvas should know That this True Dharma is the hidden essence Of all the buddhas 
In the troubled worlds of the ve kinds of delement Sentient beings are only attached to various desires And ultimately do not seek the path of the buddhas 
In the future the impure will hear The Buddha teach the single vehicle But they will be confused and will not accept it They will reject the Dharma And fall into the troubled states of being 
To those who are modest and pure And seek the path of the buddhas I will praise extensively The path of the single vehicle 
O āriputra 
You should know that the Dharma Of all the buddhas is like this They teach the Dharma With myriads of koṭis of skillful means According to the capacities of sentient beings The inexperienced cannot understand this 
You have come to know with certainty the skillful means Of the buddhas the Teachers of the World That are expounded in accordance With peoples capacities All of you have no further doubts Let great joy arise in your hearts And know that you will all become buddhas 
A Parable Thereupon āriputra stood up ecstatic and joyful pressed his palms together and gazing at the Buddha the Bhagavat said Now hearing the words of this Dharma from the Bhagavat my heart is full of joy for I have experienced something unprecedented 
What is the reason for this 
In the past when I heard this Dharma from the Buddha and saw the bodhisattvas receive their predictions I was not included I grieved because I thought I had been deprived of the immeasurable wisdom and insight of the Tathāgata 
O Bhagavat 
While I was dwelling alone under forest trees whether sitting or walking I was constantly thinking this 
Since we have also realized the true nature of the Dharma why has the Tathāgata tried to save us with the teachings of the inferior vehicle The fault is ours not the Bhagavats 
Why is this 
If we had waited for your explanation about the way to achieve highest complete enlightenment we certainly would have been able to save ourselves by means of the Mahayana 
However we did not understand that you were teaching with skillful means according to what is appropriate to us When we rst heard the Buddhas teaching we immediately accepted contemplated and understood it 
Since long ago I have reproached myself incessantly day and night But now from the Buddha we have heard the unprecedented Dharma that we have never heard before and it has removed all our doubts I have obtained peace and tranquility in body and mind 
Today I have nally realized that I am truly the heir of the Buddha born from the mouth of the Buddha incarnated from the Dharma and that I have inherited a part of the BuddhaDharma Then āriputra wanting to elaborate this meaning spoke again in verse When I heard the words of this Dharma Experiencing something unprecedented My heart overowed with joy And I was rid of all my doubts 
From long ago ever since I heard The teaching of the Buddha I have not lost the Mahayana The words of the buddhas are extremely rare And are capable of ridding sentient beings Of their suffering Although I had already attained Freedom from corruption By hearing the Buddhas voice I have also been rid of my anxiety 
Whether I was dwelling In mountain valleys or under forest trees Whether I was sitting or walking Grieving and blaming myself deeply I thought incessantly How have I deceived myself 
I am also the heir of the buddhas Having entered the same incorruptible Dharma Nevertheless in the future I shall not be able to explain the highest path 
The golden color the thirtytwo marks The ten powers and the liberations Are all in the same Dharma And yet I have not attained any of these 
Moreover such qualities as The eighty excellent and eighteen special characteristics Are completely lost to me 
When I was wandering alone I saw the Buddha in the great assembly Filling the ten directions with his fame And greatly beneting sentient beings I then thought 
I have lost all these benets Because I have been deceiving myself 
I thought about this constantly day and night And wanted to ask the Bhagavat Have I or have I not lost these 
I always saw the Bhagavat Praising the bodhisattvas That is why I pondered over such matters As these both day and night 
Now I have heard the words of the Buddha Explaining to sentient beings The incorruptible Dharma Which is difcult to comprehend And making them enter The terrace of enlightenment 
Formerly I was attached to false views And was a teacher of brahmans The Bhagavat knowing my mind Removed the false views and taught nirvana 
I got rid of false views completely And attained the teaching of emptiness At that time I considered myself To have attained nirvana 
But now I have become aware That this was not the real nirvana 
When I become a buddha I shall be endowed with the thirtytwo marks And be honored by devas humans yakṣas and nāgas Only then can it be said that I have Permanently attained nirvana without residue 
Before the great assembly The Buddha has proclaimed That I will become a buddha After hearing these words of the Dharma I was immediately rid of all my doubts 
When I rst heard this teaching of the Buddhas I was greatly startled and thought I wonder if Māra acting like the Buddha Is confusing me 
But the Buddha who teaches skillfully By means of various explanations and illustrations Has made my mind tranquil like the ocean While listening to him I was freed from the web of my doubts 
The Buddha has said that immeasurable buddhas Who have attained parinirvāṇa in the past Established in the use of skillful means Have also taught this Dharma 
Immeasurable buddhas in the present and future Will also teach this Dharma With various skillful means 
The present Bhagavat From the time he was born And renounced household life Until he obtained the path And turned the wheel of the Dharma Has also taught through skillful means 
The Bhagavat teaches the real path But the Wicked One does not Therefore I know denitely That it was not Māra acting like the Buddha 
Because I fell into a web of doubt I thought that Māra was impersonating the Buddha When I heard the voice of the Buddha Profound and very subtle Fluently explaining the pure Dharma I became full of great joy 
My doubts are completely and forever exhausted And I have achieved the true wisdom 
I will denitely become a buddha Honored by devas and humans I will turn the wheel of the highest Dharma And lead and inspire the bodhisattvas 
At that time the Buddha said to āriputra I will now reveal to you before the great assembly of devas humans śrāmaṇas and brahmans that in the past in the presence of two hundred thousand koṭis of buddhas I led and inspired you constantly for the sake of the highest path You have followed my instructions for a long time 
Because I led you with skillful means you were born in my Dharma 
O āriputra 
In the past I inspired you to seek the buddha path Yet just now you had completely forgotten this and considered yourself to have attained nirvana 
Now because I want you to remember the path that you practiced according to your original vow in the past I will teach the śrāvakas the Mahayana sutra called the Lotus Sutra the instruction for the bodhisattvas and treasured lore of the buddhas O āriputra 
In the future after immeasurable limitless and inconceivable kalpas you will have paid homage to thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas preserved the True Dharma and mastered the path practiced by the bodhisattvas You will become a buddha called Padmaprabha a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
Your land will be called Viraja Its earth will be level and pure ornamented peaceful and rich The devas and humans will prosper 
The earth will be made of lapis lazuli with a wellplanned network of roads like a chessboard bordered with golden cords 
Rows of sevenjeweled trees which are always full of owers and fruits will line the borders of these roads 
The Tathāgata Padma prabha will also lead and inspire sentient beings by means of the three vehicles 
When that buddha appears even though his will not be a troubled world he will teach the three vehicles because of his original vow 
This kalpa will be called Mahāratnaprati maṇḍita meaning Adorned with Great Jewels Why will it be called Mahā ratna pratimaṇḍita 
Because in that world the bodhisattvas will be like great jewels 
The number of these bodhisattvas will be immeasurable limitless inconceivable and beyond all comparison known only by those with the power of the Buddhas wisdom 
When they want to walk they will step on jeweled owers 
And these bodhisattvas will not be those who are just setting out Over a long time they will have planted roots of good merit and practiced the pure path of discipline and integrity in the presence of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas 
They will always be praised by the buddhas and continually practice the buddha wisdom They will be endowed with transcendent powers and know well all the teachings of the Dharma They will be honest without falsity and rm in recollection 
That world will be lled with bodhisattvas like these O āriputra 
The lifespan of this buddha Padmaprabha will be twelve intermediate kalpas not including the period after he becomes a prince and before he becomes a buddha and the life span of the people in that world will be eight intermediate kalpas 
After these twelve intermediate kalpas have passed the Tathāgata Padmaprabha will predict Bodhisattva Dhṛti pari pūrṇas attainment of highest complete enlightenment and will address the monks saying 
After the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha Padma prabha the True Dharma will remain in the world for thirtytwo intermediate kalpas and the Semblance Dharma will also remain in the world for thirtytwo intermediate kalpas Then the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this again spoke these verses O āriputra 
Having paid homage to innumerable buddhas Perfected the bodhisattva practice And the qualities including the ten powers You will attain the highest path 
After immeasurable kalpas have passed The kalpa will be called Prabhūtaratna And the world will be called Viraja Pure and without dirt 
The earth will be made of lapis lazuli And the roads bordered with golden cords Will be lined with variegated trees of the seven treasures Which are always full of owers and fruits 
The bodhisattvas in that world Will be always rm in recollection All of them will be completely endowed With transcendent powers and the perfections And will have properly practiced the bodhisattva path In the presence of innumerable buddhas 
When this buddha becomes a prince He will abdicate his kingship And give up his worldly fame Bearing his last body He will renounce household life And attain the path of the Buddha 
This Buddha Padmaprabha will live in the world For twelve intermediate kalpas And the lifespan of the people in this world Will be eight intermediate kalpas 
After the parinirvāṇa of this buddha The True Dharma will last in the world For thirtytwo intermediate kalpas During which time many sentient beings Will be saved After the extinction of the True Dharma The Semblance Dharma will last For thirtytwo intermediate kalpas The relics of the Buddha Will be distributed widely And devas and humans will pay them homage 
All that the Buddha Padmaprabha does Will be exactly like this That very Best of Humans Who will be foremost and without comparison Is none other than you 
You should be delighted to hear this 
At that time the fourfold assembly of monks nuns laymen and laywomen and the great assembly of devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas saw āriputra receive his prediction of highest complete enlightenment in the presence of the Buddha They rejoiced greatly and became immeasurably happy All of them removed their outer garments and proffered them to the Buddha as offerings 
akra the lord of devas and Brahma together with innumerable devaputras also made offerings to the Buddha of their heavenly beautiful garments heavenly māndārava owers and great māndārava owers 
Their heavenly garments oated and uttered in the air while in the sky the devas played hundreds of thousands of myriads of kinds of music together at one time They rained down various heavenly owers and said In the past the Buddha turned the wheel of the Dharma for the rst time in Vārā ṇasī Now he has turned the wheel of the utmost and greatest Dharma again Thereupon the devaputras spoke these verses in order to explain this again 
In the past you turned the wheel of the Dharma Of the Four Truths in Vārāṇasī And you illuminated and explained the Dharma Of the origination and extinction of the ve aggregates 
You have now again turned the wheel Of the subtlest utmost and greatest Dharma This Dharma is extremely profound Only a few will be able to believe it 
Since long ago we have frequently heard The teaching of the Bhagavat Yet we have never before heard Such a profound and supreme teaching 
When the Bhagavat taught this Dharma We were all delighted 
And now āriputra possessed of great wisdom Has received his prediction from the Bhagavat In the same way we too Shall certainly become buddhas 
We shall become peerless Unrivaled in all the world The path of the Buddha Which is difcult to understand Is taught with skillful means According to what is appropriate for sentient beings 
May the merits of our benecial acts Whether of the past or the present And those acquired in meeting the Buddha Be completely transferred to the buddha path 
At that time āriputra said this to the Buddha O Bhagavat 
I now have no further doubts I have received the prediction of the highest supreme enlightenment in the presence of the Buddha 
When all those twelve hundred who have attained complete mental discipline were still under training in the past the Buddha constantly led and inspired them saying My teaching overcomes birth old age illness and death and it leads to nirvana Both those who were still in training and those who were not thought that they were free from false views about the self existence and nonexistence and declared that they had attained nirvana 
Yet now in the presence of the Bhagavat they have heard what they have never heard before and have fallen into doubt 
Splendid O Bhagavat 
I entreat you to explain to the fourfold assembly the reason why and free them from their doubts Then the Buddha said to āriputra Did I not previously tell you that all the Buddha Bhagavats explain the Dharma with various explanations and illustrations using skillful means all for the sake of highest complete enlightenment 
All of these teachings are for leading and inspiring the bodhisattvas 
Moreover āriputra I will now clarify what I mean with illustrations Those with wisdom will be able to understand through these illustrations O āriputra 
Suppose there were an aged and extremely afuent man either in a town city or country who has immeasurable wealth abundant estates mansions and servants 
He has a spacious house yet it only has a single entrance Suppose many people live there as many as one two or even ve hundred people 
The buildings are in poor repair the fences and walls are crumbling the pillar bases are rotten and the beams and framework are dangerously tilted Suddenly and unexpectedly res break out everywhere setting the house swiftly aame 
The children of this man ten twenty or thirty in number are in the house 
The afuent man seeing the re breaking out everywhere becomes alarmed and terried He thinks I am capable of escaping through the burning entrance in safety but my children are absorbed in play within the burning house and are not aware  do not know are not alarmed or terried and the re is approaching them They are not troubled about their suffering nor do they intend to leave the house 
Since I am still physically strong I could take the children out of the house in the folds of my garment or on top of a desk He further thought There is only one entrance to this house and it is very narrow 
The children who are immature and still unaware are attached to their place of play They may fall into danger and be burned by the re 
I should now tell them of the danger this house is already burning They must escape as quickly as they can to avoid being burned by the re After considering this he urged the children according to his thought Children 
Although their father in his concern has given them the proper advice the children are immersed in their play and do not accept it they are neither alarmed nor afraid and have no intention of leaving  
Moreover they do not even know what a re is the condition of the house or what they may lose 
They merely run about back and forth looking at their father Thereupon the afuent man thought This house is already engulfed in ames If my children and I do not get out we shall perish in the re 
I will now use skillful means to help my children escape from this disaster Since the father already knew that his children were attached to various rare toys and unusual things that each of them liked he said to them The toys you are fond of are rare and hard to obtain If you do not take them you will certainly regret it later 
Go play with them 
Children Run out of this burning house immediately and I will give you whatever you want The children hearing what their father had said about the rare toys became excited and in their eagerness to get to them they pushed each other out of the way in a mad rush out of the burning house 
Then the afuent man saw that his children had got out safely and were sitting unharmed in an open area at a crossroad He was relieved happy and joyful 
The children said to their father Father please give us the toys you promised those carts one yoked to a sheep one to a deer and one to an ox O āriputra the afuent man then gave each child the same kind of large cart 
These carts were tall and spacious adorned with various jewels and encircled with railings full of hanging bells 
On the tops of the carts were canopies also decorated with various kinds of jewels These carts were draped with jeweled cords and hung with ower garlands They were thickly piled with fabrics and red pillows had been placed about 
These carts were each yoked to an ox with a spotlessly white hide These oxen had beautiful bodies with powerful muscles even gaits and were as swift as the wind and there were many attendants guarding them 
Because the man had great and immeasurable wealth and his abundant storehouses were full He thus thought further Since my treasure has no limit I should not give my children inferior carts 
These are my children and I love them all equally 
I have an immeasurable number of large carts such as these decorated with the seven treasures I should equally distribute them to each child without discrimination 
Why is this 
Even if I gave carts like these to everyone in the country their number would not be exhausted Why should I not give them to my own children 
At that time the children each climbed into a great cart and had an unprecedented experience one beyond their original expectations O āriputra What do you think about this 
This afuent man gave to his children equally a large cart decorated with precious treasures 
Has he deceived them or not āriputra replied 
The afuent man only tried to help his children escape from the disastrous re He saved their lives and did not deceive them This is by no means a deception 
Because by saving their lives they obtained marvelous toys Moreover they were saved from the burning house by skillful means 
O Bhagavat If this afuent man had not given them even the smallest cart it still would not have been a deception 
Why is this 
Because this afuent man thought before I will help my children escape with skillful means This is why it was not a deception 
How much more so since the afuent man knowing that he had immeasurable wealth and wanting to benet them equally gave each of his children a large cart The Buddha said to āriputra 
It is exactly as you have said 
O āriputra the Tathāgata is also just like this 
He has attained immeasurable wisdom insight power and fearlessness as well as great transcendent powers and the power of wisdom He has attained the perfection of skillful means and of wisdom With his great mercy and compassion he incessantly and indefatigably seeks the welfare of all beings and benets them all The Tathāgata appears in the triple world which is like a decaying old house on re to rescue sentient beings from the re of birth old age illness and death anxiety sorrow suffering distress delusion blindness and the three poisons of greed hatred and ignorance 
The Tathāgatas see all sentient beings burning in the re of birth old age illness and death anxiety sorrow suffering and distress Because of the desires of the ve senses and the desire for monetary prot they also experience various kinds of suffering 
Because of their attachment and pursuits they experience various kinds of suffering in the present and in the future they will suffer in the states of existence of hell animals and hungry ghosts  
If they are born in the heavens or in the human world they will experience a variety of sorrows such as suffering from poverty and destitution separation from loved ones or suffering from encounters with those they dislike 
Although sentient beings are immersed in such sorrows they rejoice and play They are not aware shocked startled or disgusted nor do they seek release 
Running around in the burning house of the triple world they experience great suffering and yet they do not realize it 
O āriputra Seeing these things the Buddha thought Since I am the father of sentient beings I must rid them of their immeasurable suffering and distress I will cause them to rejoice through the immeasurable and limitless pleasure of the buddha wisdom 
The Tathāgata further thought If I proclaim the Tathāgatas wisdom insight power and fear lessness to sentient beings with my transcendent powers and the power of my wisdom alone without using skillful means it will be impossible to save them 
Why is this 
Because these sentient beings have not escaped from birth old age illness and death anxiety sorrow suffering and distress and are being burned in the blazing house of the triple world 
How would they be able to understand the Buddhas wisdom 
O āriputra 
Although that afuent man had physical strength he did not use it He only earnestly employed skillful means to save his children from the disaster of the burning house and later he gave each of them a large cart decorated with precious treasures 
The Tathāgata is exactly like this Although the Tathāgata has power and fearlessness he does not use them but rescues sentient beings from the burning house of the triple world only through wisdom and skillful means teaching the three vehicles to the śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and the buddhas saying Do not take pleasure in living in this burning house of the triple world And do not thirst after inferior objects sounds smells avors and tangibles 
If you are attached to these objects and have desires then you will be burned 
Leave the triple world in haste and you will obtain the three vehiclesthe vehicles for the śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and buddhas I denitely guarantee this to you 
In the end it will come true You should be diligent and persistent The Tathāgata attracts sentient beings through this skillful means saying further You should know that the Noble Ones praise the teachings of these three vehicles that are selfdirected unrestricted and independent 
Those beings wise by nature who accept the Dharma from the Buddha Bhagavat who are diligent persistent and wish to escape from the triple world quickly and who are seeking nirvana are all practicing the śrāvaka vehicle They are like those children who left the burning house seeking the cart yoked to a sheep 
Those beings who accept the Dharma of the Buddha Bhagavat who are diligent and persevere in seeking the wisdom of the Selfgenerated One and enjoy tranquility for themselves who profoundly know the causes of and reasons for existence are all practicing the pratyekabuddha vehicle They are just like those children who left the burning house seeking the cart yoked to a deer 
Those beings who accept the Dharma of the Buddha Bhagavat who are diligent and persevere in seeking the wisdom of the Omniscient One the wisdom of the Buddha the wisdom of the Selfgenerated One the wisdom acquired without a teacher the wisdom and insight powers and fearlessness of the Tathāgata who are compassionate put immeasurable sentient beings at ease benet devas and humans and save all beings are all practicing the Mahayana Bodhisattvas are called mahāsattvas because they seek this vehicle They are just like those children who left the burning house seeking the cart yoked to an ox O āriputra 
That afuent man saw his children leave the burning house safely and arrive at a safe place Knowing that he had immeasurable wealth he gave a large cart equally to each child The Tathāgata is exactly like this 
As the father of all sentient beings he sees that immeasurable thousands of koṭis of sentient beings escape from the dangers sufferings and fears of the triple world through the gates of the Buddhas teaching and attain the pleasure of nirvana Then the Tathāgata thought Because I possess the treasure house of the Dharma of all the buddhas which contains immeasurable limitless wisdom power and fearlessness and because all sentient beings are my children I will give them equally the Mahayana I will not allow anyone to attain nirvana merely for himself but will cause everyone to attain it through the Tathāgatas nirvana 
At rst that afuent man attracted his children with three kinds of carts then later gave them only the safest and best large cart adorned with jewels 
Moreover that afuent man was never accused of telling a lie 
The Tathāgata is exactly like this He tells no lies In the beginning the Tathāgata teaches the three vehicles in order to lead sentient beings And later he saves them through only the Mahayana 
Why is this 
Because the Tathāgata possesses the treasure house of the Dharma which contains immeasurable wisdom power and fearlessness And although he is able to give the teaching of the Mahayana to all sentient beings not all of them can accept it O āriputra 
You should know that the buddhas with the power of skillful means teach the single buddha vehicle dividing and teaching it as three Then the Buddha wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this again spoke these verses 
Suppose there were an afuent man Who had a large house And this house was very old On the verge of collapsing The halls were extremely dangerous The pillar bases rotten and disintegrating The beams and framework dangerously tilted And the stairways were falling apart The fences and walls were cracked The plaster was peeling off The thatched roof was falling down The rafters and eaves were coming apart The partitions were everywhere askew And the whole place was covered with lth 
Five hundred people lived there And moving around helterskelter were Kites owls hawks eagles crows magpies Doves pigeons lizards snakes vipers Scorpions centipedes millipedes Newts myriapods ferrets badgers mice Rats and other harmful creatures 
It was lled with stench And there were places overowing with excrement All kinds of bugs Had gathered there 
There were foxes wolves and vermin Devouring trampling and gnawing on corpses Scattering bones and esh about And a pack of dogs Forcing each other out of the way Rushed to the spot Frightened and exhausted from hunger They were searching everywhere for food Fighting among themselves snatching at food Biting snarling and barking at each other 
Ogres of the mountains and valleys Yakṣas and demons were everywhere Devouring human esh 
There were various poisonous insects All kinds of harmful birds of prey And beasts who were producing rearing And protecting their offspring 
Yakṣas were scrabbling and ghting to devour them And after sating themselves Evil thoughts would arise in them The sound of their ghting Was terrifying 
The kumbhāṇḍa demons were crouching on the ground Sometimes rising up a foot or two Roaming about pleasing themselves as they liked They would catch two legs of a dog Beat it until it could not bark And grabbing the dogs neck with their legs Terrify it for their own amusement 
There were also other demons living there With large bodies naked dark and gaunt They were screaming horrifying howls Crying out while searching for food 
Other demons were there Some with needlelike throats While others had necks Like a cows head Some had those of human esheaters or dogdevourers Their hair was disheveled like rank weeds And they were destructive and malicious Driven by hunger and thirst They were crying and scurrying about 
Yakṣas hungry ghosts And various malicious birds and beasts Were peering out of the windows And running frantically in all directions Driven by hunger 
In this house with its immeasurable terrors There were many such horrendous things as these 
Now suppose this old and decaying house Belonged to a man And this man came out from it a short distance 
Soon after the house suddenly Burst into ames behind him The re instantly spread in all directions 
The frame beams rafters and pillars exploded And shaking split and crashed While the fences and walls collapsed 
All the demons screamed out loudly 
The hawks eagles other birds And kumbhāṇḍa demons panicked and terried Could not get out 
Malicious beasts and poisonous insects Concealed themselves in holes 
There were also piśāca demons dwelling there Who because of little merit Were chased by the ames They were tearing at each other Drinking blood and eating esh 
A horde of vermin had already died off And the large malicious beasts Raced to devour them While the smoke of the stench owed And lled everywhere 
As the centipedes millipedes And poisonous snakes rushed Burning out of their holes The kumbhāṇḍa demons devoured them One after another 
The hungry ghosts with their hair on re Ravenous thirsty and suffering from the heat Frantically scurried about 
In this way the house was extremely terrifying With poison and re And disasters more than one 
Then the householder who was standing Outside the entrance of the house Heard someone say Just a moment ago In the midst of their play Your children entered this house Being young and ignorant They are attached to playing games Hearing this the afuent man was startled And went into the burning house To save them from the disaster of the re 
As he thought t he warned the children And explained the various dangers There are malicious demons poisonous insects And the re is raging everywhere There are endless horrors One right after another 
There are poisonous snakes lizards vipers Yakṣas kumbhāṇḍa demons vermin Foxes dogs hawks eagles kites Owls and centipedes all acutely suffering From hunger and thirst And all extremely terrifying These horrors are difcult to deal with How much more so the conagration 
But the children being ignorant Would not listen to their fathers warning Still attached to their games They kept right on playing 
Thereupon the afuent man thought My children by doing this Increase my distress 
There is nothing to enjoy now in this house Nevertheless my children who are absorbed in play Will not accept my instructions And so will be hurt by the re Then he immediately thought That he should advise his children Using various skillful means and said I have a variety of unusual toys Such as ne carts adorned with beautiful treasures Yoked to sheep deer and oxen 
I had these carts made for you Play with them as you like Hearing about these carts The children immediately started To push each other out of the way To get out of the house Arriving at an open area They escaped from the disaster 
The afuent man seeing that his children Had escaped from the burning house And were standing at the crossroads Sat down on his lion seat 
Then he joyously said Now I am happy 
It is extremely difcult to raise these children Foolish and ignorant They entered a dangerous house Full of various poisonous insects Terrifying ogres from mountains and valleys And a raging re that broke out in all directions 
In spite of this These children were attached to playing their games 
But by causing them to escape from the disaster I have saved them 
Therefore my people I now feel at ease Thereupon the children Seeing their father sitting in peace Approached him saying Please father Give us the three kinds of carts Adorned with treasures That you just promised us When you said that if we your children came out You would give us three kinds of carts Just as we like Now is the right time 
He had a number of great carts made Adorned with various precious things Like gold silver lapis lazuli Motherofpearl and agate 
They were beautifully decorated Encircled with railings And were covered with hanging bells Attached to golden cords 
Over them was hung a net of pearls With golden ower tassels Hanging down everywhere They were all completely Decorated in a variety of colors 
The bedding was made of soft silk That was covered with An extremely ne carpet of spotless white Which cost thousands of koṭis 
There were large white oxen Healthy and powerful with beautiful bodies Yoked to the jeweled carts And they were guarded by many attendants 
When they were given these ne carts The children were joyful and excited They got on the carts And drove delightedly all about Amusing themselves in play They mastered them without difculties 
The Buddha said to āriputra I am also like this I am the father of the world The best of the sages 
All sentient beings are my children They are deeply attached to worldly pleasures And have no wisdom 
There is no peace in the triple world Just like in the burning house Which is full of various suffering And which is extremely terrifying 
There are always the sufferings Of birth old age illness and death Such res as these burn endlessly 
The Tathāgata who has already left The burning house of the triple world Lives in tranquility And dwells at ease in the forest 
Now this triple world is my property And the sentient beings in it are my children 
There are now many dangers here And I am the only one who can protect them 
Although I give them advice They do not accept it Because they are tainted with desires And have deep attachments 
On this occasion I teach the three vehicles Using skillful means Realizing the sufferings of the triple world I reveal and explain it To cause sentient beings to Escape from the mundane path 
If these children are resolute They are endowed with the three knowledges And six transcendent powers Or they can become pratyekabuddhas or Bodhisattvas who have reached The stage of nonretrogression 
O āriputra I explain the single buddha vehicle To sentient beings using this illustration 
If you are able to accept what I say You will all attain the buddha path 
This vehicle is subtle pure and peerless There is nothing superior to it In all the worlds This is what the Buddha enjoys 
All the sentient beings should praise Honor and revere it 
There are immeasurable thousands of koṭis Of powers liberations meditations Wisdoms and other attributes of the Buddha 
I cause my children to obtain such a vehicle And let them play continuously Day and night for kalpas I cause the bodhisattvas as well as the śrāvakas To board this jeweled vehicle And lead them directly To the terrace of enlightenment 
For this reason There is no other vehicle but The skillful means of the buddhas Even if one seeks in all the ten directions I tell you O āriputra All of you are my children And I am thus your father 
Since you were burned by the re Of various sufferings for many kalpas I saved you all By leading you out of the triple world 
Although I have previously told you About your parinirvāṇa You have only extinguished birth and death And have not actually attained nirvana 
You should now seek only The wisdom of the Buddha 
If there are any bodhisattvas in this assembly They should listen singlemindedly To the real teaching of all the buddhas 
Those sentient beings Whom the Buddha Bhagavats Lead and inspire with skillful means Are all bodhisattvas 
Because people have little knowledge And are deeply attached to pleasures I teach them the truth of suffering  
And those sentient beings rejoice Having attained Such an unprecedented experience The truth of suffering taught by the Buddha Is nothing but the truth 
To those who do not know the origin of suffering ie the Second Noble Truth Who are deeply attached to its causes And unable to abandon them even for a while I teach the truth about the path to its cessation Using skillful means 
All the causes of suffering Originate from excessive craving When this craving is extinguished The source is removed The cessation of suffering Is called the Third Truth 
One practices the path leading to its cessation ie the Fourth Noble Truth In order to attain the truth of cessation Removing the bonds of sufferings is called liberation 
In what sense have these people attained liberation 
They have merely removed false views And called that liberation But actually they have not yet completely attained it 
The Buddha has explained that these people Have not actually attained nirvana 
I do not intend to lead them to nirvana Because they have not yet attained the highest path 
I am the Lord of the Dharma And have mastered the Dharma I appear in the world To cause sentient beings to be at peace 
O you āriputra 
Teach this my Dharma sign To benet the world Wherever you may go Never propagate it recklessly 
You should know that those who hear Rejoice and fully accept it Have reached the stage of nonretrogression 
Those who accept the teaching of this sutra Have formerly seen the buddhas in the past Honored and paid homage to them And also heard this teaching 
Those who are able to accept what you teach Will see me you the monks and the bodhisattvas 
This very Lotus Sutra shall be taught Only to the profoundly wise Those of supercial awareness who hear it Will become confused and will not comprehend it 
This sutra is beyond the comprehension Of all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas 
O you āriputra 
Even you understood this sutra only through faith It is no wonder that the other disciples cannot 
They accept this sutra Because they believe the Buddhas teaching But it is beyond their intellectual comprehension 
O āriputra 
Never teach this sutra To those who are arrogant and lazy Or to those who hold False views about the self 
Never teach it to those people Of supercial awareness Who are deeply attached To the desires of the ve senses Since even if they heard it They would not understand 
Those people who will not accept And who disparage this sutra Will consequently destroy the seed of the Buddha In the entire world 
Now listen to what I teach About the results of the errors of those people Who frown upon and have doubts about this sutra 
Listen also to what I teach Concerning the results of the errors of those people Who whether at the time Of the Buddhas presence in this world Or after his parinirvāṇa disparage this sutra And despise hate and hold grudges Against the people who recite copy and preserve it 
When such people die They will go to the Avīci Hell And after spending a kalpa there Will be born in the same way Again and again for innumerable kalpas 
After coming out of this hell They will be reborn as animals 
If born as dogs or vermin Their bodies will be emaciated darkspotted Devoid of hair with scabies and leprosy 
Tormented hated and despised by people They will constantly suffer from hunger and thirst With withered bones and esh They will be in anguish while living And covered with stones after death 
Because they destroyed The seed of the Buddha They will suffer the consequences Of their errors 
If they are born as camels or mules They will always have heavy burdens to carry They will be whipped repeatedly And think of nothing but water and grass 
It is because they disparaged this sutra That they suffer the consequences of their errors in this way 
If they are born as vermin and enter a village Children will beat them because they have scabies Leprosy and perhaps a missing eye At times they will be tortured even to death 
After dying They will be reborn as giant snakes With great bodies as long as ve hundred yojanas Deaf dumb legless slithering on their bellies Eaten at by small insects They will suffer day and night without respite 
They suffer the consequences of their errors in this way Because they disparaged this sutra 
If they are born as humans They will have dull faculties And be runts who twitch and are crippled Blind deaf and humpbacked 
No matter what they may say People will not believe them Their breath will always be foul They will be snatched at by demons 
Being poor and degraded and enslaved by others They will be emaciated from many illnesses And will have nowhere to turn When they approach others They will be disdained 
Even if they manage to get something They will immediately lose it 
Even if they study medicine And cure themselves according to the correct method They will suffer from other illnesses again And may even die 
When they get sick No one will tend to them And even if they take the proper medicine Their pain will increase 
Every hand will be turned against them Threatening them pilfering and stealing from them They will fall helplessly into this plight Because of their transgressions 
Such erring people will never see The Buddha the king of seers Preaching the Dharma and leading and inspiring people 
Such people will always be born Into difcult circumstances Crazed unheeding and unthinking They will never hear the teaching 
They will be born deaf and dumb With defective faculties For as many immeasurable kalpas As the sands of the Ganges River 
Though they will always nd themselves in hell They will feel as if they were playing In a pleasure garden Although they are in other troubled states of being They will feel as if they were in their own home They will live among camels mules boars and dogs 
These are the results of their error In disparaging this sutra 
If they are born as human beings They will be deaf blind mute Impoverished and decrepit Such will be their adornments 
They will have dropsy gonorrhea Scabies leprosy and tumors Such diseases as these will be their clothing 
Their bodies will always be foul lthy and impure Their deep attachment to false views About the self will cause Their anger and passion to increase Their sexual desires will be insatiable With either birds or beasts as their objects 
These are the results of their Errors in disparaging this sutra The Buddha said to āriputra If one were to explain The consequences of the errors Of those who disparage this sutra It would take more than a kalpa 
For that reason I am now telling you Never to expound this sutra To those who have little wisdom 
You should teach it Only to those people of sharp faculties Who are wise learned and understanding Who have good memories and erudition And are seeking the buddha path 
You should teach it to those who have seen Hundreds of thousands of koṭis of buddhas Who have planted good roots and are resolute 
Teach it to those who strive Always practice compassion And give unsparingly of their bodies and lives 
You should teach it to those who are respectful And devoid of hypocrisy Who are living alone In mountains and valleys away from fools 
O āriputra 
You should teach it To those who have left their bad companions And made friends with virtuous people 
Teach it to the heirs of the Buddha Who have good conduct are as pure as jewels And who are seeking the Mahayana sutras 
You should teach it To those who are free of anger Honest exible always sympathetic to everyone And who honor all the buddhas 
Teach it to the heirs of the Buddha In the great assembly Who have pure thoughts And who teach the Dharma without doubts Using various reasonings Illustrations and explanations 
You should teach it to those monks Who always and everywhere in search of the Dharma Seek the Omniscient One To whom they joyfully press their palms together Touch their heads and preserve Only the Mahayana sutras with pleasure Who never preserve even a single verse Of any other sutra 
Teach it to those who seek this sutra As intently as they seek for the relics of the Buddha Who after obtaining it will accept it Respectfully with bowed heads And will not seek any other sutra And will never think about heretical scriptures O āriputra I say to you I have described the characteristics of those Who seek the buddha path Though a kalpa would not sufce to do so in full 
You should teach the Lotus Sutra To those who are able to accept it Willing Acceptance At that time the noble Subhūti Mahākātyāyana Mahākāśyapa and Mahāmaudgalyāyana having heard the unprecedented teaching from the Buddha and the Bhagavats prediction of āriputras highest complete enlightenment were lled with wonder and ecstatic joy They immediately rose from their seats straightened their garments leaving their right shoulders bared and touched their right knees to the ground With rapt attention and with palms pressed together they bowed in veneration and gazing at the Bhagavats face said to the Buddha 
It has been a long time since the Bhagavat taught the Dharma in the past Now we sit with weary bodies and only contemplate emptiness signlessness and wishlessness Neither the bodhisattva teaching nor the carefree sporting with transcendent powers nor the pure buddha worlds nor helping sentient beings attain enlightenment produced any eager desire in us 
Why is this 
Because the Bhagavat caused us to leave the triple world and to attain nirvana 
But now we are old and feeble We did not take even a single thought of pleasure in the Buddhas inspiration of the bodhisattvas to highest complete enlightenment 
And now in the presence of the Buddha we have heard the śrāvakas receive their prediction of highest complete enlightenment and we are very joyful to have obtained such an unprecedented experience 
We never considered that we would suddenly be able to hear this marvelous teaching and we are overjoyed that we have attained such great benetsan immeasurable treasure which we attained though unsought and unawaited 
We now wish to give an illustration to clarify what we mean 
Suppose there were a man who when he was still a child left his father and ran away Living in another region for a long time he passed the age of ten twenty even fty years The older he got the more impoverished he became He went searching everywhere for food and clothing and while he was wandering about he started back by chance in the direction of his native country 
From the rst the father had looked for his son but in vain in the meantime he had stayed in the city and become extremely wealthy and now possessed uncountable treasures  storehouses were all lled to overowing with gold silver lapis lazuli coral amber crystal and other such things 
He had many servants subordinates and clerks as well as innumerable elephants horses carriages cows and sheep He proted through lending and his trade with other countries was also great 
Then the impoverished son after wandering through many villages from one country and city to another nally reached the city where his father lived 
Although the father had constantly thought about the son from whom he had been separated for over fty years he nevertheless had spoken to no one about it He brooded and grieved in his heart thinking to himself I have become old and feeble and although I have many treasures and storehouses lled with gold silver and precious jewels I have no son 
When I die my treasures will be scattered and lost for lack of someone to whom to entrust them 
It was for this reason that he was always thinking anxiously about his son He also thought If I could get my son back and leave my fortune to him I would be relieved and happy and without further worry O Bhagavat 
At that time the impoverished son who had been wandering about taking odd jobs by chance nally reached his fathers house 
Standing at the side of the gate he saw his father in the distance sitting on the lion seat with his feet propped up on a jeweled stool respectfully surrounded by many brahmans kṣatriyas and householders His body was adorned with pearl necklaces worth thousands of myriads 
He was attended on both sides by clerks and servants holding whisker fans 
Above was a jeweled canopy with various hanging owered banners Perfume was sprinkled on the ground which was strewn with a variety of beautiful owers There were rows of precious objects and people were coming and going buying and selling 
The impoverished son seeing his father wielding such great power became terried and regretted that he had ever come to that place 
He thought to himself He must be a king or of a similar rank This is not a place where I can obtain things as a hired worker 
It would certainly be better for me to go to a poor village a place where I can use my ability and easily obtain clothing and food 
If I stay here for very long I will be seized and put to forced labor Thinking this way he quickly ed At that time the wealthy man sitting on the lion seat realized that he had seen his son and became extremely happy 
I have been constantly thinking about my son but had no way to meet him and now suddenly he has come This is exactly what I wanted 
Although I am old I still yearn for him The man immediately dispatched his attendants to chase his son and bring him back 
Then the attendants quickly ran and overtook him 
The impoverished son was frightened and cried out in fear I did nothing wrong Why are you seizing me 
The attendants grabbed him more rmly and forced him to return 
Then the impoverished son thought They have seized me even though I have done nothing wrong I shall certainly be killed 
He was so terried that he collapsed unconscious on the ground 
His father seeing this from a distance told the attendants I dont need him Dont force him to come 
Pour cold water on his face and bring him to consciousness Dont say anything more to him What was the reason for this 
The father knew that his son was of lowly aspiration and that his own wealth and position would cause him problems Although the father knew without doubt that the man was his son he used skillful means and did not say to others This is my son The attendant then said to the son 
You are free to go wherever you wish Then the impoverished son happy because he had never felt such relief stood up and went to a poor village to seek for food and clothing At that time wanting to get his son back the wealthy man employed skillful means and secretly dispatched two attendants of wretched and humble appearance He said to them 
Approach the impoverished fellow and gently tell him that there is a place for him to work where he will be paid double 
If he asks you what kind of work there is for him to do tell him that he will be employed to sweep dung and that both of you will work with him 
Then the two attendants immediately went in search of the impoverished son When they found him they told him this At that time he took his pay and immediately went to work sweeping dung 
The father seeing his son felt pity and wondered what to do 
Then one day while looking through the window he saw his son in the distance appearing emaciated and wretched soiled with dung and dirt 
The father took off his necklaces ne garments and ornaments and put on torn lthy clothes Covering himself with dirt and taking a dung sweeper in his right hand he made himself look fearsome 
He said to his workers Work hard and dont be lazy Through this kind of skillful means he was able to approach his son 
I want you to always work here Dont go anywhere else and I will pay you more 
There will be no difculty in getting the things you need like utensils rice noodles salt and vinegar I also have an old servant If you need him Ill give him to you Be at ease 
I am just like your father so dont worry about anything 
Why am I doing this 
Because I am old and you are still young Whenever you work you are never lazy or sullen and never complain I never see in you the bad qualities the other workers have 
From now on you will be just like my own son Then the wealthy man immediately addressed him as his child 
At that time even though the impoverished son rejoiced at being treated this way he nevertheless still considered himself a humble employee 
For this reason his father let him continue to sweep dung for twenty years 
I now have plenty of gold silver and precious treasures lling my storehouses Get to know exactly how much is being taken in and out of them 
Why do I want you to do this 
Because you and I are one and the same Take good care of our fortune and dont let it be lost Then the impoverished son obeyed his instructions Although he learned everything about the gold silver precious treasure and the storehouses he never wanted to take even the least amount 
Nevertheless he still lived in the same place as before and was still not able to get rid of his feeling of inferiority 
After a short time had passed the father knew that his sons mind had become composed that his will had increased and that he was ashamed of his former feelings 
When the father was just on the verge of death he ordered his son to meet the king ministers kṣatriyas householders and relatives who had already assembled there 
This is my son my own progeny 
When we were in a certain city he left me and ed He wandered around for more than fty years undergoing hardships His original name is Suchandsuch and my name is Suchandsuch 
Long ago when I was in that city I worried and searched for him At last and unexpectedly I met up with him 
This is my true son and I am in truth his father 
All of the fortune I now possess belongs to my son He already knows about our nances 
O Bhagavat At that time the impoverished son hearing what his father said became extremely happy at having obtained such an unprecedented experience Then he thought I never even considered receiving this nevertheless this treasure house has come into my possession though unsought and unawaited 
This very wealthy man is the Tathāgata and all of us are the heirs of the Buddha The Tathāgata has always said that we are his children 
Because of the triple sufferings O Bhagavat we experienced pain were confused ignorant and attached to inferior teachings in life after life 
Today the Bhagavat has made us think about getting rid of the dung of fallacies regarding the reality of the world and that in this respect we diligently strove to attain the nirvana only as one seeking a salary for a single days labor We had already attained it and were extremely happy and satised with it 
Although we had attained nirvana from the Buddha as our salary for one days labor we thought we had attained much and did not seek the Mahayana 
Furthermore we have manifested and explained the wisdom of the Tathāgata for the bodhisattvas but we ourselves had no aspirations regarding it 
Why is this 
The Buddha knowing that we were content with lowly aspirations taught us according to what is appropriate through the power of skillful means 
But we did not know that we really were the heirs of the Buddha 
Now we fully know that the Bhagavat is unstinting in regard to the wisdom of the buddhas 
What is the reason for this 
We have actually been the heirs of the Buddha from long ago even though we only yearned for the inferior teaching If we had yearned for the superior teaching then the Buddha would have taught the teachings of the Mahayana to us 
Yet in this sutra he has taught only the single vehicle Now in the past the Buddha reviled the śrāvakasthose who yearned for the inferior teachingin the presence of the bodhisattvas but actually the Buddha inspired them also with the Mahayana 
That is why we say that though we originally had no desire to seek the great treasure of the King of the Dharma it has now come to us unsought and unawaited 
We have all attained what we should attain as the heirs of the Buddha Thereupon Mahākāśyapa wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses Today we have heard the Buddhas words And we are joyful and ecstatic At having attained such an unprecedented experience 
The Buddha has said That the śrāvakas will be able to become buddhas The most magnicent jewels Have been obtained without being sought or awaited 
Suppose there were a young and inexperienced child Who left his father And ran away to a distant country He wandered around for more than fty years 
And his worried father looked for him everywhere The father exhausted from searching for him Remained in a city Where he had a house built And enjoyed the desires of the ve senses 
His family built up a vast wealth of much gold silver Motherofpearl agate pearls lapis lazuli Elephants horses cows sheep oats carriages Peasants servants and other employees 
He earned interest through loans and deposits And had buyers and sellers Throughout all the other regions 
He was surrounded by thousands of Myriads of koṭis of people Who held him in awe Always loved by the king And deeply respected by the subjects And powerful families 
There were many people Coming and going on different business He was thus extremely wealthy And very powerful 
And yet as he grew older He increasingly worried about his son Day and night he thought Soon I will die 
My foolish son has abandoned me For over fty years What should I do with the Various goods in my treasure houses 
At that time the impoverished son Was going from town to town From one country to another Seeking food and clothing 
Sometimes he obtained them And sometimes he did not He was emaciated from hunger And his body was covered with scabies 
Through his wanderings He gradually reached the city Where his father lived And after having been employed At one place after another Finally ended up at his fathers home 
At that time the wealthy man Was sitting within the gate On a lion seat sheltered by A huge jewelcovered canopy 
He was surrounded by his attendants And guarded by his men Some were counting gold silver and jewels And some were settling the nances While others were keeping the accounts 
The impoverished son saw his father Who was extremely wealthy and dignied He wondered if this man were a king Or someone of equal rank 
He became intimidated And wondered why he had gone there 
He thought to himself If I stay here for long I will be harassed and coerced into working Thinking this he ran away In search of a poor village Where he could nd employment 
At that time the wealthy man Who was sitting on the lion seat Saw his son in the distance 
The impoverished son was terried Cried out and collapsed on the ground In confusion thinking Since this man has seized me I shall certainly be killed In vain did I come here In search of food and clothing 
The wealthy man knew that his sons thoughts Were humble and foolish And that he would not believe what he said Nor believe that he was his father 
Then using skillful means He dispatched other men With squint eyes of small stature And little dignity saying to them Tell him We will employ you To sweep dung at double your wages When he heard this The impoverished son was overjoyed And returned to sweep dung and clean houses 
The wealthy man Constantly watched his son Through the window and thought That his son was foolish And willingly did menial things 
The wealthy man being wise Gradually gave him freedom of the house And after twenty years had passed Let him become involved In the family business 
He showed him the gold Silver pearls and crystal And made him learn about All aspects of the nances 
Yet the impoverished son still lived In a thatched hut outside the gate And considered himself poor thinking That these things were not his own 
The father knew that his son Was gradually becoming more noble And wanting to give him his fortune He assembled the king ministers Kṣatriyas householders and relatives 
He informed this great assembly saying This is my son He left me and stayed away For fty years 
Twenty years have already passed Since I saw my son return here 
Long ago I lost my son in a certain city And after wandering around in search of him I ended up staying here 
I entrust to him all the houses and men That I possess 
They are all at his disposal The son thought Long ago I was poor and of lowly aspiration Now at my fathers place I have obtained an immense fortune Of such things as precious jewels and houses 
I am overjoyed at having obtained Such an unprecedented experience 
The Buddha is also like this He knew that we yearned for the inferior teaching So he never taught us That we should become buddhas Yet he did tell us that we had attained The stage of noncorruption That we had achieved the inferior vehicle And that we were the disciples of the śrāvaka vehicle 
The Buddha told us to teach that Those who practiced the highest path Would be able to become buddhas 
Accepting the Buddhas teaching We explained the highest path For the great bodhisattvas Using various explanations and illustrations And many gures of speech 
The heirs of the Buddha Heard the teachings from us Contemplated day and night And practiced diligently 
The buddhas instantly made their predictions saying You will all be able to become buddhas in the future We have explained the essence Of the treasured teaching of the buddhas Only for the sake of the bodhisattvas But did not expound it for ourselves 
Just as the impoverished son Who after approaching his father Learned of various things Yet did not want them So although we explained the treasure house Of the teaching of the buddhas We never aspired to it 
We understood only this And did not think there was anything else 
Even if we heard About the pure buddha lands And leading and inspiring sentient beings We never rejoiced in it 
Why is this 
Every existence is quiescent Neither produced nor extinguished Neither large nor small Incorrupted and unconditioned We felt no eagerness 
For days and nights we neither craved for Nor were attached to the wisdom of the buddhas Neither did we aspire to it 
Furthermore we ourselves thought With regard to the Dharma itself That this was the ultimate goal 
After practicing the teaching Of emptiness day and night We were able to shake off The suffering of the triple world And bearing our last bodies Abided in the nirvana with residue 
We were led and inspired by the buddhas So that our attainment of the path was not in vain And we have already been able To pass on the benets We received from the Buddha 
Although we have expounded The teaching of the bodhisattvas To the heirs of the Buddha To seek the buddha path We never longed for this teaching 
Because he knew our minds The Leader turned away from us At rst he did not arouse our zeal With the explanation that there exists Real prot in the teaching 
Just as the wealthy man Who knowing that his son was of lowly aspiration Broadened his sons mind using The power of skillful means And only then entrusted his entire fortune to him 
The Buddha is also exactly like this He has manifested marvelous things But perceiving that we were content With lowly aspirations He brought control to our minds using The power of skillful means And only then taught us the great wisdom 
Thus today we have obtained An unprecedented experience The fact that we have now spontaneously obtained What we had not longed for Is just like the impoverished son Who obtained innumerable jewels 
O Bhagavat We have now obtained the path and its fruit And have obtained pure sight Into the incorruptible Dharma 
For a long while we have maintained The pure conduct of the Buddha Today for the rst time We have obtained the results For a long time we have practiced The pure path of discipline and integrity Based on the teaching of the Dharma King And now we have attained The supreme fruit of noncorruption 
We are now real śrāvakas And cause everyone to hear the words buddha path We are now real arhats and shall be revered Among the devas humans māras and Brahmas In all the worlds 
The Bhagavat the Great Benefactor Benets us with marvelous things By his inspiration and compassion Who can repay him for it Even in immeasurable koṭis of kalpas 
Even if one were to serve him With ones hands and feet Bow ones head in reverence And give all kinds of offerings One could not repay him 
Even if one were to bear him On ones head and shoulders Out of deep respect for as many kalpas As there are sands in the Ganges River One could not repay him 
Or even if one were to honor him With delicious food Uncountable jeweled garments Beddings various medicines Famed sandalwood from Mount Oxhead And various precious jewels Or by building temples Spreading jeweled clothing and other such things For as many kalpas as there are sands in the Ganges River One could not repay him 
The buddhas have marvelous immeasurable Limitless inconceivable great transcendent powers They are the Kings of the Dharma 
Without depravities and unconditioned They are patient in all matters For the sake of the humble ones They teach the common people Who are attached to tangible things According to what is appropriate to them 
All of the buddhas having attained Complete mastery over the Dharma Perceive the various desires and intentions Of sentient beings and explain the teachings With innumerable illustrations According to what is appropriate to them 
Judging from the roots of good merit That sentient beings have planted in former lives The buddhas perceive who are mature And who are not 
Herbs Thereupon the Bhagavat addressed Mahākāśyapa and other great disciples saying 
Splendid Splendid O Kāśyapa You have skillfully explained the real merit of the Tathāgata 
It is exactly as you have said The Tathāgata has immeasurable unlimited and incalculable merits Thus even in a period of immeasurable koṭis of kalpas you will never fully be able to explain all of his merits 
O Kāśyapa You should know that the Tathāgata is the king of all the teaching What he teaches is never false 
He explains all the teaching using his wisdom and skillful means and what he teaches leads everyone to the stage of omniscience 
The Tathāgata perceives the goal of all teachings and knows the underlying mental disposition of all sentient beings perceiving all with no obstructions 
He completely understands all teachings and displays omniscience to all sentient beings O Kāśyapa 
Suppose in the great manifold cosmos there are mountains rivers valleys and plains where many kinds of grasses trees shrubs and herbs of different names and colors grow 
Dense clouds thoroughly cover this great manifold cosmos and rain falls at the same time everywhere moistening the small medium and large roots stems branches and leaves of all the grasses trees shrubs and herbs 
The sizes of all the trees depend on whether their capacities are superior mediocre or inferior and the rain falling from the same cloud makes them grow according to the nature of their various seeds 
Flowers blossom in the same place and fruit ripens in the same place moistened by the same rain yet there are differences among these grasses and trees O Kāśyapa 
You should know that the Tathāgata is exactly like this He appears in this world like a great overspreading cloud His great voice resounds over the devas humans and asuras in the world just as the great cloud thoroughly covers the great manifold cosmos 
He declares to the assembly I am the Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat I set free those who have not been freed I enlighten those who have not been enlightened and bring calm to those who have not been calmed 
I am the AllKnower the AllSeer the Knower of the Path the One who discloses the path and explains it All of you devas humans and asuras Come and listen to my teachings At that time innumerable thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings approach the Buddha and listen to his teaching 
Then the Tathāgata perceiving the faculties of sentient beingswhether they are sharp or dull diligent or idleexplains the teachings according to their capacities in a variety of immeasurable ways gladdening and beneting them all 
Having heard his teaching all of these beings are at peace in this world and are born into a good existence in the future Through this they will receive peace of mind and be able to hear the teaching 
Having already heard the teaching they will become free from obstructions and be able to gradually enter the path to the Dharma according to their capacities 
Just like the great cloud that rains upon all the grasses trees shrubs and herbs whose seeds are watered and which grow according to their capacities the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma of one aspect and character that is to say the character of liberation dispassion and cessation which ultimately leads to omniscience 
Those sentient beings who hear hold and recite the teachings of the Tathāgata and practice it accordingly will nevertheless not perceive the merit that they have obtained 
Why is this 
Only the Tathāgata knows the seed character disposition and capacity of sentient beings Only he knows what they contemplate think and practice how they contemplate think and practice what teachings they contemplate think and practice and what teaching they obtain through what teaching 
Only the Tathāgata exactly perceives and knows without obstructions the various states in which sentient beings reside 
It is just like the grasses trees shrubs and herbs that do not know their own natures whether they are superior mediocre or inferior 
Yet the Tathāgata knows the teachings of one aspect and character the character of liberation dispassion cessation complete nirvana and eternal tranquility which ultimately leads to emptiness 
The Buddha knows this and perceives the aspirations of sentient beings For this reason in order to protect them he does not immediately teach omniscience O Kāśyapa 
It is a rare thing that all of you know that the Tathāgata teaches according to your capacities and that you believe and accept it 
Why is this 
Because the Dharma taught by all the Buddha Bhagavats according to what is appropriate to sentient beings is difcult to understand and difcult to know Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses The King of the Dharma The destroyer of delusive existence Appears in the world And keeping in mind the aspirations of sentient beings Teaches the Dharma in various ways According to the wishes of sentient beings 
The Tathāgata is greatly distinguished And his wisdom is profound 
Those who are wise Will be well convinced when they hear it Those who are not wise will have doubts And remain confused for a long time 
That is why O Kāśyapa the Tathāgata teaches According to the capacities of sentient beings And enables them to attain the correct perspective By using various illustrations 
O Kāśyapa you should know That it is as if a great cloud Arises in the world And covers everything 
This benecent cloud contains moisture And bright lightning ashes from it The sound of its thunder shakes the earth afar And gladdens the people 
It conceals the sun And cools the earth The spreading cloud hangs so low As if it could be touched 
Everywhere equal and immeasurable The rain pours down and moistens the earth 
Grasses herbs large and small trees All kinds of crops seedlings sugarcane and grapes Growing in the depths of the mountains In rivers and in precipitous valleys Are all watered and completely nourished by the rain The dry earth is moistened everywhere And the herbs and trees grow up thickly 
Out of this cloud the same rain Waters these grasses trees and shrubs Each according to their capacities 
All the trees small medium or large Are able to grow in accordance with their capacities The luster and colors of the roots stems Branches leaves and owers Are all freshened by the same rain 
Each of these although receiving the same moisture Reaches a greater or lesser size In accordance with their different Dispositions characteristics and natures 
The Buddha is exactly like this He appears in the world As a great cloud Which covers everything universally 
Once appearing in this world He illuminates and explains The essence of the teachings For the sake of sentient beings 
The Great Seer the Bhagavat expounds this To the assembly of all the devas and humans I am the Tathāgata the Best of Humans I appear in the world to nourish sentient beings Just as the great cloud Moistens all the withered trees 
I cause everyone to be rid of suffering And attain ease of heart Worldly happiness and the joy of nirvana So devas and humans listen carefully 
Come all of you And look at the Highest One I am the Bhagavat No one is equal to me I appear in this world To bring peace of mind to sentient beings And to teach the Dharma of immortality To the great assembly 
This Dharma has a single avor Of liberation and nirvana 
I expound its meaning with the same subtle voice Always making the Mahayana The subject of my illustrations 
I see everywhere and regard all as equal I have no feelings of like or dislike For me there is no this or that Nor do I have either love or hate 
I have no attachments and make no distinctions And so always teach the Dharma equally to all And teach the same thing to one person As I teach to everyone else 
Going or coming sitting or standing I never tire of satisfying the world Just like the rain that gives nourishment universally 
I tirelessly pour down the rain of the Dharma Equally on those who are noble or humble Superior or inferior who keep or break the precepts Who have good or bad conduct right or wrong views Sharp or dull faculties 
According to their power to understand All sentient beings who hear my teaching Dwell in various stages 
Those living among humans Devas noble emperors akra and Brahma kings Are like the small herbs 
Those who know the incorruptible Dharma Who are able to attain nirvana Have the six transcendent powers and Have attained the three sciences Those who live alone in mountain forests Always practicing meditation and Who attain the enlightenment of the pratyekabuddhas Are like the mediumsized herbs 
Those who seek the stage Of the Bhagavat thinking that They will become buddhas And practice persistence and meditation Are like the large herbs 
The heirs of the buddhas Who concentrate on the path of the Buddha Who always cultivate compassion within themselves And know denitely without a doubt That they will become buddhas Are like the small trees 
Those who are comfortable with transcendent powers Who turn the irreversible wheel And save innumerable hundreds Of thousands of koṭis of sentient beings Are the bodhisattvas Who are like the large trees 
The Buddhas equal teaching Is like the rain of one avor 
The sentient beings accept it According to their different capacities Just as the grasses and trees Each differently absorb the rain 
The Buddha reveals the single teaching With illustrations using skillful means And explains it with various explanations And yet it is just a drop in the ocean Compared to the Buddhas wisdom 
I pour down the rain of the Dharma Fullling the world And the sentient beings Practice the Dharma of one avor According to their capacities 
Just as the shrubs herbs and trees Flourish in accordance with their capacities Reaching either a greater or lesser size The teaching of the buddhas Is always of one avor And fullls the entire world Anyone who practices it little by little Obtains the fruit of the path 
The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas Living in mountain forests Who in their last bodies Hear the Dharma and attain its fruit Are just like the ourishing herbs 
The bodhisattvas who are rm in wisdom Who completely understand the triple world And seek the highest vehicle Are just like the ourishing small trees 
Those who abide in meditation Attain transcendent powers Listen to the teaching regarding the emptiness Of every existence with great joy And save sentient beings By emitting innumerable rays of light Are just like the ourishing large trees 
In this way O Kāśyapa The Dharma that the Buddha teaches Is just like the great cloud that enriches human owers With the rain of one avor So that each attains its fruits 
O Kāśyapa You should know that I reveal the buddha path Using various explanations and illustrations And that this is my skillful means All of the buddhas are just like this 
I will now teach the highest truth for your sake There are no śrāvakas who attain nirvana 
What you practice is the bodhisattva path And if you practice step by step You will all become buddhas 
Prediction At that time after the Bhagavat had spoken these verses he addressed the great assembly proclaiming This disciple of mine Mahākāśyapa in the future will be able to meet three hundred myriads of koṭis of Buddha Bhagavats to whom he will pay homage respect veneration and praise and he will extensively expound the immeasurable great teachings of these buddhas 
In his last body he will become a buddha called Raśmiprabhāsa a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
The lifespan of this buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas The True Dharma will last in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas and the Semblance Dharma will also last for twenty intermediate kalpas 
His world will be adorned and there will be no dirt shards thorns excrement or other impurities 
The earth will be level without irregularities hollows or hills 
The earth will be made of lapis lazuli with jeweled trees in rows Golden cords will line the borders of these roads which will be scattered with precious owers and everywhere will be pure 
In his world there will be immeasurable thousands of koṭis of bodhisattvas as well as innumerable śrāvakas All malice will be far removed and even though Māra and his minions will be there they will all protect the BuddhaDharma Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to explain the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
I tell you O monks That I see with the buddhaeye That Kāśyapa in the future Will become a buddha After innumerable kalpas have passed 
In the future he will meet and pay homage To three hundred myriads of koṭis of Buddha Bhagavats And practice the pure path of discipline and integrity Seeking for the wisdom of the buddhas 
Having offered respect to the highest and best of humans And having completely grasped the ultimate wisdom He will become a buddha while in his last body 
His land will be pure The earth will be made of lapis lazuli And many jeweled trees will be in rows Along roads bordered with golden cords And those who see it will be gladdened 
The air will be always lled With a pleasant fragrance And many beautiful owers Will be strewn about 
Various wonderful things Will adorn this earth Which will be level Without hills or hollows 
There will be an incalculable number Of bodhisattvas there Who will have the power of selfcontrol Be versed in transcendent powers And who will preserve the sutras of the Mahayana Taught by the buddhas 
The multitude of śrāvakas Bearing their last bodies free from corruption Heirs of the Dharma King Will also be unreckonable Their number will be impossible to calculate Even with the divine eye 
The lifespan of this buddha Will be twelve intermediate kalpas 
The True Dharma will last in the world For twenty intermediate kalpas 
And the Semblance Dharma will also last For twenty intermediate kalpas 
Thus will things be with The Bhagavat Raśmiprabhāsa 
At that time Mahāmaudgalyāyana Subhūti and Mahākātyā yana were all charged with excitement and with palms pressed together they attentively gazed at the Bhagavat never turning their eyes from him 
If knowing the depths of our hearts You give us your predictions It will be like cooling our fevers By sprinkling us with the Dharma of immortality 
It is as though someone coming From a country suffering from famine Were suddenly to nd A great kings feast spread before him Yet is stricken with doubt And does not venture to eat Until being instructed by the king He dares at last to do so 
We are exactly like this We have been constantly thinking About the faults of the inferior vehicle And so we had no knowledge of the way To obtain the highest wisdom of the Buddha 
Although we hear the Buddhas voice Saying that we will become buddhas We still have doubt in our minds As if we dare not eat the meal If we receive the Buddhas prediction It will immediately put us at ease 
The Bhagavat the Great Hero Always wants to put the world at ease And so we entreat you to bestow Upon us your predictions As though to starving people Waiting for permission to eat 
Then the Bhagavat knowing what lay in the thoughts of the great disciples addressed the monks saying This Subhūti in the future will meet respect venerate praise and pay homage to three hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of buddhas and he will always practice the pure path of discipline and integrity and complete the bodhisattva path 
In his last body he will become a buddha called Yaśasketu a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
The land will be even and the earth will be made of crystal and adorned with jeweled trees It will be without pits pebbles thorns or the lth of excrement The earth will be covered with precious owers and will be everywhere pure 
The people in this world will all live in wonderful towers with jeweled terraces 
The śrāvakas the disciples there will be innumerable and limitless beyond calculation and metaphor and there will also be innumerable thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of bodhisattvas 
The lifespan of this buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas The True Dharma will last in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas and the Semblance Dharma will also last for twenty intermediate kalpas 
This Buddha will always dwell in the air teaching the Dharma for the multitude and he will save incalculable bodhisattvas and śrāvakas Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to explain the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
O monks I shall now make something known to you You should attentively listen To what I have to say My great disciple Subhūti Will become a buddha called Yaśasketu 
He will pay homage to innumerable Myriads of koṭis of buddhas And following the Buddhas practice He will gradually come to complete the great path 
He will attain the thirtytwo marks In his last body And his form will be ne and beautiful Just like a jeweled mountain 
His buddha world will be ultimately pure Of the sentient beings who see it There will be none who do not rejoice There the Buddha will bring Incalculable sentient beings to enlightenment 
In the midst of his Dharma There will be many bodhisattvas With keen faculties Who turn the irreversible wheel  This world will always Be graced with bodhisattvas 
There will also be Incalculable numbers of śrāvakas All of them will have perfected the three sciences And the six transcendent powers Will abide in the eight liberations And have great dignity and virtue

The lifespan of this buddha Will be twelve intermediate kalpas The True Dharma will last in the world For twenty intermediate kalpas And the Semblance Dharma will also last For twenty intermediate kalpas 
Thereupon the Bhagavat addressed the monks saying I will now tell you that this Mahākātyāyana in the future will honor respect and pay homage to eight thousand koṭis of buddhas with offerings 
After the parinirvāṇas of these buddhas he will erect stupas each of which will be one thousand yojanas in height and ve hundred yojanas in both width and depth These stupas will all be constructed of the seven precious treasuresgold silver lapis lazuli motherofpearl agate pearls and rubies He will pay homage to these stupas with many owers and necklaces fragrant ointments scented powders burning incense canopies ags and banners 
After this he will also pay homage to two myriads of koṭis of buddhas in exactly the same way and having done so he will perfect the bodhisattva path and become a buddha called Jāmbūna dā bhāsa a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
His land will be level The earth will be made of crystal and it will be adorned with jeweled trees The roads will be bordered with golden cords and beautiful owers will cover the earth It will be pure everywhere and those who see it will rejoice 
There will be none of the four troubled states of being namely the hells hungry ghosts animals and asuras There will be many devas and humans and immeasurable myriads of koṭis of śrāvakas and bodhisattvas will grace this world 
The lifespan of this buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas The True Dharma will last in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas and the Semblance Dharma will also last for twenty intermediate kalpas At that time the Bhagavat wanting to explain the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
This Kātyāyana Will pay homage to the buddhas With various wonderful offerings 
After the parinirvāṇas of those buddhas He will erect stupas constructed Of the seven precious treasures And offer respect to their relics With owers and incense 
In his last body He will attain the wisdom of the Buddha And will achieve complete enlightenment

There is nothing that surpasses This Buddhas ray of light So this buddha Will be called Jāmbūnadābhāsa 
There will be innumerable uncountable Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas gracing this world Who have shaken free from every state of being 
Thereupon the Bhagavat again addressed the assembly saying I will now tell you that this Mahāmaudgalyāyana will respect venerate and pay homage to eight thousand buddhas with various offerings and after the parinirvāṇas of these buddhas he will erect stupas each of which will be one thousand yojanas in height and ve hundred yojanas in both depth and width 
These stupas will be constructed with the seven precious treasures gold silver lapis lazuli motherofpearl agate pearls and rubies He will offer them various owers necklaces fragrant ointments scented powders burning incense canopies ags and banners 
After this he will pay homage to two hundred myriads of koṭis of buddhas in exactly the same way and will become a buddha called Tamālapatracandanagandha a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
The land will be level The earth will be made of crystal adorned with jeweled trees and strewn with owers of pearls It will be pure everywhere and those who see it will rejoice 
There will be many devas and humans innumerable bodhisattvas and śrāvakas 
The lifespan of this buddha will be twentyfour intermediate kalpas The True Dharma will last in this world for forty intermediate kalpas and the Semblance Dharma will also last for forty intermediate kalpas Then the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on this meaning spoke these verses 
This disciple of mine Mahāmaudgalyāyana Having abandoned this body Will meet eight thousand and then two hundred Myriads of koṭis of Buddha Bhagavats 
For the sake of the buddha path He will pay them homage and respect them And always practice holy conduct Of discipline and integrity In the presence of these buddhas He will uphold the BuddhaDharma For immeasurable kalpas

There will be innumerable bodhisattvas Resolute and persevering who will never turn away From the wisdom of the buddhas 
After the parinirvāṇa of this buddha The True Dharma will last For forty intermediate kalpas And the Semblance Dharma Will also be like this 
All of my disciples Five hundred in number Who are endowed with dignity and virtue Will also receive my prediction 
In the future they will all become buddhas 
I will now explain the relationships That you and I have formed in past lives All of you listen carefully 
The Apparitional City The Buddha addressed the monks saying Once upon a time immeasurable limitless inconceivable incalculable kalpas ago there was a buddha called Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata an Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
His land was called Susaṃbhavā in the kalpa called Mahārūpa 
Suppose there were a man who ground the earth of the entire great manifold cosmos into powdered ink and he were to then pass through a thousand worlds to the east where he let fall a single particle of ink the size of a speck of dust After passing through another thousand worlds he let fall another particle and he continued in this way until he had completely used all the ink 
What do you think about this 
Do you think that a mathematician or a mathematicians pupil would be able to count those worlds to the last particle or not O Bhagavat 
No they could not O monks 
Suppose that all the worlds this man passed through whether letting fall a particle or not were all ground into dust and one speck of this dust were equal to one kalpa 
The time since the parinirvāṇa of this buddha surpasses this number by immeasurable limitless incalculable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas and through the power of the Tathāgatas wisdom and insight I can see his distant past as if it were today Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
I recall that in the past Immeasurable kalpas ago There was a buddha the most honored among twolegged beings Called Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū 
Suppose there was a man Who vigorously ground up in its entirety The earth of the great manifold cosmos And turned it all to powdered ink 
After passing through one thousand worlds He let fall one particle of ink And in this way He continued to let fall particles Until he had used up all the ink 
If all these worlds Those where he let fall a particle And those where he did not Were to be ground into specks of dust And one speck of dust were equal to a single kalpa Their number would be surpassed By the number of kalpas That have passed since that buddhas parinirvāṇa So incalculable has this number of kalpas been 
With the Tathāgatas unobstructed wisdom I know of these bodhisattvas and śrāvakas And the parinirvāṇa of this buddha It is as if I see his parinirvāṇa today 
O monks you should know That with the knowledge of the Buddha Which is pure and subtle Incorrupted and without obstructions I perceive what happened immeasurable kalpas ago 
The Buddha addressed the monks saying The lifespan of this buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū was ve hundred and forty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas 
When that buddha was seated on the terrace of enlightenment after having defeated Māras army he tried to obtain highest complete enlightenment yet the Dharma of the buddhas did not appear to him 
In this way even after having sat crosslegged for one to ten intermediate kalpas undisturbed in body and mind the Dharma of the buddhas still did not appear to him 
At that time a group of thirtythree devas rst prepared for that buddha a lion seat one yojana in height under the bodhi tree for this buddha was to attain highest complete enlightenment on that seat 
As soon as the Buddha sat on this seat all the Brahmas rained down various heavenly owers for a hundred yojanas around periodically a fragrant breeze would blow away the withered owers and they would rain down fresh ones 
In this way they unceasingly paid homage to the Buddha for a full ten intermediate kalpas raining down these owers continuously until his parinirvāṇa 
The devas of the four quarters constantly struck heavenly drums to honor the Buddha and in the same way all the other devas made divine music for a full ten intermediate kalpas until his parinirvāṇa O monks 
The Dharma of the buddhas appeared to the Buddha Mahā bhijñājñānābhibhū after ten intermediate kalpas had passed and he attained highest complete enlightenment 
This Buddha had had sixteen children before he renounced household life The eldest child was called Jñānākara 
Each child had various kinds of rare toys After hearing about their fathers attain ment of highest complete enlightenment they all put aside their toys and set out for where the Buddha was 
Weeping sad tears their mothers saw them off 
Their grandfather the wheelturning sage king went with them along with a hundred ministers and hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of people 
When they arrived at the terrace of enlightenment they all wanted to approach the Tathāgata Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū and pay homage and respect honor and praise him 
They came up to him and bowed until their foreheads touched his feet and then circled around him Attentively with palms pressed together they gazed at the Bhagavat and spoke these verses The Bhagavat of great virtuous dignity In order to bring sentient beings to the path After immeasurable koṭis of kalpas And perfecting all the vows Finally became a buddha How wonderful 
The Bhagavat is truly extraordinary He sat tranquil for ten intermediate kalpas With his body and limbs immobile 
His mind was always calm and never distracted He has attained ultimate eternal tranquility And is rmly established In the incorruptible Dharma 
Now seeing the Bhagavat Who has serenely attained the buddha path We receive benet and celebrate With great joy 
Sentient beings ever suffering Are blind and without a teacher They are unaware of the path that leads To the extinction of suffering Ignorant of the way to seek liberation 
From one blind state to the next Those in the troubled states of being daily increase While the devas decrease They never hear the Buddhas name 
Now the Buddha has attained the highest Serene and incorruptible Dharma Thus we and the devas and humans Shall obtain the greatest benet Therefore we all bow and pay homage To the highest Lord At that time the sixteen princes having praised the Buddha in verse requested that the Bhagavat turn the wheel of the Dharma saying 
Illuminate and reveal this wisdom So that we may attain it 
If we can become buddhas So can the other sentient beings 
The Bhagavat knows The deepseated intentions of sentient beings And the paths they practice As well as the power of their wisdom 
The Buddha addressed the monks saying When the Buddha Mahā bhijñājñānābhibhū attained highest complete enlightenment ve hundred myriads of koṭis of buddha worlds in each of the ten directions quaked in six ways The dark places between the worlds where the rays of the sun and moon had been unable to penetrate were brightly illuminated 
The sentient beings there were able to see each other and said How is it possible that sentient beings have suddenly appeared here Moreover those worlds from the heavenly palaces up to the palaces of the Brahmas also quaked in six ways 
The great ray of light shone everywhere lling the worlds with a radiance that surpassed the light of the devas At that time the palaces of Brahmas in the ve hundred myriads of koṭis of worlds in the east were illuminated twice as brightly as usual 
The great Brahmas each thought The palaces are illuminated now as never before 
What has caused this phenomenon 
At that time all of the great Brahmas approached each other to discuss this matter 
In that assembly there was a great Brahma called Sarvasattvatrātar who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse saying This illumination of our palaces Has never occurred before Let us nd out The reason for this 
This great ray of light Has illuminated the ten directions Has a deva of great merit been born Or has a buddha appeared in the world Then the great Brahmas of the hundred myriads of koṭis of worlds went toward the west with their palaces to enquire about this phenomenon carrying heavenly owers in their robes 
They saw the Tathāgata Mahābhijñā jñānā bhibhū on the terrace of enlightenment sitting on the lion seat under the bodhi tree He was respectfully surrounded by humans and such non humans as devas nāga kings gandharvas kiṃnaras and mahoragas They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the wheel of the Dharma 
Then the great Brahmas bowed until their foreheads touched the Buddhas feet and then circled around him one hundred thousand times They scattered heavenly owers on the Buddha and the owers they scattered were piled as high as Mount Sumeru 
They also paid homage to the Buddhas bodhi tree which was ten yojanas in height 
Having reverently offered him owers they presented their palaces to the Buddha saying 
Please accept the palaces we now offer you and benet us through your compassion Then the great Brahmas spoke these verses wholeheartedly and in unison before the Buddha The Bhagavat who is truly extraordinary Is extremely difcult to meet He is endowed with immeasurable qualities And seeks to protect all 
The Great Teacher of Devas and Humans Feels compassion for the world And causes all sentient beings In the ten directions To be universally beneted 
All of us who have come from Five hundreds of myriads of koṭis of worlds Have given up the pleasure of deep meditation In order to pay homage to the Buddha 
Please accept them through your compassion Thereupon having praised the Buddha in verse the great Brahmas each said this O Bhagavat We entreat you to turn the wheel of the Dharma open the path to nirvana and guide sentient beings to it 
Furthermore O monks the great Brahmas in the ve hundred myriads of koṭis of worlds in the southeast saw their palaces illuminated with a ray of light that had never occurred before 
Joyful and ecstatic they were struck with wonder They assembled to discuss this matter 
At that time there was a great Brahma called Adhimātrakāruṇika He spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse saying What is the reason That this phenomenon has appeared 
Even since the olden times This illumination of all of our palaces Is without precedent 
Has a deva of great merit been born Or has a buddha appeared in the world 
Since we have never seen such a phenomenon We should seek thoroughly for its source 
Possibly a buddha has appeared in the world To save suffering sentient beings Thereupon ve hundred myriads of koṭis of great Brahmas went toward the northwest with their palaces carrying heavenly owers in their robes to enquire about this phenomenon 
They saw the Tathāgata Mahābhijñā jñānābhibhū on the terrace of enlightenment sitting on the lion seat under the bodhi tree He was respectfully surrounded by humans and such nonhumans as devas nāga kings gandharvas kiṃnaras and mahoragas They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the wheel of the Dharma 
Then all the Brahmas bowed until their foreheads touched the Buddhas feet and then circled around him one hundred thousand times They scattered heavenly owers on the Buddha and the owers they scattered were piled up as high as Mount Sumeru They also paid homage to the Buddhas bodhi tree 
Having reverently offered the Buddha owers they presented their palaces to him saying Please accept the palaces we now offer you and benet us through your compassion 
Then the great Brahmas spoke these verses wholeheartedly and in unison before the Buddha O Great Sage Deva of Devas We now bow to the one Whose voice is as beautiful as the kalaviṅka birds And who has compassion for sentient beings 
The Bhagavat is truly extraordinary And can only be seen once In an extremely long time One hundred and eighty kalpas Have passed away fruitlessly And no buddhas have appeared during this time 
The worlds have been lled With people in the three troubled states of being And the devas have decreased The Buddha has now appeared in the world To be the eyes of sentient beings 
He will be the refuge of the world And will seek to protect all As the father of sentient beings He is the compassionate benefactor 
Because of our past merits We now have the good fortune to be able To meet the Bhagavat Thereupon having praised the Buddha in verse the great Brahmas said this O Bhagavat We entreat you to turn the wheel of the Dharma out of your compassion for all and save sentient beings 
If sentient beings hear this Dharma They will attain the path and be born as devas The beings in the troubled states of being will decrease While those who persevere in the good will increase Then the Tathāgata Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū silently consented 
Furthermore O monks the great Brahmas in the ve hundreds of thousands of koṭis of lands in the south each saw their palaces illuminated as they had never been before 
Joyful and ecstatic they were struck with wonder They immediately assembled to discuss this matter together asking Why have our palaces been illuminated 
At that time there was a great Brahma called Sudharma He spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse saying Our palaces are illuminated With brilliant light There must be a reason for this And we should seek its source 
We have not seen such a phenomenon During the past hundreds of thousands of kalpas Has a deva of great merit been born Or has a buddha appeared in the world 
Thereupon ve hundred myriads of koṭis of great Brahmas went toward the north with their palaces to enquire about this phenomenon carrying heavenly owers in their robes 
They saw the Tathāgata Mahābhijñā jñānābhibhū on the terrace of enlightenment sitting on the lion seat under the bodhi tree He was respectfully surrounded by humans and such nonhumans as devas nāga kings gandharvas kiṃnaras and mahoragas They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the wheel of the Dharma 
Then all the great Brahmas bowed until their foreheads touched the Buddhas feet and then circled around him one hundred thousand times They scattered heavenly owers on the Buddha and the owers they scattered piled up as high as Mount Sumeru They also paid homage to the Buddhas bodhi tree 
Having revered the Buddha with owers they offered their palaces to him saying Please accept the palaces we now offer you and benet us through your compassion 
Then the great Brahmas spoke these verses wholeheartedly and in unison before the Buddha O Destroyer of Afictions It is extremely difcult to meet a Bhagavat We are now meeting the Buddha for the rst time Since one hundred and thirty kalpas have passed away 
Please satisfy sentient beings Who are suffering from hunger and thirst By pouring down the rain of the Dharma O One Possessed of Immeasurable Wisdom Whom we have never met before Today we have encountered The one who appears as rarely As the uḍumbara ower blooms 
We have all come to request That you expound it With your profound voice Then the Tathāgata Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū silently consented 
The very same thing happened in the worlds from the southwestern to the lower regions as well as those in other directions Then all the great Brahmas in the ve hundred myriads of koṭis of lands in the upper region saw their palaces illuminated with a light that had never existed before 
Joyful and ecstatic they were struck with wonder They immediately assembled to discuss this matter together asking Why have our palaces been illuminated 
There was a great Brahma in that assembly called ikhin He spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse saying Why have all our palaces Been brilliantly illuminated With this light of virtuous dignity And adorned in this unprecedented way 
We have never seen such a wonderful phenomenon Has a deva of great merit been born Or has a buddha appeared in the world 
Thereupon ve hundred myriads of koṭis of great Brahmas went into the lower regions with their palaces to enquire about this phenomenon carrying heavenly owers in their robes 
They saw the Tathāgata Mahābhijñā jñānābhibhū on the terrace of enlightenment sitting on the lion seat under the bodhi tree He was respectfully surrounded by humans and such nonhumans as devas nāga kings gandharvas kiṃnaras and mahoragas They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the wheel of the Dharma 
Then all the great Brahmas bowed until their foreheads touched the Buddhas feet and then circumambulated him one hundred thousand times They scattered heavenly owers on the Buddha and the owers they scattered were piled up as high as Mount Sumeru They also paid homage to the Buddhas bodhi tree 
Having reverently offered him owers they presented their palaces to the Buddha saying 
Please accept the palaces we now offer you and benet us through your compassion Then all the great Brahmas spoke these verses wholeheartedly and in unison before the Buddha How splendid it is to meet the buddhas The Great Sages who deliver the world Who diligently work to get sentient beings Out of the hell of the triple world 
The Best of Devas and Humans Who has universal wisdom Out of compassion for everyone Opens the gate to immortality And extensively saves all 
Since olden times immeasurable kalpas Have passed away in vain Without the presence of the Buddha In the time before the Bhagavat appears The ten directions are in constant darkness Those in the three troubled states of being increase And the asuras also ourish The devas decrease all the more And when they die Many of them fall into those troubled states 
Having never heard the teaching from the Buddha All of them always behave badly And their physical power and wisdom decreases 
Because of their erring deeds They lose happiness or any notion of it Abiding in the teaching of false views They know nothing of good conduct Deprived of the buddhas inspiration They always fall into the troubled states of being 
After a very long time the Buddha has now Appeared as the Eye of the World It is out of compassion for sentient beings That the Buddha appears in the world 
We are all extremely happy And all the other beings joyfully acclaim This unprecedented experience 
All our palaces are beautifully adorned By this ray of light We now offer them to the Bhagavat Please accept them out of your compassion 
By the universal transference of this merit May we and all other beings Together attain the buddha path Thereupon the ve hundred myriads of koṭis of great Brahmas having praised the Buddha in verse each spoke to him saying O Bhagavat We strongly entreat you to turn the wheel of the Dharma give ease to many and enable them to attain the path 
We strongly entreat you to accept our request And out of your compassion And with your wonderful voice Expound the Dharma That you have perfected Over immeasurable kalpas And then the Tathāgata Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū acceded to the request made by all the great Brahmas from the ten directions and the sixteen princes He then immediately turned three times the Dharma wheel of twelve spokes that no śrāmaṇas brahmans devamāras Brahmas or any other being in the world could turn He taught 
When becoming ceases then birth ceases When birth ceases then old age illness death anxiety sorrow suffering and distress cease When the Buddha explained this Dharma to the great assembly of the devas and humans at that time six hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of people because they were not attached to any existent thing became free of all corruption All of them perfected profound meditations the three sciences the six transcendent powers and were endowed with the eight liberations 
When he taught the Dharma for the second third and fourth time thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of sentient beings equal to the sands of the Ganges River who were not attached to any existent thing became free of all corruption 
Innumerable immeasurable incalculable śrāvakas followed in their turn At that time the sixteen princes who were still young renounced household life and became śrāmaṇeras All their faculties were sharp and their wisdom was penetrating They had paid homage to hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas practiced the pure path of discipline and integrity and sought highest complete enlightenment 
All of these immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of śrāvakas of great merit have all attained perfection 
O Bhagavat You should also expound the teaching of highest complete enlightenment to us Hearing it we shall all practice it O Bhagavat 
We aspire for the wisdom and insight of the Tathāgata The Buddha himself knows what is deep in our minds At that time eight myriads of koṭis of people in the assembly who served the noble emperor saw the sixteen princes renounce household life and appealed to the emperor to allow their own renunciation The emperor immediately gave his permission 
Then the Buddha accepted the request of the śrāmaṇeras After twenty thousand kalpas had passed he taught to the fourfold assembly this Mahayana sutra called the Lotus Sutra the instruction for bodhisattvas and treasured lore of the buddhas 
After the Buddha taught this sutra all the sixteen śrāmaṇeras preserved recited and understood it in order to achieve highest complete enlightenment 
When the Buddha taught this sutra all the sixteen śrāmaṇeras the bodhisattvas completely accepted it 
There were also some among the śrāvakas who believed it 
But all the other thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings became confused 
The Buddha continuously taught this sutra for eight thousand kalpas without stopping 
After teaching this sutra he immediately entered a quiet place and abided in meditation for eightyfour thousand kalpas 
At that time each of the sixteen śrāmaṇeras the bodhisattvas knowing that the Buddha had entered the quiet place and was abiding tranquilly in meditation ascended the Dharma seat and extensively taught and explained the Lotus Sutra to the fourfold assembly for eightyfour thousand kalpas 
Each of them saved six hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of sentient beings equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River By revealing and teaching it they gladdened these sentient beings and awoke in them the thought of highest complete enlightenment Having arisen from samādhi after eightyfour thousand kalpas had passed the Buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū approached the Dharma seat and sat down with complete mindfulness He addressed everyone in the great assembly saying 
They preserved the wisdom of the buddhas and revealed it to sentient beings causing them to enter into it 
All of you should approach and pay them homage again and again 
Why is this 
If there are any śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas who are able to believe and preserve the teaching in this sutra expounded by these sixteen bodhisattvas and not disparage it they will all attain the wisdom of the Tathāgata highest complete enlightenment 
The Buddha addressed the monks saying These sixteen bodhisattvas always willingly taught this Lotus Sutra Each bodhisattva has inspired six hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of sentient beings equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River In life after life they remained with these bodhisattvas and hearing this teaching from them they believed and understood 
O monks I shall now tell you that these sixteen śrāmaṇeras disciples of that buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū have now attained highest complete enlightenment and presently teach the Dharma in the lands of the ten directions There are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas who have become their attendants 
Two of these śrāmaṇeras have became buddhas in the east One is called Akṣobhya in the land called Abhirati and the other is called Merukūṭa 
In the southeast there are two buddhas One is called Siṃhaghoṣa and the other is called Siṃhadhvaja 
In the south there are two buddhas called kāśapratiṣṭhita and Nitya pari nirvṛta 
There are also two buddhas in the southwest One is called Indra dhvaja and the other is called Brahmadhvaja 
In the west there are two buddhas called Amitāyus and Sarvaloka dhātū padra vodvega pratyuttīrṇa 
There are two buddhas in the northwest One is called Tamāla patracandanagandhābhijña The other is called Meru kalpa 
In the north there are two buddhas One is called Megha svaradīpa and the other is called Meghasvara rāja 
In the northeast there is a buddha called Sarva loka bha ya cchambhi tatva vidhvaṃsanakara And the sixteenth one is myself Buddha ākyamuni who in this sahā world achieved highest complete enlightenment O monks 
When we were śrāmaṇeras each of us inspired immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River Those sentient beings who heard the teaching from me attained highest complete enlightenment 
There are sentient beings who still abide in the stage of a śrāvaka and whom I will inspire to attain highest complete enlightenment 
By means of this teaching they will gradually enter the buddha path 
Why is this 
The wisdom of the Tathāgatas is hard to believe and hard to understand 
Those incalculable sentient beings equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River who were inspired at that time were you O monks and those disciples who will be śrāvakas in the future after my parinirvāṇa 
After my parinirvāṇa there will be disciples who will not hear this sutra and will neither know nor understand the bodhisattva practice yet through the merit they have acquired the thought of extinction will awake in them and they will enter parinirvāṇa 
I will become a buddha in another land with a different name 
Although the idea of extinction has awoken in these disciples and they have entered parinirvāṇa in that land they will still seek the wisdom of the buddhas and will then be able to hear this sutra They can obtain parinirvāṇa only through the buddha vehicle There are no other vehicles except the one taught through the skillful means of the Tathāgatas O monks 
When the Tathāgata realizes that the time of his parinirvāṇa is approaching knowing that the assembly is pure rm in belief and understanding has penetrated the teaching of emptiness and has deeply entered meditation he will then gather the assembly of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas together and teach this sutra to them 
In this world there is no second vehicle through which one can attain parinirvāṇa only through the single buddha vehicle can one attain it 
You should know O monks that the Tathāgata through skillful means deeply penetrates the dispositions of sentient beings Knowing their inclination toward the inferior teachings and that they are deeply attached to the desires of the ve senses he teaches nirvana for their sake 
If they listen they will accept it Suppose in a desolate fearful place there were a dangerous road ve hundred yojanas long 
There is a large group that wants to travel along this road to reach a place where there is great treasure 
They have a leader who is wise and penetrating and who knows the passable and impassable parts of this dangerous road very well Although he wants to guide these people past the danger they become exhausted along the way 
Addressing the leader they say We are extremely tired and frightened We cannot go any further 
We are still far away from our destination and we want to turn back The leader knowing many skillful means thinks These people are to be pitied How could they want to turn back and abandon the great treasure 
After thinking this the leader through his skillful means magically creates a city three hundred yojanas away along the dangerous road He addresses the people saying Do not be frightened Do not turn back 
You may now stay in this great city and be at your leisure 
If you enter this city you can be comfortable and at ease 
Once you are able to go on and reach the treasure site then you can depart once more Then the exhausted people rejoice greatly and praise this unprecedented experience saying We are now free of this evil road and will be comfortable and at ease Then they proceed to the apparitional city and enter it 
Then the leader realizes that they are rested and their fatigue has gone 
He immediately makes the apparitional city vanish and says to the people All of you come along The treasure site is near 
I made that great apparitional city only in order to let you rest O monks 
The Tathāgata is exactly like this Now for your sake he has become a great leader who knows the long dangerous and evil road of birth death and desires confusion You should leave it and be saved 
If sentient beings hear only about the single buddha vehicle they will then want neither to see nor approach a buddha They will think that the buddha path is long and attainable only after enduring severe and protracted suffering The Buddha knowing their minds knowing that they are weakwilled and of lowly aspiration teaches them the two nirvanas through skillful means in order to let them rest halfway to the goal 
If there are sentient beings who abide in either of these two stages the Tathāgata immediately teaches What you have accomplished is not complete The stage you abide in is close to the wisdom of the buddhas You should observe and consider that the nirvana you have obtained is not the true one 
It is only through the power of the Tathāgatas skillful means that the single buddha vehicle is explained as three The Buddha is just like that leader who conjured a great apparitional city to let the people rest 
Knowing that they were rested he addressed them saying The treasure site is near This city is not real 
It is only my invention Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses The Buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū sat On the terrace of enlightenment for ten kalpas But still the Dharma of the buddhas Did not appear to him And he did not attain the buddha path 
The devas nāga kings asuras and others Constantly rained down heavenly owers In order to pay homage to that buddha 
The devas beat heavenly drums And played various kinds of music The fragrant winds blew the withered owers away And then they rained down fresh beautiful ones 
After ten intermediate kalpas had passed He then attained the buddha path And all the devas and humans Became joyful and ecstatic 
The sixteen princes of that buddha Surrounded by thousands of Myriads of koṭis of attendants Came to the place where the Buddha was Having bowed until their foreheads touched his feet They requested him to turn the wheel of the Dharma Saying O Noble Lion Fill us and everyone else with the rain of the Dharma 
The palaces of the Brahmas in the ve hundred Myriads of koṭis of lands in the east Were illuminated as never before 
All of the Brahmas seeing this phenomenon Came to the place where the Buddha was They reverently scattered owers And offered him their palaces Requesting the Buddha To turn the wheel of the Dharma They praised him in verse 
The Buddha knew that the right time Had not yet arrived And although he had been asked He sat in silence 
The other three directions the four remaining quarters And the upper and lower regions were all like this All the Brahmas scattered owers Offered their palaces and requested the Buddha To turn the wheel of the Dharma Saying It is extremely difcult to meet a Bhagavat We entreat you to open wide the gate to immortality And turn the wheel of the highest Dharma Through your great compassion 
You should know about such miseries When the Buddha expounded this teaching Six hundred myriads of koṭis of trillions of people Attained the complete extinction of all suffering And became arhats 
At the time of the second teaching Thousands of myriads of people Equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River Unattached to any existent thing Also attained arhatship 
After that an incalculable number Of beings attained the path Even if one were to count For myriads of koṭis of kalpas One could not nish counting their number 
Then the sixteen princes renounced Household life and became śrāmaṇeras They all asked the Buddha to expound The teaching of the Mahayana saying Let us and all of our attendants Attain the buddha path We entreat you to let us obtain The Bhagavats eye of wisdom supreme in purity 
Explaining the true teaching And the path to be practiced by the bodhisattvas He taught this Lotus Sutra in verses Equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River 
After the Buddha taught this sutra He entered meditation in a quiet place And sat with complete concentration in the same spot For eightyfour thousand kalpas 
Those śrāmaṇeras knowing that the Buddha Had not arisen from meditation Taught the highest wisdom of the buddhas To immeasurable koṭis of beings 
Each sat on the Dharma seat And explained this Mahayana sutra After the great parinirvāṇa of that buddha They propagated the Dharma and inspired others 
Each śrāmaṇera saved Six hundred myriads of koṭis of sentient beings Equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River 
Those who heard the teaching After the Buddhas parinirvāṇa Were always born together with their teachers In various other buddha lands 
These sixteen śrāmaṇeras Completely cultivated the buddha path And now in the ten directions They have attained highest complete enlightenment 
Then those who heard the Dharma In the presence of each of these buddhas And those who are in the śrāvaka stage Will gradually be taught the buddha path 
I am one of the sixteen I have also taught you in the past Therefore through skillful means I will now also lead you to the goal Which is the wisdom of the buddhas 
Through these former causes and conditions I will now teach the Lotus Sutra In order to let you enter the buddha path Do not be worried or frightened 
Suppose there were a dangerous road In a deserted wasteland far away Where there are many harmful beasts There is neither water nor grass It is a fearful place for human beings 
Innumerable thousands of myriads of beings Wish to pass along this dangerous way But that road is very long Some ve hundred yojanas 
Then there is a leader Endowed with deep wisdom and knowledge Discerning and resolute Who saves the people from various calamities When they meet with danger 
The people all get tired And address the leader saying We are all now totally exhausted We want to turn back from here The leader thinks 
He immediately thinks of skillful means And how he should now use his transcendent powers And he makes a great apparitional city With houses adorned and surrounded With gardens moats and ponds There are fortied gates and tall towers And it is full of men and women When the apparition is complete He immediately consoles the people saying 
Do not be afraid When you enter the city You can each do as you please All the people enter the city They are very happy and feel at ease Thinking they have been saved 
When the leader knows they are rested He gathers them together and addresses them saying You should now proceed For this is just an apparitional city 
Seeing that you were extremely fatigued And that you wanted to turn back After coming halfway I made this apparitional city through skillful means 
You should now strive To reach the treasure site together I am exactly like this I am the leader of all 
Perceiving that those seeking the way Have become timid have stopped halfway And are unable to walk to the end of the dangerous road Of birth death and desires confusion I use skillful means and teach nirvana So that they may rest saying 
You have extinguished suffering And you have completed what must be done Knowing that they have reached nirvana And attained arhatship the Buddha immediately Gathers the great assembly together And teaches the True Dharma 
All the buddhas explain and teach The three vehicles through skillful means Although there is only the single buddha vehicle They teach two in order to provide a place of rest 
For your benet I now teach the truth What you have attained is not the ultimate goal You must call forth great efforts In order to obtain the omniscience of a buddha 
If you attain omniscience And the qualities of the Buddha Such things as the ten powers And become endowed with the thirtytwo marks Then you will have attained the ultimate goal 
The buddhas the Leaders teach nirvana In order to let beings rest in comfort When they know that they have rested They lead them to the wisdom of the buddhas 
The Five Hundred Disciples Receive Their Predictions At that time Pūrṇa the son of Maitrāyaṇī after hearing the Buddha teach the Dharma according to what is appropriate to sentient beings through the wisdom of skillful means and bestow the prediction of highest complete enlightenment on all the great disciples and then hearing stories about past causes and conditions and that all the buddhas have obtained perfect mastery of transcendent powers obtained an unprecedented experience and became pure in mind and joyful 
He immediately rose from his seat went into the presence of the Buddha bowed until his forehead touched the Buddhas feet and then stood to one side gazing unwaveringly at the Buddha and thought this The Bhagavat is truly marvelous His actions are rare 
He teaches the Dharma according to the natural capacities of the beings in the world through skillful means wisdom and insight He leads sentient beings away from their various attachments 
We have no words to describe the Buddhas qualities Only the Buddha the Bhagavat is able to know our deep intentions and original vow 
Then the Buddha addressed the monks saying Do you see Pūrṇa the son of Maitrāyaṇī 
I always praise him as the foremost among the teachers of the Dharma I also always praise his various qualities He diligently maintains and propagates my teaching and is able to gladden and benet the fourfold assembly He interprets the True Dharma of the buddhas perfectly and greatly benets those who practice the pure path of discipline and integrity together with him 
With the exception of the Tathāgata no one else explains the doctrine more eloquently 
You must not think that Pūrṇa is only now able to protect and propagate my teaching He also protected and propagated the True Dharma of the buddhas in the presence of ninety koṭis of buddhas in the past when he was always the foremost among the teachers of the Dharma 
Moreover he was completely versed in the teaching of emptiness that the buddhas taught and attained the fourfold unobstructed wisdom He has always been able to teach the Dharma clearly and purely He never had any doubts and was endowed with the transcendent powers of the bodhisattvas Throughout each life he always practiced the pure path of discipline and integrity 
The people who lived in the same buddha world all thought he really was a śrāvaka yet Pūrṇa beneted immeasurable hundreds of thousands of sentient beings through this skillful means and also led and inspired immeasurable incalculable numbers of beings and caused them to attain highest complete enlightenment 
In order to purify the buddha land he always did what the buddhas have done and led and inspired sentient beings O monks 
Pūrṇa also was able to become the foremost among the teachers of the Dharma under the past seven buddhas and he is also the foremost of those who preach the Dharma under me He will also be the foremost among the teachers of the Dharma under the future buddhas in this auspicious kalpa 
He will protect and propagate the BuddhaDharma and also in the future he will protect and propagate the Dharma of incalculable limitless buddhas He will lead inspire and benet incalculable sentient beings and cause them to attain highest complete enlightenment 
In order to purify the buddha lands he will always be diligent and persevering leading and inspiring sentient beings 
He will gradually perfect the bodhisattva path and after immeasurable incalculable kalpas he will attain highest complete enlightenment in this land He will be called Dharmaprabhāsa a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
That Buddhas land will consist of all the worlds in the great manifold cosmos equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River The earth will be made of the seven treasures and it will be level just like the palm of ones hand There will be no mountains valleys or hollow places This land will be lled with towers of the seven treasures 
There will be no troubled states of being nor any women All the sentient beings will be born here spontaneously without any sexual desires 
They will attain great transcendent powers emit rays of light from their bodies and y freely through the air These beings will be rm in recollection persevering and wise They will all be of golden hue and adorned with the thirtytwo marks 
The sentient beings in that land will always eat two meals one being the meal of delight in the Dharma and the other the meal of pleasure in meditation 
There will be immeasurable incalculable thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of bodhisattvas who have attained great transcendent powers and the fourfold unobstructed wisdom They will be able skillfully to lead and inspire sentient beings 
The number of śrāvakas there will be impossible to calculate They will all perfect the six transcendent powers the three sciences and the eight liberations 
Such will be the immeasurable merits of this buddhas land being perfect in adornment 
The kalpa will be called Ratnāva bhāsa and his land will be called Suviśuddha 
This buddhas lifespan will last for immeasurable incalculable kalpas and the Dharma will abide for a very long time 
After the parinirvāṇa of that buddha stupas of the seven treasures will be erected everywhere throughout the land Then the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses O monks Listen carefully 
The path that the heir of the buddhas Has practiced by learning skillful means Cannot be conceived 
Because the bodhisattvas know That sentient beings long for inferior teachings And are afraid of great knowledge They make themselves either śrāvakas Or pratyekabuddhas They inspire those sentient beings Using innumerable skillful means saying 
We are śrāvakas and still very far away From attaining the buddha path They save immeasurable sentient beings All of whom they cause to attain perfection And they even cause those who are lazy Or who have lowly intentions Gradually to become buddhas 
These beings secretly carry out the bodhisattva practice While outwardly calling themselves śrāvakas Having little desire Their thoughts xed on birth and death They in fact purify the buddha lands 
These bodhisattvas show sentient beings That they have the three poisons And further they reveal the mark of false views In this way my disciples save Sentient beings through skillful means 
If I fully disclosed That they had taken on various forms The sentient beings hearing this Would immediately become doubtful 
This Pūrṇa has now practiced the path Under thousands of koṭis of buddhas in the past And he has propagated and protected The teaching of these buddhas 
Seeking the highest wisdom Under all these buddhas He showed that he was the foremost Among the disciples And that he was knowledgeable and wise 
Fearless in his teaching He was able to gladden the people He never tired in performing The actions of a buddha 
He has already attained the great transcendent powers And is endowed with the fourfold unobstructed wisdom Knowing whether the faculties Of sentient beings are sharp or dull He always teaches the pure Dharma 
Expounding such doctrines as these He has taught thousands of koṭis of beings And by making them abide in the Mahayana teaching He himself has puried his buddha land 
In the future he will also pay homage to Incalculable innumerable buddhas Protect and propagate the True Dharma And also purify his buddha land 
He will always fearlessly teach the Dharma Using his skillful means Save incalculable sentient beings And enable them to achieve omniscience 
Paying homage to all the Tathāgatas And preserving the treasure house of the Dharma He will eventually become the Buddha Called Dharmaprabhāsa 
His land will be called Suviśuddha Which will consist of the seven treasures His kalpa will be called Ratnāvabhāsa 
There will be a large number of bodhisattvas there Numbering immeasurable koṭis His buddha land will be lled With bodhisattvas who have attained Great transcendent powers And are endowed with dignity 
There will also be innumerable śrāvakas Who have perfected the three sciences The eight liberations And the fourfold unobstructed wisdom Such beings as these will form the sangha 
The sentient beings in his land Will have already cut themselves off from sexual desires Everyone there will thus be pure and born spontaneously With bodies adorned with the thirtytwo marks 
They will feast on delight in the Dharma And pleasure in meditation Never thinking of eating anything else 
There will be neither women Nor troubled states of existence 
The qualities of the monk Pūrṇa Will be completely perfected And there will be many wise people In this pure land 
I am now only briey explaining These immeasurable things 
Thereupon there were twelve hundred arhats who had attained complete mental discipline who thought this We have joyfully attained an unprecedented experience 
If the Bhagavat would give each of us a prediction like those he has given the other great disciples we would be overjoyed The Buddha knowing their minds addressed Mahākāśyapa saying 
I shall now bestow the prediction of highest complete enlightenment one by one on these twelve hundred arhats who are in my presence 
My great disciple the monk jñātakauṇḍinya who is in this assembly will pay homage to sixtytwo thousands of koṭis of buddhas He will thereafter become the buddha called Samanta prabha a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
The ve hundred arhats beginning with Uruvilvakāśyapa Gayākāśyapa Nadīkāśyapa Kālodāyin Udāyin Aniruddha Revata Kapphiṇa Bakkula Cunda Svāgata and the others will all attain highest complete enlightenment 
They will all have the same name that of Samantaprabha Then the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate the meaning of this further spoke these verses The monk Kauṇḍinya Will meet immeasurable buddhas And after incalculable kalpas have passed He will attain perfect enlightenment 
He will always emit a great ray of light And will be endowed with transcendent powers His fame will spread universally Throughout the ten directions He will be honored by all beings And will always teach the highest path He will therefore be called Samantaprabha 
His land will be pure And the bodhisattvas there Will all be of great vigor They will all ascend marvelous towers And roam in the lands of the ten directions They will present the most excellent offerings To all of the buddhas 
After having shown their reverence in this way They will be full of great joy And immediately return to their own lands Such will be their transcendent powers 
The lifespan of this buddha Will be sixty thousand kalpas And the True Dharma will last Twice as long as his lifespan The Semblance Dharma Will last twice as long as this When the Dharma disappears The devas and humans will grieve 
Those ve hundred monks Will become buddhas each in their turn All having the same name Samantaprabha They will give predictions One after the other saying 
After my parinirvāṇa Soandso will become a buddha The world he inspires Will be exactly like mine today 
The embellishments of their lands All the transcendent powers The assembly of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas The True and Semblance Dharma The lifespan and duration of the kalpa Will be just as I explained before 
O Kāśyapa You now know That the ve hundred arhats Whose minds are free And the remaining śrāvakas Will also be exactly like this You should teach those Who are not in this assembly 
Thereupon the ve hundred arhats having obtained their predictions from the Buddha were joyful and ecstatic They rose from their seats approached the Buddha bowed until their foreheads touched his feet repented of their faults and reproached themselves saying 
We have always thought we had attained complete nirvana We now realize that we were ignorant 
Why is this 
We should have attained the wisdom of the Tathāgatas Yet we were satised with little wisdom 
Suppose there were a man who came to the house of a close friend and went to sleep after becoming intoxicated with wine 
The intimate friend having to go out on ofcial business sews a priceless jewel into the inside of his friends garment and giving it to him leaves 
But the man who was drunk and asleep is totally unaware of this 
After getting up he leaves and roams around until he arrives in another country 
Although he diligently seeks for food and clothing they are very difcult to obtain 
He is satised if he just obtains a very meager amount 
Later on the intimate friend happens to meet this man Seeing him he says 
How have you come to this state through lack of food and clothing 
Once on suchandsuch a day in suchandsuch a month and year I sewed a priceless jewel into the inside of your garment wanting to make things easier for you and to let you enjoy the desires of the ve senses as much as you wished 
It is still there although you arent aware of it and you seek your livelihood with great effort and hardship You have been very foolish 
Sell this jewel and use it to buy what you need From now on you will know neither poverty nor want and can live as you wish The Buddha is exactly like this When he was a bodhisattva he aroused in us the aspiration for omniscience 
Nevertheless we forgot we did not know or understand 
We attained the path of the arhats and considered that we had attained nirvana It was very hard for us to support ourselves and we were satised with little 
But we never fully lost our wish for allknowledge 
Now the Bhagavat perceiving our minds has said this O monks 
What you have attained is not the complete nirvana 
For a long time I have made you plant the various roots of good merit of a buddha and shown you the marks of nirvana through skillful means That is why you consider yourselves to have actually attained nirvana O Bhagavat 
We now know that we are actually bodhisattvas and will obtain a prediction of highest complete enlightenment 
For this reason we are extremely happy at having obtained such an unprecedented experience At that time jñātakauṇḍinya and the others wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses We have heard his voice Giving the prediction of utmost ease Rejoicing in this unprecedented experience We bow to the Buddha whose wisdom is immeasurable 
We now repent of our faults In the presence of the Bhagavat Although we had attained Only a small measure of nirvana Out of the immeasurable treasures of the Buddha We were selfsatised Just like ignorant fools 
Suppose there were a poor man Who went to the house of a close friend Whose family was very wealthy He was entertained with a feast And had a priceless jewel sewn To the inside of his garment The wealthy friend made him this gift Without saying anything and went away The poor man had fallen asleep And did not know of this 
Shortly afterward this man gets up And after wandering around Arrives in another country He manages to seek out Enough food and clothing to live But has great difculty in supporting himself Yet he is satised to obtain a little And does not desire anything better 
He is still unaware of the priceless jewel Sewn inside his garment 
The intimate friend who gave him the jewel Meets this poor man later And bitterly reproaches him Showing him the jewel That had been sewn into his garment 
The poor man seeing this jewel rejoices greatly And with this rich treasure he enjoys To his satisfaction the desires of the ve senses We are exactly like this 
For a long time the Bhagavat Has led and inspired us Through his compassion And planted in us the highest aspiration 
Because we were ignorant We neither noticed nor knew We were satised with attaining Only a small measure of nirvana And did not seek for the rest 
Now the Buddha has enlightened us saying This is not the real nirvana Attaining the highest wisdom of the buddhas Is indeed the only real nirvana 
Now having heard the predictions from the Buddha And of the adorned lands And the subsequent predictions We universally rejoice in body and mind 
The Predictions for Those Who Still Have More to Learn and for Those Who Do Not At that time nanda and Rāhula thought this 
The delight we would feel if we were to receive our predictions is constantly before our minds Then arising from their seats and going into the presence of the Buddha they bowed until their foreheads touched his feet and spoke to him in unison saying 
We should also be qualied to receive our predictions Both of us take refuge only in the Tathāgata 
Moreover we are well known by the devas humans and asuras throughout the entire world nanda has always attended the Tathāgata preserving the treasure house of the Dharma and Rāhula is the son of the Buddha 
If the Buddha would bestow upon us the prediction of highest complete enlightenment then our vows would be fullled and our wishes also realized Then two thousand disciples śrāvakas some who still had more to learn and some who did not all arose from their seats and with their right shoulders bared went into the presence of the Buddha Attentively with palms pressed together they gazed at the Bhagavat all having the same wish as nanda and Rāhula and stood to one side 
Then the Buddha addressed nanda saying In the future world you will become a buddha called Sāgara dharabuddhivikrīḍitarājābhijña a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
You will pay homage to sixtytwo koṭis of buddhas preserve the treasure house of the Dharma and ultimately attain highest complete enlightenment 
Further you will inspire twenty thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattvas equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River causing them to attain highest complete enlightenment 
Your land will be called Avanāmitavaijayantā It will be pure and the earth will be made of lapis lazuli 
The lifespan of this buddha will be for immeasurable incalculable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas Their number would be incalculable even if one were to count for immeasurable innumerable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas 
The True Dharma will abide in the world twice as long as his lifespan and the Semblance Dharma will abide in the world twice as long as the True Dharma 
O nanda 
The virtues of this buddha Sāgaradhara buddhi vikrīḍita rājābhijña will be praised by immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddha Tathāgatas in the ten directions equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River Thereupon the Tathāgata wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses I now tell the assembly That nanda the preserver of the Dharma Will pay homage to the buddhas And ultimately attain complete enlightenment 
His land will be pure And called Avanāmitavaijayantā He will lead and inspire bodhisattvas In numbers equal to the sands of the Ganges River 
This buddha will be endowed With great virtue and dignity and his fame Will ll the ten directions 
His lifespan will be immeasurable Due to his compassion for sentient beings The True Dharma will abide Twice as long as his lifespan And the Semblance Dharma will abide Twice as long as the True Dharma 
Countless sentient beings Within the Dharma of this buddha Equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River Will plant the seed of the buddha path At that time the eight thousand bodhisattvas in the assembly in whom the thought of enlightenment had recently awakened all thought this Since we have never heard the great bodhisattvas receive predictions like this why should the śrāvakas now obtain it Then the Bhagavat knowing what the bodhisattvas were thinking spoke to them saying 
The thought of highest complete enlightenment once awoke simultaneously in nanda and myself in the presence of the Buddha Dharma gaganābhyudgatarāja 
nanda always wanted to hear a great deal about the Dharma and I always made diligent efforts For this reason I was shortly able to attain highest complete enlightenment whereas nanda preserves my teaching and in the future will uphold the treasure house of the Dharma of all the buddhas He will lead inspire and perfect the bodhisattvas 
Since this was his original vow he has obtained this prediction nanda while facing the Buddha in the audience heard his own prediction and about the adornments of his land His vow fullled he rejoiced greatly at attaining such an unprecedented experience 
With his unobstructed penetration he immediately remembered the treasure house of the Dharma of the past immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas as if he had just heard of it today and he also became aware of his original vow 
Thereupon nanda spoke these verses The Bhagavat is truly extraordinary He has enabled me to recollect the Dharma Of incalculable numbers of buddhas of the past Just as if I had rst heard of the matter today 
I now have no further doubts I am established in the buddha path I have become an attendant of the Tathāgata And as an attendant I will preserve The Dharma of all the buddhas using skillful means 
Then the Buddha addressed Rāhula saying In the future you will become a buddha called Saptaratnapadmavikrama a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
You will pay homage to the Buddha Tathāgatas whose number is equal to that of the grains of dust in the ten worlds and you will always become the eldest son of all the buddhas just as you are my eldest son now 
The adornments of the land the number of disciples led and inspired the duration of the True and Semblance Dharma of this buddha Saptaratnapadmavikrama will be just like those of the Buddha Sāgaradharabuddhi vikrīḍitarājābhijña without the slightest difference 
You will also become the eldest son of this buddha and after that attain highest complete enlightenment At that time the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses When I was a prince Rāhula was my eldest son And now that I have perfected the buddha path He accepts my teaching as the heir of the Dharma 
In the future he will meet Immeasurable koṭis of buddhas Becoming the eldest son of all these buddhas He will wholeheartedly seek The buddha path 
Only I am able to discern Rāhulas unseen practice But now that he has become my eldest son He reveals it to the sentient beings 
His thousands of myriads Of koṭis of merits are uncountable and incalculable He will become established in the BuddhaDharma And seek the highest path 
Then the Bhagavat perceived that the minds of those two thousand people some of whom had more to learn and some of whom did not were sincere mild and receptive They were all attentively gazing at the Buddha 
The Buddha said to nanda Do you not see these two thousand people some of whom have more to learn and some of whom do not nanda replied Yes I see them The Buddha said 
O nanda 
All of these people will pay homage to the Buddha Tathāgatas whose number is equal to that of the grains of dust in fty worlds They will respect honor and preserve the treasure house of the Dharma and will later all become buddhas simultaneously in the worlds of the ten directions They will all have the same name Ratnaketurāja a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
Their lifespans will last one kalpa 
The adornments of their lands the number of śrāvakas and bodhisattvas and the duration of the True and Semblance Dharma will be the same for all Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
Now in my presence These two thousand śrāvakas Have all received their predictions In the future they will all become buddhas 
The buddhas they will revere Will be equal to the number of grains of dust Just as mentioned above Preserving this treasure house of the Dharma They will later attain complete enlightenment 
They will all have the same name And dwell in the lands of the ten directions All sitting at the exact same time On the terrace of enlightenment They will attain the highest wisdom All of them will be called Ratnaketurāja 
Their lands the number of disciples Duration of the True and Semblance Dharma Will all be the same without any difference 
Moreover through their transcendent powers They will save sentient beings Throughout the ten directions Their fame will spread universally And they will gradually enter nirvana 
Then the two thousand people some of whom had more to learn and some of whom did not having heard their predictions from the Buddha rejoiced ecstatically and spoke in verse O Bhagavat the Light of Wisdom We have just heard you give us our predictions And our minds are full of joy Just as if we had been sprinkled With the Dharma of immortality 
The Expounder of the Dharma Thereupon the Bhagavat by addressing Bodhisattva Bhaiṣa jyarāja Medicine King through him addressed eighty thousand mahā sattvas saying 
O Bhaiṣajyarāja In this assembly do you see innumerable humans and nonhumans such as devas nāga kings yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas monks nuns laymen and laywomen those seeking the śrāvaka vehicle the pratyekabuddha vehicle and the buddha path If in the presence of the Buddha any beings such as these hear a single verse or line of the Lotus Sutra and thereupon have even one thought of rejoicing in it I will bestow upon them my prediction that they will attain highest complete enlightenment The Buddha addressed Bhaiṣajyarāja saying 
If after the parinirvāṇa of the Tathāgata any being hears even a single verse or line of the Lotus Sutra and thereupon has even one thought of rejoicing in it I will bestow upon them the prediction that they will attain highest complete enlightenment 
If there is anyone who preserves recites explains or copies even a single verse of the Lotus Sutra or who respects this sutra as if it were a buddha or who reverently offers it various owers perfumes necklaces fragrant ointments scented powders burning incense canopies ags banners clothing or music or who simply honors it with his palms pressed together know O Bhaiṣa jyarāja that this person has already paid homage to tens of myriads of koṭis of buddhas of the past 
If anyone should ask you what kind of sentient being will become a buddha in the future you should inform them that it is those of this kind who will denitely become buddhas in the future Why is this 
If there are any sons or daughters of a virtuous family who preserve recite explain and copy even a single line of the Lotus Sutra or who pay homage to this sutra with various offerings of owers perfumes necklaces scented powders and ointments burning incense canopies ags banners clothing or music or who honor it with their palms pressed together such people should be respected by the entire world They should be revered in the same way as the Tathāgata is revered 
Know that these people are great bodhisattvas who are to attain highest complete enlightenment Out of their compassion for sentient beings they wish to be born among them in order to expound and explain the Lotus Sutra far and wide How much more to be honored are those who completely preserve the entire sutra and pay homage to it with various offerings O Bhaiṣajyarāja 
You should know that after my parinirvāṇa these people will set aside the rewards of their pure karma and be born in the troubled world out of their compassion for sentient beings and in order to expound this sutra far and wide 
After my pari nirvāṇa if there are any sons and daughters of a virtuous family who expound even a single line of the Lotus Sutra in private to even a single person they should be acknowledged as the ambassadors of the Tathāgata 
They have been dispatched by the Tathāgata and carry out the Tathāgatas work As for those who extensively teach among the common people know that they are yet greater ambassadors 
O Bhaiṣajyarāja if there are erring people during a kalpa those with troubled thoughts who always disparage the Buddha in his presence their fault is nonetheless slight 
Yet if there are those who disparage the laity or ordained people who recite the Lotus Sutra even with a single evil word their fault is extremely grave 
Know that those who recite this Lotus Sutra adorn themselves with the adornments of a buddha This means that they will carry the Tathāgata on their shoulders and pay him homage wherever they go 
They should be respected revered honored and praised wholeheartedly with palms pressed together through offerings of owers perfumes necklaces scented powders ointments burning incense canopies ags banners clothing delicious food music and the best offerings that people can make They should have heavenly jewels scattered upon them and offered to them 
Why is this 
Because these people joyfully expound the Dharma and those who hear it even for an instant will fully attain highest complete enlightenment Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate upon the meaning of this further spoke these verses Those who want to abide in the buddha path And perfect the wisdom of the Selfgenerated One Should always diligently pay homage To those who preserve the Lotus Sutra 
Those who want to quickly attain omniscience Should hold to this sutra And pay homage to those who preserve it 
Know that anyone who preserves the Lotus Sutra Is an ambassador of the Buddha Who feels compassion for sentient beings 
Those who preserve the Lotus Sutra Were born here in this world Withholding themselves from the Pure Land Out of their compassion for sentient beings 
Know that such people are born Where and when they will They are born in this troubled world To extensively expound the highest Dharma 
Such expounders of the Dharma should be revered With offerings of divine owers perfumes Heavenly jeweled clothing and exquisite celestial jewels 
Those who preserve this sutra In the troubled world after my parinirvāṇa Should be paid homage with palms pressed together Just as one pays homage to the Bhagavat 
These heirs of the buddhas should be revered With delicious food various delicacies And a variety of clothing in the hope of hearing The teaching even for an instant 
If in the future there is anyone Who preserves this sutra I will dispatch him to the world of humans To carry out the Tathāgatas task 
If throughout one entire kalpa There is anyone with erring thoughts Who always disparages the Buddha With an angry countenance the consequences of His grave errors will be incalculable 
If there is anyone who speaks A hostile word even for an instant About those who recite and preserve this Lotus Sutra His fault will be even greater 
If throughout one entire kalpa There are people seeking for the buddha path Who praise the Buddha in my presence With incalculable numbers of verses And with palms pressed together The merits they attain will be immeasurable Because of praising this buddha 
You must pay tribute to those who preserve the sutra Throughout eighty koṭis of kalpas With the best objects sounds Fragrances avors and materials 
If you are able to hear the teaching for even a moment After having paid tribute in this way You will then become delighted thinking I have now attained great benets 
O Bhaiṣajyarāja I now tell you that I have taught many sutras Among these sutras however The Lotus Sutra is the utmost and best 
Then the Buddha spoke further to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja saying There are immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of sutras I have taught in the past which I teach now and which I will teach in the future Among them however this Lotus Sutra is the most difcult to accept and to understand O Bhaiṣajyarāja 
This sutra is the treasure house of the hidden essence of all the buddhas It must not be distributed or heedlessly bestowed upon the people 
Since times long past all the Buddha Bhagavats have protected it and have never openly taught it 
Moreover people show great hostility to this sutra even in the presence of the Tathāgata 
O Bhaiṣajyarāja You should know that after the parinirvāṇa of the Tathāgata those who copy preserve recite and revere this sutra and expound it for the sake of others will be clothed with the Tathāgatas garments and treasured by the present buddhas of the other directions 
Such people will have the power of great faith the power of aspiration as well as the power of the roots of good merit 
You should know that these people have dwelled together with the Tathāgata and his hand has caressed their heads 
O Bhaiṣajyarāja Wherever this sutra is taught read recited copied or wherever it is to be found one should build a sevenjeweled stupa of great height and width and richly ornamented There is no need to put a relic inside 
Why is this 
Because the Tathāgata is already in it 
This stupa should be respected honored praised and rendered homage with offerings of all kinds of owers perfumes necklaces canopies ags banners music and songs 
If there is anyone able to see this stupa and to pay it homage and honor it know that such a one is nearing highest complete enlightenment O Bhaiṣajyarāja 
Among the many people either among the laity or the ordained who practice the bodhisattva path if they are unable to see hear recite copy preserve and pay homage to this Lotus Sutra know that they are people who are not yet properly practicing the bodhisattva path 
If anyone is able to hear this sutra such a one is skillfully practicing the bodhisattva path 
Among sentient beings seeking the buddha path if there are those who see or hear this Lotus Sutra and after hearing it are drawn to it and preserve it know that they are those who are approaching highest complete enlightenment O Bhaiṣajyarāja 
Suppose there were a thirsty man seeking water He drills in search of water on a high plain yet he sees only dry earth and thus realizes that water is still far away 
But he does not cease his efforts until he turns up moist earth and gradually reaches mud Now he is sure that water must be near 
The bodhisattvas are exactly like this If they have not yet heard understood or been able to practice this Lotus Sutra they should be known as people who are still far away from highest complete enlightenment 
If they hear understand contemplate and are able to practice it they realize that they are certainly nearing highest complete enlightenment 
Why is this 
Because the highest complete enlightenment of all the bodhisattvas is within this sutra This sutra opens the gate of skillful means and reveals the marks of the truth 
The treasure house of this Lotus Sutra is deep and remote No one is able to discover its depths That is why the Buddha now reveals it inspiring and perfecting the bodhisattvas 
O Bhaiṣajyarāja If there are bodhisattvas who hear this Lotus Sutra and are confused and frightened know that they are bodhisattvas in whom the thought of enlightenment has only recently awakened 
If there are śrāvakas who hear this sutra and are confused and frightened know that they are people who have excessive pride 
O Bhaiṣajyarāja If there are any sons and daughters of a virtuous family who after the parinirvāṇa of the Tathāgata want to teach this Lotus Sutra to the fourfold assembly how should they teach it 
These sons and daughters of a virtuous family after entering the abode of the Tathāgata wearing the Tathāgatas garments and sitting on his seat should then extensively teach this sutra to the fourfold assembly 
The Tathāgatas chamber is nothing but the great compassion toward all sentient beings 
The Tathāgatas garments are the thoughts of gentleness and perseverance and the Tathāgatas seat is the very emptiness of all existing things 
After settling among them one should tirelessly and extensively expound this Lotus Sutra for the sake of the bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly O Bhaiṣajyarāja 
I will dispatch transformed beings to other worlds who will gather the people together to hear the teaching I will also dispatch transformed monks nuns laymen and laywomen to hear this teaching All these transformed beings will hear the Dharma believe and accept it and not reject it 
If an expounder of the Dharma resides in a secluded place I will then dispatch many devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas and asuras to hear his teaching 
Although I will be in a different land I will periodically let the expounders of the Dharma see me 
If they forget a line of this sutra I will explain it again enabling them to master it Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses If you wish to rid yourself of idleness You should listen to this sutra This sutra is rarely heard And it is also difcult to accept 
Suppose there were a thirsty man Seeking for water by drilling Into the earth on a high plain He sees only dry earth and knows That water is still far away 
He gradually sees The moist earth turn into mud And knows with certainty That water is near O Bhaiṣajyarāja 
You should know that those people Who do not hear the Lotus Sutra Are very far away From the Buddhas wisdom If they hear this profound sutra Which brings resolution to the śrāvakas And if they hear this King of Sutras And attentively contemplate it Know that these people Are close to the Buddhas wisdom 
If people want to expound this sutra They should enter the Tathāgatas chamber Put on the Tathāgatas garments And sit on the Tathāgatas seat They then should face the people without fear So that they may extensively Illuminate and explain it to the assembly 
The Tathāgatas chamber is great compassion His garments are gentleness and perseverance And his seat is the emptiness of all existent things After settling among them They should expound the Dharma 
Even if when they expound this sutra People disparage them with evil words Or attack them with swords sticks tiles or stones Being mindful of the Buddha They should persevere 
I will manifest my pure and solid form In thousands of myriads of koṭis of lands And teach the Dharma to sentient beings For immeasurable koṭis of kalpas 
If after my parinirvāṇa There is someone who is able to teach this sutra I will dispatch a transformed fourfold assembly Of monks nuns laymen and laywomen To pay homage to this expounder of the Dharma I will lead the sentient beings And gather them together To let them hear the teaching 
If anyone wishes to do ill to them With swords sticks tiles or stones Then I will dispatch those transformed ones In order to guard them 
If there is any expounder of the Dharma Who recites this sutra In a secluded tranquil place Where there is no sound of human beings I will then manifest my body of pure light 
If they forget a chapter or a verse I will teach it to them Enabling them to master it 
If anyone perfects these qualities If he teaches the fourfold assembly Or in a solitary place recites this sutra Such a person will be able to see me 
If anyone abides in a secluded place I will dispatch devas nāga kings Yakṣas and rākṣasas To be an audience to their teaching 
Such people teach the Dharma willingly And explain it without obstruction Because all the buddhas protect them They gladden the great community of people 
Anyone who closely attends an expounder of the Dharma Will immediately attain the bodhisattva path Anyone who follows this expounders instructions Will be able to meet buddhas Equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River 
The Appearance of a Jeweled Stupa At that time there appeared before the Buddha a sevenjeweled stupa ve hundred yojanas in height and two hundred and fty yojanas both in length and width which emerged from the ground and hovered in the air 
It was adorned with various jewels had ve thousand railings and thousands of myriads of chambers It was decorated with innumerable ags and banners and hanging jeweled necklaces and myriads of koṭis of jeweled bells hung from the top 
The fragrance of tamāla leaves and sandalwood trees exuded from all sides of the stupa covering the world 
The banners and umbrellas were composed of the seven jewels such as gold silver lapis lazuli motherofpearl agate pearl and ruby and they rose as high as the palaces of the worldprotectors of the four quarters 
The thirtythree devas rained down heavenly māndārava owers in homage to the jeweled stupa 
The other thousands of myriads of koṭis of humans and such nonhumans as devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and maho ragas also respected honored revered and praised the precious stupa by offering all kinds of owers perfumes necklaces ags banners and music Then a tremendous voice issued forth in praise from the jeweled stupa saying 
Splendid splendid O ākyamuni 
Just so 
Just so O ākyamuni Bhagavat 
What you teach is true Thereupon the fourfold assembly saw the great jeweled stupa hovering in the air and also heard the voice that issued forth from the stupa They all were pleased with the teaching and marveled at this unprecedented experience They stood up from their seats honored ākyamuni with their palms pressed together and withdrew to one side 
At that time there was a bodhisattva mahāsattva called Mahā pratibhāna who realizing that the devas humans and asuras of the entire world were puzzled addressed the Buddha saying 
Why has this jeweled stupa emerged from the earth 
And why has this voice come forth from it Then the Buddha told Bodhisattva Mahāpratibhāna The Tathāgata is in this jeweled stupa In the remote past immeasurable incalculable thousands of myriads of koṭis of worlds away in the east there was a land called Ratnaviśuddha In that land there was a buddha called Prabhūtaratna 
When this buddha was practicing the bodhisattva path in his previous lives he made a great vow saying If I become a buddha after my parinirvāṇa if the Lotus Sutra is being taught anywhere in all the lands of the ten directions my stupa shall appear there so that this sutra may be heard and in order that I may bear testimony to it and praise it with the word Splendid After the Buddha had perfected the path and immediately before his parinirvāṇa he addressed the monks among the great assembly of devas and humans saying After my parinirvāṇa anyone who wishes to pay me homage should build a great stupa If there is anyone teaching the Lotus Sutra anywhere in the worlds of the ten directions this buddha makes a jeweled stupa emerge out of the ground in that place through his transcendent powers and the power of his vow 
The Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna has now emerged from the earth within his stupa so that he may hear the Lotus Sutra and give praise with the words Splendid splendid At that time Bodhisattva Mahāpratibhāna spoke to the Buddha through the Tathāgatas transcendent powers saying 
We all want to see this buddhas form The Buddha answered Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mahāprati bhāna saying This Buddha Prabhūtaratna made a great vow saying Whenever my jeweled stupa appears in the presence of a buddha in order to hear the Lotus Sutra if that buddha wants to show my form to the fourfold assembly he should gather into one place all his magically created forms that are teaching the Dharma in the worlds of the ten directions After that my form will appear 
O Mahāpratibhāna I shall now gather all my magically created forms who are teaching the Dharma in the worlds of the ten directions Mahāpratibhāna spoke to the Buddha saying 
We also strongly wish to see the Bhagavats magically created forms to honor and pay homage to them Then the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows and they immediately saw the buddhas in ve hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands in the eastern direction equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River In these lands the soil was of crystal and adorned with treasure trees and jeweled garments and these lands were full of innumerable thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattvas Jeweled drapes were hung everywhere and were covered with jeweled nets 
All the buddhas in these lands were teaching the Dharma in most harmonious voices They also saw immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattvas lling all the lands and teaching the Dharma to sentient beings 
The other directions to the south north and west the four intermediary directions and the upper and lower regions were also illuminated by the ray of light emitted from the tuft of white hair between the Buddhas eyebrows and they were also exactly like this 
Then all the buddhas in the ten directions each addressed the assembly of bodhisattvas saying O sons of a virtuous family 
We will now go to the place where ākyamuni is in the sahā world and pay homage to the jeweled stupa of the Tathāgata Prabhūta ratna At that time the sahā world was immediately puried the earth was of lapis lazuli adorned with jeweled trees its roads laid out like a chessboard and bordered with golden cords and there were no villages towns cities oceans rivers mountains streams forests or groves 
Very precious incense was burning māndā rava owers were spread everywhere on the earth and it was covered with jeweled nets and drapes from which jeweled bells hung 
With the exception of this assembly the devas and human beings were all moved to other lands 
Then the buddhas each took one great bodhisattva as an attendant and arrived under a jeweled tree in the sahā world 
Each jeweled tree was ve hundred yojanas in height and adorned with branches leaves blossoms and fruits in their proper turn Under all these jeweled trees were lion seats ve yojanas in height that were adorned with great jewels 
The buddhas each sat crosslegged on these seats 
They sat one after another in this way lling the great manifold cosmos Yet the separate forms of ākyamuni Buddha of even one direction had not all arrived yet 
At that time ākyamuni Buddha wanting to be able to receive all of his magically created forms transformed and puried two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands in each of the worldsystems in the eight directions There were no hells hungry ghosts animals or asuras and all the devas and humans were moved to other lands 
In these transformed lands the earth was made of lapis lazuli and adorned with jeweled trees These trees were ve hundred yojanas in height and were adorned with branches leaves blossoms and fruits in their proper turn Under every tree was a jeweled lion seat ve yojanas in height which was adorned with various jewels 
There were no oceans rivers or great mountain kings such as Mount Mucilinda Mount Mahāmucilinda Mount Cakravāḍa Mount Mahācakravāḍa or Mount Sumeru The lands were all made into one buddha world throughout 
The jeweled earth was level and covered everywhere with jewelstudded drapes 
Banners and umbrellas were set up precious incense was burning and heavenly jeweled owers covered the ground everywhere 
Then ākyamuni Buddha again transformed and puried two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands in each of the eight directions so that the buddhas could come and sit There were no hells hungry ghosts animals or asuras and the devas and humans were moved to other lands 
In the transformed lands the earth was of lapis lazuli and adorned with jeweled trees The trees were ve hundred yojanas in height and were adorned with branches leaves blossoms and fruits in their proper turn Under these trees were jeweled lion seats that were ve yojanas in height and decorated with great jewels 
There were no oceans rivers or great mountain kings such as Mount Mucilinda Mount Mahāmucilinda Mount Cakravāḍa Mount Mahācakravāḍa or Mount Sumeru The lands were all made into one buddha world throughout 
The jeweled earth was level and covered everywhere with jewelstudded drapes 
Banners and umbrellas were set up precious incense was burning and heavenly jeweled owers covered the ground everywhere 
Then the magically created forms of ākyamuni Buddha which had been teaching the Dharma in the hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands in the east equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River gathered here 
In this way all the buddhas in the ten directions gradually came until all were assembled sitting in the eight directions 
At that time these Buddha Tathāgatas lled four hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands in each direction 
Then sitting on the lion seats under the jeweled trees the buddhas each dispatched their attendants with hands full of jeweled owers to inquire after the Buddha ākyamuni saying O son of a virtuous family 
You should approach the Buddha ākyamuni on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa and give him a greeting saying Are you without illness and pain and are you full of vigor and at ease and are the assemblies of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas all at ease or not 
Then having paid homage to the Buddha by scattering him with these jeweled owers say this to him The Buddha Soandso wishes you to open this jeweled stupa 
All the other buddhas dispatched their messengers like this Then the Buddha ākyamuni saw that his magically created forms had already gathered and were each sitting on a lion seat And he heard that all the buddhas also wanted him to open the treasured stupa 
Immediately rising he hovered in the air and the entire fourfold assembly rose and gazed attentively at the Buddha with their palms pressed together 
Thereupon ākyamuni Buddha opened the entrance to the sevenjeweled stupa with his right nger There was a tremendous sound as if the bar and lock to the gateway of a large city were being pushed aside 
Then immediately the entire gathering saw the Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna in the jeweled stupa sitting on a lion seat as if he were in meditation his body whole and undecomposed 
The Buddha ākyamuni is teaching the Lotus Sutra and I have come in order to hear it At that time the fourfold assembly saw the Buddha who had entered parinirvāṇa immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas ago speaking those words They praised this unprecedented experience and scattered heavenly jeweled owers upon the buddhas Prabhūtaratna and ākyamuni 
Then from within the stupa the Buddha Prabhūtaratna offered half of his seat to the Buddha ākyamuni saying 
O ākyamuni Buddha please take a seat here The Buddha ākyamuni immediately entered the stupa and sat crosslegged on half of the seat 
Thereupon the great assembly saw the two Tathāgatas sitting crosslegged on the lion seat in the sevenjeweled stupa and they each thought thus The buddhas are seated far away 
O Tathāgata we entreat you to use your transcendent powers so that we may be in the air together with you The Buddha ākyamuni immediately moved the entire fourfold assembly into the air through his transcendent powers and addressed them with a great voice saying Who in the sahā world is able to extensively teach the Lotus Sutra It is now the right time 
The Tathāgata will enter parinirvāṇa before long and the Buddha wants to transmit this Lotus Sutra to you 
Thereupon the Buddha wanting to further elaborate upon the meaning of this spoke these verses Although the Great Sage the Bhagavat Entered parinirvāṇa long ago He has been abiding in a jeweled stupa And he has now come for the sake of the Dharma 
Why is it that people Do not strive for the Dharma 
Although this buddha entered parinirvāṇa Incalculable kalpas ago Because it is difcult to encounter He listens to the Dharma Wherever it is taught 
The original vow of this buddha was After my parinirvāṇa I will always listen to the Dharma Wherever it may be 
My magically created forms Incalculable as the sands of the Ganges River Have come to hear the Dharma And see the Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna Who has entered nirvana 
Each buddhaform having abandoned his beautiful land Disciples devas humans nāgas And ritual tributes has come here So that the Dharma may abide forever 
In order to seat all these buddhas I transferred immeasurable beings And puried the lands Through my transcendent powers And each of these buddhas Settled under a jeweled tree As lotus blossoms Adorn a limpid cool pond 
Under every jeweled tree was a lion seat On which the buddhas sat radiating light As a great bonre Blazes in the dark of the night 
They emitted a subtle fragrance from their bodies Which lled the lands of the ten directions Sentient beings who smelled this fragrance Were overcome with unsurpassed joy Like branches of a small tree Being blown by a great wind 
Through this skillful means I enable the Dharma to abide forever 
I tell the great assembly That after my nirvana Whoever can preserve and recite this sutra Should now individually make a declaration In the presence of the buddhas 
Although the Buddha Prabhūtaratna Entered parinirvāṇa long ago Through his great vow He has roared the lions roar 
The Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna I myself and all the magically created forms Who have gathered here Should know this intention 
O heirs of the buddhas Whoever is able to preserve the Dharma Should make a great vow So that it may abide forever 
Whoever is able to preserve The teaching of this sutra Will thus honor me And Prabhūtaratna 
This Buddha Prabhūtaratna Always roams the ten directions In a jeweled stupa In order to hear this sutra 
He also honors All the transformed buddhas Who have come here and who adorn All the worlds with light 
Whoever teaches this sutra will see me The Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna And the transformed buddhas 
O sons of a virtuous family 
Each of you must carefully consider this This is indeed a difcult matter Make a great vow accordingly 
It is not really difcult To teach all of the other sutras The number of which is Equal to the sands of the Ganges River 
It is not difcult To take Mount Sumeru And throw it to another quarter Over innumerable buddha worlds 
It is also not difcult To shake free the manifold cosmos With one toe and throw it Far into another distant world 
It is not difcult to stand On the highest summit of the world And teach the other innumerable sutras For the sake of sentient beings 
However it will indeed be difcult To teach this sutra in the troubled world After the Buddhas nirvana 
It is not difcult for anyone To grasp empty space And wander around with it 
But it will certainly be difcult to copy And preserve this sutra And cause others to copy it After my nirvana 
It is not really difcult To put the great earth on a toenail And ascend with it To the world of Brahmas 
However it will indeed be difcult To recite this sutra Even for a moment In the troubled world After the Buddhas nirvana 
It is not really difcult To enter into the conagration At the time of the close of a kalpa Carrying hay on your back And yet not be burned 
It certainly will be difcult To preserve this sutra And teach it to even a single person After my nirvana 
It is indeed not really difcult for anyone to preserve The eightyfour thousand treasure houses of the Dharma And the twelvefold scriptures And teach them so that the listeners Can attain the six transcendent powers 
It will indeed be difcult for anyone To hear and accept this sutra And to ask about its meaning After my nirvana 
It is not really difcult for people to do Such benecial things as teaching the Dharma And making thousands of myriads of koṭis of Immeasurable incalculable sentient beings Numbering as many as the sands of the Ganges River Attain arhatship and perfect The six transcendent powers 
It will certainly be difcult To preserve such a sutra as this After my nirvana 
I have extensively taught many sutras In incalculable lands From the beginning until now For the sake of the buddha path And yet among them This sutra is the best 
If anyone preserves it He preserves the form of the Buddha 
O sons of a virtuous family 
Those who preserve and recite this Sutra After my nirvana Must now individually make a declaration In the presence of the buddhas 
It is hard to preserve this sutra If anyone preserves it Even for a single moment I shall truly rejoice All of the other buddhas Will do so also 
Such people as these Are praised by the buddhas 
They are courageous They are persevering They are known as those Who follow the rules of good conduct And carry out ascetic practices Subsequently they quickly attain The highest buddha path 
Those in the future Who recite and preserve this sutra Are the true heirs of the Buddha And abide in the stage of purity 
Those who can understand its meaning After the Buddhas nirvana Will become the Eyes of the World For devas and humans 
Those who teach it even for a moment In the fearful world Will be revered By all the devas and humans 
Devadatta The Buddha then addressed the assembly of bodhisattvas and also the devas humans and the fourfold assembly saying In the past immeasurable kalpas ago I tirelessly sought the Lotus Sutra 
Throughout many kalpas I always became a king and made a vow to seek highest enlightenment My mind became irreversible 
Wanting to fulll the six perfections I diligently carried out practices unstintingly giving elephants horses the seven precious treasures countries and cities wives and children male and female servants my head eyes marrow and brains the esh of my body hands and feet without stinginess not even hesitating to give my own life 
If you faithfully obey me I will expound it to you Having heard the sage the king became joyful and ecstatic and accompanying the sage he did everything he was asked He gathered fruits drew water collected rewood and provided meals He even provided his own body as a bed for the sage 
Yet he never tired in either body or mind and in this way served the sage for one thousand years 
For the sake of the Dharma he served him diligently making certain the sage never lacked for anything At that time the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses I remember that in the past many kalpas ago Although I became king of the world In order to seek the great Dharma I was never attached to the desires of the ve senses 
Striking a bell I declared this To the four directions If anyone possesses the great Dharma And explains it to me I will become his servant 
At that time there was a sage called Asita Who came to the great king and said I possess a subtle and true Dharma That is rare in the world 
If you are able to practice it I will explain it to you On hearing what the sage said The king became overjoyed He immediately accompanied the sage And performed whatever he was asked He gathered rewood and various fruits And respectfully offered them whenever requested 
For the sake of sentient beings He diligently sought everywhere the great Dharma He never sought it for his own sake Nor for the desires of the ve senses 
For this reason although a great king He diligently sought and attained this Dharma Ultimately becoming a buddha That is why I now tell you this 
The Buddha addressed the monks saying The king at that time was I myself and the sage was he who is now Devadatta 
Through the virtuous friendship of Devadatta I was able to become endowed with the six perfections benevolence compassion sympathetic joy generosity the thirtytwo marks the eighty excellent characteristics reddishgold skin the ten powers the four kinds of fearlessness the four methods of gaining trust the eighteen excellent qualities the transcendent powers and the power of the path It is all due to the good and virtuous friendship of Devadatta that I attained complete enlightenment and extensively saved innumerable sentient beings The Buddha addressed the fourfold assembly saying 
After immeasurable kalpas have passed Devadatta will then become a buddha called Devarāja a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
His world will be called Deva so pānā 
At that time the Buddha Devarāja will abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas and extensively teach the True Dharma to sentient beings Sentient beings equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River will attain arhatship The thought of a pratyekabuddha has awakened in incalculable numbers of sentient beings The thought of the highest path will awaken in sentient beings equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River and they will become convinced of the nonarising of all dharmas and reside in the stage of nonretrogression 
Then after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha Devarāja the True Dharma will abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas 
A sevenjeweled stupa sixty yojanas in height and forty yojanas in both length and width will be built for all his relics and all the devas and humans will honor and revere this beautiful sevenjeweled stupa with various owers scented powders burning incense fragrant ointments clothing necklaces banners ags jeweled canopies music and songs 
Incalculable sentient beings will attain arhatship Innumerable sentient beings will be enlightened as pratyekabuddhas and the thought of enlightenment will awaken in an inconceivable number of sentient beings and they will reach the stage of nonretrogression The Buddha addressed the monks saying 
If in the future there are sons and daughters of a virtuous family who upon hearing the Devadatta chapter of the Lotus Sutra accept it with pure minds and without doubt they shall not fall into the realms of hell or to the states of hungry ghosts or of animals but will be born in the presence of the buddhas in the ten directions Wherever they may be they will always hear this sutra 
If they are born among humans or devas they will enjoy a supreme and delightful contentment and if in the presence of a buddha they will be born spontaneously in a lotus ower At that time in the lower region there was a bodhisattva called Prajñā kūṭa who was accompanying the Bhagavat Prabhūtaratna 
The Buddha ākyamuni addressed Prajñākūṭa saying O son of a virtuous family 
Wait for a moment 
There is a bodhisattva called Mañjuśrī Let us meet him together and discuss the True Dharma 
After that you can return to your original land At that time Mañjuśrī sitting on a thousandpetaled lotus ower as large as a carriage wheel together with attendant bodhisattvas also seated on jeweled lotus owers emerged spontaneously out of the ocean from the palace of the nāga king Sāgara and oated in midair Arriving at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa they descended from the lotus owers and went into the presence of the buddhas where they bowed until their foreheads touched the feet of both Bhagavats 
Having honored them Mañjuśrī approached Prajñā kūṭa They greeted each other and withdrew to sit at one side 
Then Bodhisattva Prajñā kūṭa asked Mañjuśrī saying Your Eminence How many sentient beings did you lead and inspire at the palace of the nāga king Mañjuśrī answered 
The number is immeasurable and incalculable It is not possible to express it in words nor is it possible to calculate it with ones mind 
Wait a moment and you will have proof Before he had nished speaking innumerable bodhisattvas emerged from the ocean seated on jeweled lotus owers Arriving at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa they oated in midair 
All of these were bodhisattvas who had been led and inspired by Mañjuśrī Those who had perfected the bodhisattva practices discussed the six perfections together 
Those who were originally śrāvakas explained the śrāvaka practices in the air and now they all practice to understand the meaning of emptiness of the Mahayana Mañjuśrī said to Prajñākūṭa 
Thus did I lead and inspire people in the ocean Thereupon Bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa spoke these verses in praise O One of great wisdom virtue and courage This assembly and I have now all witnessed that You have led and inspired Incalculable numbers of sentient beings 
You have expounded the essential character of dharmas And revealed the teaching of the single vehicle You have extensively led many sentient beings Causing them to quickly attain enlightenment 
Mañjuśrī said In the ocean I always expounded only the Lotus Sutra Then Prajñākūṭa questioned Mañjuśrī saying 
This sutra is profound and subtle It is a jewel among sutras and rare in the world 
If sentient beings diligently strive to practice this sutra will they immediately become buddhas or not Mañjuśrī answered Yes they will 
There is the daughter of the nāga king Sāgara who is only eight years old She is wise her faculties are sharp and she also well knows all the faculties and deeds of sentient beings She has attained the power of recollection She preserves all the profound secret treasures taught by the buddhas enters deep meditation and is well capable of discerning all dharmas 
She instantly produced the thought of enlightenment and attained the stage of nonretrogression 
She has a harmonious mind and has attained enlightenment The Bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa said I see the Tathāgata ākyamuni who has been incessantly carrying out difcult and severe practices for immeasurable kalpas accumulating merit and virtue while seeking the bodhisattva path 
Looking into the great manifold cosmos there is not a single place even the size of a mustard seed where this bodhisattva has not abandoned his life for the sake of sentient beings He attained the path to enlightenment only after this 
It is hard to believe that this girl will instantly attain complete enlightenment Before he had nished speaking the daughter of the nāga king suddenly appeared in their presence Bowing until her forehead touched their feet she withdrew to one side and spoke these verses in praise The Buddha is deeply versed In the characteristics of good and evil And he completely illuminates the ten directions His subtle and pure Dharma body Is endowed with the thirtytwo marks With the eighty good characteristics Is his Dharma body adorned 
He is adored by devas and humans And honored by nāgas There is no sentient being Who does not pay him homage 
Moreover that I will attain enlightenment Upon hearing him Can only be known by a buddha I will reveal the teaching of the Mahayana And save suffering sentient beings 
At that time āriputra spoke to the daughter of the nāga king saying You say that you will soon attain the highest path This is difcult to believe 
Why is this 
The female body is polluted it is not a t vessel for the Dharma How can you attain highest enlightenment 
The buddha path is long One can only attain it after diligently carrying out severe practices and completely practicing the perfections over immeasurable kalpas 
Moreover the female body has ve obstructions The rst is the inability to become a great Brahma The second is the inability to become akra The third is the inability to become Māra and the fourth is the inability to become a universal monarch  
How can you with your female body quickly become a buddha Then the daughter of the nāga king presented to the Buddha a jewel worth the great manifold cosmos and the Buddha accepted it 
The daughter of the nāga king spoke to Bodhisattva Prajñā kūṭa and the noble āri putra saying I offered a jewel and the Bhagavat accepted it Was that done quickly or not They answered saying It was done extremely quickly The daughter said 
Through your transcendent powers watch me become a buddha even more quickly than that Then the assembly there all saw the daughter of the nāga king instantly transform into a man perfect the bodhisattva practices go to the vimalā world in the south sit on a jeweled lotus ower and attain highest complete enlightenment become endowed with the thirtytwo marks and eighty excellent characteristics and expound the True Dharma universally for the sake of all sentient beings in the ten directions 
Then the bodhisattvas śrāvakas eight kinds of devas nāgas and so on humans and nonhumans of the sahā world all saw in the distance that the daughter of the nāga king had become a buddha and was universally teaching the Dharma for the sake of the humans and devas in that assembly They rejoiced greatly and honored her from afar 
On hearing the Dharma incalculable numbers of sentient beings became enlightened and attained the stage of nonretrogression 
Incalculable numbers of sentient beings received their predictions to the path and the vimalā world quaked in six ways 
In the sahā world three thousand sentient beings attained the stage of nonretrogression and three thousand sentient beings in whom the thought of enlightenment had awakened received their predictions 
The Bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa āriputra and the entire assembly accepted and believed in silence 
Perseverance At that time Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja and Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna made this declaration in the presence of the Buddha together with two thousand bodhisattvas O Bhagavat 
We entreat you not to be concerned since after the Buddhas parinirvāṇa we will preserve recite and teach this Sutra 
In the troubled world to come sentient beings will have hardly any roots of good merit but will have excessive pride and will be greedy to receive offerings They will increase their roots of bad merit and thus will be far away from liberation It will be difcult to lead and inspire them 
Therefore we will produce the power of great patience and recite preserve teach and copy this sutra as well as pay it homage in various ways even willingly giving up our bodies and lives Then in the assembly ve hundred arhats who had received their predictions addressed the Buddha saying 
O Bhagavat We also declare that in other lands we will extensively teach this sutra Moreover eight thousand of those who had received their predictions including those who had more to learn and those who did not rose from their seats and with their palms pressed together faced the Buddha and made this declaration 
We also will extensively teach this sutra in other lands 
Why is this 
Because in the sahā world there are many erring people with excessive pride and supercial virtue those who are quick to anger deceitful and untrue Thereupon the Buddhas aunt the nun Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī with six thousand nuns some of whom had more to learn and some who did not rose from their seats and with their palms pressed together gazed attentively at the Buddha never turning their eyes away 
Then the Bhagavat spoke to Mahāprajā patī Gautamī saying Why are you anxiously staring at the Tathāgata Are you thinking that I have not given you your prediction of highest complete enlightenment 
O Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī I have previously said that all of the śrāvakas would receive their predictions Now if you wish to know your prediction I will tell you that in the future you will become a great expounder of the Dharma taught by sixtyeight thousand koṭis of buddhas These six thousand nuns some of whom have more to learn and some who do not will all become expounders of the Dharma together 
In this way you will gradually be able to complete the bodhisattva path and become a buddha called Sarvarūpa saṃdarśana a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
This Buddha Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana will give predictions of highest complete enlightenment one by one to bodhisattvas totaling six thousand in number Then the nun Yaśodharā the mother of Rāhula thought this 
While giving the predictions the only name the Bhagavat did not mention was mine The Buddha addressed Yaśodharā saying In the future you will cultivate the bodhisattva practice of the teachings of hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas You will become a great expounder of the Dharma and gradually complete the buddha path 
In a land called Bhadrā you will become a buddha called Raśmiśatasahasraparipūrṇadhvaja a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
This buddhas lifespan will be for immeasurable incalculable kalpas At that time the nun Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and the nun Yaśo dharā together with their attendants all rejoiced greatly at having attained such an unprecedented experience In the presence of the Buddha they immediately spoke in verse saying 
Having spoken this verse all the nuns addressed the Buddha saying O Bhagavat 
We also will extensively expound this sutra in other lands Then the Bhagavat saw eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of bodhisattva mahāsattvas all of whom were at the stage of nonretrogression 
They had turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma and attained the power of recollection Arising from their seats they went before the Buddha with their palms pressed together and with this wholehearted thought If the Bhagavat commands us to preserve and teach this sutra then we will extensively expound this Dharma exactly as the Buddha has taught They also thought 
The Buddha now keeps silent and does not command us 
What should we do Then all of the bodhisattvas respecting the Buddhas intention and also wanting to fulll their original vow uttered a lions roar in the presence of the Buddha and declared 
O Bhagavat After the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa we will roam throughout the worlds of the ten directions enabling sentient beings to copy preserve and recite this Sutra and to explain its meaning practice it according to the Dharma and remember it correctly This will all be due to the Buddhas majestic power O Bhagavat 
We entreat you to protect us from afar while we are in other quarters Immediately after that all of the bodhisattvas spoke these verses in unison We entreat you not to be concerned Because we will extensively teach In the fearful troubled world After the Buddhas parinirvāṇa 
We will be patient With those who are ignorant Those who disparage others with evil words Or who attack us with sticks and swords 
Monks in this troubled world Will have false wisdom And be deceitful They will think they have attained What they have not and their minds Will be full of conceit 
Then there will be those who dwell In tranquil forests wearing rags With the thought that they alone practice the true path And who look down on those who lead worldly lives 
There will be those who teach the Dharma To laypeople only out of greed for offerings Yet they will be respected in the world As if they were arhats endowed with The six transcendent powers 
The minds of such people are in error They are always thinking about worldly matters And they enjoy pointing out our faults Playing the role of the forest dwellers Thus they will say such things as All of these monks here Teach heretical doctrines Because they are greedy for prot 
They have fabricated this sutra To deceive the people of the world And they explain this sutra Out of desire for fame They always want to slander us In the great assembly They slander us to the kings Ministers brahmans householders And to other monks saying that we are evil They say These are people of false views Who teach heretical doctrines 
Since we revere the Buddha We will be patient with their wickedness 
They will mockingly address us saying All you buddhas We will be patient with These scornful words 
In the troubled world of the Age of There are many fearful things People possessed by evil spirits Will scorn and slander us 
But we shall wear the armor of patience Because we trust and revere the Buddha And we will persevere under these difculties In order to teach this sutra 
We will not be attached to our bodies or lives We only desire the highest path In the future we will preserve What the Buddha has entrusted us with 
The Bhagavat himself must know That the erring monks in the troubled world Will not understand the Dharma Taught by the Buddha through skillful means According to what is appropriate to sentient beings They will utter evil words with angry countenances And they will repeatedly expel us And keep us away from the monasteries and stupas 
There will be many evils such as this We will all endure in these matters Because we remember the Buddhas decree 
If there are any people seeking this Dharma In villages or cities we will all go there And teach the Dharma entrusted to us by the Buddha 
Because we are the Bhagavats ambassadors Wherever we go we have nothing to fear We will skillfully teach the Dharma We entreat you O Buddha to be at ease 
In the presence of the Bhagavat And all of the buddhas who have come From the ten directions We make this declaration O Buddha You know our intentions 
Ease in Practice Thereupon the Prince of the Dharma Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mañ juśrī addressed the Buddha saying 
O Bhagavat These bodhisattvas are very rare In respectful obedience to the Buddha they have made this great vow In the troubled world to come we will preserve recite and teach this Lotus Sutra O Bhagavat 
How can these bodhisattva mahāsattvas teach this sutra in the troubled world to come The Buddha addressed Mañjuśrī saying 
If the bodhisattva mahā sattvas want to teach this sutra in the troubled world to come they should abide in the four kinds of practices 
The rst is to establish the sphere of their bodhisattva practice and the sphere of their relationships and thereupon expound this sutra for the sake of sentient beings 
O Mañjuśrī What is the sphere of the practice of the bodhisattva mahāsattva 
If a bodhisattva mahāsattva abides in the stage of perseverance is gentle tranquil nonviolent and unafraid and furthermore if he remains unmoved with regard to existent things and perceives them in their true aspect and neither acts nor discriminates this is called the sphere of the practice of the bodhisattva mahāsattva 
What is the sphere of the relationships of the bodhisattva mahāsattva 
The bodhisattva mahāsattva should not consort with kings princes ministers and chief ofcials He should not consort with heretics brahmans Jains and others or with worldly writers critics of poetry materialists or extreme materialists 
Nor should he become acquainted with pranksters boxers wrestlers clowns and various jugglers nor with outcastes and people who raise boars sheep chickens and dogs nor with hunters shermen and those with evil conduct 
Nor should a bodhisattva consort with monks nuns laymen and laywomen who seek the śrāvaka vehicle 
The bodhisattva should avoid their company in chambers on roads or while in lecture halls and not remain with them 
If they come teach them the Dharma according to their capacities but expect nothing 
Moreover O Mañjuśrī The bodhisattva mahāsattva should expound the teaching without any thought of desire for or wish to see a womans body 
If a bodhisattva enters someone elses home he should not talk to young girls maidens and widows 
He should not enter someone elses home alone and if for any reason he should enter it alone a bodhisattva should do nothing but singlemindedly contemplate the Buddha 
If he should teach the Dharma to women he should not show his teeth when smiling nor reveal his chest 
How much less for other things A bodhisattva should take no pleasure in keeping young disciples śrāmaṇeras or young boys Nor should he take pleasure in having the same teacher as them 
He should always take pleasure in meditation and in a quiet place practice to control his mind 
This is what is known as the rst sphere of relationships 
Furthermore the bodhisattva mahāsattvas perceive the emptiness of all dharmas in their true aspect All things are unerring unmoving nonreturning irreversible and like empty space which lacks substance They are beyond all language They are not produced nor do they emerge nor do they arise 
They do not have any name or mark and in reality they have no substance They are immeasurable limitless without obstacles or obstructions They exist only through dependent origination arising through error 
This is what is known as the second sphere of relationships of a bodhisattva mahāsattva At that time the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate upon the meaning of this further spoke these verses If in the troubled world to come A bodhisattva with a fearless mind Wants to teach this sutra He should enter the sphere Of the bodhisattva practice And the sphere of relationships 
He should always stay away from kings Princes ministers chief ofcials Dangerous pranksters outcastes Heretics and brahmans 
He should not consort With excessively proud scholars Who are attached to scriptures of the inferior vehicle Contained in the three baskets  Nor with monks who violate the precepts With those who call themselves arhats Nor with nuns who like to joke and laugh He should not become acquainted with laywomen Who are attached to the desires of the ve senses And seek nirvana in their present lives 
If these people come to the bodhisattva With good intentions In order to hear about the buddha path The bodhisattva should then fearlessly Teach them the Dharma Without any expectations 
A bodhisattva should not Become intimately acquainted With widows maidens Or impotent men 
Nor should he consort With slaughterers butchers hunters Or shermen who kill for prot He should not consort With people such as those Who make a living From selling meat Or from pandering prostitutes 
He should never become acquainted With dangerous wrestlers Or the varieties of jugglers or courtesans 
He should not teach the Dharma To a woman alone in a quiet place When he teaches the Dharma He should not joke or laugh 
If he enters a village to beg for food He should be accompanied by a monk If there is no monk he should Singlemindedly contemplate the Buddha 
Within these two spheres He can teach at ease 
He should not practice The superior mediocre or inferior teachings The conditioned and the unconditioned Or the teaching of the real and the unreal Nor should he discriminate Between men and women 
He should not acquire comprehend Or perceive any phenomenon This is what is known As the sphere of the Bodhisattva practice 
All dharmas are empty and without substance Impermanent without origination or cessation This is known as the sphere Of the relationships of the wise 
Through the error of discrimination One sees all existent things As existing or nonexisting Real or unreal Produced or unproduced 
Being in a quiet place the bodhisattva Carries out practices to control his mind And remains as rm and unmoved As Mount Sumeru 
He should regard all dharmas As being without substance Like empty space Which has no rmness 
All dharmas are neither produced Nor do they emerge They are immovable nonreturning And always remain in their single character 
This is known as the sphere of relationships Any monk after my parinirvāṇa Who enters the sphere of practice And the sphere of relationships Will not be disheartened When he teaches this sutra 
A bodhisattva at proper times Should enter a quiet chamber And contemplate all dharmas With correct thoughts According to the meaning 
Arising from meditation he should reveal And expound this sutra To kings princes ministers and brahmans Then his mind will be at ease and unafraid 
O Mañjuśrī This is the bodhisattva Who rmly abides in the Dharma from the beginning And in the world to come will be able To teach the Lotus Sutra 
Furthermore O Mañjuśrī after the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa anyone who wants to teach this sutra in the Age of the Decadent Dharma should abide in ease of practice 
When he expounds or recites this sutra he should not take pleasure in talking about the faults of people or of the sutra 
Nor should he slander other expounders of the Dharma or talk of the good and bad strong and weak points of others 
As for the śrāvakas a bodhisattva should not name them and point out their faults nor name them and praise their virtues 
Moreover he should not feel any hatred because if he skillfully practices ease of mind in this way those who listen to him will not oppose his intentions If he is asked difcult questions he should not answer using the teaching of the inferior vehicle He should take his explanation only from the Mahayana which will enable them to attain omniscience At that time the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
The bodhisattva should always willingly Teach the Dharma at ease Establishing his seat in a pure place 
He should anoint his body with oil To cleanse himself of dirt And put on new clean clothing Both his outer garments and undergarments being pure Sitting comfortably on the Dharma seat He should teach according to the questions 
If there are any monks nuns laymen and laywomen Or kings princes subjects ofcials and commoners Using subtle ideas he should teach them With a composed countenance 
If they have difcult questions He should answer in accordance with the meaning Expounding and illuminating it With various explanations and illustrations 
Through these skillful means He should awaken the thought of Enlightenment in them all Gradually beneting them And causing them to enter the buddha path 
Ridding them of idle minds And lazy thoughts As well as anxieties He should compassionately Teach the Dharma 
He should continuously expound The teaching of the highest path Both day and night using various explanations And incalculable illustrations Revealing this to sentient beings He will cause them all to rejoice 
He should not expect to receive any clothing Bedding food and drink or medicine 
He should only singlemindedly think Of teaching the Dharma Gain mastery of the buddha path And enable sentient beings also to attain it 
It is exactly this kind of offering That brings great benet and ease 
After my parinirvāṇa if there is any monk Who is able to explain the Lotus Sutra His mind will be free from the obstructions of Jealousy anger and anxiety 
He will also be without sorrows And no one will slander him He will not be afraid of being Attacked with swords and sticks And he will not be expelled from the sangha Because he abides in perseverance 
The wise skillfully compose Their minds in this way And can abide in ease As I have described above 
One would not be able to fully Describe the qualities of such a person Through calculations and illustrations Though they lasted for Thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas 
Furthermore O Mañjuśrī in the future when the Dharma becomes extinct any bodhisattva mahāsattva who preserves and recites this sutra will not feel jealous or be deceitful nor will he insult those who study the buddha path by pointing out their good qualities or their deciencies 
If there are any monks nuns laymen and laywomen who are seeking the śrāvaka vehicle the pratyekabuddha vehicle or the bodhisattva path a bodhisattva will not worry them causing them to have doubts by saying You are very far away from the path and will never be able to attain omniscience 
Why is this 
Because you are negligent and idle in the path 
In him the thought of great compassion for all sentient beings should awaken together with the thought that all Tathāgatas are compassionate fathers and that all bodhisattvas are great teachers He should always deeply respect and pay homage to all of the great bodhisattvas in the ten directions 
He should teach the Dharma equally to all sentient beings in accordance with the Dharma explaining neither too much nor too little Nor should he teach too much even to those who are deeply enthusiastic about hearing the Dharma 
O Mañjuśrī In the future world when the Dharma is to be extinguished this bodhisattva mahāsattva having perfected the third sphere of ease in practice will not be perplexed when he teaches this Dharma He will become acquainted with good fellow students who will recite this sutra together He will also acquire a great following who come to hear his teaching preserve it after hearing it recite it after preserving it teach it after reciting it copy it after teaching it and enable others to copy respect honor praise and pay homage to the Sutra Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
If anyone wants to teach this sutra He should get rid of jealousy anger Pride attery deceitfulness and falsity He should always practice honest conduct 
He should not slander others Or make up fallacies about the Dharma Nor should he cause others to be doubtful by saying You will not become a buddha 
This heir of the Buddha who teaches the Dharma Should always be gentle patient And compassionate to all He should never have lazy thoughts 
He should respect the great bodhisattvas In the ten directions who practice the path Out of their compassion for sentient beings And think that they are his great teachers 
He should think that all the Buddha Bhagavats are the most excellent fathers Destroying arrogance he should teach The Dharma without obstructions 
The third sphere of the teaching Of ease in practice is like this The wise should preserve it Those who practice wholeheartedly and at ease Will be honored by innumerable sentient beings 
Furthermore O Mañjuśrī in the future world when the Dharma is to be extinguished any bodhisattva mahāsattva who preserves this Lotus Sutra will awaken the thought of great kindness toward lay Buddhists and renunciants and also awaken the thought of great compassion toward nonbodhi sattvas He should think 
They do not ask believe or understand Those people do not even ask questions about this sutra believe it or understand it When I attain highest complete enlightenment wherever I am I will lead them and enable them to abide in this teaching through my transcendent powers and power of wisdom O Mañjuśrī 
After the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa this bodhisattva mahāsattva who has perfected the fourth sphere of the teaching of ease in practice will be faultless when he teaches this Dharma He will always be paid homage to respected honored and praised by monks nuns laymen laywomen kings princes ministers commoners brahmans and householders 
The devas in the sky will always accompany him in order to hear the Dharma 
If he is in a village city secluded spot or forest and the people want to come and ask difcult questions the devas will protect him both day and night always for the sake of the Dharma and he will cause all of those who listen to him to rejoice 
Why is this 
Because this sutra is preserved through the transcendent powers of all the buddhas of the past present and future 
Even the title of this Lotus Sutra cannot be heard in incalculable lands 
O Mañjuśrī Suppose a very powerful noble emperor wanted to subdue other countries with his might but the lesser kings would not obey his command In such a case the noble emperor gathers an army together to overcome them 
He recognizes the soldiers who have committed brave deeds in war and greatly rejoicing he bestows boons according to their merit such as estates villages cities garments ornaments various treasures gold silver lapis lazuli motherofpearl agate coral amber elephants horses chariots servants and subjects but he never gives them the precious jewel in his topknot 
Why is this 
Because only the noble emperor has this precious jewel in his topknot If the emperor gives it away his attendants would certainly be very surprised and mistrustful 
The Tathāgata is exactly like this He has attained the land of the Dharma through his powers of concentration and wisdom Thus he has become the king of the triple world Since the māra kings will not obey him the wise and noble generals of the Tathāgata come to do battle with them 
The Tathāgata rejoices at the meritorious ones and teaches various sutras to the fourfold assembly gladdening them He bestows upon them the property of all the teachings about concentrations liberations faculties without corruption and powers He also bestows upon them the city of nirvana Saying that they have attained nirvana he leads their minds onward and gladdens them all 
O Mañjuśrī It is just as if the noble emperor nally gives the jewel that has been long concealed in his topknot Although he perceived the great merit of those soldiers and was deeply pleased he did not rashly give them the marvelous jewel 
The Tathāgata is also exactly like this Since he is the great King of the Dharma in the triple world he inspires all the sentient beings through the Dharma 
When he sees the wise and noble soldiers who have done battle with the māra of the ve aggregates the māra of desires and the māra of death who have great merit in battle and have extinguished the three poisons left the triple world and broken out of Māras net he then rejoices greatly 
He now teaches the Lotus Sutra which is treated with hostility by the entire world and is difcult to believe in and which he has never taught before and enables sentient beings to attain omniscience 
O Mañjuśrī This Lotus Sutra is the ultimate teaching of all the Tathāgatas the most profound among all the teachings and conferred at the very end It was in the same way that the very powerful and noble emperor gave the jewel after having preserved it for a long time O Mañjuśrī 
This Lotus Sutra is the secret treasure house of all the Buddha Tathāgatas and the foremost among all the sutras The Buddha has preserved it for a long time and he has not taught it indiscriminately 
Now for the rst time he teaches it At that time the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses Always practice patience And be compassionate toward all Since only then can one expound A sutra praised by the Buddha 
In the future those who preserve this sutra Should be compassionate and kind toward Lay Buddhists renunciants and nonbodhisattvas Saying Those who have not heard this sutra Or who do not believe in it Have consequently lost a great opportunity 
When I attain the buddha path I will expound this teaching Through various skillful means And enable them to abide in it 
Suppose there was a powerful noble emperor Who bestows upon those soldiers meritorious in battle Various gifts of elephants horses chariots conveyances Ornaments estates villages cities garments Various treasures servants and wealth He gives these gifts with joy 
If there is anyone who has been brave And has performed difcult deeds The noble emperor gives The precious jewel in his topknot 
The Tathāgata is exactly like this He is the emperor of all the teachings Out of his great compassion And through his treasury of wisdom And great power of patience He inspires the world according to the Dharma 
Seeing all the sentient beings suffering Seeking liberation And doing battle with the māras He explains various teachings for the beings And teaches various sutras With his great skillful means 
Knowing that the sentient beings have Finally attained the power to understand He teaches this Lotus Sutra only at the very end Just like the noble emperor Who gave the jewel in his topknot 
This sutra is the utmost Superior to all the sutras I have constantly preserved it And have not revealed it indiscriminately Now is the right time to teach it to you 
After my parinirvāṇa Those seeking the buddha path Who want to attain ease and expound this sutra Should become familiar with these four spheres Of the teaching concerning ease in practice 
Those who recite this sutra will always Be free from anxiety and illness And will have a noble countenance They will not be born into poverty Lowliness or ugliness 
Sentient beings will want to meet them Just as they long to meet a wise seer And all of the devaputras will serve them 
Sticks and swords cannot hurt them And poison cannot harm them If people slander them Those slanderers mouths will be sealed up 
They will travel fearlessly Like a lion king and The light of their wisdom Will illuminate just like the sun 
If they dream they see only subtle things 
They see the Tathāgatas seated on lion seats Teaching the Dharma to the assembly Of monks surrounding them 
They see nāgas and asuras As numerous as the sands of the Ganges River Honoring the Tathāgatas With their palms pressed together Revealing themselves They teach the Dharma to these beings 
They also see the buddhas with golden bodies Emitting immeasurable rays of light Which illuminate universally And expounding various teachings With beautiful voices like Brahmas 
To the fourfold assembly The Buddha teaches the highest Dharma Revealing themselves among them They praise the Buddha With palms pressed together Hearing the Dharma they rejoice And pay homage to the Buddha They attain the power of recollection And achieve the wisdom of nonretrogression 
The Buddha knowing their minds And that they have deeply entered the buddha path Gives them a prediction of the highest Complete enlightenment saying O son of a virtuous family 
In the future you will attain immeasurable Wisdom and the great path of the Buddha 
Your land will be pure and vast Beyond all comparison The fourfold assembly will also be there Listening to the Dharma with their palms Pressed together 
They who recite this sutra also see themselves In mountain forests practicing excellent teachings Experiencing the real aspect Deeply entering into concentration And looking at the buddhas in the ten directions All of whom have golden bodies Adorned with a hundred auspicious marks 
They will also dream about becoming The king of a realm who abandons his palace And retinue and the highly pleasing Desires of the ve senses Approaches the terrace of enlightenment Sits on the lion seat under the bodhi tree Attains the wisdom of all the buddhas After seeking the path for seven days And who arising turns the wheel of the Dharma After having attained the highest path 
They will teach the Dharma to the fourfold assembly For thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas Explaining the true and incorruptible Dharma They will save innumerable sentient beings 
Later they will enter nirvana Just as smoke dies away When the ame of a candle is extinguished 
If anyone in the troubled world to come Teaches this highest Dharma They will attain great benets Like the merits mentioned above 
Bodhisattvas Emerging from the Earth At that time the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who had arrived from other lands and whose number exceeded that of the sands of eight Ganges Rivers stood up in the great assembly bowed with their palms pressed together and then spoke to the Buddha saying 
If you give us permission to diligently strive to preserve recite copy and pay homage to this Sutra after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha in this sahā world then we will extensively teach it in this land Then the Buddha addressed the assembly of bodhisattva mahā sattvas saying Enough O sons of a virtuous family 
There is no need for you to preserve this sutra 
Why is this 
In my sahā world there are bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers in number and each of these bodhisattvas in turn has a retinue equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers After my parinirvāṇa they can preserve recite and extensively teach this sutra When the Buddha said this all the lands of the great manifold cosmos in the sahā world quaked and the earth split 
From out of this crevice there simultaneously appeared incalculable thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattva mahāsattvas 
All of these bodhisattvas had golden bodies endowed with the thirtytwo marks and radiating immeasurable rays of light They had all previously been living in the space under the earth of the sahā world 
Having heard the sound of ākyamunis teaching all of these bodhisattvas emerged from below 
Each of those bodhisattvas presided over a great assembly and each led a retinue equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers in number 
How much more numerous were the bodhisattvas who emerged leading retinues equal in number to the sands of fty thousand forty thousand thirty thousand twenty thousand or ten thousand Ganges Rivers 
How many more retinues were there numbering thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas 
How many more retinues were there numbering myriads of koṭis 
How many more were those numbering ten million one million or even ten thousand 
How many more were those numbering one thousand one hundred or even ten 
Having emerged from the earth each of these bodhisattvas approached the Tathāgatas Prabhūtaratna and ākyamuni still seated in the beautiful sevenjeweled stupa in the air 
Going up to them they bowed until their foreheads touched the feet of both Bhagavats Then having bowed to the other buddhas each sitting on a lion seat under the jeweled trees they circumambulated them to the right three times honoring them with their palms pressed together Having praised them with various bodhisattva eulogies they withdrew to one side and joyfully gazed at the two Bhagavats 
All these bodhisattva mahāsattvas having emerged from the earth praised the buddhas with various bodhisattva eulogies While they did fty intermediate kalpas passed 
During this time the Buddha ākyamuni sat in silence and the fourfold assemblies were also silent while the fty intermediate kalpas passed 
Because of the Buddhas transcendent powers the great assemblies believed that the time that had passed was only half a day 
Then through the transcendent powers of the Buddha the fourfold assemblies also saw the bodhisattvas lling the air throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of lands 
There were four leaders among those bodhisattvas gathered there They were called Viśiṣṭacāritra Anantacāritra Viśuddha cāritra and Supratiṣṭhita cāritra 
These four bodhisattvas were the foremost leaders in the assembly At the head of the great assembly they each pressed their palms together gazed at ākyamuni Buddha and inquired of him saying 
Are you without illness or pain Are you at ease in practice or not 
Do those who should be saved accept your teaching easily or not 
Do they not make you weary O Bhagavat Thereupon the four great bodhisattvas spoke these verses O Bhagavat Are you at ease Are you without illness or pain 
Do the sentient beings accept Your guidance easily or not 
Do they not tire the Bhagavat 
At that time the Bhagavat spoke to the great assembly of bodhisattvas saying It is exactly like this O sons of a virtuous family It is exactly so 
The Tathāgata is at ease and without illness or pain 
It is easy to save sentient beings and I am not fatigued 
Why is this 
Because sentient beings have continually received my guidance throughout many lives and they have also planted roots of good merit by revering and honoring the buddhas of the past 
When these sentient beings rst saw me and heard my teaching all except for those who had previously practiced and studied the inferior vehicle immediately believed and accepted it and entered the Tathāgatas wisdom 
Now I enable even such people as these to listen to this sutra and enter the Buddhas wisdom Then the great bodhisattvas spoke these verses 
O Bhagavat Great Hero All the sentient beings Can easily be brought to the path 
They can ask about The profound wisdom of the buddhas Hearing about it they trust and accept it We rejoice about this 
At that time the Bhagavat praised the foremost of the great bodhisattvas saying Splendid splendid O sons of virtuous family 
Thoughts of joy regarding the Tathāgata have awakened in you Then Bodhisattva Maitreya and the assembly of bodhisattvas equal in number to the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers thought this Looking far into the past we have never seen or heard of such an assembly of great bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have now emerged from the earth and are standing before the Bhagavat with their palms pressed together in reverence asking the Tathāgata questions 
Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Maitreya knowing the minds of the bodhisattvas whose number was equal to the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers and wanting to clear up their confusion faced the Buddha with the palms of his hands pressed together and addressed him in verse saying We have never seen such a great assembly Of incalculable thousands of myriads of koṭis Of bodhisattvas before We entreat you O Best of Humans To explain it to us Where have they come from 
They look magnicent And have great transcendent powers Their wisdom is beyond our comprehension They are rm in their resolve Have the power of great perseverance And an appearance that sentient beings Desire to see Where have they come from 
Each of these bodhisattvas is leading A retinue whose number is incalculable Like the sands of the Ganges River 
Some great bodhisattvas are leading retinues Equal in number to the sands Of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers Great are the assemblies Singlemindedly seeking the buddha path 
These great leaders equal in number To the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers Have come all together to pay homage to the Buddha And preserve this sutra 
There are disciples who number Thousands of myriads of nayutas Myriads of koṭis or even half a koṭi Their numbers also exceed that mentioned above There are also disciples in retinues Of one million ten thousand One thousand one hundred fty ten Even three two or one in number 
If anyone counted the number of such a great assembly With bamboo countingsticks he would not nish Even after exhausting kalpas greater in number Than the sands of the Ganges River 
Who has taught the Dharma To this assembly of bodhisattvas Endowed with great dignity and perseverance Who has inspired and perfected them 
Under whom did the thought of enlightenment First awaken in them 
Which BuddhaDharma do they praise 
Whose sutra have they preserved and practiced 
And which buddha path have they followed 
Such bodhisattvas as these Endowed with transcendent powers And the power of great wisdom Have all emerged out of the earth Which quaked in the four directions And split asunder 
O Bhagavat We have never seen Such a thing before We entreat you to tell us the name Of the land from where they have come 
We have been constantly traveling In various regions Nevertheless we have never seen Such a thing before We do not know even a single person In this assembly All of a sudden They have emerged from the earth We entreat you to explain the reason why 
All of the immeasurable hundreds of thousands Of koṭis of bodhisattvas in this great assembly Now wish to know about this matter 
There must be underlying causes for this To explain all of these bodhisattvas O Bhagavat He of Immeasurable Qualities We entreat you to clear up The confusion of the assembly 
Thereupon the buddhas who were the magically created forms of ākyamuni Buddha arrived from other incalculable thousands of myriads of koṭis of lands and sat crosslegged on lion seats under the jeweled trees in the eight directions 
Each attendant of these buddhas had seen the great assembly of bodhisattvas as they emerged from out of the earth and oated in midair in the four directions of the great manifold cosmos 
Each of them addressed his Buddha saying O Bhagavat 
Where has this great assembly of immeasurable limitless incalculable bodhisattvas come from Then the buddhas answered their attendants saying O sons of a virtuous family 
Wait a moment There is a bodhisattva mahā sattva called Maitreya who has received a prediction from the Buddha ākyamuni that he will become a buddha after ākyamuni in the future Since he has already asked about this the Buddha will now answer him You shall be able to hear the reason yourselves Then the Buddha ākyamuni addressed Bodhisattva Maitreya saying 
Splendid splendid O Ajita 
You have asked the Buddha an important question 
You should all singlemindedly don the armor of perseverance and be of rm will The Tathāgata now wants to reveal the wisdom of the buddhas the inherent transcendent powers of the buddhas the lionlike dignied power of the buddhas the majestic and mighty power of the buddhas Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses You should be persistent And wholeheartedly attentive For I want to explain it to you 
You should now awaken the power of faith And with perseverance abide in the good Now you will all be able to hear What you have never heard before 
I will now put you at ease Have no doubts or fear The Buddha never speaks false words His wisdom is immeasurable 
The foremost Dharma that he has attained Is profound and difcult to explain I will now expound this difcult teaching So you should listen wholeheartedly 
Then the Bhagavat after speaking these verses addressed Bodhisattva Maitreya saying I will now proclaim it to all of you in this assembly 
O Ajita 
All of you have never seen these immeasurable innumerable incalculable great bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have emerged from out of the earth Having attained highest complete enlightenment in this sahā world I led inspired and instructed these bodhisattvas restrained their thoughts and caused the thought of the path to awaken in them 
When these bodhisattvas lived in the space under the earth of this sahā world they recited various sutras became well versed in them and contemplated analyzed and correctly remembered them 
O Ajita 
All these sons of a virtuous family did not wish to be among the multitude where there is always much discussion 
They always wanted to be in quiet places They diligently strove without resting or relying upon devas or humans 
They always desired the profound wisdom without obstructions they always wanted the Dharma of the buddhas 
They strove wholeheartedly in seeking the highest wisdom At that time the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
You should know That all of these great bodhisattvas Have practiced the wisdom of the Buddha For innumerable kalpas They have all been inspired by me And the thought of the great path Has awakened in them 
They are my heirs Abiding in this world They always cultivated ascetic practices Wishing to be in quiet places Rejecting the clamor of the multitude They did not want to have much discussion 
All my heirs such as these Constantly practiced my teaching With vigor day and night In order to seek the buddha path They lived in the space Under the earth of this sahā world 
They were rm in recollection And they always diligently sought wisdom Explaining various subtle teachings Their minds were free from fear 
Sitting under the bodhi tree In the city of Gayā I attained highest complete enlightenment And turned the wheel of the highest Dharma 
I then led and inspired them So that the thought of the path Awakened in them for the rst time All of them are now at the stage of nonretrogression And will certainly become buddhas with no residue 
I now teach the truth You should wholeheartedly believe that From long long ago I have been Leading and inspiring all these bodhisattvas 
Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Maitreya and the innumerable other bodhisattvas became doubtful and confused concerning this unprecedented experience They thought this How is it possible in such a short time for the Bhagavat to have inspired such an immeasurable limitless incalculable number of great bodhisattvas enabling them to abide in highest complete enlightenment 
Immediately they addressed the Buddha saying 
O Bhagavat When the Tathāgata was a prince he left the palace of the ākyas sat on the terrace of enlightenment which is not far from the city of Gayā and attained highest complete enlightenment 
Since then more than forty years have passed 
How is it possible O Bhagavat for you to have done such great buddha acts in such a short period of time Is it through the might of the Buddha and through the Buddhas qualities that you have inspired such an assembly of incalculable great bodhisattvas to achieve highest complete enlightenment 
O Bhagavat Even if someone counted the number of the great bodhisattvas for thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas they would not be able to nish There would be no end 
From long ago these bodhisattvas have been planting roots of good merit in the presence of immeasurable limitless buddhas They have perfected the bodhisattva path and have always practiced the pure path of discipline and integrity 
It is O Bhagavat difcult to believe such things in this world 
Suppose a handsome man with dark hair twentyve years of age were to point to a hundredyearold man and say He is my son And the onehundredyearold man points to the young fellow and says He is my father and he raised me 
It has not in fact been so long since the Buddha attained the path Yet for the sake of the buddha path this great assembly of bodhisattvas has been diligently striving for innumerable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas They have skillfully entered abided in and emerged from immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of samādhis They have attained great transcendent powers and practiced the pure path of discipline and integrity for a long time 
Today the Bhagavat has correctly said that after he attained the path of the Buddha he caused the thought of enlightenment to awaken in the bodhisattvas for the rst time He then led inspired and instructed them to approach highest complete enlightenment O Bhagavat Although it has not been so long since you attained buddhahood yet you have really done these great meritorious acts 
We believe the Buddhas words spoken according to our capacities and that what he says is never false We are all well versed in the Buddhas knowledge 
However if the bodhisattvas in whom the thought of enlightenment has recently awakened hear this after the Buddhas parinirvāṇa they will not accept it and this will bring about conditions for erring deeds that destroy the Dharma 
Moreover in the future when the sons of a virtuous family hear this they will also be free from doubt Thereupon Bodhisattva Maitreya wanting to elaborate upon the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
Long ago the Buddha left The household of the ākya clan And approached Gayā Where he sat under the bodhi tree It has not been so long since that time 
The number of the Buddhas heirs Is incalculable From long ago they have practiced the buddha path And attained transcendent powers and The power of wisdom They have thoroughly studied The bodhisattva path And are as undeled by worldly affairs As the lotus blossom in the water 
They have emerged from out of the earth And all stood respectfully before the Bhagavats 
It is difcult to comprehend this matter How can we possibly believe it 
The Buddha attained the path Only a short time ago Yet he has accomplished so much We entreat you to remove our doubts And give a detailed explanation According to the truth 
Suppose there were a young man Just twentyve years of age Who pointed to a onehundredyearold man Who was wrinkled and had white hair saying This is my offspring 
The also says This is my father 
The father is young and the son is old No one in the world would believe it 
The Bhagavats teaching is exactly like this 
He attained the path only a very short time ago Yet these bodhisattvas are rm in resolution And without weak will They have been practicing the bodhisattva path For immeasurable kalpas They are skilled at difcult discussions And their minds are free from fear They are resolute and persevering They are handsome and dignied Praised by the buddhas in the ten directions 
They are good at detailed explanations They did not want to be among the multitudes For they always liked being in meditation And so they lived in the space under the earth In order to seek the buddha path 
Since we heard about this from the Buddha We have no doubts about it But still we entreat you O Buddha to expound it And make it clear for the future 
Anyone in whom doubts awaken And who does not believe in this sutra Will certainly fall into the troubled states of being 
That is why we now entreat you to explain How in such a short time You have led and inspired These innumerable bodhisattvas So that the thought of enlightenment Has awakened in them And they abide in the stage of nonretrogression 
The Lifespan of the Tathāgata Thereupon the Buddha addressed the bodhisattvas and the entire great assembly saying O sons of a virtuous family 
You should believe the true words of the Tathāgata He addressed the great assembly again saying 
You should believe the Tathāgatas true words He repeated this to them saying 
You should believe the Tathāgatas true words Then the great assembly of bodhisattvas headed by Maitreya addressed the Buddha with their palms pressed together saying O Bhagavat We entreat you to explain it 
We will accept the Buddhas words After they had spoken in this way three times they again said We entreat you to explain it 
We will accept the Buddhas words Then the Bhagavat realizing that the bodhisattvas continued to entreat him after those three times addressed them saying Listen carefully to the Tathāgatas secret and transcendent powers 
The devas humans and asuras in all the worlds all think that the present Buddha ākyamuni left the palace of the ākyas sat on the terrace of enlightenment not far from the city of Gayā and attained highest complete enlightenment 
However O sons of a virtuous family immeasurable limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas have passed since I actually attained buddhahood 
Suppose there were a man who ground ve hundreds of thousands myriads of koṭis of nayutas of incalculable great manifold cosmos into particles While passing through ve hundred thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of incalculable lands to the east he dropped just a single particle and in this way he continued to drop the particles as he went toward the east until they were all gone 
O sons of a virtuous family 
What do you think about this 
Can one imagine all of these worlds calculate and know their number or not Bodhisattva Maitreya and the others together addressed the Buddha saying 
These worlds are immeasurable limitless incalculable and beyond our powers of conception 
Even all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas with their knowledge free from corruption are not able to comprehend them or know their number 
O Bhagavat 
Such worlds as these are incalculable and limitless Then the Buddha addressed the assembly of the great bodhisattvas saying O sons of a virtuous family 
I will now explain it clearly to you 
Suppose all these worlds whether or not a particle was left in them were reduced to particles and each particle represented a kalpa The period of time since I became a buddha would exceed this by hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of incalculable kalpas 
Since then I have constantly been residing in the sahā world teaching the Dharma and inspiring sentient beings I have also been leading and beneting sentient beings in incalculable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of other worlds O sons of a virtuous family 
During this interim I explained about the Buddha Dīpaṃkara and others Furthermore I also said that they had entered parinirvāṇa I have explained such things through skillful means O sons of a virtuous family 
If any sentient being comes to me I perceive the dullness or sharpness of his faith and other faculties with my buddhaeye According to the way I should bring them to the path I myself proclaim different names and lifespans in various places In each case I have also clearly stated that I would enter parinirvāṇa Through various skillful means I have explained subtle teachings and have made the sentient beings rejoice 
To those beings whom the Tathāgata perceives as taking pleasure in the inferior teachings who have few qualities and grave delements he teaches that the Buddha attained highest complete enlightenment after he re nounced household life in his young age However it has been a very long time indeed since I attained buddhahood I give such an explanation only to lead and inspire the sentient beings to enter the buddha path through skillful means O sons of a virtuous family 
The sutras that the Tathāgata has expounded are all to save the sentient beings Whether the Tathāgata teaches about himself or others whether he reveals his form or that of others whether he shows his acts or those of others everything he says is true never false 
Why is this 
Because the Tathāgata perceives all the marks of the triple world as they really are that there is no birth and death coming or going that there is also no existence or extinction in the world truth or falsehood sameness or difference The Tathāgata does not view the triple world as sentient beings in the triple world see it The Tathāgata perceives such things clearly and without mistakes 
Since sentient beings have various natures desires behaviors thoughts and distinctions the Tathāgata wanting to cause them to plant roots of good merit has explained various teachings through a variety of examples explanations and illustrations 
He has not desisted from doing buddha acts even for a single moment and in this way it has been an extremely long time since I attained buddhahood My lifespan is immeasurable and incalculable 
The lifespan that I rst attained through practicing the bodhisattva path has not yet expired It is twice as great as the number previously mentioned 
Although I do not actually enter parinirvāṇa I proclaim that I do It is through this skillful means that the Tathāgata leads and inspires sentient beings 
Why is this 
Because if the Buddha abides a long time in this world those who have few qualities do not plant roots of good merit acquire poor and supercial characters are attached to the desires of the ve senses and enter into the web of illusions and false views 
If they see the Tathāgata always existing without extinction they then become proud selfwilled and negligent The thought that the Buddha is difcult to meet and that he is to be respected cannot awaken in them 
That is why the Tathāgata teaches through skillful means saying O monks You should know that the appearance of the buddhas in the world is very difcult to encounter 
Because some of those with little merit may not see the Buddha during the passage of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas For this reason I say O monks 
It is difcult to meet the Tathāgata Hearing such words the thought that it is very difcult to meet the Tathāgata will certainly awaken in these sentient beings Longing and yearning for the Buddha they will plant roots of good merit 
For this reason although the Tathāgata does not really pass into extinction he nevertheless says he does 
Furthermore O sons of a virtuous family the teaching of all the Buddha Tathāgatas is exactly like this It is entirely true never false all for the sake of saving sentient beings 
Suppose there were an excellent doctor He is wise knowledgeable his prescriptions are effective and he has skillfully cured a variety of diseases 
This man has many sons say ten twenty or even one hundred in number For some reason he has to go far off to another country and while he is away his children whom he has left behind drink some poison 
The poison starts to take effect and they roll on the ground in agony 
At this moment their father returns home Some of the children who have taken the poison are delirious while others are not Seeing their father in the distance they all rejoice greatly and kneeling respectfully address him saying It is good that you have returned safely 
We entreat you to cure and save us and restore us to life Seeing his children suffering in this way the father searches for benecial herbs possessed of good color aroma and avor according to the medical manual Blending them together after grinding and sifting he gives the mixture to the children and says This is an extremely benecial medicine with good color aroma and avor 
The remaining children those who are delirious seeing their father coming to them rejoice and ask him to seek a cure for their illness Although he offers them the medicine they will not take it 
Why is this 
The poison has so deeply penetrated them that they have become delirious They do not think that the medicine with good color and aroma is good 
The father thinks These children are to be pitied The poison has completely warped their minds 
Although they rejoiced upon seeing me and sought a cure they will not take this benecial medicine 
I will now cause them to take this medicine through skillful means Then he says to them 
Having left these instructions he goes to another country and sends a messenger back home to tell them Your father has already died Upon hearing that their father is dead the children become very distressed and think If our father had lived he would have taken pity on us and protected us But now abandoning us he has died in a distant country 
The father hearing that all his children have completely recovered immediately returns and makes his appearance The Buddha then asked the bodhisattvas O sons of a virtuous family 
Do you think there is anyone who would say that this good doctor is guilty of lying The bodhisattvas replied 
No we do not O Bhagavat The Buddha said I am just like this Since I became a buddha immeasurable limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of incalculable kalpas have passed Though for the sake of sentient beings I use skillful means and say that I will enter parinirvāṇa there is no one who could rightly say that I am guilty of falsehood Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
Since I attained buddhahood Immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads Of koṭis of incalculable kalpas have passed I have been constantly teaching the Dharma Through these immeasurable kalpas Leading and inspiring Innumerable koṭis of sentient beings And enabling them to enter the buddha path 
Using skillful means I have manifested the state of nirvana To bring sentient beings to this path Yet I have not actually entered nirvana But continually abide here expounding the Dharma 
Although I am always among these erring beings With my transcendent powers I prevent them from seeing me 
The sentient beings Seeing me enter perfect extinction Earnestly revere my relics And lled with longing Yearn for me 
When the sentient beings become Sincere mild and receptive And wanting wholeheartedly to meet the Buddha Are willing to give unsparingly Of their bodies and lives Then I together with the sangha Will appear on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa 
Although I am always here without extinction Through the power of skillful means I manifest extinction and nonextinction 
Not knowing this you only think That I have entered parinirvāṇa 
I see all sentient beings Submerged in the ocean of suffering That is why by not manifesting my form I cause them to yearn for me Then after awakening this longing I appear and expound the Dharma Such are my transcendent powers 
For innumerable kalpas I have constantly resided On Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa and elsewhere 
When sentient beings see themselves Amidst a conagration At the end of a kalpa It is in fact my tranquil land Always full of devas and humans 
All the gardens and palaces Are adorned with various gems The jeweled trees abound with owers and fruits And the sentient beings are joyful among them 
The devas beat heavenly drums Making constant and varied music They rain down māndārava owers Upon the Buddha and the great assembly 
Although my Pure Land never decays The sentient beings see it as ravaged by re And torn with anxiety and distress They believe it is lled with these things 
Because of their misdeeds These erring sentient beings do not hear The name of the Three Treasures For incalculable kalpas 
But all who cultivate merit And are receptive and honest Will see me residing here Expounding the Dharma 
For the sake of these sentient beings I teach that the lifespan Of the Buddha is immeasurable To those who after a long time Finally see the Buddha I teach that it is difcult to meet him 
Such is the power of my wisdom The light of my wisdom illuminates immeasurably And my lifespan is of innumerable kalpas This has been achieved through long practice 
You wise ones do not give in to doubt Banish all doubt forever The Buddhas words are true never false 
It is like the physician Who proclaimed his own death Although it was untrue He did this to cure his delirious sons Through excellent skillful means So no one could say he really spoke falsehood 
I also being the father of the world Cure those who suffer To the deluded and unenlightened I say that I have entered nirvana Although in fact I am really here 
For if they were to see me They would become lazy and arrogant Attached to the desires of the ve senses They would fall into the troubled states of being 
Always aware of which sentient beings Practice the path and which do not I teach the Dharma in various ways According to their ability to be saved 
By what means can I cause sentient beings to be able to Enter the highest path And quickly attain the Dharma 
Description of Merits Thereupon when the great assembly heard the Buddha explain that his lifespan was of such a great number of kalpas an immeasurable limitless incalculable number of sentient beings were greatly beneted 
Then the Bhagavat addressed Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mai treya saying O Ajita 
When I explained the great length of this Tathāgatas life span sentient beings equal to the sands of the six hundred and eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers in number gained understanding of the truth of the non origination of all dharmas 
Furthermore a thousand times this number of bodhisattva mahāsattvas attained the power of recollecting what they hear and bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the number of particles in one world attained unhindered eloquence 
Moreover there were bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the particles in one world who attained the power of tenacious memory which revolves hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of immeasurable times 
There were also bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the number of particles in the great manifold cosmos who turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma and bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the number of particles in two mediumsized manifold cosmos who turned the puried wheel of the Dharma 
Furthermore there were bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the number of particles in one smallsized cosmos who will be able to attain highest complete enlightenment after eight births bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the number of particles in the four fourfold continents who will attain highest complete enlightenment after four births bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the number of particles in the threefold four continents who will attain highest complete enlightenment after three births bodhisattva mahā sattvas equal to the number of particles in the twofold four continents who will attain highest complete enlightenment after two births and bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the number of particles in the four continents who will attain highest complete enlightenment after one birth 
Moreover there were sentient beings equal to the number of particles in the eightfold great manifold cosmos in all of whom the thought of highest complete enlightenment had awakened When the Buddha explained that these bodhisattva mahā sattvas had attained deep insight into the Dharma māndārava and great māndārava owers rained down from the sky scattering over the buddhas who were seated on lion seats under immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of jeweled trees and they scattered over ākyamuni Buddha and the Tathāgata Pra bhū taratna who had attained parinirvāṇa long ago both of whom were sitting on the lion seat in a sevenjeweled stupa they also scattered over all of the great bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly 
Finely powdered sandalwood and aloeswood incense also rained down and heavenly drums resounded in the sky with a deep and beautiful sound 
One thousand kinds of heavenly garments draped with strings of pearl jewels and wishfullling gems  rained down lling the nine directions 
Priceless incense burned in various jeweled incense holders and its fragrance spread spontaneously throughout the great assembly as an offering 
Above each buddha there were bodhisattvas holding banners and umbrellas that extended upward to the Brahma world 
These bodhisattvas praised the buddhas by singing immeasurable verses with beautiful voices 
Then Bodhisattva Maitreya rose from his seat leaving his right shoulder bared faced the Buddha with the palms of his hands pressed together and spoke these verses The Buddha has taught this marvelous Dharma That we have never heard before The Bhagavat has great powers And his lifespan is immeasurable 
Innumerable heirs of the Buddha Attained the benet of the Dharma After hearing the Bhagavats explanation And became completely lled with joy 
Some attained unhindered eloquence And others the power of tenacious memory Which revolves many koṭis of times 
There were also bodhisattvas Equal to the number of particles In the great cosmos Who each turned the irreversible wheel Of the Dharma 
There were also bodhisattvas Equal to the number of particles In a medium cosmos Who each turned the puried Wheel of the Dharma 
There were also bodhisattvas Equal to the number of particles In a small cosmos Who after eight births Will complete the buddha path 
There were also bodhisattvas Equal to four times three times And two times the number of particles In the four continents Who after four three and two births Will attain buddhahood 
There were also bodhisattvas Equal to the number of particles In the four continents Who will obtain omniscience After one birth And sentient beings having heard about The great length of the Buddhas lifespan Attained immeasurable results That were pure and without corruption 
There were also sentient beings Equal to the number of particles In the eight worlds In whom having heard about the lifespan of the Buddha The thought of highest enlightenment awakened 
The Bhagavat has taught the Dharma That is immeasurable and inconceivable And from which come benets As limitless as space 
Heavenly māndārava And great māndārava owers rained down And akras and Brahmas Came from innumerable buddha lands Equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River 
Sandalwood and aloeswood powder Scattered like birds in the sky Flying in all directions And rained down over the buddhas 
Heavenly drums resounded spontaneously And beautifully in the air And thousands of myriads of koṭis Of heavenly garments oated whirling down 
Precious incense was burned In various jeweled incense holders Its fragrance naturally penetrating everywhere In homage to the Bhagavats 
The great assembly of these bodhisattvas Held myriads of koṭis of tall and beautiful Sevenjeweled banners and umbrellas Which extended gradually to the Brahma world 
They hung jeweled ags and excellent banners In the presence of each of these buddhas And chanted thousands of myriads of verses In praise of the Tathāgatas 
Such things had never been Experienced before Hearing of the Buddhas Immeasurable lifespan all rejoiced And the Buddhas name being heard Throughout the ten directions Sentient beings were greatly beneted 
Everyone became endowed With the roots of good merit And the thought of highest complete enlightenment Awakened in them 
At that time the Buddha addressed Bodhisattva Mahā sattva Maitreya saying O Ajita 
Those sentient beings who hear about the great length of the Buddhas lifespan and can awaken even a single thought of willing acceptance will all obtain immeasurable merit 
If there are sons and daughters of a good family who for the sake of highest complete enlightenment practice the ve perfections of giving  good conduct  perseverance  effort  and meditation  with the exception of the perfection of wisdom  for eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas their merit is not even a hundredth a thousandth a hundred thousandth of a myriad of a koṭi of the former persons merit It is so small that it cannot be conceived of through calculation or illustration 
If there are sons and daughters of a virtuous family who possess such merit as the former they will never revert from highest complete enlightenment Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses Those who seek the Buddhas wisdom Will practice the ve perfections For eighty myriads of koṭis Of nayutas of kalpas 
Throughout these kalpas they will pay homage to The buddhas pratyekabuddhas śrāvakas And all the bodhisattvas by offering Rare delicacies excellent garments and bedding Or by building monasteries out of sandalwood Which are adorned with gardens 
Through offering such a variety of precious things Throughout all of these kalpas They will transfer the merits to the buddha path 
Those who further maintain good conduct Which is pure and without corruption Will seek what the buddhas Have praised as the highest path 
Those who further practice perseverance And abide in the stage of selfcontrol Will be of constant mind Even if subjected to illtreatment 
They will continue to endure Even if they are scorned and persecuted By those who think through their excessive pride That they have attained the truth 
Those who make diligent efforts And are rm in their intentions For immeasurable koṭis of kalpas Will be intent and never lazy And those who abide in tranquil places For immeasurable kalpas Will always discipline their minds avoiding sleep While either sitting or wandering 
For these reasons they will Abide in various meditations Their minds rm and unwavering For eighty myriads of koṭis of kalpas 
Maintaining the merit of this concentration They seek the highest path saying I will attain omniscience 
Practicing thus for hundreds of thousands Of myriads of koṭis of kalpas Their merits will be as mentioned above 
If those sons and daughters of a virtuous family Upon hearing me explain about my lifespan In this way are able to awaken Even a single thought of willing acceptance Their merit exceeds that of the former 
Such will also be the merit Of those who have no doubts whatsoever And believe deeply even for a single moment 
Those bodhisattvas who practice the path For a period of immeasurable kalpas And who believe my explanation of my lifespan When they hear it are the ones Who fully accept this sutra Saying Let us in the future devote a long life To saving sentient beings 
Just as the present Bhagavat King among the ākyas who roars the lions roar On the terrace of enlightenment Is fearless in teaching the Dharma Let us in the future be respected by all And teach of the lifespan While seated upon the terrace of enlightenment 
Those who have profound thoughts are pure Honest and learned have good recollection And understand the Buddhas words in accordance With what is appropriate Will have no doubts regarding this 
Furthermore O Ajita those who hear of the great length of the Buddhas lifespan and understand the intent of these words will obtain limitless merit that will give rise to the highest wisdom of the Tathāgata 
How much more merit will they gain who extensively hear this sutra move others to listen to it preserve it move others to preserve it copy it or move others to copy it and pay homage to the sutra by offering owers incense necklaces ags banners canopies lamps of scented oil and ghee The merit of these people will be immeasurable and limitless They will be able to achieve omniscience O Ajita 
Those sons and daughters of a virtuous family who hearing me teach the great length of the Buddhas lifespan wholeheartedly accept it will see the Buddha who always dwells on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa together with the great bodhisattvas and śrāvakas teaching the Dharma to the assembly 
Moreover they will see the land of this sahā world which is made of lapis lazuli level and even The network of roads is laid out like a chessboard paved with Jambūnāda gold and bordered with jeweled trees All its foundations towers and balconies will be made of treasures and the multitude of these bodhisattvas will be dwelling in them 
Those who can see such things should know that to be able to do so is a sign of their full and willing acceptance Furthermore after the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa those who hear this sutra do not disparage it and rejoice in their hearts should know that this is a sign of their full and willing acceptance How much more do those who recite and preserve this sutra show a sign of full and willing acceptance Such are the people who hold the Tathāgata in respect 
These sons and daughters of a virtuous family do not have to build stupas and monasteries for me make chambers for the monks or pay homage to the sangha with the four kinds of offerings 
Why is this 
Because these sons and daughters of a virtuous family recite and preserve this sutra which means they have already built stupas made chambers for the monks and paid homage to the sangha 
They have already erected sevenjeweled stupas for the Buddhas relics which are tall and wide gradually narrowing to a pinnacle that reaches to the Brahma world They have hung various banners canopies and variegated jeweled bells offered owers incense necklaces scented powder and ointment burned incense played drums music utes pipes harps and various dances and adorned the stupas and relics of the Buddha by praising with verses and songs in beautiful voices In this way they have already paid homage for immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas O Ajita 
After my parinirvāṇa those who hear this sutra and who can preserve it copy it and move others to copy it have already built chambers for monks as well as thirtytwo red sandalwood monasteries of the height of eight tāla trees wide and ne housing hundreds of thousands of monks The monasteries they have built have gardens ponds paths for wandering meditation caves garments food and drink bedding medicine and are replete with all other necessities 
Such hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of monks chambers and towers will be incalculable With these they pay homage to me and to the assembly of monks 
I have explained that for this reason after the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa those who preserve and recite this sutra and explain it to others who copy it or move others to copy it and who pay it homage to it no longer have to build stupas monasteries or erect chambers for the monks or revere the sangha How much less do those who preserve this sutra and practice the perfections of giving  good conduct  perseverance  effort  meditation  and wisdom need to do so Their merit is the highest immeasurable and limitless 
It is immeasurable and limitless in the same way that space is immeasurable and limitless in the ten directionseast west south north the four intermediate directions and the zenith and nadirand they will thus quickly obtain omniscience 
Those who recite and preserve this sutra who explain it for others who copy it or move others to copy it build monuments and make chambers for monks revere and praise the sangha of śrāvakas and praise the merits of the bodhisattvas in hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of ways those who explain this Lotus Sutra for the sake of others in accordance with its meaning through various illustrations who preserve pure conduct and dwell together with gentle people who are patient and have no anger are rm in their intentions and always hold meditation in high regard who attain profound samādhi and make vigorous efforts persevere in all good practices whose wisdom is keen and who answer difcult questions skillfully O Ajita 
Those sons and daughters of a virtuous family who preserve and recite this sutra after my parinirvāṇa will attain good qualities like those mentioned above You should know that such people have already set out for the terrace of enlightenment are near to highest complete enlightenment and are seated under the bodhi tree O Ajita 
Wherever these sons and daughters of a virtuous family sit stand or walk there a monument should be built and all of the devas and humans should pay homage to these monuments as they would do to those of the Buddha Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
If after my parinirvāṇa there are people Who preserve this sutra They will have immeasurable merits As described above 
They have built stupas for the relics Adorned with the seven treasures With a pole on the top which is very tall and thick Gradually tapering upward Until it reaches the Brahma world These stupas have been adorned With thousands of myriads of koṭis of jeweled bells That ring with beautiful sounds as the wind blows 
For immeasurable kalpas such people Have revered these stupas By offering owers incense necklaces Heavenly garments and various kinds of music While burning scented ointments and butteroil lamps Which illuminate them on all sides 
In the troubled world of the Decadent Dharma Those who preserve this sutra Will have already nished paying homage In the way just described 
If they can preserve this sutra It will be as if they had paid homage In the presence of the Buddha And had built monasteries for monks Out of sandalwood from Mount Oxhead And thirtytwo buildings as tall As eight tāla trees and offered delicious food Excellent garments bedding hundreds of Thousands of dwellings gardens ponds Paths for wandering and meditation caves All of ne quality 
Those who have the thought of willing acceptance Who preserve recite copy Or move others to copy this sutra And who pay it homage By scattering owers incense and scented powders on it And by constantly lighting lamps of Fragrant oil made from sumanas owers Campaka wood and atimukta grass Those who pay it homage in this way Will attain immeasurable merit 
Their merit will be as limitless As empty space 
How much more is the merit Of those who preserve this sutra Who carry out the practice of giving  Good conduct  perseverance  and meditation  Who never get angry or slander others Who honor monuments And are humble before monks And who are free from pride Always contemplate wisdom Never get angry at difcult questions And teach in accordance With the questioners capacity If there is anyone Who can carry out these practices Their merit will be immeasurable 
If one were to see such an expounder of the Dharma Who has perfected merits like these One should scatter heavenly owers over him And provide him with heavenly garments Bow until ones forehead touches his feet And think of him as if he were a buddha 
Furthermore one should think That before long the expounder of the Dharma Will approach the terrace of enlightenment Attain the unconditioned state of noncorruption And extensively benet devas and humans Wherever he dwells walks or sits Or recites even a single verse A stupa should be built Made beautiful with adornments And paid homage in various ways 
Wherever the heirs of the Buddha may reside There the Buddha himself will take pleasure in its use And will always be dwelling Walking and sitting within 
The Merits of Joyful Acceptance Thereupon Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha saying 
If sons and daughters of a virtuous family rejoice in hearing this sutra how much merit do they acquire And he spoke in verse saying 
After the Bhagavats parinirvāṇa If there is anyone who hears this sutra And rejoices in it How much merit do they acquire 
Then the Buddha addressed Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Maitreya saying O Ajita 
After the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa suppose those monks nuns laymen and laywomen and other wise ones whether old or young having rejoiced in hearing this sutra take leave of the Dharma assembly and go to other placeseither dwelling in monasteries or tranquil places cities towns villages or forestsand teach what they have heard to their parents relatives good friends and acquaintances according to the various capacities of these people 
Having heard the teaching they will rejoice and go on to teach it to others 
These people having heard it will also joyfully teach it to others in turn and so it continues in this way until it reaches the ftieth person 
I will now explain about the merit which this ftieth son or daughter of a virtuous family acquires from joyful acceptance You should listen attentively 
Suppose that in the four hundreds of myriads of koṭis of incalculable worlds there are sentient beings in the six transmigratory states and of the four modes of birthborn from an egg born from the womb from moisture or born spontaneouslyeither with or without form either with or without consciousness either unconscious or not unconscious having no legs two four or many legs and that among the number of such beings there is a person who seeks to acquire merit and gives pleasurable things to these beings according to their desire He gives each of those sentient beings gold silver lapis lazuli motherofpearl agate coral amber and other treasures such as would ll this continent of Jambudvīpa as well as elephant carts horse carts and palaces and towers made out of the seven treasures Having performed such acts of giving for a full eighty years this great donor thinks I have already given these sentient beings such pleasurable things as they wished 
They are over eighty years old with white hair and wrinkles and they will die before long I should now instruct them by means of the BuddhaDharma He immediately gathers these sentient beings together inspires them by proclaiming the Dharma and gladdens them by revealing its benets In an instant they all successively attain the rst stage of the śrāvakas called streamwinner  the second stage called oncereturner the third stage called nonreturner  and nally the stage of the arhat free from corruption entering profound meditations gaining complete mastery of all and attaining the eight liberations 
Has this great donor acquired abundant merit or not Maitreya addressed the Buddha saying 
The donors merit is extremely great immeasurable and limitless 
Even if this donor had only given all those pleasurable things to sentient beings the merit would have been immeasurable 
How much greater is this donors merit after having caused them to attain arhatship The Buddha addressed Maitreya saying I will now clarify this for you This person has given all these pleasurable things to the sentient beings in the six states of existence in four hundreds of myriads of koṭis of incalculable worlds and enabled them to attain arhatship The merit he has attained cannot be compared with that of even the ftieth person who after hearing even a single verse of the Lotus Sutra received it with joy 
O Ajita In this way the merit attained by even the ftieth person who rejoiced in hearing this Lotus Sutra is immeasurable limitless and incalculable How much more so is the merit of the rst person who heard it in the assembly and rejoiced in it His merit is even greater it is immeasurable limitless and incalculable and is not to be apprehended through metaphor 
Furthermore O Ajita if anyone approaches the monasteries in order to listen to this sutra and hears it for even a single moment whether seated or standing through this merit they will be reborn into a place where they will gain beautiful and excellent elephant carts horse carts palanquins made out of rare treasures and will ride on a heavenly vehicle 
Moreover if anyone sits in a place where the Dharma is taught and if another comes along and they invite that person to sit down and listen or if they offer that person part of their own seat through this merit they will be reborn in the place where akra dwells in the place where Brahmas dwell or in a place where a noble emperor dwells O Ajita If anyone addresses others saying 
They will have no disagreeable features Their noses will never be at or thin crooked or twisted They will never be darkcomplected with a narrow or long face that is hollowcheeked or twisted They will have no mark that is displeasing to others 
The merit of that person who moved others to listen to the Dharma is like this How much more is the merit of those who singlemindedly listen teach and recite the sutra explain it for others in the great assembly and practice as they explain to others Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
If anyone hears this sutra In the Dharma assembly And joyfully teaches others Even a single verse And if in this way it is taught from one person To another until it reaches the ftieth one The merit that this last person will attain Shall be as I will now explain 
Suppose there were a great donor Who gave things to an immeasurable number Of people as they wished For a full eighty years 
He will see that they are old and feeble With white hair and wrinkled faces With gaps between their teeth and withered bodies And that they will die before long He will think that he should now Teach them and enable them To attain the fruits Of the buddha path 
He will teach nirvana the True Dharma Through skillful means saying The world is impermanent Like splashes of water bubbles a mirage The feeling of repulsion for it Should quickly awaken in you 
All of them hearing this teaching Attain arhatship and perfect The six transcendent powers the three sciences And the eight liberations 
The merit of the ftieth person Who joyfully hears a single verse Is so much greater than this great donors That it is beyond illustration 
The merit of those who successively hear The Lotus Sutra in this way is immeasurable How much more is the merit of the rst person Who heard it with joy amid the Dharma assembly 
If there is a person who moves another To listen to the Lotus Sutra saying This sutra is profound and difcult to encounter Even in thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas And if this persons urging is accepted And the other one goes to hear it And listens for a single moment The merit that the former person will acquire Shall be as I will now explain 
Life after life they will have No diseases of the mouth Their teeth will have no gaps Nor be yellow or black Their lips will be neither fat thick Or thin nor will they ever have A disagreeable countenance And their tongues will never be Dry black or short Their noses will be high long and straight 
I will now explain the merit Of the one who approaches the monastery Wanting to hear the Lotus Sutra And who joyfully listens to it Even for a single moment 
Later they will be born among devas and humans And will acquire beautiful elephant and horse carts And palanquins made out of rare treasures And will ride on a heavenly vehicle 
If one is where the Dharma is taught And invites another to sit there And listen to the sutra Through the merit which is thus acquired One will attain the seats of akra Brahma or the noble emperors 
How much more is the merit of a person Who singlemindedly listens to this sutra Explains its meaning and practices In accordance with its teaching Their merit will thus be limitless 
The Benets Obtained by an Expounder of the Dharma Thereupon the Buddha addressed Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Satata sa mitā bhiyukta saying If sons or daughters of a virtuous family preserve this Lotus Sutra recite explain and copy it they will attain eight hundred qualities of the eye twelve hundred qualities of the ear eight hundred qualities of the nose twelve hundred qualities of the tongue eight hundred qualities of the body and twelve hundred qualities of the mind These qualities will adorn the six sense faculties purifying them all 
Through the natural bodily eyes given them by their parents which are thus puried those sons and daughters of a virtuous family will see the mountains forests rivers and oceans both within and beyond the great manifold cosmos all the way from the lowest hell up as far as the highest summit of the universe 
They will also see all the sentient beings there perceive and know the causes and consequences of their deeds and of their states of birth Then the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate upon the meaning of this further spoke these verses Listen to the qualities Of those in the great assembly Who can fearlessly teach This Lotus Sutra 
Such people will attain The eight hundred qualities Of the excellent eye Adorned with these qualities Their eyes are extremely pure 
With the eyes given by their parents They see both all the manifold cosmos Within and beyond Mount Meru Sumeru up to Mount Cakravāḍa And many other mountains Forests oceans rivers and streams Down to the lowest hell And up to the summit of the universe 
There they see all the sentient beings Although they have not yet Attained the divine eyes Their power of sight will be like this

The ear given by the parents Is pure and spotless With this natural ear They hear the sounds of the manifold cosmos 
They hear the sounds of elephants Horses carts and cows The sounds of gongs bells conches Drums and vīṇās The sounds of harps bamboo pipes and utes Pure and pleasing songs And even though they hear these They are not attached to them They hear innumerable kinds of human voices And yet they are able to discriminate them 
Furthermore they hear divine sounds Subtle melodies male and female voices The sounds of boys and girls 
They also hear the cries of the kalaviṅka And jīvakajīvaka birds in the mountains Around the rivers or in deep valleys 
They hear as well various sounds of pain And suffering from the hells And sounds of hungry ghosts Who suffering from hunger and thirst Are in search of food and drink When the asuras living along the ocean Speak to each other and utter great cries Such expounders of the Dharma living here Hear all of these various voices from afar And yet their faculty of hearing is unharmed

The expounders of the Dharma dwelling here Also hear the voices in the bhāsvara And ubhakṛtsna Heavens above the Brahma world All the way up to the summit of the universe

Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta Thereupon the Buddha addressed Bodhisattva Mahā sattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta 
You should know that as I have previously explained those who revile disparage or slander monks nuns lay men and laywomen who preserve the Lotus Sutra will sow a bitter harvest as I have just taught the merit attained by preserving the Lotus Sutra will result in the pure faculties of the eye ear nose tongue body and mind 
O Mahāsthāmaprāpta in the past immeasurable limitless inconceivable and incalculable kalpas ago there was a buddha called Bhīṣmagarjita svararāja a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
His land was called Mahāsaṃbhavā and the kalpa was named Vinirbhoga 
The Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja expounded the Dharma for the devas humans and asuras in his world To those who sought the śrāvaka vehicle he expounded the Dharma in accordance with the Four Noble Truths ferried them from birth old age illness and death and ultimately led them to nirvana 
To those who sought the pratyekabuddha vehicle he expounded the Dharma in accordance with the twelvelinked chain of dependent origination 
To the bodhisattvas he expounded the Dharma in accordance with the six perfections with reference to highest complete enlightenment and led them to the Buddhas wisdom 
O Mahāsthāmaprāpta the lifespan of the Buddha Bhīṣma gar jita svararāja was as kalpas equal to forty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of sands of the Ganges River 
The True Dharma abided for kalpas equal to the number of particles in Jambudvīpa 
The Semblance Dharma abided for kalpas equal to the number of particles in the four continents 
After having beneted the sentient beings the Buddha entered parinirvāṇa 
After the extinction of the True and Semblance Dharmas there appeared in this land another buddha who was also called Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
In this way there appeared two myriads of koṭis of buddhas one after another all of whom had the same name After the parinirvāṇa of the rst Tathāgata Bhīṣmagar jita svararāja there were excessively proud and overbearing monks in the Age of the Semblance Dharma after the True Dharma had been extinguished 
At that time there was also a monk a bodhisattva called Sadāparibhūta  
O Mahāsthāmaprāpta why was he called Sadāparibhūta 
Because whenever he saw any monk nun layman or laywoman he would praise and pay homage to them saying I deeply respect you I dare not belittle you 
Why is this 
Because all of you practice the bodhisattva path and will become buddhas Furthermore this monk did not concentrate himself on reciting the sutras but only paid homage such that even when he saw the fourfold assembly from afar he would go up to them praise and pay homage to them saying I dare not belittle you because you will all become buddhas In the fourfold assembly there were some whose minds were impure and who became angry and reviled and disparaged him saying 
He says that he himself does not belittle us and predicts that we shall all become buddhas 
We do not need such an idle prediction In this way he wandered about for many years and was always reviled But he never got angry and always said You will become a buddha Whenever he spoke these words people would assail him with sticks or stones he ed from them yet still proclaimed loudly at a distance I dare not belittle you 
When this monk was about to die he heard in the air twenty thousands of myriads of koṭis of verses of the Lotus Sutra expounded previously by the Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja and completely preserving them he attained the purity of the eye and the purity of the ear nose tongue body and mind that were described before 
After having attained these pure faculties his lifespan increased two hundreds of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of years and he taught this Lotus Sutra to the people far and wide 
Then those excessively proud monks nuns laymen and laywomen in the fourfold assembly who had despised him and called him Sadāparibhūta saw that he had attained great transcendent powers the power of joy in eloquence and the power of great virtuous meditation Hearing his teaching all of them believed and followed him 
Furthermore this bodhisattva inspired a thousand myriads of koṭis of sentient beings and caused them to abide in highest complete enlightenment 
After his death he met two thousand koṭis of buddhas all of whom were called Candrasūryapradīpa 
In accordance with his teaching he expounded this Lotus Sutra and for this reason met another two thousand koṭis of buddhas all of whom were called Meghasvararāja He preserved and recited this sutra in accordance with the teaching of these buddhas and expounded it for the sake of the fourfold assembly Thus he attained purity of the natural eye and purity of the ear nose tongue body and mind and taught the Dharma to the fourfold assembly without fear 
O Mahāsthāmaprāpta this Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta respected honored praised and paid homage to all these buddhas Having planted roots of good merit he again met thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas and he expounded this sutra over again in accordance with the teaching of those buddhas Having perfected his merits he attained buddhahood 
O Mahāsthāmaprāpta what do you think about this 
Was Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta of that time someone unknown to you 
He was none other than I myself 
If I had not preserved and recited this sutra and taught it to others in my previous lives I would not have swiftly attained highest complete enlightenment 
Because I preserved and recited this sutra and taught it to others in the presence of previous buddhas I swiftly attained highest complete enlightenment 
O Mahāsthāmaprāpta then the fourfold assembly of monks nuns laymen and laywomen who became angry and disparaged me did not as a consequence meet a buddha for two hundred koṭis of kalpas nor did they hear the Dharma or see the Sangha They suffered greatly in the Avīci Hell for a thousand kalpas 
After having been freed from the consequences of their errors they nally met Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta who led and inspired them to highest complete enlightenment O Mahāsthāmaprāpta what do you think about this 
Were those in the fourfold assembly of that time who disparaged this bodhisattva persons unknown to you 
They are the ve hundred bodhisattvas in this assembly beginning with Bhadrapāla the ve hundred nuns beginning with Siṃhacandrā and the ve hundred laymen beginning with Sugatacetanā all of whom will never turn back on the path to highest complete enlightenment 
O Mahāsthāmaprāpta know that this Lotus Sutra will greatly benet the bodhisattva mahāsattvas and lead them to highest complete enlightenment 
For this reason after the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa the bodhisattva mahāsattvas should always preserve recite explain and copy this sutra Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses In the past there was a buddha Called Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja He had immeasurable transcendent powers Led and guided all sentient beings And was paid homage by devas humans and nāgas 
After the parinirvāṇa of this buddha When the True Dharma faced extinction There was a bodhisattva called Sadāparibhūta 
At that time the fourfold assembly Was becoming attached To its own interpretation of the Dharma 
Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta Would approach them and say I do not belittle you Practice the path And you will all become buddhas After hearing this All the people insulted and disparaged him But Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta Patiently bore this 
As he neared the time of his death When he had expiated his past errors He was able to hear this sutra And his six sense faculties became pure 
Through his transcendent powers He prolonged his life And explained this sutra far and wide Acting once again for the benet of others 
Those who were attached To their own interpretations of the Dharma Were led and inspired by this bodhisattva And were enabled to abide Within the buddha path 
Because he explained this sutra He attained immeasurable happiness Gradually accumulating his merits He quickly attained the buddha path 
Because the fourfold assembly Which was then attached to Particular aspects of the Dharma Heard Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta say You will all become buddhas They have since met innumerable buddhas 
Those people are none other Than the ve hundred bodhisattvas And laymen and laywomen of pure belief Who are now gathered before me In this assembly to hear the Dharma 
In my previous lives I taught them And led them to hear and accept this sutra Which is the ultimate Dharma 
I revealed it and taught it to others And caused them to abide in nirvana Throughout many lifetimes they preserved and kept A sutra such as this 
Only after myriads of koṭis of koṭis Of kalpas have passed A time inconceivable Can they hear this Lotus Sutra 
Only after myriads of koṭis of koṭis Of kalpas have passed A time inconceivable Do the Buddha Bhagavats Expound this sutra 
For this reason all you practitioners Who hear this sutra After the nirvana of the Buddha Should feel no doubt about it 
You must wholeheartedly Expound this sutra far and wide You will then meet the buddhas lifetime after lifetime And quickly attain the buddha path 
The Transcendent Powers of the Tathāgata Thereupon the bodhisattva mahāsattvas equal to the number of particles in the great manifold cosmos who had emerged from the earth all in the presence of the Buddha gazed singlemindedly at his face with their palms pressed together and spoke to the Buddha saying 
O Bhagavat after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha we will teach this sutra extensively in the lands of the Bhagavats separate forms at the time of his extinction 
Why is this 
Because we also wish to attain this true pure great Dharma and to preserve recite explain copy and make offerings to it Then the Bhagavat manifested his great transcendent powers in the presence of Mañjuśrī and other immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattva mahāsattvas who had long lived in this sahā world such humans and nonhumans as monks nuns laymen and laywomen devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas 
All the buddhas sitting on the lion seats under the jeweled trees also put out their wide and long tongues and emitted immeasurable rays of light in the same way 
ākyamuni Buddha and the other buddhas under the jeweled trees manifested transcendent powers while fully hundreds of thousands of years passed After this they drew back their tongues coughed and snapped their ngers together in unison 
Those two sounds penetrated throughout the various buddha worlds of the ten directions and the earth quaked in six ways 
Through the transcendent powers of the Buddha all the sentient beings in these worldshumans and such nonhumans as devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragassaw all the buddhas sitting on the lion seats under the immeasurable limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of jeweled trees in this sahā world 
They saw ākyamuni Buddha sitting on the lion seat in the jeweled stupa together with Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna 
They also saw immeasurable limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattva mahāsattvas and the fourfold assembly respectfully surrounding ākyamuni Buddha 
After seeing this they all rejoiced greatly at having attained this unprecedented experience 
At the same time all the devas spoke loudly while in the air saying Beyond these immeasurable limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of incalculable worlds there is a land called Sahā In it is a buddha called ākyamuni For the sake of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas he now teaches the Mahayana sutra called the Lotus Sutra the instruction for bodhisattvas and treasured lore of the buddhas 
You should also honor and pay homage to ākyamuni Buddha Hearing this voice in the air all those sentient beings pressed their palms together faced the sahā world and said We take refuge in ākyamuni Buddha 
We take refuge in ākyamuni Buddha All of them scattered various kinds of owers incense necklaces banners canopies ornaments jewels and other beautiful things over the sahā world from afar 
All that had been scattered formed together from the ten directions like a cloud and was transformed into a jeweled screen that covered all the buddhas 
Then the worlds of the ten directions became pellucid without obstruction as if they were one buddha land 
Thereupon the Buddha addressed the great assembly of bodhisattvas beginning with Viśiṣṭacāritra The transcendent powers of the buddhas are as immeasurable limitless and inconceivable as this Yet if I were to use these transcendent powers to teach the benets of this sutra so that it would be entrusted to you for immeasurable limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of incalculable kalpas I would not be able to reach the end of these qualities 
To sum up in this sutra I have clearly revealed and taught all the teachings of the Tathāgata all the transcendent powers of the Tathāgata all the treasure houses of the hidden essence of the Tathāgata and all the profound aspects of the Tathāgata 
For this reason after the pari nirvāṇa of the Tathāgata you should wholeheartedly preserve recite explain and copy it and practice according to the teaching 
Those who accept recite explain and copy it and practice according to the teaching in whichever land they may be in a place where the sutra abideseither in a garden a forest under a tree in a monks chamber in a laymans house in a palace on a mountain in a valley or in the wildernessin all of these places they should erect and pay homage to a monument 
Why is this 
Because you should know that these places are the terraces of enlightenment where all the buddhas have attained highest complete enlightenment where all the buddhas have turned the wheel of the Dharma and where all the buddhas entered parinirvāṇa Thereupon the Bhagavat wanting to elaborate on the meaning of this further spoke these verses 
The buddhas worldinspirers Abiding in their great transcendent powers Manifest this immeasurable power In order to gladden sentient beings Their tongues reach up to the Brahma world And they emit innumerable rays of light From their bodies They manifest this marvel For those who seek for the buddha path 
The coughing and snapping sounds Of the buddhas are universally heard In the lands of the ten directions The earth quakes in six ways 
Because this sutra can be preserved After the nirvana of the Buddha All the buddhas rejoice and manifest Their immeasurable transcendent powers 
Even if for immeasurable kalpas They praise those who preserve this sutra In order to entrust it They will not reach the limit of their merit 
The qualities of those people are Limitless and endless Just like the boundless sky In the ten directions 
Those who preserve this sutra Have already seen me The Buddha Prabhūtaratna And the various magically created forms And today they see all the bodhisattvas I have led and inspired up until now 
Those who preserve this sutra Will gladden me my magically created forms As well as the Buddha Prabhūtaratna Who has entered nirvana 
They will also see gladden and pay homage to The past and future buddhas and those who are present In the ten directions 
Those who preserve this sutra Will before long attain the Dharma The hidden essence Which was attained by the buddhas Seated upon the terrace of enlightenment 
Those who preserve this sutra Will explain the meaning of the Dharma The names and phrases joyfully and with undying vigor Like the wind in the sky That has no obstruction whatsoever 
After the parinirvāṇa of the Tathāgata They will know the causes and conditions And the sequences of the sutras Taught by the Buddha And will explain the truth In accordance with its meaning 
As the light of the sun and moon Eliminates the darkness These people practicing in the world Will extinguish the blindness of sentient beings Teaching innumerable bodhisattvas To dwell ultimately in the single vehicle 
For this reason The wise hearing of the benets of these merits Should preserve this sutra After my nirvana Those people will be resolute and will Unwaveringly follow the buddha path 
Entrustment Thereupon having arisen from the Dharma seat and manifested his great transcendent powers ākyamuni Buddha caressed the heads of the innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvas with his right hand and addressed them saying For immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of incalculable kalpas I practiced this Dharma of highest complete enlightenment which is hard to attain I now entrust it to you 
You should wholeheartedly spread this teaching and so extensively benet others Having caressed the heads of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas three times in this way he further addressed them saying For immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of incalculable kalpas I practiced this Dharma of highest complete enlightenment which is hard to attain I now entrust it to you 
You should preserve and recite it You should spread this teaching extensively You should let all the sentient beings hear and know it 
Why is this 
Because with his great compassion unstinting and unafraid the Tathāgata gives the wisdom of the Buddha the wisdom of the Tathāgata and the knowledge of the selfarising one to the sentient beings The Tathāgata is nothing but the great donor to all the sentient beings 
You should accordingly practice the teaching of the Tathāgata 
Never allow the thought of avarice to awaken in you If there are sons and daughters of a virtuous family who believe in the wisdom of the Tathāgata in the future you should expound this Lotus Sutra and let them hear and know it so that they may attain the wisdom of the Buddha 
If there are sentient beings who do not accept it you should reveal teach benet and gladden them with the other profound teachings of the Tathāgata 
If you do this you will repay your indebtedness to the Buddha Having heard the Buddha teach this all the bodhisattva mahā sattvas were lled with joy inclined their bodies bowed their heads with increased respect and with their palms pressed together faced the buddhas and uttered these words 
O Bhagavat we entreat you to feel no anxiety All the bodhisattva mahāsattvas uttered these words three times in this way saying We will do as the Bhagavat directs us 
O Bhagavat we entreat you to feel no anxiety At that time in order to cause all the buddhas who were his magically created forms and who had come from the ten directions to return to their own lands ākyamuni Buddha said this All the buddhas should be at ease 
The Buddha Prabhūtaratna will be restored as before When he said this all the innumerable buddhas in their magically created forms from the ten directions sitting on the lion seats under the jeweled trees the Buddha Prabhūtaratna the great assembly of the limitless and incalculable bodhisattvas beginning with Viśiṣṭacāritra the fourfold assemblies of the śrāvakas beginning with āriputra and the devas humans and asuras in all the worlds having heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced greatly 
Ancient Accounts of Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja Thereupon Bodhisattva Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña addressed the Buddha saying 
O Bhagavat why does Bodhisattva Bhaiṣa jyarāja wander in this sahā world 
O Bhagavat this Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja has performed hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of difcult and arduous practices 
Splendid O Bhagavat 
I entreat you to explain it even a little so that all the devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃ naras maho ragas humans and nonhumans and also the assemblies of the bodhisattvas who have come from the other lands and these śrāvakas will rejoice on hearing it Then the Buddha spoke to Bodhisattva Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusu mitābhijña saying 
In the remote past beyond kalpas as immeasurable as the sands of the Ganges River there was a buddha called Candrasūryavimalaprabhāsaśrī an Arhat Completely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
With this buddha were eighty koṭis of great bodhisattva mahā sattvas and an assembly of great śrāvakas as many as the sands of seventytwo Ganges Rivers The lifespan of this buddha was fortytwo thousand kalpas and the lifespans of the bodhisattvas were also equal to this 
In his land there were no women no helldwellers no hungry ghosts no animals no asuras and no calamities 
It was adorned with jeweled trees and was covered with jeweled canopies with various hanging owered banners This world was lled with jeweled vases and incense burners There were platforms made of the seven treasures For each tree there was a platform and each tree stood away from the platform a distance of no more than a bowshot 
All the bodhisattvas and śrāvakas sat under these jeweled trees 
On the top of every jeweled platform were hundreds of koṭis of devas who played divine music and sang in praise and homage to the Buddha 
Then the Buddha expounded the Lotus Sutra for Bodhisattva Sarva rūpasaṃdarśana and numerous other bodhisattvas and śrāvakas Bodhisattva Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana devoted himself entirely to severe practices Following the teachings of the Buddha Candrasūryavimalaprabhāsaśrī he strove and wandered up and down in the singleminded search for enlightenment for a full twelve thousand years and he attained the samādhi called sar va rūpasaṃ darśana After having attained this samādhi he rejoiced a great deal and thought thus 
I have attained the samādhi called sarvarūpasaṃdarśana entirely because of the power I attained through hearing the Lotus Sutra I will now pay homage to the Buddha Candra sūryavimalaprabhāsaśrī and the Lotus Sutra Immediately after he had entered this samādhi māndārava and great māndārava owers and nely powdered solid and black sandalwood fell from the sky lling the air like clouds and raining down upon the earth It also rained the perfume of sandalwood from the inner seacoast of Mount Sumeru 
Having paid homage to the Buddha he emerged from samādhi and thought this I have paid homage to the Buddha using my transcendent power This is however by no means equal to the tribute of offering my body For a full one thousand two hundred years he inhaled the fragrance of sandalwood olibanum frankincense clove aloeswood and glue trees and drank the fragrant oil of campaka owers 
At the same time all the buddhas in these worlds praised him saying 
Splendid splendid O son of a virtuous family This is the true perseverance 
It stands no comparison even if one were to pay tribute with owers perfumes necklaces burning incense scented powders ointments divine silk banners canopies perfumes of sandalwood from the inner seacoast of Mount Sumeru and various other things like this 
It stands no comparison even if one were to offer ones kingdom or wife and children 
O son of a virtuous family this is the supreme offering This is the highest and best of all offerings because you offer the Dharma to the Tathāgatas Having spoken these words all became silent 
His body was alight for one thousand two hundred years After this period passed his body burned out Because he had paid tribute to the Dharma like this Bodhisattva Sarva rūpasaṃdarśana was reborn after his death in the land of the Buddha Candra sūryavimalaprabhāsaśrī He was born spontaneously sitting crosslegged in the house of King Vimaladatta 
Then he immediately spoke these verses for the sake of his father saying O Great King You should now know That I in an instant attained The samādhi called sarvarūpasaṃdarśana In the place where I wandered And practicing with enthusiasm and perseverance I set aside this my beloved body 
I have paid homage to the Bhagavat In order to attain the utmost wisdom After having spoken these verses he addressed his father saying The Buddha Candrasūryavimalaprabhāsaśrī is now in this world 
Having previously paid homage to the Buddha I attained the dhāraṇī of understanding the speech of all sentient beings and heard eight hundred thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of verses and tens of billions of verses hundreds of billions of verses and thousands of billions of verses of the Lotus Sutra 
O Great King I will now once again pay homage to this buddha Having spoken this he sat on the sevenjeweled platform and ascended into the air as high as seven tāla trees Having come before the Buddha he bowed until his forehead touched the Buddhas feet He praised the Buddha in verse with his ten ngers pressed together saying 
O Bhagavat The Bhagavat is yet in this world Then the Buddha Candrasūryavimalaprabhāsaśrī said to Bodhisattva Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana O son of a virtuous family 
I ask you now to prepare my bed I will enter parinirvāṇa tonight The Buddha said again to Bodhisattva Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana O son of a virtuous family 
I entrust you with the BuddhaDharma and all the bodhisattvas and great śrāvakas as well as the Dharma for highest complete enlightenment I will also entrust you with the sevenjeweled world all the jeweled trees jeweled platforms and the devas who are my servants in the great manifold cosmos 
At that very time the great manifold cosmos quaked in six ways It rained jeweled owers from the heavens and all the devas and humans experienced an unprecedented marvel The Buddha addressed Bodhisattva Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña saying What do you think about this 
Is Bodhisattva Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana someone unknown to you 
He is none other than this Bodhisattva Bhaiṣa jyarāja 
He undertook the practice of giving by abandoning his body immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of times in this way O Nakṣa tra rāja saṃkusumitābhijña 
If there is anyone who sets forth and wishes to attain highest complete enlightenment he should pay homage to the stupas of the Buddha by burning either a nger or a toe He is superior to those who pay homage by giving their countries and cities their wives and children or the mountains forests rivers ponds and many other rare treasures If there is anyone who pays homage to all the buddhas great bodhisattvas pratyekabuddhas and arhats by lling the great manifold cosmos with the seven precious treasures the merit of this person will not be equal to the surpassing merit of one who receives and holds to even a single verse consisting of four lines of the Lotus Sutra O Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña 
Just as the ocean is the greatest of streams and rivers and of all waters this Lotus Sutra is the most profound of the sutras taught by the Tathāgatas 
Just as Mount Sumeru is the greatest of mountainsgreater than Earth Mountain Black Mountain Mount Cakravāḍa Mount Mahācakra vāḍa and the ten jeweled mountainsthis Lotus Sutra is the greatest of the sutras 
Just as the moon is the greatest among all the stars this Lotus Sutra is the most illuminating of the thousands of koṭis of sutras 
Just as the sun destroys darkness in the same way this sutra destroys the darkness of erring thought 
Just as the noble emperor is the best of all the kings this sutra is the noblest of all the sutras 
Just as akra is the king of the thirtythree devas this sutra is the King of Sutras 
Just as Great Brahma is the father of all the sentient beings in the same way this sutra is the father of all the wise the noble those who have more to learn and those who do not and those in whom the thought of enlightenment has awakened 
Just as those who have entered the stream of the teaching  those who are to return to this world once again  those who are never to return  arhats and pratyekabuddhas are the best of all the common people in the same way this is the best of all the sutras taught by all the Tathāgatas bodhisattvas or śrāvakas 
Those who hold to this sutra are the best of all sentient beings 
The bodhisattvas are the best of all śrāvakas and pratye kabuddhas 
In the same way this sutra is the best of all sutras 
Just as the Buddha is the King of the Dharma this sutra is the King of Sutras O Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña 
This sutra saves all sentient beings This sutra makes all sentient beings free from suffering 
This sutra greatly benets all sentient beings and brings their aspirations to fulllment just as a clear cool pond satises the thirsty as a re satises those suffering from cold as clothes for the naked as a caravan leader for merchants as a mother for her children as a boat for the traveler as a physician for the sick as a lamp for the gloom as a treasure for the poor as a king for the people as the sea for traders and a torch for those in darkness 
In the same way this Lotus Sutra frees sentient beings from every suffering all the pains and bonds of illness and of birth and death 
If there is anyone who hears this Lotus Sutra copies it or moves others to copy it their merit will be limitless even if it is measured through the Buddhas wisdom 
If there is anyone who copies it and pays it tribute with owers perfumes necklaces burning incense scented powders fragrant ointments banners canopies clothes various kinds of ghee lamps oil lamps fragrant oil lamps lamps of oil made from campaka sumanas pāṭala vārṣika and navamā likā trees that persons merit will also be immeasurable O Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña 
If there is anyone who hears this chapter Ancient Accounts of Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja they will attain immeasurable and limitless merit 
If there is any woman who hears and holds to this chapter Ancient Accounts of Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja she will never be reborn with a female body 
If there is any woman ve hundred years after the pari nirvāṇa of the Tathāgata who hears this sutra and practices according to the teaching she will immediately reach the dwelling of the Buddha Amitāyus in the Sukhāvatī world surrounded by great bodhisattvas and will be born on a jeweled seat in a lotus ower Never again troubled by the of greed anger or ignorance by arrogance or jealousy he will attain the bodhisattvas transcendent powers and the acceptance of the nonorigination of all dharmas 
After attaining this acceptance his faculty of sight will be pure and with this pure eye faculty he will see all the Buddha Tathāgatas equal in number to the sands of seventytwo million koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers 
At that time all the buddhas will praise him from afar saying Splendid Splendid 
Son of a virtuous family 
You have preserved recited and contemplated this sutra from the teachings of the Buddha ākyamuni and taught it to others The merit you have obtained is immeasurable and limitless Even re cannot burn it Even water cannot wash it away 
You have already destroyed the māras You have already conquered the armies of birth and death You have defeated all enemies 
O son of a virtuous family 
Hundreds of thousands of buddhas together protect you with their transcendent powers There is no one equal to you among the devas and humans of the entire world With the exception of the Tathāgata the wisdom and meditation of all śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas can never equal yours 
Such is the power of the merit and wisdom that this bodhisattva has perfected 
If there is anyone who hears this chapter Ancient Accounts of Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja rejoices in it and praises it well in his present life he will always exhale the fragrance of blue lotus owers from his mouth and will always emit the fragrance of the sandalwood on Mount Oxhead from his pores The benets of the qualities he has obtained are just as mentioned above For this reason O Nakṣatrarāja saṃkusumitābhijña I will entrust you with this chapter Ancient Accounts of Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja During the period of ve hundred years after my parinirvāṇa you must spread it far and wide in Jambudvīpa and not allow it to be destroyed You must not give Māra and his men or the devas nāgas yakṣas and kum bhāṇḍa demons any chance of destroying it 
You should protect this sutra with your transcendent power 
Why is this 
Because this sutra is good medicine for the ills of the people of Jambudvīpa 
If there is any sick person who hears this sutra his illness will disappear and he will neither die nor grow old 
O Nakṣatrarāja saṃkusumitābhijña If you see anyone who holds to this sutra you should scatter blue lotus owers full of scented powder on him 
After scattering them you should think like this This man will before long destroy the army of Māra sitting on the grasscovered terrace of enlightenment He will blow the conch of the Dharma beat the drum of the great Dharma and ferry all sentient beings across the ocean of old age illness and death 
Therefore if those seeking the buddha path see those who hold to this sutra the thought of respect should awaken in them When this chapter Ancient Accounts of Bodhisattva Bhaiṣa jyarāja was being taught eightyfour thousand bodhisattvas attained the dhāraṇī of understanding the speech of all sentient beings 
The Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna in the jeweled stupa praised Bodhisattva Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña saying 
You have attained marvelous merit for you have questioned the Buddha ākya muni about these things and beneted all of the immeasurable numbers of sentient beings Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara Thereupon the Buddha ākyamuni emitted a ray of light from his topknot  the mark of a great person and also from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows  thus illuminating all the buddha worlds in the east equal to the sands of one hundred and eight myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers 
In that world was the buddha named Kamala dala vimalanakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña a Tathāgata Arhat Com pletely Enlightened Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct WellDeparted Knower of the World Unsurpassed Tamer of Humans Teacher of Devas and Humans Buddha Bhagavat 
At that time in the buddha world of Vairocanaraśmiprati maṇḍitā there was a bodhisattva whose name was Gadgadasvara  Having planted many roots of good merit over a long period he paid homage to and closely attended immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas and accomplished complete and profound wisdom He attained the samādhis called dhvajā grakeyūra saddharmapuṇḍarīka vimala datta nakṣa tra rā ja vikrīḍita anilambha jñānamudrā sarva rutakauśalya sarva puṇyasamuccaya prasādavatī ṛddhi vikrīḍita jñānolkā vyū harāja vimalaprabhāsa vimalagarbha apkṛtsna and sūryāvarta He thus attained great samādhis equal in number to the sands of hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Ganges Rivers 
As the light of the Buddha ākyamuni illuminated his body he addressed the Buddha Kamaladalavimalanakṣatrarājasaṃkusu mi tā bhijña saying O Bhagavat 
I shall go to the sahā world approach the Buddha ākyamuni in homage and reverence and see Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī the Prince of the Dharma as well as Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja Bodhisattva Pradānaśūra Bodhisattva Nakṣatra rāja saṃ ku su mitābhijña Bodhisattva Viśiṣṭacāritra Bodhisattva Vyūharāja and Bodhisattva Bhaiṣa jya samud gata Then the Buddha Kamaladalavimalanakṣatrarājasaṃkusu mitā bhijña addressed Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara saying 
O son of a virtuous family 
The land of that sahā world is uneven and irregular and is lled with mud stones mountains and lth The Buddha is short of body as are the bodhisattvas 
By contrast your body is fortytwo thousand yojanas tall and my body is six million eight hundred thousand yojanas tall Your body is perfect in its bearing and illuminated most beautifully with hundreds of millions of merits Yet when you go there you must not despise that country nor think the Buddha bodhisattvas or the world itself inferior The Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara addressed the Buddha saying 
I am now going to the sahā world through the power of the Tathāgata the carefree play of the transcendent powers of the Tathāgata and the adornment of the qualities and wisdom of the Tathāgata At that time Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara without rising from his seat or moving his body entered samādhi 
On seeing these lotus owers Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī the Prince of the Dharma addressed the Buddha saying 
Why has this marvel appeared 
There are a great many millions of lotus owers whose stems are made of Jambūnāda gold leaves of silver pistils of diamond and calyces of ruby The Buddha ākyamuni answered Mañjuśrī saying 
The Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara wishes to come to this sahā world from the buddha world called Kamala dala vimala nakṣatra rāja saṃ kusu mitā bhijña together with eightyfour thousand bodhisattvas as his retinue He approaches me in homage and reverence wishing to make offerings and to hear the Lotus Sutra Mañjuśrī asked the Buddha saying 
What roots of good merit has he planted and what merits has he practiced to attain his great transcendent powers 
What kind of samādhi has he practiced 
I entreat you to tell us the name of this samādhi We wish to practice it with diligence By practicing this samādhi we wish to see the shape appearance size and manner of this bodhisattva 
I entreat you O Bhagavat to use your transcendent powers and let us see the appearance of that bodhisattva Then the Buddha ākyamuni spoke to Mañjuśrī saying 
The Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna who long ago entered parinirvāṇa will manifest the signs for you At that time the Buddha Prabhūtaratna addressed that bodhisattva saying 
Mañjuśrī the Prince of the Dharma wishes to see you Thereupon Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara disappeared from his world and arrived together with eightyfour thousand bodhisattvas 
In the worlds through which he passed the land quaked in six ways sevenjeweled lotus owers rained everywhere and hundreds of thousands of heavenly musical instruments sounded spontaneously without being played 
The eyes of this bodhisattva were as large as blue lotus leaves Even if hundreds of thousands of myriads of moons were gathered together they would not exceed the beauty of his countenance His body was pure gold in color adorned with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of merits radiant with virtuous dignity and brilliantly illuminated like the adamantine body of the god Nārāyaṇa 
Having entered the sevenjeweled platform and ascended into the air he ew above the earth at a height of seven tāla trees Surrounded by respectful bodhisattvas he arrived at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa in this sahā world and descended from the sevenjeweled terrace 
He came before the Buddha ākyamuni with a necklace worth hundreds of thousands in his hand and bowed until his forehead reached the Buddhas feet He presented the necklace to the Buddha saying O Bhagavat The Buddha Kamaladalavimalanakṣatrarāja saṃ kusu mitā bhijña in quires of the Bhagavat 
Are your worldly affairs bearable 
Is it easy to save sentient beings 
Are they not lled with greed anger foolishness avarice and pride 
Are they mindful of their parents Do they respect śrāmaṇas Do they not have false views or erring thoughts Do they control the desires of their ve senses 
O Bhagavat Do the sentient beings conquer māras 
Has the Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna sitting in the sevenjeweled stupa long after his parinirvāṇa come here to hear the Dharma Furthermore he inquired of the Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna saying 
O Bhagavat 
I now wish to see the body of the Buddha Prabhūtaratna 
I entreat you O Bhagavat to manifest and show it to me At that time the Buddha ākyamuni said to the Buddha Pra bhū ta ratna This Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara wants to see you Then the Buddha Prabhūtaratna addressed Gadgadasvara saying 
You have paid homage to the Buddha ākya muni and heard the Lotus Sutra and have come here in order to see Mañjuśrī and others Thereupon Bodhisattva Padmaśrī addressed the Buddha saying 
What roots of good merit has this Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara planted and what merits has he practiced to attain these transcendent powers The Buddha answered Bodhisattva Padmaśrī saying 
As a result of his deeds he was born in the world of the Buddha Kamala dalavimalanakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña and has attained his transcendent powers 
What do you think about this 
Is Bodhisattva Gadgada svara who paid homage to the Buddha Meghadundubhisvararāja with music and jeweled vessels someone unknown 
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Gad ga dasvara here present is one and the same 
O Padmaśrī Having closely and respectfully attended innumerable buddhas and planted roots of good merit over a long time this Bodhisattva Gadgada svara met hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of buddhas equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River 
In this way he has expounded this sutra and saved those in the states of being of helldwellers hungry ghosts animals and those in difcult circumstances Sometimes he has transformed himself into a female in royal harems and taught this sutra 
O Padmaśrī This Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara saves all sentient beings in the sahā world This Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara has transformed himself into various forms and taught this sutra for the sake of all sentient beings Nevertheless his transcendent power has never decreased nor his power of transformation or his wisdom 
This bodhisattva illuminates the sahā world with his great wisdom and causes every sentient being to attain what should be known 
He does exactly the same in all the worlds of the ten directions which are equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River 
If he is able to save them in the form of a śrāvaka he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of a śrāvaka 
If he is able to save them in the form of a pratyekabuddha he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of a pratyekabuddha 
If he is able to save them in the form of a bodhisattva he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of a bodhisattva 
If he is able to save them in the form of a buddha he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of a buddha 
Thus he transforms himself in various ways according to the capacities of those who are to be saved If he is able to save them by means of parinirvāṇa he manifests parinirvāṇa to them 
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Gadgadasvara has achieved his transcendent powers and the power of wisdom in just such a manner Thereupon Bodhisattva Padmaśrī addressed the Buddha saying 
Deep are the roots of good merit that this Bodhi sattva Gadgada svara has planted 
In what samādhi did this bodhisattva dwell such that he was able to appear in various places in this way and bring sentient beings to the path The Buddha answered Bodhisattva Padmaśrī saying 
Dwelling in this samādhi Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara has beneted innumerable sentient beings in this way When this chapter Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara was being taught those eightyfour thousand people who had come with Bodhi sattva Gadgadasvara attained the samādhi called sarva rūpa saṃdarśana 
Innumerable bodhisattvas in this sahā world also attained this samādhi and dhāraṇī 
Then Bodhisattva Mahā sattva Gadgadasvara paid homage to the Buddha ākyamuni and the stupa of the Buddha Prabhūtaratna and returned to his own world Those worlds through which he traveled quaked in six ways and it rained jeweled lotus owers Hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of variegated music was heard 
Having returned to his own world he approached the Buddha Kamaladalavimala nakṣatra rāja saṃkusumitābhijña surrounded by eightyfour thousand bodhisattvas and said to him 
O Bhagavat I have been to the sahā world and beneted the sentient beings Having seen the Buddha ākyamuni and the stupa of the Buddha Prabhūtaratna I paid homage to them and made them offerings 
Having seen Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī the Prince of the Dharma Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja Bodhisattva Vīryabalavegaprāpta and Bodhisattva Pradānaśūra I caused these eightyfour thousand bodhisattvas to attain the samādhi called sarvarū pasaṃ darśana When this chapter The Coming and Going of Bodhisattva Gadgada svara was taught fortytwo thousand sons of the devas attained the acceptance of the nonorigination of all dharmas and Bodhisattva Padmaśrī attained the saddharmapuṇḍarīka samādhi 
The Gateway to Every Direction Manifested by Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara Thereupon arising from his seat with his right shoulder bared Bodhisattva Akṣayamati faced the Buddha with his palms pressed together and spoke thus to him 
For what reason is Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called Ava lo kiteśvara The Buddha answered Bodhisattva Akṣayamati saying 
O son of a virtuous family If innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings who experience suffering hear of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and wholeheartedly chant his name Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive their voices and free them from their suffering 
Even if those who hold to the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara were to enter a great re because of this bodhisattvas transcendent power the re would not be able to burn them 
If they were adrift on the great waters by chanting his name they would reach the shallows 
There are hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings who enter the great ocean to seek such treasures as gold silver lapis lazuli motherofpearl agate coral amber and pearl Even if a cyclone were to blow the ship of one of these toward the land of rākṣasa demons they would all become free from the danger of those rākṣasa demons if there were even a single person among them who chanted the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara 
For this reason he is called Avalokiteśvara 
If anyone who is about to be beaten chants the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara the sticks and swords will immediately be broken into pieces and he will be delivered 
If the yakṣas and rākṣasas lling the great manifold cosmos come with the intent to afict the people but hear them chanting those demons evil eyes will be unable to see them so how could they possibly hurt them 
If anyone whether guilty or innocent is bound with fetters or chains such bonds will be broken into pieces and those who have been bound will become free by chanting the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara 
When a caravan leader travels on a dangerous road together with his fellow merchants carrying precious treasures in a great manifold cosmos lled with evil robbers if there be a single person who says O sons of a virtuous family 
Do not fear You should wholeheartedly chant the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara 
If you chant his name you will be free from these evil robbers Now if those merchants chant loudly in unison saying Homage to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara Then by chanting his name the caravan will immediately gain deliverance 
O Akṣayamati The transcendent power of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalo kiteśvara is as great and mighty as this 
If there are any sentient beings who are greatly subject to sensual desires if they contemplate Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with respect they will become free from these desires 
If there are any sentient beings who often become angry if they contemplate Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with respect they will become free from anger 
If there are any sentient beings who are greatly confused if they contemplate Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with respect they will become free from their confusion 
O Akṣayamati Thus Bodhisattva Avalo kiteśvara greatly benets sentient beings through his transcendent power For this reason sentient beings should always turn their thoughts to him 
If any woman wanting to have a baby boy pays homage and makes offerings to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara she will bear a baby boy endowed with good merit and wisdom 
If she wants to have a baby girl she will bear a beautiful and handsome baby girl who has planted roots of good merit and will have the love of sentient beings 
O Akṣayamati Such are the transcendent powers of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara that if any sentient being reverently respects him the merit they achieve will never be in vain For this reason sentient beings should hold to the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara O Akṣayamati 
What do you think of someone who holds to the names of the bodhisattvas equal in number to the sands of sixtytwo koṭis of Ganges Rivers and pays homage to them with drink and food clothes bedding and medicine 
Is the merit of this son or daughter of a virtuous family great or not Akṣayamati answered saying 
O Bhagavat It is great The Buddha said If there is anyone who holds to the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and anyone who pays homage to him and makes offerings even for a moment the merit of these two people will be equal and the same it will never be extinguished after hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas 
Those who hold to the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will attain such benets of immeasurable and limitless merit The Bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed the Buddha saying 
O Bhagavat How does Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara wander through this sahā world 
How does he teach the Dharma for the sake of sentient beings 
What of his power of skillful means The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Akṣayamati 
O son of a virtuous family If there is any land where sentient beings are to be saved by the form of a buddha Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of a buddha 
To those who are to be saved by the form of a pratyekabuddha he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of a pratyekabuddha 
To those who are to be saved by the form of a śrāvaka he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of a śrāvaka 
To those who are to be saved by the form of Brahma he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of Brahma 
To those who are to be saved by the form of akra he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of akra 
To those who are to be saved by the form of śvara he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of śvara 
To those who are to be saved in the form of Maheśvara he teaches the Dharma by changing himself into the form of Maheśvara

For this reason you should wholeheartedly pay homage to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara 
This Bodhisattva Avalo kiteśvara bestows fearlessness in times of fearful calamity For this reason everybody in this sahā world calls him Abhayaṃ dada  
The Bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed the Buddha saying O Bhagavat 
I shall now pay homage to Bodhisattva Avalo kiteśvara He then took from his neck a manyjeweled necklace worth hundreds of thousands of gold coins gave it to him and said 
I entreat you to accept this rarejeweled necklace for the Dharma At that time Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara did not dare to receive it 
Akṣayamati addressed Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara saying 
I entreat you to accept this necklace out of pity for us Then the Buddha said to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara You should accept this necklace out of pity for such humans and nonhumans as this Bodhisattva Akṣayamati the fourfold assembly devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas The Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara accepted the necklace out of pity for the fourfold assembly devas nāgas humans non humans and the rest 
With such inherent transcendent powers Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara wanders throughout the sahā world Thereupon Bodhisattva Akṣayamati asked a question in verse saying O Bhagavat endowed with excellent marks I now wish to ask you about him once again For what reason is the heir of the Buddha Named Avalokiteśvara 
The Bhagavat endowed with excellent marks answered Akṣaya mati in verse Listen to the practices of Avalokiteśvara Which have their application to all His vow is deep like the ocean And his kalpa is of inconceivable length After having attended Many thousands of koṭis of buddhas He made a great pure vow

At that time Bodhisattva Dharaṇiṃdhara arose from his seat went before the Buddha and said to him O Bhagavat 
If there are any sentient beings who hear of this chapter Bodhisattva Avalo kiteś 
vara and these effortless deeds the manifestation of the gateway to all directions and the transcendent powers know that their merit will not be little When the Buddha taught the chapter The Gateway to Every Direction the thought of incomparable highest complete enlightenment awoke in eightyfour thousand sentient beings in the assembly 
Dhāraṇī Thereupon rising from his seat with his right shoulder bared Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja faced the Buddha with his palms pressed together and spoke to him saying 
If there is any son or daughter of a virtuous family who preserves the Lotus Sutra and recites it is versed in it and copies it how much merit will he or she attain Then the Buddha addressed Bhaiṣajyarāja saying 
If there is any son or daughter of a virtuous family who pays homage to buddhas numbering as many as the sands of eight hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers what do you think 
Will the merit he or she attains be great or not He answered 
It will be great O Bhagavat The Buddha said If any son or daughter of a virtuous family preserves a verse of four lines of this sutra recites it understands the meaning or practices what it teaches his or her merit will be very great Thereupon Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja addressed the Buddha saying 
I will now give the dhāraṇīs to the expounders of the Dharma and protect them He then recited a dhāraṇī 
Anye manye mane mamane citte carite same samitā viśānte mukte mukta tame same avisame samasame jaye kṣaye akṣaye akṣiṇe śānte samite dhāraṇi ālokabhāṣe pratyavekṣaṇi ni dhiru abhyantaranirviṣte abhyantara pāriśuddhi mutkule araḍe paraḍe sukāṇkṣi asamasame buddha vilokite dharmaparikśite saṃghanirghoṣanirghoṇi bhayā bhaya viśodhani mantre mantrākṣayate rute rutakauśalye akṣaye ak ṣa ya vanatāye vakkule valoḍa amanyanatāye 
This mantradhāraṇī was spoken by buddhas equal in number to the sands of sixtytwo koṭis of Ganges Rivers Anyone who attacks or slanders an expounder of the Dharma also attacks or slanders these buddhas Thereupon the Buddha ākyamuni praised Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja saying 
O Bhaiṣajyarāja 
Out of compassion you have taught this dhāraṇī in order to protect the expounders of the Dharma 
It will greatly benet all sentient beings Then Bodhisattva Pradānaśūra addressed the Buddha saying 
O Bhagavat I also will teach a dhāraṇī in order to protect anyone who recites and preserves the Lotus Sutra 
If ex pounders of the Dharma attain this dhāraṇī no yakṣa rākṣasa pūtana kṛtya kumbhāṇḍa or hungry ghost will ever have a chance to strike at their weaknesses even if they try to do so In the presence of the Buddha he taught a dhāraṇī saying 
This mantradhāraṇī has been spoken by buddhas equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River and everyone has rejoiced in it Anyone who attacks or slanders an expounder of the Dharma also attacks or slanders these buddhas Thereupon the devarāja Vaiśravaṇa a worldprotector addressed the Buddha saying 
I will also teach a dhāraṇī out of pity for sentient beings and in order to protect ex pounders of the Dharma He then recited a dhāraṇī saying 
Aṭṭe naṭṭe vanaṭṭe anaḍe nāḍi kunaḍi 
With this mantradhāraṇī I protect the ex pounders of the Dharma I will also protect those who hold to this sutra 
All heavy cares shall be banished for a hundred yojanas around At that time the devarāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra was present in the assembly respectfully surrounded by thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of gandharvas He came before the Buddha together with them and addressed the Buddha with his palms pressed together saying 
With a mantradhāraṇī I will also protect those who hold to the Lotus Sutra He then recited the dhāraṇī saying 
This mantradhāraṇī was spoken by fortytwo koṭis of buddhas Anyone who attacks or slanders an expounder of the Dharma also attacks or slanders these buddhas 
We also want to protect those who recite and preserve the Lotus Sutra and rid them of their heavy cares Those who try to strike at the expounders of the Dharma through their weaknesses shall never be able to do so They then recited a dhāraṇī in the presence of the Buddha saying 
Iti me iti me iti me iti me iti me nime nime nime nime nime ruhe ruhe ruhe ruhe stuhe stuhe stuhe stuhe stuhe 
No yakṣa no rākṣasa no hungry ghost no pūtana no kṛtya no vetāla no skanda no omāraka no apa s mā raka no yakṣakṛtya no manuṣyakṛtya no fever no fever for one day for two days for three days for four days or even up to seven days or at any time no one in the form of a man no one in the form of a woman no one in the form of a boy no one in the form of a maiden no one who may appear even in a dream in any of these forms shall cause them distress They then spoke to the Buddha in verse saying 
If anyone does not accept my dhāraṇī And troubles one who expounds the Dharma His head will be split into seven pieces Just like a branch of the arjaka tree 
Consider the transgression of parricide Of pressing sesame mixed with impurities Of cheating people with scales Consider the transgression committed by Devadatta Who divided the sangha 
Those who slander this expounder of the Dharma Shall suffer consequences such as these 
After having spoken these verses the rākṣasīs addressed the Buddha saying 
We also want to protect those who preserve recite and practice this sutra and cause them to live at ease rid them of their weighty cares and drive out various poisons The Buddha said to the rākṣasīs 
Your merit is immeasurable How much more merit is there in protecting those who perfectly preserve and revere the sutra in various ways such as by offering owers perfumes necklaces fragrant ointments scented powders burning incense banners canopies and music or by lighting ghee lamps oil lamps fragrant oil lamps lamps of oil made from sumanas campaka vārṣika and utpala owers How much more merit is there in offering such things in hundreds to thousands of ways 
You and your retinues should protect the expounders of the Dharma in this way When this chapter Dhāraṇī was taught sixtyeight thousand people attained the acceptance of the nonorigination of all dharmas 
Ancient Accounts of King ubhavyūha Thereupon the Buddha addressed the great assembly saying Once upon a time immeasurable limitless inconceivable and incalculable kalpas ago there was a buddha named Jaladhara gar jita ghoṣa susvarana kṣatrarā ja saṃ ku su mitābhijña a Tathāgata Arhat Completely Enlightened His land was called Vairo cana raśmi pratimaṇḍitā and the kalpa was named Priyadarśana 
There was a king practicing the teaching of the Buddha He was called ubha vyūha and his consort was named Vimaladatta They had two sons One was named Vimalagarbha and the other Vimala netra 
These two sons were endowed with great transcendent power merit and wisdom and practiced the bodhisattva path for a long time They were versed in the perfections of giving  good conduct  perseverance  effort  meditation  wisdom  and skillful means and compassion benevolence joy and generosity as well as the thirtyseven helpful ways to attain the Dharma 
Furthermore they were also versed in the bodhisattva samā dhis of vimala nakṣatrarājā ditya vimala nirbhāsa vimala rūpa vimala bhāsa alaṃkāra śubha and mahātejogarbha Then the Buddha wanting to guide King ubhavyūha and out of compassion for sentient beings taught this Lotus Sutra 
At that time Prince Vimalagarbha and Prince Vimalanetra approached their mother and addressed her with their palms and ten ngers pressed together saying We entreat you O mother to go before the Buddha Jaladhara garjita ghoṣasusvaranakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña We shall also go before him together with you attend him make offerings to him and pay him homage 
Why is this 
They walked stood sat and slept in the air causing water to ow from their upper bodies and blowing re out of their lower bodies causing water to ow from their lower bodies and blowing re out of their upper bodies enlarging their bodies so that they lled the air making them small and then enlarging them again disappearing in midair and instantly reappearing on the earth entering the earth as if it were water and walking on the water as though on the earth 
By showing various marvels like these they puried their fathers mind and caused him to believe them 
When their father saw the transcendent powers of his sons he rejoiced a great deal at his unprecedented experience and addressed his sons with his palms pressed together saying Who is your teacher Whose pupils are you 
The two sons said O great king 
The Buddha Jaladharagarjitaghoṣa susvarana kṣatrarāja saṃ kusumitābhijña is now sitting on the seat of the Dharma under the sevenjeweled bodhi tree and teaching the Lotus Sutra extensively to the assembly of all the devas and humans in this world He is our teacher We are his pupils The father said to his sons 
We have done the Buddhas work for the sake of our father We entreat you O mother to allow us to renounce household life and practice the bodhisattva path under the guidance of that buddha At that time the two sons addressed the mother in verse wanting to elaborate on this meaning further saying We entreat you O mother to allow us To renounce household life And to become śrāmaṇas 
It is more difcult to meet a buddha Than to see uḍumbara owers It is also difcult to escape from adversity We entreat you to allow us To renounce household life Their mother addressed them immediately saying 
What is the reason for this 
It is because it is difcult to meet a buddha Then the two sons addressed their parents saying Splendid O father and mother 
We entreat you now to approach and meet the Buddha Jaladharagar jita ghoṣa su svara na kṣatrarāja saṃ kusu mitā bhijña and pay homage to him 
Why is this 
Because it is difcult to meet a buddha just as it is to see uḍumbara owers or for a oneeyed turtle to nd the hole in a oating piece of wood 
Because of our profound merits accumulated in the past we were born to meet the BuddhaDharma For this reason our father and mother should allow us to renounce household life 
Why is this 
Because it is difcult to meet buddhas and it is also difcult to obtain an opportunity for meeting them At that time eightyfour thousand women in the palace of King ubha vyūha all became capable of preserving this Lotus Sutra 
Bodhisattva Vimala netra had already been versed in the saddharmapuṇḍarīka samādhi for a long time and Bodhisattva Vimalagarbha had also been versed in the sarvasattva pāpa jahana samādhi for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas for he wanted all sentient beings to be separated from evil states of being 
The consort of that king attained the sarva buddha saṃgīti samādhi and the secret treasure house of the buddhas was revealed to her In this way the two sons inspired their father through the power of their skillful means and caused him to have faith and pleasure in the BuddhaDharma 
Then King ubhavyūha together with his subjects and retinue Queen Vimaladatta together with her servants and retinue and the two princes together with fortytwo thousand people came before the Buddha at the same time 
Having approached the Buddha they bowed until their foreheads touched his feet then circled around him three times and sat to one side At that time the Buddha expounded and taught the BuddhaDharma for the kings sake greatly beneting and rejoicing him 
Then King ubhavyūha and his queen took off their pearl necklaces worth hundreds of thousands and scattered them over the Buddha In the air they transformed into a fourpillared jeweled platform On the platform was a great jeweled bed spread with hundreds of thousands of myriads of heavenly clothes The Buddha sat crosslegged upon it emitting great rays of light 
Then King ubhavyūha thought The Buddhas form is marvelous most superior in dignity and given perfection by the most delicate countenance Thereupon the Buddha Jaladharagar jita ghoṣa susvarana kṣatrarāja saṃ kusu mitābhijña addressed the fourfold assembly saying Do you see King ubhavyūha standing with his palms pressed together in my presence 
This king has become a monk in my Dharma He will diligently practice the Dharma that aids those on the buddha path and will become a buddha He will be called ālendrarāja His land will be called Vistīrṇavatī and the kalpa Abhyudgatarāja 
Such will be his merits That king immediately gave his kingdom to his younger brother He renounced household life and practiced the BuddhaDharma together with his queen two sons and their retinue For a period of eightyfour thousand years after their renunciation the king continued to make diligent efforts and practiced the Lotus Sutra 
After this he attained the sarvaguṇālaṃkāravyūha samā dhi He ascended instantly into the air to a height of seven tāla trees and addressed the Buddha saying 
O Bhagavat My two sons have done the Buddhas work Through their miracles they have reformed my erring mind so that I dwell in the BuddhaDharma 
These two sons are my good friends they enabled me to see the Bhagavat It was because they wanted to nurture the roots of good merit accumulated in my past and benet me that they were born in my house Then the Buddha Jaladharagar jita ghoṣa susvarana kṣatra rāja saṃkusu mitābhijña addressed King ubhavyūha saying 
Exactly Exactly It is exactly as you have said 
If the sons and daughters of a virtuous family make good friends throughout many lives after having planted roots of good merit those good friends will perform the Buddhas work illuminating teaching beneting and gladdening them and will cause them to enter highest complete enlightenment 
O great king 
You should know that a good friend is indeed the great spur that brings inspiration to others causing them to meet a buddha and the thought of highest complete enlightenment to awaken in them 
O great king 
Do you see these two sons 
These two sons have already paid homage to buddhas equal in number to the sands of sixtyve hundred thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers closely attended the buddhas with respect accepted the Lotus Sutra in their presence and in their compassion caused sentient beings with false views to dwell in right views Immediately after that King ubhavyūha descended from the air and addressed the Buddha saying O Bhagavat The Tathāgata is extraordinary 
Because he is endowed with merits and wisdom his topknot is brilliantly illuminated his deep blue eyes are long and wide the tuft of hair between his eyebrows is white like the bright moon his white teeth are even and always shining and his scarlet lips are like the bimba fruit in their beauty At that time King ubhavyūha praised immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of qualities of the Buddha like these and again wholeheartedly addressed the Buddha with his palms pressed together in the presence of the Tathāgata saying O Bhagavat 
This is unprecedented 
The Tathāgatas Dharma is endowed and perfected with inconceivable subtle qualities His teaching integrity and deeds are serene and comfortable From today on we shall never act selshly and the wrongful thoughts of false views pride and anger shall never awaken in us Having spoken these words he bowed to the Buddha and went away The Buddha addressed the great assembly saying 
Is King ubhavyūha someone unknown 
He is none other than this Bodhisattva Padmaśrī 
His Queen Vimala datta is none other than this Vairocanaraśmipratimaṇḍitādhvaja rāja now in the presence of the Buddha 
Because she had compassion for King ubhavyūha and his retinue she was born here 
These two sons are none other than Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja and Bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyasamudgata 
These bodhisattvas Bhaiṣa jyarāja and Bhaiṣajyasamudgata perfected great qualities such as these and having planted many roots of good merit under the guidance of innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas perfected inconceivable good merit 
If anyone holds the names of these two bodhisattvas in memory the devas and humans in this entire world will certainly pay homage to those bodhisattvas When the Buddha taught this chapter Ancient Accounts of King ubha vyūha eightyfour thousand people removed themselves from impurity rid themselves of delement and attained pure Dharmaeyes with which to see the teachings 
Encouragement of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra Thereupon Bodhisattva Samantabhadra through his effortless transcendent power dignity and fame arrived from the east together with innumerable limitless and incalculable numbers of great bodhisattvas 
All the lands quaked universally wherever he passed Jeweled lotus owers rained down and immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kinds of music were heard 
I entreat you O Bhagavat to teach us how the sons and daughters of a virtuous family may attain the Lotus Sutra after the parinirvāṇa of the Tathāgata The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Samantabhadra 
After the parinirvāṇa of the Tathāgata the sons and daughters of a virtuous family will attain the Lotus Sutra if they achieve the four necessary accomplishments the rst is to be protected by the buddhas the second is to plant roots of good merit the third is to enter a group of those who are rightly resolute and the fourth is to awaken the thought of saving all sentient beings 
Those sons and daughters of a virtuous family will denitely attain this sutra after the parinirvāṇa of the Tathāgata if they perfect these four accomplishments Then Bodhisattva Samantabhadra addressed the Buddha saying 
If there are those who preserve this sutra in the troubled world of ve hundred years after I will protect them and rid them of their heavy cares cause them to attain happiness and allow no one to strike at them through their weaknesses I will not give Māra any chance to afict them nor the sons of Māra daughters of Māra minions of Māra those possessed by Māra yakṣas rākṣasas kumbhāṇḍas piśācas kṛtyas pūtanas or vetālas 
If they recite this sutra whether walking or standing I will then come before them on a white elephant king with six tusks together with the assembly of great bodhisattvas manifest myself pay homage and protect them and console their minds for the sake of revering the Lotus Sutra 
If they sit contemplating upon this sutra I will then manifest myself before them on a white elephant king If they forget a single line or a verse in the Lotus Sutra I will teach and recite it with them and cause them to become procient in it 
At that time those who accept and recite the Lotus Sutra will be able to see me and greatly rejoicing will thus make further efforts As a result of seeing me they will attain the samādhi and dhāraṇīs named āvartā dhāraṇī koṭīśatasahasrāvartā dhāraṇī and sarva ruta kauśalyāvartā dhāraṇī They will attain dhāraṇīs like these O Bhagavat 
In the troubled world of ve hundred years after those monks nuns laymen and laywomen who seek preserve recite copy and wish to practice this Lotus Sutra should persevere singlemindedly for twentyone days 
After a full twentyone days I will appear on a white elephant with six tusks accompanied by innumerable bodhisattvas who themselves will also be surrounded by their retinues and manifest myself before sentient beings in whatever form they wish to see Then I will expound and teach the Dharma to them and gladden them I will also give them a dhāraṇīspell When they attain this dhāraṇī nonhumans will have no power to destroy them and women no power to trouble them 
I entreat you O Bhagavat to allow me to teach this dhāraṇī Thus he taught the spell in the presence of the Buddha saying 
Adaṇḍe daṇḍapati daṇḍāvartani daṇḍakuśale daṇḍa sudhāri sudhāri sudhārapati buddhapaśyane sarvadhāraṇī āvartani sarvabhāṣyā vartane suāvartane saṃghaparīkṣani saṃ gha nirghātani asaṃge saṃgāpagate tṛadhvasaṃgatulya prāpte sarvasaṃgasamatikrānte sarvadharma suparīkṣite sarva sattvarutakauśalyānugate siṃhavikrīḍite 
If there is any bodhisattva who hears this dhāraṇī he should know it is because of the transcendent power of Samantabhadra If there is anyone who accepts the Lotus Sutra practiced in Jambudvīpa he should think This is nothing but Samantabhadras virtuous power If there is anyone who preserves recites correctly remembers understands this meaning and practices in accordance with the teaching know that they are practicing the practice of Samantabhadra They plant deep roots of good merit in the presence of innumerable and limitless buddhas 
If they copy this sutra after their death they will be born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven At that time eightyfour thousand heavenly maidens will welcome them performing various kinds of music They will wear sevenjeweled coronets and be happy among their female servants 
How much more for those who preserve recite remember correctly understand the meaning and practice in accordance with the teaching If there is anyone who preserves recites and understands this meaning at the end of their life a thousand buddhas will offer their hands so that they will neither be afraid nor fall into the troubled states of being 
They will thus arrive in the Tuṣita Heaven of Bodhisattva Maitreya who is endowed with the thirtytwo marks and surrounded by an assembly of great bodhisattvas and a retinue of hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of heavenly maidens There they will be born and such will be their merit and benets 
For this reason the wise should wholeheartedly copy move others to copy preserve recite and remember it correctly and practice in accordance with the teaching O Bhagavat 
Through my transcendent powers I will now protect extensively distribute and keep this sutra from extermination in Jambudvīpa after the pari nirvāṇa of the Tathāgata Thereupon the Buddha ākyamuni praised him saying 
You will protect this sutra and bring benet and happiness to sentient beings in many places 
You have already accomplished inconceivable merits and profound compassion Long long ago the thought of highest complete enlightenment awakened in you and you made this vow of transcendent power I will protect this sutra 
Through my transcendent powers I will protect the one who holds to the name of Bodhisattva Samanta bhadra O Samantabhadra 
If there is anyone who preserves recites correctly remembers practices and copies this Lotus Sutra they should know that they will meet the Buddha ākya muni and hear this sutra from the mouth of the Buddha By this they should know that they are paying homage to the Buddha ākyamuni 
They should know that they will be praised by the ākyamuni Buddha with the word Splendid They should know that the hand of the Buddha ākyamuni will caress their heads 
They should know that they will be clad in the robe of the Buddha ākyamuni Such people are not attached to worldly pleasures 
They are not pleased to consort with heretics wicked people butchers those who keep boars sheep chickens or dogs hunters or those who make a living by pandering They will be honest in mind and will have correct recollection and the power of merit They will not be troubled by the three kinds of poison Nor will they be confused by jealousy selshness false pride or arrogance 
O Samantabhadra If you meet anyone who preserves and recites the Lotus Sutra ve hundred years after the parinirvāṇa of the Tathāgata you should think like this This man will before long approach the terrace of enlightenment destroy the hosts of Māra attain highest complete enlightenment turn the wheel of the Dharma beat the drum of the Dharma blow the conch of the Dharma pour down the rain of the Dharma and will sit on the lion seat of the Dharma in the great assembly of devas and humans 
O Samantabhadra Those who preserve and recite this sutra in the future world will not be greedy for clothes bedding food and drink and the necessities of life Their aspirations will not be unrewarded and their happy reward will be attained in this world 
If there is anyone who despises them saying You are mad This practice of yours is in vain and will attain nothing at the end they will have no eyes lifetime after lifetime as a retribution for this wrongdoing 
If there is anyone who pays them homage and praises them he will attain tangible rewards in this world 
If anyone sees those who preserve this sutra and speaks maliciously about their faults whether true or not such a person will suffer from leprosy in this life 
If anyone scorns them that persons teeth will be either loose or missing their lips will be ugly their nose will be at their limbs will be crooked they will squint their body will stink and be dirty suffering from evil tumors oozing pus their belly will swell with water and they will have tuberculosis and other evil and serious illnesses 
For this reason O Samantabhadra if you see anyone who holds to this sutra you should stand up and show your respect even from afar just as you would pay homage to the Buddha When this chapter Encouragement of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra was being taught innumerable and limitless bodhisattvas equal in number to the sands of Ganges Rivers attained hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of dhāraṇīs named āvartā and bodhisattvas equal to the number of atoms in the manifold cosmos mastered the path of Samantabhadra 
When the Buddha had taught this sutra the entire great assembly of bodhisattvas including Samantabhadra the śrāvakas including āriputra devas nāgas humans and nonhumans rejoiced greatly accepted the Buddhas words bowed to him and departed 


 Never are any existing things found to originate From themselves from something else from both or from no cause  There are four conditioning causes A cause   objects of sensations  immediately preceding condition  and of course the predominant influencethere is no fifth
 Certainly there is no selfexistence  of existing things in conditioning causes etc
And if no selfexistence exists neither does otherexistence 
 The efficient cause  does not exist possessing a conditioning cause
Nor does the efficient cause exist without possessing a conditioning cause
Conditioning causes are not without efficient causes
Nor are there  which possess efficient causes
 Certainly those things are called conditioning causes whereby something originates after having come upon them
As long as something has not originated why are they not so long  nonconditioningcauses
 There can be a conditioning cause neither of a nonreal thing  nor of a real thing 
Of what nonreal thing is there a conditioning cause And if it is  real what use is a cause
 If an element  occurs which is neither real nor nonreal  nor both realandnonreal  How can there be a cause which is effective in this situation  Just that which is without an object of sensation is accepted as a real element
Then if there is an element having no object of sensation how is it possible to have an object of sensation
 When no elements have originated  disappearance is not possible
Therefore it is not proper to speak of an immediately preceding condition for if something has already ceased what cause is there for it
 Since existing things which have no selfexistence are not real
It is not possible at all that This thing becomes upon the existence of that other one
 The product does not reside in the conditioning causes individually or collectively
So how can that which does not reside in the conditioning cause result from conditioning causes
 Then the nonreal would result from those conditioningcauses
Why then would a product not proceed also from noncauses
 On the one hand the product  conditioning causes on the other hand the causes do not consist of themselves
How can a product  from  not consisting of themselves be consisting of those causes
 Therefore that product does not consist in those causes  it is agreed that a product does not consist of noncauses
How  a conditioning cause or noncause when a product is not produced
  That which is already gone to  is not that which is being gone to  more so that which is not yet gone to  is certainly not that being gone to
Also the present going to  without that which is already gone to and that which is not yet gone to is not being gone to 
Where there is activity  there is a process of going  and that activity  is in the present going to 
Then process of going  is inherent in the present going to   the activity  is not in that which is already gone to  nor in that which is not yet gone to
 How will the act of going  of present going to  be produced
Since both kinds of the act of going   simply are not produced  in the present going to 
 Having the act of going  of present going to  has necessarily resulted in a lack of the present going to  of the process of going 
For the present going to  is the being gone to 
  the act of going  of present going to  results in two  acts of going 
One by which there is present going to  the other which is the act of going 
 Two goers  would fallaciously follow as a consequence of two acts of going
Since certainly the act of going  is not produced without a goer
 If there is no going   without a goer 
How will the goer  come into being when there is no going  
 The goer does not go  consequently a nongoer certainly does not go 
What third  goes  other than the goer and nongoer
 It is said The goer goes  How is that possible
When without the act of going  no goer is produced
 Those who hold the view that the goer goes  must  conclude
That there is a goer without the act of going  since the act of going  is obtained  by a goer
 If the goer goes  then two acts of going   follow
that by which the going on  is designated and  the real goer  who goes
 The state of going to  is not begun in that which is already gone to  nor in that which is not yet gone to 
Nor is the state of going to begun in present going to  Where then is it begun
 Present going to  does not exist previous to the beginning of the act of going  nor does that which is already gone to  exist where the act of going  should begin
How can the act of going   in that which is not yet gone to 
 It is mentally fabricated what is that which is already gone to  present going to  and that which is not yet gone to 
Therefore the beginning of the act of going  is not seen in any way
 A goer does not remain unmoved  then certainly the nongoer does not remain unmoved
What third  other than goer and nongoer can thus remain unmoved
 It is said that a goer continues to be  But how can that be possible
Since a goer lacking the act of going  is simply not produced
  does not continue to be  as a result of present going to  or that which is already gone to  or that which is not yet gone to
For then the act of going   origination while the process of going  would be the same as cessation
 Thus it does not obtain that the goer is simply what is going 
Likewise it does not obtain that Then the 'goer' is something other that what is in the 'process of going' 
 And if the act of going  and the goer are identical
The fallacy logically follows that the person acting  and the action  are identical
 Alternatively if the goer is different from the process of going 
The act of going  would exist without the goer and the goer would exist without the act of going
 Neither the identity nor the essential difference is established  regarding the two 
If these two  are not established in what way is  to be understood
 The goer is defined by that which is in the process of going  he does not go to that  which is determined by the process of going  because there is no prior process of going
Indeed someone goes somewhere  The goer does not go to that  other than that process of going by which he is defined as goer
Because when one goes   two processes of going  cannot be produced
 A real goer does not motivate three kinds of acts of going 
Nor does a nonreal  motivate three kinds of motion
 Also a realnonreal  does not motivate three kinds of motion
Therefore the process of going the goer  and a destination to be gone to  do not exist 
 Vision hearing smelling tasting touching and thought
Are the six sense faculties The area of their concern is that which is seen  and so forth
 Certainly vision does not in any way see its own self
Now if it does not see its own self how can it possibly see something else
 An understanding of vision is not attained through the example of fire 
 When no vision occurs nothing whatsoever is being seen How then is it possible to say Vision sees
 Therefore vision does not see and novision does not see Nevertheless it is explained that also the seer is to be known only by his vision
 There is no seer with vision or without vision
Therefore if there is no seer how can there be vision and the object seen  As the birth of a son is said to occur presupposing the mother and the father Knowledge is said to occur presupposing the eye being dependent on the visible forms
 Since the object seen and the vision do not exist  there is no fourfold  knowledge etc  Also then how will the acquisition   and its consequences  be produced
  hearing smelling tasting touching and thought are explained as vision
Indeed one should not apprehend the hearer what is heard etc 
 Visible form  is not perceived without the basic cause of visible form 
Likewise the basic cause of visible form does not appear without the visible form  If the visible form existed apart from its basic cause it would logically follow that visible form is without cause
But there is nothing anywhere  without cause
 On the other hand if there would be a basic cause apart from visible form The basic cause would be without any product but there is no basic cause without a product
 Just as when there is visible form no basic cause of form obtains
So when there is no visible form no basic cause of form obtains
 Furthermore it does not obtain that no visible form exists without a basic cause
One should not construe any constructs concerning the form
 Just as it does not obtain that the product is the same as the cause
So it does not obtain that product is not the same as the cause
 Also sensation thought mental conception conditioned elements  and
All things  are to be dealt with in the same way as visible form
 Whoever argues against emptiness in order to refute an argument
For him everything including the point of contention  is known to be unrefuted
 Whoever argues by means of emptiness in order to explain an understanding
For him everything including the point to be proved  is known to be misunderstood
 Space does not exist at all before the defining characteristic of space 
If it would exist before the defining characteristic then one must falsely conclude that there would be something without a defining characteristic
 In no case has anything existed without a defining characteristic
If an entity without a defining characteristic does not exist to what does the defining characteristic apply
 There is no functioning of a defining characteristic in a case where there is  a defining characteristic or where there is not a defining characteristic
And it can function in nothing except where there is a defining characteristic or where there is not a defining characteristic
 When there is no related function   it is not possible to have that to which a defining characteristic applies
And if that to which a defining characteristic applies is not possible then a defining characteristic cannot come into existence
 Therefore that to which a defining characteristic applies does not exist  and certainly a defining characteristic itself does not exist 
Now something does not exist without that to which a defining characteristic applies and the defining characteristic
 If the existing thing   does not exist how then would the nonexisting thing   come into existence
And who holds the existingandnonexisting  thing which does not have the properties of an existingandnonexisting thing 
 Therefore space is neither an existing thing nor a nonexisting thing neither something to which a defining characteristic applies  nor a defining characteristic
Also the other five irreducible elements can be considered in the same way as space
 But those unenlightened people who either affirm reality or nonreality
Do not perceive the blessed cessationofappearance of existing things
 An Analysis of Desire  and One Who Desires
 If the one who desires would exist before desire itself then desire may be regarded
When desire becomes related to one who desires then desire comes into existence
 If there is no one who desires how then will desire come into being
whether desire exists or does not exist likewise holds true for the one who desires
 Further it is not possible for both desire and the one who desires to be produced concomitantly
Indeed desire and the one who desires come into being independent of each other
 Concomitance does not exist in that which is only one thing  certainly something which is only one thing cannot be concomitant
But yet how will concomitance come into being if there are separate  things
 If concomitance applied to that which is only one thing then that one with concomitance would be that one without 
If concomitance applied to separate things then that one with concomitance would be that one without 
 And if concomitance applied to separate things what is the proof for the separation of both desire and the one who desires
that which is nonseparate is concomitant
 Or if the separateness of desire and the one who desires really were proved
Why do you imagine the concomitance of them both
 You postulate concomitance by saying neither is proved separate from 
you postulate separateness even more to prove concomitance
 Because separateness is not proved concomitance is not proved
What kind of separateness must exist for you to establish concomitance
 Thus there is no proof that the desire is concomitant with or not concomitant with one who desires
From  desire  every fundamental element  there is no proof of concomitance or nonconcomitance
 If origination  is a composite product then the three characteristics  are appropriate
But if origination is a noncomposite  then how  characteristics of a composite product
 When the three are separate origination of either of the other two characteristics does not suffice to function as a characteristic If united in a composite product how could they all be at one place at one time
 If origination duration and dissolution are other  characteristics of composite products
It is an infinite regress If this is not so they are not composite products
 The originating origination   is only the origination of the basic origination  
Also the origination of the basic   produces the originating origination
 But if according to you the originating origination  produces basic origination
How according to you will this   produce that   if  is not produced by basic origination 
 If according to you that which has originated through basic   produces basic 
How does the basic  which is yet unproduced by that   cause that   to be originated
 According to you this while originating would certainly cause that to originate
If this not being produced would be able to cause origination
 As a light is the illuminator of both itself and that which is other than itself
So origination would originate both itself and that which is other than itself
 There is no darkness in the light and there where the light is placed
What could the light illumine Indeed illumination is the getting rid of darkness
 How is darkness destroyed by the light being originated
When the light being originated does not come in contact with darkness
 But then if darkness is destroyed by a light having no contact with 
placed here will destroy the darkness of the entire world
 If the light illuminated both itself and that which is other than itself Then without a doubt darkness will cover both itself and that which is other than itself
 If it has not yet originated how does origination produce itself
And if it has already originated when it is being produced what is produced after that which is already produced
 In no way does anything originate by what is being originated  by what is already originated  or by what is not yet originated 
Just as it has been said in  presently going to  that which is already gone to  and that which is not yet gone to 
 When in thatwhichisoriginated  there is nothing which activates that which is being originated 
How can one say That which is being originated   presupposing that which is produced
 Whatever comes into existence presupposing something else is without selfexistence 
an allayment of being originated so  of that which is originated 
 If some particular thing which is not yet originated  is indeed known to exist
That thing will be originated What originates if it does not exist
 And if the origination originates that which is being originated 
What origination in turn would originate that origination
 If another origination originates that  there will be an infinite regress of originations
But if nonorigination is that which is origination then everything  would originate
 It is not possible that what has originated either exists or does not exist
Nor that what has not originated either exists or does not exist this has been demonstrated earlier
 The origination of something being destroyed is not possible
And whatever is not being destroyed that entity is not possible
 Neither an entity that has endured   nor an entity that has not endured  endures
Not even something enduring  endures And what endures if it is not originated
 Duration is not possible of a thing that is being destroyed
But whatever is not being destroyed that thing  is  not possible
 Because every entity always  the law of old age and death
What entities are there which endure without old age and death
 The enduring quality of a different duration is as impossible as of that same duration
So the origination of origination is neither itself nor that which is other than itself
 That which has ceased   does not cease and that which has not ceased  does not cease
Nor even that which is ceasing  For what can cease  produced
 Therefore cessation of an enduring entity is not possible
Moreover cessation of a nonenduring entity is not possible
 Indeed a state  does not cease because of this state
And a different state  does not cease because of a different state
 So if the production of all dharmas is not possible
Then neither is the cessation of all  dharmas possible
 Therefore cessation of a real existing entity is not possible
And certainly both an existing entity and a nonexisting entity cannot be possible in the same case
 Even more cessation of a nonreal existing entity is not possible
Just as there is no second decapitation
 There is no cessation by means of itself nor cessation by something other than itself
Just as there is no origination of origination by itself nor by another
 Because the existence of production duration and cessation is not proved there is no composite product 
And if a composite product is not proved how can a noncomposite product  be proved
 As a magic trick a dream or a fairy castle
Just so should we consider origination duration and cessation
 A real producer does not produce a real product
Even more so a nonreal producer does not seek a nonreal product
 There is no producing action of a real thing  there would be a product without someone producing Also there is no producing by a real thing  there would be someone producing without something produced
 If a nonexistent producer would produce a nonreal product
The product would be without a causal source and the producer would be without a causal source
 If there is no causal source there is nothing to be produced nor causeingeneral 
Then neither do the producing action the person producing nor the instrument of production  exist
 If the producing action etc do not exist then neither can the true reality  nor false reality  exist
If neither the true reality nor the false reality exists then also the product  born from that does not exist
 If there is no real product then there also exists no path to heaven nor to ultimate release
Thus it logically follows that all producing actions are without purpose
 And a realnonreal producer does not produce in a realnonreal manner
For indeed how can real and nonreal which are mutually contradictory occur in one place
 A real producer  does not produce what is nonreal and a nonreal producer does not produce what is real indeed all the mistakes must logically follow
 The producer who is neither real nor nonreal does not produce a product which is either real or nonreal Because of the reasons which have been advanced earlier  The nonreal producer does not produce a product which is not real nor both realandnonreal
Because of the reasons which have been advanced earlier
 And a realnonreal producer does not produce a product which is neither real nor nonreal This is evident from the reasons which have been advanced earlier
 The producer proceeds being dependent on the product and the product proceeds being dependent on the producer
The cause for realization  is seen in nothing else
 In the same way one should understand the acquiring  on the basis of the giving up etc of the producer and the product By means of  the product and the producer all other things should be dissolved
 Certain people say Prior to seeing hearing and other  together with sensation and other
Is that to which they belong
  How will there be seeing etc of someone  who does not exist
Therefore there exists a definite  entity before that 
 But that definite entity is previous to sight hearing etc and sensation etc  How can that  be known
 And if that  is determined without sight 
Then undoubtedly those  will exist without that 
 Someone becomes manifest by something  something is manifest by someone
How would someone exist without something How would something exist without someone
 Someone does not exist previous to  sight and all the other  together
he is manifested by any one of  sight etc at any one time
 But if nothing exists previous to sight and all the other  together
How could that  exist individually before sight etc
  if that  were the seer that  were the hearer that  were the one who senses
Then one  would exist previous to each Therefore this  is not logically justified
 On the other hand if the seer were someone else or the hearer were someone else or the one who senses were someone else
Then there would be a hearers when there was already a seer and that would mean a multiplicity of selves 
 In those elements  from which seeing hearing etc and sensation etc arise
Even in those elements that  does not exist
 When he to whom seeing hearing etc and feeling etc belong does not exist
Then certainly they do not exist
 For him who does not exist previous to at the same time or after seeing etc
The conception He exists He does not exist is dissipated
 If fire is identical to its kindling then it is both producer and product
And if fire is different from kindling then surely  exists without kindling 
 A  which is perpetually burning would exist without a cause which is kindling Since another beginning would be pointless in this case  is without its object    is without a cause namely kindling if it were independent of anything else
In which case another beginning would be pointless and there is perpetual burning
 If it is maintained Kindling is that which is being kindled
By what is kindling kindled since kindling is only that  It is inherent existence that would make extinguishing  liberation impossible
  when different and not obtained  will not obtain not burning it will not burn later
Without extinction it will not be extinguished if there is no extinction then it will remain with its own characteristics
 If fire is different from kindling it could obtain the kindling
As a woman obtains a husband and a man  a wife
 Though fire is different from kindling it could indeed obtain the kindling
On the condition that both fire and kindling can be reciprocally differentiated 
 If the fire is dependent on the kindling and if the kindling is dependent on the fire
Which is attained first dependent on which they are fire and kindling
 If fire is dependent on kindling so is the proof of the proved fire
Thus being kindling it will exist without fire
 When a thing  is proved by being dependent on something else then it proves the other by being dependent 
If that which is required for dependence must be proved then what is dependent on what
 If that thing is proved by being dependent how can that which has not been proved be dependent
So that which is proved is dependent but the dependence is not possible
 Fire does not exist in relation to kindling and fire does not exist unrelated to kindling
Kindling does not exist in relation to fire and kindling does not exist unrelated to fire
 Fire does not come from something else and fire does not exist in kindling The remaining  in regard to kindling is described by  that which is being gone to that which is gone to and that which is not yet gone to
 Fire is not identical to kindling but fire is not in anything other than kindling
Fire does not have kindling as its property also the kindling is not in fire and vice versa
 By  fire and kindling the syllogism of the individual self  and the acquiring
Is fully and completely explained as well as the jar and the cloth and other 
 Those who specify the nature of the individual self and of existing things  as radically different
Those people I do not regard as ones who know the sense of the teaching
 The great ascetic  said The extreme limit  of the past cannot be discerned
Existenceinflux  is without bounds indeed there is no beginning nor ending of that 
 How could there be a middle portion of that which has no before and after
It follows that past future and simultaneous events do not obtain
Birth and death are not separate  different not simultaneous  the same  If birth  the former and growing old and dying  coming into being later
Then birth exists without growing old and dying and  is born without death
 If birth were later and growing old and dying were earlier
How would there be an uncaused growing old and dying of something unborn
 And a birth which is simultaneous with growing old and dying is likewise impossible
For that which is being born would die and both would be without cause
 Since the past future and simultaneous activity do not originate
To what purpose  explain in detail  birth growing old and dying
 That which is produced and its cause as well as the characteristic and that which is characterized
The sensation and the one who senses and whatever other things there are 
 Not only is the former limit of existenceinflux  not to be found
But the former limit of all those things is not to be found
 Some say
Sorrow  is produced by oneself  or by another  or by both   or from no cause at all  But  that  as what is produced is not possible
 If it were produced by itself  it would not exist dependent on something else
Certainly those groups of universal elements  exist presupposing these groups
 If these were different from those or if those were different from these
Sorrow  would be produced by something other than itself  because those would be made by these others
 If sorrow  is made through ones own personality   then ones own personality would be without sorrow 
Who is that own personality by which sorrow  is selfproduced 
 If sorrow  were produced by a different personality  
How would he to whom is given that sorrow  by another after he had produced it be without sorrow 
 If sorrow  is produced by a different personality who is that different personality
Who while being without sorrow  yet makes and transmits that  to the other
 It is not established that sorrow  is selfproduced   how is  produced by another 
Certainly the sorrow  which would be produced by another  in his case would be selfproduced 
 Sorrow  is not selfproduced  for that which is produced is certainly not produced by that 
If the other  is not produced by the individual self  how would sorrow  be that produced by another
 Sorrow  could be made by both   if it could be produced by either one
not produced by another and not selfproduced  how can sorrow  exist without a caused
 Not only are the four  interpretations not possible in respect to sorrow 
none of the four  interpretations is possible even in respect to external things 
 A thing of which the basic elements are deception is vain as the glorious one said
All conditioned elements  are things that have basic elements  which are deception therefore they are vain
 If that which has deceptive basic elements is vain what is there which deceives
This was spoken by the glorious one to illuminate emptiness
 There is nonselfexistence of things  a thing by observation  something else
A thing without selfexistence does not existdue to the emptiness of existing things
 If selfexistence does not exist whose otherexistence would there be
 
If selfexistence does exist whose otherexistence would there be
 Just as there is no otherexistence of a thing so also  of something else is not possible
Since a youth is not aging  and since who has already aged is not aging 
 If there would be an otherexistence of a thing milk would exist as curds
surely being curds will be something other than milk
 If something would be nonempty something would  be empty
But nothing is nonempty so how will it become empty
 Emptiness is proclaimed by the victorious one as the refutation of all viewpoints
But those who hold emptiness as a viewpoint have called those incurable 
 That which is seen sight and the seer these three Do not combine together either in pairs or altogether
 Desire the one who desires and the object of desire have to be regarded in the same way
the impurities which remain and the three kinds of base of sense  which remain
  There is unification  of one different thing with another different thing  since the differentness
Of what is seen etc does not exist those  do not enter into unification
 Not only does the differentness of that which is seen etc not exist
Also the differentness of something coming from another does not obtain
 A thing is different insofar as it presupposes a second different thing One thing is not different from another thing without the other thing
 If one different thing is different from a second different thing it exists without a second different thing
But without a second different thing one different thing does not exist as a different thing
 Differentness does not exist in a different thing nor in what is not different
When differentness does not exist then there is neither what is different nor this 
 Unification is not possible by  one thing with that one thing nor by  one thing with a different thing
Thus the becoming unified the state of being united and the one who unites are not possible
 The production of a selfexistent thing by a conditioning cause is not possible
being produced through dependence on a cause a selfexistent thing would be something which is produced 
 How indeed will a selfexistent thing become something which is produced
Certainly a selfexistent thing  is notproduced and is independent of anything else
 If there is an absence of a selfexistent thing how will an otherexistent thing  come into being
Certainly the selfexistence of an otherexistent thing is called otherexistence
 Further how can a thing  without either selfexistence or otherexistence
If either selfexistence or other existence exist then an existing thing indeed would be proved
 If there is no proof of an existent thing then a nonexistent thing cannot be proved
Since people call the otherexistence of an existent thing a nonexistent thing
 Those who perceive selfexistence and otherexistence and an existent thing and a nonexistent thing
Do not perceive the true nature of the Buddhas teaching
 In The Instruction of Katyayana both it is and it is not are opposed
By the Glorious One who has ascertained the meaning of existent and nonexistent
 If there would be an existent thing by its own nature there could not be nonexistence of that 
Certainly an existent thing different from its own nature would never obtain
  If there is no basic selfnature  of what will there be otherness
If there is basic selfnature of what will there be otherness
 It is is a notion of eternity It is not is a nihilistic view
Therefore one who is wise does not have recourse to being or nonbeing
 That which exists by its own nature is eternal since it does not notexist
If it is maintained That which existed before does not exist now there annihilation would logically follow
 When conditioned elements  continue to change  they do not continue to change as eternal things 
Likewise they do not continue to change as noneternal things  The arguments here is the same as for a living being
 If the personality would change when it is sought five ways in the groups  bases of sense perception  and the irreducible elements  Then it does not exist Who  will change 
 Moving from acquisition  to acquisition would be that which is without existence 
Who is he who is without existence and without acquisition To what will he change 
 The final cessation  of the conditioned elements certainly is not possible at all
Nor is the final cessation of even a living being possible at all
 The conditioned elements whose nature  is arising and destruction neither are bound nor released
Likewise a living being neither is bound nor released
 If the acquisition  were the binding that one  the acquisition is not bound
Nor is that one not having the acquisition bound Then in what condition is he bound
 Certainly if the binding would exist before that which is bound then it must bind
But that does not exist The remaining  is stated in  the present going to that which has already gone to and that which has not yet gone to
 Therefore that which is bound is not released and that which is not bound is likewise not released
If that which is bound were released being bound and release would exist simultaneously
 I will be released without any acquisition Nirvana will be mine
Those who understand thus hold too much to a holding on 
 Where there is a superimposing of nirvana  nor a removal of existenceinflux
What is the existenceinflux there
What nirvana is imagined
 The state of mind which is selfdisciplined being favorably disposed toward others
And friendship that is the dharma that is the seed for the fruit now and after death
 The most perceptive seer  has said that there is action  as volition and as a result of having willed
The variety of acts of that  has been explained in many ways
 Thus that action which is called volition that is considered  as mental
But that action which is a result of having willed that is considered  as physical or verbal
 Sound  gesture  and that which does not rest which is considered as unknown 
Also the other unknown which is considered to be at rest 
 That which is pure as a result of enjoyment  that which is impure as a result of enjoyment 
And volition  these seven basic elements  are considered  as the modes of action
 If an action  by enduring to the time of its fulfillment that  would be eternal
If  were stoppedbeing stopped what will it produce
 There is fruit  when a process a sprout etc starts from a seed But without a seed that  does not proceed
 Inasmuch as the process is dependent on a seed and the fruit is produced from the process
The fruit presupposing the seed neither comes to an end nor is eternal
 There is a product  when a mental process starts from a thoughts
But without a thought that  does not proceed
 Inasmuch as the process is dependent on a thought and the product  is produced from the process
The product presupposing the thought neither comes to an end nor is eternal
 The ten pure paths of action are means for realizing the dharma
And the five qualities of desired objects  are fruits  of the dharma both now and after death
 There would be many great mistakes if that explanation 
Therefore that explanation is not possible
 In rebuttal I will explain the interpretation which can be made to fit 
That which is followed by the Buddha the selfsufficient enlightened ones  and the disciples 
 As that which is imperishable is like a credit  so an action  is like a debt
of four kinds in its elements   in its essential nature it cannot be analyzed
  is not destroyed qua destruction rather it is destroyed according to spiritual discipline
Therefore the fruit of actions originates by the imperishable force
 If  were that which is destroyed by  destruction or by transference of action
Fallacies  the destruction of action would logically result  At the moment of transition that
Of all identical and different actions belonging to the same element  originates
 That  is the dharma having arisen by one action after another in visible existence
And it remains  even in the development of all bifurcating action
 That  is destroyed by death and by avoiding the product  
There the difference is characterized as impure and pure
 Emptiness no annihilation existenceinflux noneternity
And the imperishable reality of action such was the teaching taught by the Buddha 
 Why does the action not originate Because it is without selfexistence Since it does not originate it does not perish
 If an action did exist as a selfexistent thing without a doubt it would be eternal
An action would be an unproduced thing certainly there is no eternal thing which is produced
 If the action were not produced then there could be the fear attaining something from something not produced
Then the opposite to a saintly discipline would follow as a fallacy
 Then undoubtedly all daily affairs would be precluded
And even the distinction between saints and sinners is not possible
 Then an act whose development had taken place would develop again
If an act because it persists exists through its own nature  An action is that whose self  is desire and the desires do not really exist
If these desires do not really exist how would the action really exist
 Action and desire are declared to be the conditioning cause of the body
If action and desire are empty what need one say about body 
The man shrouded in ignorance and chained by craving
Is one who seeks enjoyment He is not different from the one who acts nor identical to it
 Since action is not originated presupposing the conditions nor fails to arise from presupposing the conditions
There is no one acting
 If there is no action how could there be one who acts and the product of action
And if there is no product how can there be an enjoyer of the product
 Just as a teacher by his magical power formed a magical form
And this magical form formed again another magical form
 Just so the one who forms is himself being formed magically and the act performed by him
Is like a magical form being magically formed by another magical form
 Desires actions bodies producers and products
Are like a fairy castle resembling a mirage a dream
 If the individual self  were  the groups  then it would partake of origination and destruction
If  were different from the groups then it would be without the characteristics of the groups
 If the individual self does not exist how then will there be something which is my own
There is lack of possessiveness and no ego on account of the cessation of self and that which is my own
 He who is without possessiveness and who has no ego  He also does not exist
Whoever sees he who is without possessiveness or he who has no ego  does not see
 When I and mine have stopped then also there is not an outside nor an inner self
The acquiring   is stopped on account of that destruction there is destruction of verse existence
 On account of the destruction of the pains  of action there is release for pains of action exist for him who constructs them
These pains result from phenomenal extension  but this phenomenal extension comes to a stop by emptiness  There is the teaching of individual self  and the teaching of nonindividual self 
But neither individual self nor nonindividual self whatever has been taught by the Buddhas
 When the domain of thought has been dissipated that which can be stated is dissipated
Those things which are unoriginated and not terminated like nirvana constitute the Truth 
 Everything is actual  or notactual or both acts actualandnotactual
Or neitheractualnornotactual This is the teaching of the Buddha
 Not caused by something else peaceful not elaborated by discursive thought
Indeterminate undifferentiated such are the characteristics of true reality 
 Whatever exists being dependent  is certainly not identical to that 
Nor is a thing different from that therefore it is neither destroyed nor eternal  The immortal essence of the teaching of the Buddhas the lords of the world is
Without singleness or multiplicity it is not destroyed nor is it eternal
 If fullydeveloped Buddhas do not arise  and the disciples  disappear
Then independently the knowledge of the selfproduced enlightened ones  is produced
 If the present and future exist presupposing the past
The present and future will exist in the past
 If the present and future did not exist there 
How could the present and future exist presupposing that past
 Without presupposing the past the two things  cannot be proved to exist Therefore neither present nor future time exist
 In this way the remaining two  can be inverted
Thus one would regard highest lowest and middle etc as oneness and difference
 A nonstationary time cannot be grasped and a stationary time which can be grasped does not exist
How then can one perceive time if it is not grasped
 Since time is dependent on a thing  how can time  without a thing
There is not any thing which exists how then will time become 
 If a product  is produced through the aggregate of causes and conditions
And exists in an aggregate how will it be produced in the aggregate
 If a product is produced in the aggregate of causes and conditions
And does not exist in the aggregate how will it be produced in the aggregate
 If the product is in the aggregate of causes and conditions
Would it not be grasped  in the aggregate But it is not grasped in the aggregate
 If the product is not in the aggregate of causes and conditions
Then the causes and conditions would be the same as noncauses and nonconditions
 If a cause having given the cause for a product is stopped
Then that which is given and that which is stopped would be two identities of the cause
 If a cause without having given the cause for a product is stopped
Then the cause being stopped the product would be produced as something derived from a noncause 
 If the product would become visible concomitantly with the aggregate 
Then it would logically follow that the producer and that which is produced  in the same moment
 If the product would become visible before the aggregate
Then the product without being related to causes and conditions would be something derived from a noncause
 If when the cause of the product is stopped there would be a continuation of the cause
It would logically follow that there would be another production of the previous producing cause
 How can that which is stopped ie something which has disappeared produce the arising of a product
How could a cause which is enclosed by its product even though it persists originate 
 Or if that  were not enclosed by the product which product would it produce
For the cause does not produce the product having seen or not having seen 
 There is no concomitance of a past product with a past cause a future  or present 
 Certainly there is no concomitance of the present product with future cause past  or present 
 Certainly there is no concomitance of a future product with a present cause future  or past 
 If there is no concomitance whatever how would the cause produce the product
Or if a concomitance exists how would the cause produce the product
 If the cause is empty of a product how would it produce the product
If the cause is not empty of a product how would it produce the product
 A nonempty product would not be originated  a nonempty  would not be destroyed
Then that is nonempty which will not originate or not disappear
 How would that be produced which is empty
How would that be destroyed which is empty It logically follows then that which is empty is not originated and not destroyed
 Certainly a oneness of cause and product is not possible at all
Nor is a difference of cause and product possible at all
 If there were a oneness of the cause and product then there would be an identity of the originator and what is originated If there were a difference of product and cause then a cause would be the same as that which is not a cause
 Can a cause produce a product which is essentially existing in itself 
Can a cause produce a product which is not essentially existing in itself   It is not possible to have what is by its nature a cause  of that which is not producing
If what is by its nature a cause is not possible whose product will exist
 How will that  produce a product when
That which is the aggregate of causes and conditions does not produce itself by itself  The product is not produced by the aggregate nor is the product not produced by the aggregate
Without the product how is there an aggregate of conditions
 There is no disappearance either with origination or without it
There is no origination either with disappearance or without it
 How indeed will disappearance exist at all without origination
death without birth There is no disappearance without  origination
 How can disappearance exist concomitantly with origination
Since surely death does not exist at the same moment as birth
 How indeed will origination exist at all without disappearance
For impermanence does not fail to be found in existent things ever  How can origination exist concomitantly with disappearance Since surely death does not exist at the same moment as birth
 When two things cannot be proved either separately or together
No proof exists of those two things How can these two things be proved
 There is no origination of that which is destructible nor of that which is notdestructible
There is no disappearance of that which is destructible nor of that which is nondestructible
 Origination and disappearance cannot exist without an existent thing
Without origination and disappearance an existent thing does not exist
 Origination and disappearance does not obtain for that which is empty
Origination and disappearance does not obtain for that which is nonempty
 It does not obtain that origination and disappearance are the same thing
It does not obtain that origination and disappearance are different
  Origination as well as disappearance is seen it would exist for you
origination and disappearance are seen due to a delusion
 An existent thing does not originate from  thing and an existent thing does not originate from a nonexistent thing
Also a nonexistent thing does not originate from another nonexistent thing and a nonexistent thing does not originate from an existent thing
 An existent thing does not originate either by itself or by something different
Or by itself and something different  How then can it be produced
 For someone assuming an existent thing either an eternalistic or nihilistic point of view would logically follow
For that existent thing would be either eternal or liable to cessation 
For someone assuming an existent thing there is not  eternalism or nihilism
Since this is existence namely the continuity of the originating and stopping of causes and product
 If this is existence namely the continuity of originating and stopping of causes and product
It would logically follow that the cause is destroyed because the destroyed thing does not originate again
 If there is selfexistence of something which is intrinsically existing then nonexistence does not obtain
At the time of nirvana there is destruction of the cycle of existence  as a result of the cessation
 If the last  is destroyed the first  existence does not obtain
If the last  is not destroyed the first  existence does not obtain
 If the first  were produced while the final part were being destroyed
There would be one thing being destroyed and being produced 
 If the one being destroyed and the one being produced cannot exist together
Can someone be produced in those groups of universal elements  in which he is  dying
 Thus the chain of existences is not possible in any of the tree times  And if it does not exist in the three times how can the chain of existences exist
 That one  is not the groups of universal elements  nor something other than the groups the groups are not in him nor is he in them
The fully completed does not possess the groups
What then is the fully completed
 If the Buddha exists dependent on the groups then he is not that which exists by itself
And how can he exist as something else   if he is not that which exists by itself 
 That which exists presupposing another existent thing is properly called a nonindividual self 
How will that which is a nonindividual self become the fully completed
 And if there is no selfexistence  how would it have an otherexistence 
What would that fully completed  be without either a selfexistence or otherexistence
 If some kind of fully completed  would exist without dependence on the groups
It is dependent now therefore it exists dependent 
 There is no kind of fully completed  which is not dependent on the groups
And whatever is not nondependenthow will it become dependent
 There is nothing whatever that is dependent on  and there is no thing whatever on which something does not depend
There would not exist in any way a fully completed  without being dependent on 
 That  which does not exist by its actual reality  or by some other reality  according to the fivefold examination
How is the fully completed  perceived by being dependent
 So when there is dependence selfexistence does not exist
And if there is no selfexistence whatever how is an otherexistence possible
 Thus dependence and that which is dependent are completely empty 
How is that empty fully completed one known through that which is empty
 One may not say that there is emptiness   nor that there is nonemptiness  Nor that both   nor that neither exists  the purpose for saying  is for the purpose of conveying knowledge
 How then will eternity noneternity and  the Tetralemma apply to bliss 
How then will the end without end and  the Tetralemma apply to bliss
 That image of nirvana  the Buddha  either is or is not
By him who  the notion is crudely grasped
 Concerning that which is empty by its own nature  the thoughts do not arise that
The Buddha exists or does not exist after death
 Those who describe in detail the Buddha who is unchanging and beyond all detailed description
Those completely defeated by description do not perceive the fully completed 
 The selfexistence of the fully completed  is the selfexistence of the world
The fully completed  is without selfexistence  the world is without selfexistence
 It is said that desire  hate and delusion are derived from mental fabrication 
Because they come into existence presupposing errors as to what is salutary and unsalutary
 Those things which come into existence presupposing errors as to what is salutary and unsalutary
Do not exist by their own nature  therefore the impurities  do not exist in reality
 The existence or nonexistence of the individual self  is not proved at all
Without that  how can the existence or nonexistence of the impurities be proved
 For impurities exist of somebody and that person is not proved at all
Is it not so that without someone the impurities do not exist of anybody
 In reference to the view of having a body of ones own the impurities do not exist in what is made impure according to the fivefold manner
In reference to the view of having a body of ones own that which is made impure does not exist in the impurities according to the fivefold manner  The errors as to what is salutary and nonsalutary do not exist as selfexistent entities
Depending on which errors as to what is salutary and nonsalutary are then impurities
 Form sound taste touch smell and the dharmas this sixfold Substance  of desire hate and delusion is imagined
 Form sound taste touch smell and the dharmas are
Merely the form of a fairy castle like a mirage a dream
 How will that which is salutary or that which is nonsalutary come into existence
In a formation of a magical man or in things like a reflection
 We submit that there is no nonsalutary thing unrelated to a salutary thing
depending on which there is a salutary thing therefore a salutary thing does not obtain
 We submit that there is no salutary thing unrelated to a nonsalutary thing
depending on which there is a nonsalutary thing therefore a nonsalutary thing does not obtain
 If what is salutary does not exist how will there be desire 
And if what is nonsalutary does not exist how will there be hatred 
 Even if the notion What is permanent is in something impermanent is in error
How can this notion be in error since what is impermanent does not exist in emptiness
 Even if the notion what is permanent is in something impermanent is in error
Is not then the notion concerning emptiness ie that it is impermanent in error
 That by which a notion is formed the notion those who have notions and that which is grasped 
All have ceased therefore the notion does not exist
 If a notion is not existing either as false or true
Whose is the error Whose is the nonerror
 Nor do errors of someone who has erred come into existence
Nor do errors of someone who has not erred come into existence
 And errors of someone who is at present in error do not come into existence
Now you examine of whom do errors really come into existence
 How in all the world will errors which have not originated come into existence
And if errors are not originated how can there be someone involved in error  Since no being is produced by itself nor by something different Nor by itself and something different at the same time how can there be someone involved in error
 If the individual self what is pure what is eternal and happiness really exist
Then the individual self what is pure what is eternal and happiness are not errors
 But if individual self what is pure what is eternal and happiness do not exist
Then nonindividual self what is impure what is impermanent and sorrow  do not exist
 From the cessation of error ignorance ceases
When ignorance has ceased conditioning forces  and everything else cease
 If any kind of selfexistent impurities belong to somebody
How in all the world would they be eliminated Who can eliminate that which is selfexistent
 If any kind of selfexistent impurities do not belong to somebody
How in all the world would they be eliminated Who can eliminate that which is nonselfexistent
 If everything is empty there is no origination nor destruction
Then you must incorrectly conclude that there is nonexistence of the four holy truths
 If there is nonexistence of the four holy truths the saving knowledge the elimination 
The becoming   and the realization  are impossible
 If there is nonexistence then also the four holy fruits do not exist
In the nonexistence of fruit there is no residing in fruit nor obtaining
 When the community  does not exist then those eight kinds of persons  do not exist
Because there is nonexistence of the four holy truths the real dharma does not exist
 And if there are no dharma and community how will the Buddha exist
By speaking thus  certainly you deny the three jewels 
 You deny the real existence of a product of right and wrong
And all the practical behavior of the world as being empty
 We reply that you do not comprehend the point of emptiness
You eliminate both emptiness itself and its purpose from it
 The teaching by the Buddhas of the dharma has recourse to two truths
The worldensconced truth  and the truth which is the highest sense 
 Those who do not know the distribution  of the two kinds of truth
Do not know the profound point   in the teaching of the Buddha
 The highest sense   is not taught apart from practical behavior 
And without having understood the highest sense  one cannot understand nirvana 
 Emptiness having been dimly perceived utterly destroys the slowwitted
It is like a snake wrongly grasped or  knowledge incorrectly applied
 Therefore the mind of the ascetic  was diverted from teaching the dharma
Having thought about the incomprehensibility of the dharma by the stupid
 Time and again you have made a condemnation of emptiness
But that refutation does not apply to our emptiness
 When emptiness works then everything in existence works
If emptiness does not work then all existence does not work
 You while projecting your own faults on us
Are like a person who having mounted his horse forgot the horse
 If you recognize real existence on account of the selfexistence of things
You perceive that there are uncaused and unconditioned things
 You deny what is to be produced cause the producer the instrument of production and the producing action
And the origination destruction and fruit
 The originating dependently we call emptiness
This apprehension ie taking into account  is the understanding of the middle way
 Since there is no dharma whatever originating independently
No dharma whatever exists which is not empty
 If all existence is not empty there is neither origination nor destruction
You must wrongly conclude then that the four holy truths do not exist
 Having originated without being conditioned how will sorrow  come into existence
It is said that sorrow  is not eternal therefore certainly it does not exist by its own nature 
 How can that which is existing by its own nature originate again
For him who denies emptiness there is no production
 There is no destruction of sorrow  if it exists by its own nature
By trying to establish selfexistence you deny destruction
 If the path  is selfexistent then there is no way of bringing it into existence 
If that path is brought into existence then selfexistence which you claim does not exist
 When sorrow  origination and destruction do not exist
What kind of path will obtain the destruction of sorrow 
 If there is no complete knowledge as to selfexistence how  any knowledge of it
Indeed is it not true that selfexistence is that which endures
 As in the case of complete knowledge neither destruction realization bringing into existence
Nor are the four holy fruits possible for you
 If you accept selfexistence and a fruit is not known by its selfexistence
How can it be known at all
 In the nonexistence of fruit there is no residing in fruit nor obtaining 
When the community  does not exist then those eight kinds of persons do not exist
 Because there is nonexistence of the four holy truths the real dharma does not exist
And if there is no dharma and community how will the Buddha exist
 For you either the one who is enlightened  comes into being independent of enlightenment
Or enlightenment comes into being independent of the one who is enlightened
 For you some one who is a nonbuddha by his own nature  but strives for enlightenment Will not attain the enlightenment though the way of life of becoming fully enlightened
 Neither the dharma nor nondharma will be done anywhere
What is produced which is nonempty Certainly selfexistence is not produced
 Certainly for you there is a product without  of dharma or nondharma
Since for you the product caused by dharma or nondharma does not exist
 If for you the product is caused by dharma or nondharma be nonempty
How can that product being originated by dharma or nondharma empty
 You deny all mundane and customary activities
When you deny emptiness  dependent coorigination   If you deny emptiness there would be action which is unactivated
There would be nothing whatever acted upon and a producing action would be something not begun
 According to  selfexistence the world is free from different conditions
Then it will exist as unproduced undestroyed and immutable
 If nonemptiness does not exist then something is attained which is not attained
There is cessation of sorrow  and actions and all evil is destroyed
 He who perceives dependent coorigination
Also understands sorrow  origination and destruction as well as the path 
 If all existence is empty there is no origination nor destruction
Then whose nirvana through elimination  and destruction  would be postulated
 If all existence is nonempty there is no origination nor destruction
Then whose nirvana through elimination  and destruction  would be postulated
 Nirvana has been said to be neither eliminated nor attained neither annihilated nor eternal Neither disappeared nor originated
 Nirvana is certainly not an existing thing for then it would be characterized by old age and death In consequence it would involve the error that an existing thing would not become old and be without death
 And if nirvana is an existing thing nirvana would be a constructed product  Since never ever has an existing thing been found to be a nonconstructedproduct 
 But if nirvana is an existing thing how could  exist without dependence 
Certainly nirvana does not exist as something without dependence
 If nirvana is not an existing thing will nirvana become a nonexisting thing Wherever there is no existing thing neither is there a nonexisting thing
 But if nirvana is a nonexisting thing how could  exist without dependence  Certainly nirvana is not a nonexisting thing which exists without dependence
 That state which is the rushing in and out  when dependent or conditioned
This  when not dependent or not conditioned is seen to be nirvana
 The teacher  has taught that a becoming and a nonbecoming  are destroyed
Therefore it obtains that Nirvana is neither an existent thing nor a nonexistent thing
 If nirvana were both an existent and a nonexistent thing
Final release  would be  an existent and a nonexistent thing but that is not possible
 If nirvana were both an existent and a nonexistent thing There would be no nirvana without conditions for these both  conditions
 How can nirvana exist as both an existent thing and a nonexistent thing
For nirvana is a noncompositeproduct  while both an existent thing and a nonexistent thing are composite products 
 How can nirvana exist as both an existent and a nonexistent thing
There is no existence of both at one and the same place as in the case of both darkness and light
 The assertion Nirvana is neither an existent thing nor a nonexistent thing
Is proved if  It is an existent thing and a nonexistent thing were proved
 If nirvana is neither an existent thing nor a nonexistent thing
Who can really arrive at  neither an existent thing nor a nonexistent thing
 It is not expressed if the Glorious One  exists  after his death
Or does not exist  or both  or neither 
 Also it is not expressed if the Glorious One exists  while remaining 
Or does not exist  or both  or neither 
 There is nothing whatever which differentiates the existenceinflux  from nirvana
And there is nothing whatever which differentiates nirvana from existenceinflux
 The extreme limit  of nirvana is also the extreme limit of existenceinflux
There is not the slightest bit of difference between these two
 The views  whether that which is beyond death is limited by a beginning or an end or some other alternative
Depend on a nirvana limited by a beginning  and an end 
 Since all dharmas are empty what is finite What is infinite
What is both finite and infinite What is neither finite nor infinite
 Is there anything which is this or something else which is permanent or impermanent
Which is both permanent and impermanent or which is neither
 The cessation of accepting everything  is a salutary  cessation of phenomenal development 
No dharma anywhere has been taught by the Buddha of anything
 What is hidden by ignorance   has caused the three kinds of conditioned things   to be made for rebirth  By those actions it  goes forward
 Consciousness  presupposing that which is conditioned  enters on its course When consciousness is begun the nameandform  is instilled  When the nameandform is instilled the six domains of sense perceptions   are produced
Having arrived at the six domains of sense perceptions the process of perception begins to function  Consciousness begins to function presupposing the eye the visual forms and ability of mental association
Presupposing nameandform
 That which is the coincidence   of visual form consciousness and the eye
That is sensual perception and from perception sensation  begins to function
 Craving    is conditioned by sensation
Certainly  craves for the sake of sensation
The one who craves acquires the fourfold acquisition
  When the acquisition exists the acquirer begins to function   If he were someone without acquisition that being would be released and would not exist
 That being is the five groups of universal elements  Because of a being birth  begins to function
Growing old dying sorrow   etc grief and regrets
 Despair and agitation all this results from birth
That produced being is a single mass of sorrows 
 Thus the ignorant people construct the conditioned things   the source for existenceinflux The one who constructs is ignorant the wise person is not  because he perceives true reality  When ignorance ceases the constructed phenomena do not come into existence A persons cessation of ignorance proceeds on the basis of becoming  through knowledge
 Through cessation of every  none functions
That single mass of sorrow  is thus completely destroyed
 Those  relating to the limits of the past reality are The world is eternal etc 
 The assertion I will not become something different in a future time
I will become  and the alternative etc are relating to an end 
  I existed in a past time  does not obtain
Since this  is not  that one who  in a former birth
 Were he  that individual self  which he acquires  would be different
Moreover what kind of individual self is there without acquisition 
 If it were held that There is no individual self without the acquisition
Then the individual self would be  the acquisition or it is not an individual self 
 The individual self is not the acquisition since that  appears and disappears
Now really how will he who acquires become that which is acquired
 Moreover it does not obtain that the individual self is different from the acquisition
If the individual self were different it would be perceived without the acquisition but  it is not so perceived
 Thus that  is not different from nor identical to the acquisition The individual self is not without acquisition but there is no certainty that It does not exist
  I have not existed in a past time  does not obtain
For that one  is not different  from that one who was in a former birth  If that  were different he would exist in exclusion of that  one
Therefore either that  persists or he would be born eternal
 
 There is no existing thing which is that which has not existed prior Therefore the error logically follows that
Either the individual self is what is produced or it originates without a cause
 Thus the view concerning the past which  I have existed  or I have not existed 
Both   or neither  this does not obtain at all
  I will become something in a future time 
Or I will not become   etc    like those  of the past
 If This is a man this is a god  then eternity  exists
For god is unproduced and certainly something eternal would not be born
 If man is different from god there would exist something noneternal 
If man is different from god then a continuity does not obtain
 If one part were divine and another part human
Then there would be something noneternal  that which is eternal  but that is not possible  If something both noneternal and eternal were proved
Then no doubt something neither eternal nor noneternal  is proved
 If someone having come from somewhere in some way goes somewhere again
Then there would be existenceinflux with no beginning but this is not the case
 If someone who is eternal does not exist who will exist being noneternal
Or who being both eternal and noneternal or devoid of these two 
 If the world would come to an end how would an otherworld come into existence
If the world would not come to an end how would an otherworld come into being
 Since the continuity of the groups of universal elements   functions like flames of lamps both having an end and not having an end is not possible
 If the former  would disappear those  groups which are dependent on those  groups would not arise
Therefore the world would come to an end 
 If the former  would not disappear these  groups which are dependent on those  groups would not arise
Therefore the world would be eternal 
 If one part were finite and the other were infinite
The world would be both finite and infinite  but this is not possible
 Therefore how can it be that one part of one who acquires  will be destroyed
And one part not destroyed  This is not possible
 How indeed can it be that one part of the acquisition   will be destroyed
And one part not destroyed  That certainly does not obtain
 If the  both finite and infinite were proved
Then no doubt neither finite nor infinite  could be proved
 Because of the emptiness of all existing things
How will the views about eternity etc come into existence about what of whom and of what kind
 To him possessing compassion who taught the real dharma

Summary of the Great Vehicle by Huikai In a farreaching manner the excellent path is rich in insight and in an impartial fashion its great compassion is conducive and inexhaustible 
Yet it is easy to embark on a wrong path and bewildering illusions are dicult to allay 
If one begins by discoursing on transcendence then doubts cannot be eradicated This is why established the teaching and constructed the methods in accord with the character and disposition of sentient beings 
Before Yao and Shun there were only a few simple guidelines but after Chou of Chi there were many prolix rules and regulations Although again and again regulated the ceremonies proposed their instructions and led the people by means of conventional teachings the wondrous meaning of the true and the apparent remained hidden and unnoticed Thus the progression of the BuddhaDharma lay concealed west of the Pamir Mountains and the teaching was hidden beyond the vast Sea 
From the time when the House of Han received the mandate has slowly and gradually spread eastward until in the Chin dynasty it began to grow popular When the Liang ruled the land it prospered and became eminent After about half a thousand years and seven generations it has come down to the present Kumrajva led forth to the pure source and spent his entire life in spreading its fragrance 
Thenceforth being excessively fervent and enthusiastic none failed to run astray in their own directions Their grasp of the teachings of the ancients and the practices of the patriarchs followed their own dispositions and the opaqueness of their interpretations exceeded all limit 
In my heart I Huikai felt inadequate to assume the satchel  was embarrassed to gather my resources diligently and feared I might lay out a mistaken direction for students and disciples In sincerity I received instruction and over a period of several years visited innumerable places in order to study Famous teachers were my dear friends and I readily took their counsel Yet in my investigations and inquiries I focused on the rustic and shallow without any hope of success 
I hid this  my thinking exhausted itself in the literal meaning of texts and my notions were led astray from the broad meaning I began the mornings with a sigh and frequently became dispirited My entire attempt was to question the way according to current practice yet I failed to see the path 
There was a Tripiaka master from the country of Ujjayan He was a brahman His surname was Bhrata and his personal name was Kulantha which translated means Savior of his Family His discernment was profound and extensive 
His visage was superior and his intelligence conspicuous His eloquence was disciplined and farreaching His spiritual practice excelled the crowd and his enunciation of virtue bypassed the common When young he had visited all countries and studied under a succession of masters 
He had initially studied nonBuddhist texts and fully understood the profundities of these books He retained the four Vedas in his heart and the six kinds of Vedic commentaries in his innermost mind He had also studied exhaustively the Three Collections of Buddhist texts He thoroughly practiced the ve classes of insight into the four truths and meditation 
For this reason the Dharma Master avoided the entire area with the result that the great doctrine remained hidden and did not spread 
Before he reached Chinchiang he turned back and went to Wuling he was not engaged in translating many scrolls but when afterward he went to Minyeh he preached frequently 
The Dharma Master was magnanimous to all his only lament being that there were few who understood his words This is why Poya cut the strings of his lute and why Pienho wept jade  was skillful in the dicult interpretation of subtle passages  the rarity of his wonderful jewel was exceptional 
After a long period of traveling about the Dharma Master desired to return to his native land Retracing his steps along the highway he came to Fany 
Ouyang Wei of sage visage and lofty spirit who held the post of elder statesman ie he held the ceremonial rank equal to the following three oces without any specic duties was magistrate of Hungchou and prefect of Yangshang and had become governor of Tungho He was well versed in the classics and trained in military tactics He supported the Way and aided the times bringing peace to the homeless people in Paiyeh He established the true doctrine in Wuling 
He respected the noble conduct of the Dharma Master and honored his excellent discipline Requesting that he become the Vinaya master with full and due respect he observed the proprieties of a disciple 
I  had formerly received instruction and was in some slight degree puried but the heavy dross lay hidden in my heart and for a short time I had withdrawn  Now I repeatedly honored and cherished Dharma Master Paramrtha and danced for joy 
Once again I desired to feed on peace and true virtue I inquired into the Way and expressed my doubts 
Although I had been diligent attentive and earnest and was not slowwitted or recalcitrant I had been irresolute and losing the course had not committed my heart 
The eldest son Ouyang Ho who was magistrate of Hengchou and prefect of Yangshang was noble and moderate in his actions dignied upright and well read in literature and history In a profound and farreaching manner he attended to the essentials of governing He was a rened man of inner depth His purity and brightness shone forth 
He revered eminence and relished the path He had genuine faith and loved the wonder  Observing all the proper ceremonies he personally made a request of my master 
The Dharma Master was pleased to receive his request and agreed to engage in translation and interpretation of the Buddhas teachings 
Dharma Master Huichih abbot of Chihchih Temple was unsullied in his observance of discipline and totally engaged in spiritual practice his mind was set upon quiet seclusion when ran counter to the path he always rose to the occasion inexhaustible in reforming and untiring in turning aairs around Chungching the commandant of the Southern Army was docile and intelligent in his progression in virtue His resolution was simple and farreaching 
With the sun shining each morning the next year passed in harmony and in the third month when spring had arrived at Chihchih Temple Dharma Master began his translation and interpretation  
He already understood its grammar and had learned the dialect All its words had to be elucidated and no meaning left imprecise or unclear My teacher would sit on his mat until dawn without sleep 
I  was his attentive scribe who copied down just what he said word for word phrase for phrase chapter for chapter Only after he had nished his examination of the text and translated its meaning did we issue the text 
We present it to the monks so that they may patiently study it together 
The basic text is in three scrolls the Commentary in twelve scrolls and the Interpretation in eight scrolls which amount to twentythree scrolls 
This treatise is an outline of the Great Vehicle The deep and wondrous meaning of the true doctrine arises cloudlike  and its pure expressions overow like the sea 
It is both profound and farreaching Because of it the two vehicles fade into oblivion 
Broad and formidable are its contents which constitute the course of study on the ten stages 
About one thousand one hundred years after the departure of the Tathgata Bodhisattva Maitreya reached his appointed time descended from his spirit abode came down and drew near Forgetful of self he deigned to respond to Dharma Master Asaga and to interpret extensively the meaning of the Great Vehicle The name Asaga means Nonattachment The Dharma Master attained the unitary way and embodied its practice He delved into the nal limits of its mystery and made its spiritual reality manifest 
The Dharma Masters younger brother Vasubandhu which translated means Heavenly Friend was born into the inferior way ie the Hinayana but in virtue he was endowed with the seed lineage of the Great Vehicle His character was lofty and his spirit quick to discern Having been prodded by his elder brother he meditated on the broad meaning of the Great Vehicle 
Recognizing that the style of all Master Asagas treatises was profound and their meaning dicult to understand he was concerned lest later students become confused Therefore he composed his Commentary in order to interpret the basic text in which he subsumed the lesser vehicles and refuted heterodox teachings with the point of his brush 
By laboring over and carefully reading  the way of the illustrious gentlemen will not be lost 
 The Chapter Titles of the Excellent Teaching on Support on the scriptures of the Great Vehicle  Standing before the Worldhonored One Bodhisattva Mahynasupravia desiring to manifest the excellent qualities of the Great Vehicle spoke in accord with the teaching of that Great Vehicle and said All Worldhonored Buddhas have ten excellent teachings which are unequaled and unsurpassed by any other teachings  port for the knowable  the excellent teaching on the knowable excellent teaching on the cause and result of this entrance  the excellent teaching on dierences in the cultivation of the cause and result of this entrance  the excellent teaching on the moral training that depends on these dierences in cultivation  the excellent teaching on the thought training that relies on this moral training  the excellent teaching on the wisdom training that relies on this thought training  the excellent teaching on abandonment as the result of this training and  the excellent teaching on the dierentiations of wisdom 
The teaching enunciated by the Tathgata surpasses other teachings 
An interpretation of the scriptures such as this demonstrates that the truths of the Great Vehicle are the very words of the Buddha 
demonstrate that the Great Vehicle is superior to other teachings 
Because this summary interpretation treats ten themes that are found only in the Great Vehicle and not in the lesser vehicle 
What are these ten 
They are  the container consciousness explained as the support for the knowable  the three patterns of otherdependence  imagination  and reality explained as the characteristic patterns of the knowable  the doctrine of conscious constructiononly explained as the entrance into the knowable  the six perfections explained as the causes and results of this entrance  the ten bodhisattva stages explained as the dierences in the cultivation of these causes and results of this entrance  the discipline maintained and kept by bodhisattvas explained as the moral training within these dierences  the concentrations such as those of the heroic march and the space storehouse explained as thought training  nonimaginative wisdom explained as wisdom training  nonabiding cessation explained as the resultant abandonment and  the three Buddha bodies of essence  reward  and transformation explained as resultant nonimaginative wisdom 
 Because these ten themes are found only in the Great Vehicle and dier from those of the lesser vehicle we arm that it is foremost 
Because the Worldhonored Buddha has enunciated these ten themes for bodhisattvas the ten excellent teachings of all Worldhonored Buddhas who rely on the Great Vehicle are armed to be superior to other teachings 
entation in the enunciation of these ten excellent teachings is the very word of the Tathgata How can one deny that the lesser vehicle is indeed also a great vehicle 
Because these ten themes never appear in the lesser vehicle or in any of its interpretative commentaries but do appear in the Great Vehicle and are commented upon therein 
Furthermore these ten themes are able to elicit the highest wisdom They are valid consistent and logically cogent so that sentient beings may attain a wisdom of universal understanding 
We present verses The support of the knowable its characteristic patterns Its entrance its causes and results And the dierences in cultivation The three trainings and abandonment as result Together with wisdom are the sum of the Great Vehicle 
These ten themes are found nowhere else Gaining insight into them is the cause of wisdom Therefore the Great Vehicle is the Buddhas word Because he taught excellence in these ten themes 
They are so presented because in their initial practices bodhisattvas must rst examine the causes of all things just as they are and in virtue of such an examination they must engender an intelligent understanding of the twelvefold dependent coarising 
Then they must understand and analyze the basic character of what is dependently coarisen through the understanding of which they can separate themselves from the two extreme mistakes of imputing being where nothing exists or subtracting being where it does exist 
In this manner their correct meditation will penetrate to all the characteristics of objects just as they really are Next they must become liberated from all obstacles 
Having penetrated to the true characteristics of the knowable by reliance on the purication of their inner aspirations they must bring the rst six perfections which they have already been cultivating to completion and cause them to be puried without further defect 
Then all the perfections comprised in that inner purication must be cultivated for three eons in the dierent conditions of the ten stages 
Then the three bodhisattva trainings must be brought to fulllment after which the results of these trainings will be cessation and the supreme highest awakening  
This is the sequence wherein they must attain these ten understandings through successive cultivations 
The Great Vehicle attains its full plenitude in such a sequence 
Where has the Worldhonored One spoken of this consciousness Where did he call it the container 
In the basic verses that summarize the Abhidharma he said From beginningless time this realm Is the support for all things Only if it exists do all the destinies exist And is there an access to cessation 
These two scriptural verses express the basic structure and the name of this consciousness 
Because the results of the deled mental states of all sentient beings lie concealed and stored up in it as results and because this consciousness lies concealed and stored up in all those mental states as their cause 
Furthermore it is called the container consciousness inasmuch as all sentient beings clinging to an image of their selfhood are themselves contained within the connes of  this consciousness 
Because it appropriates and upholds all the physical sense organs of sentient beings and because it is the support for taking up all the experiences of rebirth 
Why is this so 
Because all the physical sense organs having been appropriated by this consciousness do not pass away until the end of life 
When it continues into new rebirths it is able to engender and make its own their formation for this is how the physical bodies in the six destinies are appropriated It is thus that the bodies in the six destinies are made ones own 
Thinking is here of two kinds 
 If this deled state of mind did not exist then solitary ignorance would be impossible  there would be no analogy with the ve sense consciousnesses for just as these ve sense consciousnesses must have their own common simultaneous support that is the ve sense organs so deled ideas and images must have their support in the deled mind  the root meaning of the term thinking would be meaningless   there would be no dierence between nonconceptual concentration and the concentration that destroys thought for the deled mind is present in nonconceptual concentration but not in minddestroying concentration 
If this were not their dierence they would be identical  among unconscious gods  there would be no belief in self selfpride and so on since they would be perfected in the absence of outows defects and dele ments and  at all times the engendering of selfclinging occurs in all good evil and morally neutral mental states 
However we avoid this error by allowing that the two minds arise simultaneously 
But if one grants that illusions are activated solely in association with the six sense consciousnesses one falls into this error 
The absence of solitary ignorance the analogy with the ve sense consciousnesses The identity between the two concentrations the meaningless status for the root mind The absence of selfclinging in states of no thinking during that period of concentration which would issue in the absence of outows The nonarising of selfclinging in all good evil and neutral states 
If there were no deled mind the rst two would not exist and the latter three would be contradicted 
Solitary ignorance is the illusory obstacle that causes the realization of insight into true meaning not to arise and it occurs in all states 
Mind although deled is comprised among morally undened states and it is always yoked to the four delusions 
Being clouded and yet morally undened it is similar to the delusions in the worlds of form and formlessness for the passions of these two worlds occlude quietude  Such thought arises in each and every state without ceasing 
Because it belongs among the subtle objects of understanding 
Wordhearers are not expected to attain the preeminent wisdom of omniscience and thus even though there is no mention of it among them nevertheless their perfect wisdom leads them to fulll their basic commitment Thus it was not taught to them 
But because all bodhisattvas are expected to attain the preeminent wisdom of omniscience the Buddha taught it to them 
Apart from this wisdom it is impossible to attain supreme awakening 
 the wordhearers vehicle but in dierent terms 
It is because a Tathgata appears in the world that such a singular wondrous inconceivable doctrine as that about the fundamental consciousness is manifested in the world 
In this Scripture on the Four Kinds of Good Qualities of the Tathgatas Appearance in the World from the Book of Gradual Sayings we see that this consciousness is already taught in the wordhearers vehicle although in dierent terms 
Moreover in a scripture of the Mahsghika school this consciousness is presented under the alternate term of the foundational consciousness for it is like the roots of a tree 
The Mahsaka school also teaches this consciousness under an alternate name when it explains the aggregate that perdures throughout transmigration What does this mean 
That although the continuity of material form and mind is at times severed the seeds within the mind are not terminated 
able is already presented as a royal road in the lesser vehicle in the terms of appropriation container mind the foundational conscious ness and the aggregate that perdures throughout transmigration 
Inasmuch as it has already been admitted that thought and sense consciousness refer to dierent things so one must understand mind also to refer to something dierent 
Yet other masters interpret the term possessions in the Worldhonored Ones statement that people in the world delight in their possessions to refer to the ve appropriated aggregates  
Yet others think that it refers to the sensations of enjoyment that accompany desire 
When they draw their opinions from the scriptures and meditations they do so in the context of the teachings and practices of the lesser vehicle and their proposals do not accord with true reason 
If they were not confused about the container consciousness they would agree that our interpretation that these terms in the lesser vehicle refer to this consciousness is preferable 
Why is it preferable 
The term possessions does not refer to the appropriated aggregates because  Those who hold the opinion that possessions refer to the ve appropriated aggregates should consider that for those born into one of the evil destinies lled with total pain these appropriated aggregates are most detestable 
It is not reasonable that those people would delight in such totally undelightful aggregates 
Rather they constantly wish that those aggregates be severed and done away with 
 It does not refer to the sensation of enjoyment that accompanies desire since this sensation does not exist for those above the fourth meditation 
If one had already experienced that sensation then when he seeks the higher realms he will engender revulsion in its regard Therefore it cannot be reasonably held that such persons delight in that sensation 
 It cannot refer to belief in selfhood because those within the true doctrine who believe in nonself negate such an attachment and engender no delight in it 
Although those born above the fourth meditation never again delight in the pleasurable sensation associated with desire yet they are still pursued by and not separated from their love of self in their container consciousnesses 
Likewise those within the true doctrine although committed to the doctrine of nonself and opposed to belief in selfhood yet also have selflove for their container consciousnesses 
Its dening characteristic is that relying on the permeations of all deled states it is the basic repository of seeds whereby the arising of those states is maintained 
Its characteristic as cause means that this consciousness with all these seeds is the cause for the constant generation of those deled states 
Its characteristic as result means that this consciousness arises as the result of the beginningless permeations of these various deled states 
meation meant to signify 
It is meant to signify the state arising and passing away in tandem with those  that is the generative cause for subsequent changes 
It is like a sesame seed imbued with the fragrance of a ower As the sesame and the owers scent repeatedly arise and pass away in tandem the sesame becomes the generative cause for that fragrance 
If a person engages in acts of lust he becomes permeated with lust As his mind repeatedly arises and passes away in tandem with lust the lust becomes the generative cause for the evolutions of his mind 
As his repeated acts of reective listening arise and pass away in tandem with his thinking that learning becomes the generative cause for his minds understanding 
Because this permeation becomes habitual we say that such and such persons are learned in doctrine 
This same reasoning also applies in regard to the container consciousness 
But although when joined they are not dierent from it yet they are not identical with it either 
The container consciousness arises in such a manner that when permeations are engendered it has full capability to engender as dierent 
states are simultaneously causes of one another It is like the light and the wick of a lamp for the arising of the light and the burning of the wick are simultaneous causes one of the other 
It is also like a bundle of reeds that remain standing because simultaneously lean on one another 
Know then that the foundational consciousness and its permeations are reciprocal causes in a similar fashion for this consciousness is the cause for deled states and deled states are the causes for this consciousness 
Why is this so 
Because no other cause can be found apart from these two 
variegated be the eective generative cause for all things which are dierentiated and are variegated 
It is like a garment woven with many threads it does not have many colors but after it is put into the dyeing vat sundry patterns appear on its surface 
In like fashion at the moment when the container consciousness is permeated by a cluster of varied mental states its one nature is not variegated 
But when it is put into the dyeing vat of karmic results it takes on an incalculable variety of patterns 
sciousness is the most subtle and most profound interpretation of dependent coarising in the Great Vehicle 
 In summary there are two levels of dependent coarising that which distinguishes essences and that which distinguishes the pleasurable and the unpleasurable 
Dependent coarising that distinguishes essences means that the arising of all things is supported upon the container consciousness for it distinguishes the essences of the causes of all the varied things 
That which distinguishes the pleasant and the unpleasant is the twelvefold dependent coarising for it distinguishes the various dierent causes for the pleasant and the unpleasant in good or evil destinies 
Those who are confused about the second dependent coarising imagine a self as the subject of action and experience 
They are like the blind men who had never before encountered an elephant 
When someone showed them one and had them feel it some touched its trunk some its tusk some its ear some its foot some its tail and some its ank 
When asked what an elephant was some of the blind men responded that it was like a plow handle others that it was like a wooden pestle a fan a mortar a broom or a mountain rock 
Whether they claim that the cause of transmigration is an original essence past actions the creative action of a god the self with its eight inherent qualities or that there is no cause or whether they imagine a self as the subject of action and experience because they do not understand the basic pattern of the container consciousness and its causeresult relationships they are like those blind men who not recognizing the shape of the elephant oered such strange explanations 
is maturing consciousness endowed with all its seeds This consciousness is found in all persons in the three worlds and all the six destinies and four kinds of birth without exception 
meatorif unable to be otherwise permeatedthis is the basic character of permeation 
These characteristics apply only to the container consciousness because they are not associated with the six sense consciousnesses because three aspects of the six sense consciousnesses ie support object and attention are dierent and opposed  because two moments are not simultaneous and because one would then overextend the analogy  
It is in virtue of inner seeds that The outer come to fruition 
They are the active consciousnesses that are present in all births and destinies 
Know that they are also called the experiential consciousnesses as taught in a verse from the Analysis of the Middle and the Extremes  The rst is termed causal consciousness And the second experiential consciousness Wherein the mental states of sense experience Discrimination of names and activity take place 
other as a verse from the Mahayana Abhidharma states All mental states are stored within consciousness And consciousness within all mental states These two are causes of each other As they are always results of each other 
active consciousnesses and consciousness are direct causes of each other then in the second dependent coarising what kind of causality is exercised in regard to all these mental states 
It is that of the dominant condition  
How many kinds of causality engender the six sense consciousnesses 
There are three kinds of causality dominant condition object as cause and immediately antecedent causality 
But how can one be certain that it is the container consciousness that is so described by the Tathgata through these various names and in these structural patternsthat they do not also describe the active consciousnesses 
If the container consciousness were to be established apart from these names and patterns then neither deled nor puried states would be possible for the deled states of passion action and birth as well as states of both worldly purication and worldtranscendent purication would not be possible 
Because it is impossible that the seminal permeations activated by the basic passions and the secondary passions come to term in the six sense consciousnesses 
Why is this so 
Let us consider the case where a visual consciousness arises and passes away in tandem with major or minor delusory passions of desire and so on It is this visual consciousness that becomes seeded by the permeations of delusory passions not any other consciousness 
Furthermore permeation does not occur in visual consciousness even if it were to arise simultaneously with desire and so on 
Because the seed does not dwell in the desire since desire is supported by consciousness and because the continuity of desire is not stable 
Furthermore desire in the other consciousnesses is not permeation because their supports are specic to each and because the other consciousnesses do not arise and pass away in tandem with each other 
Visual consciousness does not permeate itself because two visual consciousnesses of the same variety cannot permeate because they do not arise simultaneously in tandem with each other 
Therefore visual consciousness is not permeated by the major or minor delusory passions of desire and so on It is not permeated by another consciousness of the same kind 
This evaluation of visual consciousness also applies to the other sense consciousnesses 
unconcsious gods and is reborn into this lower world then his consciousness from the instant of that rebirth is deled by the major and minor delusory passions But his consciousness would at the time of rebirth lack seeds for he would have already eliminated the permeations of delusory passions and their supporting sense consciousnesses that support delement 
then other worldly consciousnesses are eliminated 
If there were no container consciousness then this countering consciousness would arise in tandem with the seeds of the major and minor delusory passions which is patently impossible 
Because its nature is liberative and because a mind without deled outows cannot arise and pass away simultaneously with delusory passions 
Also when after one emerges from insight into truth ie after the path of meditation that engenders the prior countering consciousness has passed into the path of vision and worldly consciousness arises then all the permeations of delusory passions would long since have been eliminated and a mental consciousness that had deled outows would arise without seeds  
Therefore the delement of passion is impossible apart from the container consciousness 
The member of the twelvefold dependent coarising conditioned on karmic formations consciousness arises would be impossible and it is unreasonable to say that conditioned by appropriation being arises if the appropriating container consciousness does not exist 
Because there would be no link to a rebirth 
When a person dies in a realm of nonconcentration ie in the world of desire  he comes to experience rebirth in virtue of a deled thinking consciousness engendered in the entire intermediary state 
When this deled consciousness is eliminated in the intermediate state then a consciousness formed in the embryo in the mothers womb experiences rebirth 
But if it is this thinking consciousness that becomes the support for the embryo then within the mothers womb this thinking consciousness would engender another separate thinking consciousness which cannot happen since it is impossible for two kinds of thinking consciousness to arise simultaneously in the mothers womb 
Also thinking consciousness cannot be the that formed in the embryo because thinking consciousness nds its support in delement  because it would always have an object  and because that object would be unknown  
If one holds that another supported consciousness is the seminal consciousness then thinking consciousness because it is supported and caused by another is a supported consciousness 
Therefore it is demonstrated that the consciousness that is formed in the embryo is not thinking consciousness but only the maturative and seminal  
be impossible for him to appropriate the material sense organs apart from the maturing consciousness 
This is because the other sense consciousnesses all have their specic supports in the sense organs and because they are not stable 
It is impossible to have sense organs without an appropriating consciousness 
and the naming of perceptible things is like the mutual reliance of reeds standing in bundles and is impossible apart from the consciousness 
could be no mental sustenance for sentient beings who have already been born because apart from the maturing consciousness not any of the consciousnesses of seeing etc have ever been seen to be able to sustain sentient beings born into the triple world 
land of concentration it is in virtue of this scattered deled thinking consciousness that he experiences rebirth there But apart from this maturing consciousness it is impossible for that deled scattered mind to be the seed in that land of concentration 
formlessness engenders a deled but morally good mind then apart from the seminal maturing consciousness it would be without seed and without support thereby rendering impossible a mind both deled and morally good 
outows then all other worldly states of mind are eliminated If then there were no maturing consciousness then one would become extinct in that destiny 
nor nonconceptualization engenders a mind of no outows and a mind of nonbeing then he would immediately eliminate both these states because that mind without outows is a worldtranscendent mind and neither the destiny of neither conceptualization nor nonconceptualization nor the destiny of nonbeing nor the entry into cessation is its support 
Therefore apart from the seminal maturing consciousness the delement of birth is impossible 
If a sentient being has not yet become freed from the world of desire with its cravings if he has not yet attained a mind of the world of form  then he rst engenders a good mind in the world of desire and strives to be freed from that world of desire with its cravings 
But the thought of applying oneself to meditation is not permeated  because the thought of engaging in practice in the world of desire does not arise and pass away in tandem with any mind from the world of form Therefore the good thoughts in the world of form are not the seeds for good thoughts of the world of desire 
Past states of mind in the world of form have been eliminated by other states of mind through an unlimited number of other rebirths and thus they cannot act as the seed for subsequent states of concentration because they do not exist 
Therefore it is demonstrated that the repeated inuences of the seminal maturing consciousness act as direct cause in regard to subsequent states of concentration in the world of form while the good thought of engaging in practice acts as their dominant condition 
This explanation holds for all realms that are freed from desire 
Thus apart from the seminal maturing consciousness states of worldly purication are impossible 
The Worldhonored Buddha has taught True insight arises from hearing the voice of others and reecting within oneself correctly But this hearing of the voice of others and this correct reection are unable to permeate the ear consciousness or the thinking consciousness or both together  
When a person correctly reects on the doctrine as heard and understood at that moment the ear consciousness is not operative Furthermore that thinking consciousness also becomes inoperative when other distracting and discriminating ideas are heard 
If this thinking consciousness that arises in tandem with correct reection has long since disappeared then the permeation of hearing with its permeating energy is already nonexistent How then could such a no longer existent consciousness be the seed for the arising of a later consciousness 
Furthermore worldly thoughts associated with correct reection never arise and pass away together with thoughts of worldtranscendent purication which are associated with true insight Therefore these worldly thoughts are not permeated by those puried thoughts 
Having no permeating energy they cannot become the seed for worldtranscendence 
Therefore apart from the seminal maturing consciousness the worldtranscendent puried mind is also impossible because the permeating energies of hearing and reecting are unable to include the seeds of permeating energy for transcending the world 
the cause for impure states of mind bring about the countering of such delement and be cause for the worldtranscendent mind 
The worldtranscendent mind has never been experienced by impure beings and so it does not permeate their minds 
If it does not permeate then please explain from what cause does this worldtranscendent mind arise 
The worldtranscendent mind arises because its seed is the permeation of hearing that ows from the purest reality realm 
If it is identical with the container consciousness then how can it issue in the seed to counter this consciousness 
If it is not identical then where does this wisdom seed of hearing nd its support 
Until the attainment of the highest awakening of Buddhas this wisdom permeation of hearing arises in synergy with whatever supporting ground it abides in Therein it arises together with the maturing consciousness just as water with milk 
But this permeation of hearing is not itself that foundational consciousness for it is the seed that counters that consciousness 
states of permeation while higher states depend on these middle states because of hearing reection and meditation cultivated repeatedly 
higher is then the seed of the Dharma body  Because it arises in countering the container consciousness it is not comprised within that container consciousness Since it is an outow from the worldtranscendent most pure reality realm even though a worldly state it brings about the worldtranscendent mind 
Because even when the worldtranscendent puried mind has not yet arisen from this seed all such superior states of mind counter delusory passions and all evil destinies Furthermore they counter the decay consequent upon all evil actions enabling one to maintain life continuity thus favoring the encounter with all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas 
Although it is a worldly state this permeation of hearing is comprised within the Dharma body as that which is to be attained by novice bodhisattvas and in the liberation body as that which is to be attained by wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones  
This permeation of hearing is not the container consciousness for it is comprised within the Dharma body or the liberation body 
Thus as increases from small to middle to high to the same degree the maturing consciousness decreases The support is then converted 
When that support is entirely converted then the container consciousness with all its seeds is entirely eliminated together with all those seeds 
in tandem with is not the foundational consciousness just as water is mixed with milk then how can it be that the foundational consciousness is eliminated and that which is not the foundational consciousness is not eliminated 
It is just like the hasa that when drinking extracts milk from water 
In a similar fashion when worldly states are freed from desire permeations from nonconcentrated realms are eliminated and permeations from states of concentration increase This is how a worldly conversion of support becomes a worldtranscendent conversion of support 
it is not the maturing consciousness that leaves the body for it has been taught that consciousness does not leave the body This is because the concentration that destroys thought is a countering not of this consciousness  
concentration there is no need for consciousness again to be engendered for this maturing consciousness continues without interruption and apart from the time of rebirth need not be reengendered  
But this assertion cannot be demonstrated for the following reasons 
These further mistakes are that in this opinion it would be impossible for one to fall from the abode of the unconscious gods or to emerge from the concentration that destroys thought and that the last thought of a saint would become impossible 
If is apart from this sequence of causes then this opinion is not valid 
Therefore our interpretation of this mind is demonstrated and one must arm and understand it as we have explained When bodhisattvas abide in good mind They are freed from the ve sense consciousnesses And without remainder their minds convert their supports By what other means could they do so 
Countering cannot be the conversion of support Because in abandonment it is absent One would then err in failing to distinguish Cause from result in regard to abandonment 
The nonbeing of seeds or Of their natures Cannot be the conversion of support Since because they do not exist These two do not exist either and The meaning of conversion is impossible Section  
Dierentiations In sum there are three or four 
There are the three dierent kinds of permeation 
The projection of rebirth means that permeation arises anew for if it did not it would be impossible for consciousness to arise conditionally upon karmic formations or for being to arise conditioned upon appropriation 
Its maturation means that in virtue of those karmic formations those beings mature in the six destinies for without this it would be impossible for any being who had experienced rebirth to be reborn at a later time 
Its referent signies that within the mind there is an image that engenders selfclinging for without this clinging to an image of self would be impossible 
Its character means that this consciousness has a common character and a specic character a seedcharacter as engendering the nonsensible and a seedcharacter as engendering the sensible is common to all 
Its specic character is as the seed within each individual 
Also its common character is as the seed for the engendering of the nonsensible and its specic character is as the seed for the engendering of the sensible 
When its counteragent arises that which is countered and eliminated is its specic character while true insight is puried supported upon a consciousness of the common seeds and others discriminations It is just as a practitioner of meditation may take dierent attitudes toward the same object and as many ways of examining things as are established in accord with their mental  
We present verses That which is dicult to eliminate and know Is termed the common entanglements The thoughts of practitioners of meditation dier For the vastness of images forms the external world 
Even though is not eliminated For puried persons therein insight is puried The perfection of the puried Buddha lands Is due to the purity of Buddha insight Here is another verse 
This foundational consciousness as specic is the seed for engendering a sensation of intelligent beings for otherwise there would be no cause for the engendering of the sentient world 
The common container consciousness as common is the seed for engendering the nonsensible  for otherwise there would be no cause for the arising of the physical receptacle world 
Consciousness as sluggish refers to the seeds of the major and minor delusory passions 
Consciousness as lucid refers to the seeds of all good states with outows 
If these two were absent one could not establish any dierence between minds that have superior capabilities and those that do not have superior capabilities both of which are the results of previous actions 
Also there are two kinds of foundational consciousness nished and not nished 
Its character as nished is this consciousness as seed for the good and evil destinies that have already matured as results 
Its character as not yet nished is its nature as the seed of language permeation for from unlimited time it is the seed that engenders fabrication 
Without this consciousness the experience of the nal causal maturation of good or evil actions and omissions and the arising of new language permeations would both be impossible 
Furthermore it has a pattern of resemblance for consciousness is like a magic trick a mirage a dream or an optical illusion This primary consciousness resembles these things 
If this were not so then this consciousness as the seed for unreal imagining could not be established as the cause of error 
Furthermore it is described as total and not total 
When one attains worldly liberation from desire then that bondage is loosened For adepts wordhearers and all the bodhisattvas it is in part destroyed and eliminated while for saints solitary enlightened ones and Tathgatas it is totally destroyed and eliminated 
Without this  this gradual destruction of passion would be impossible 
There is no contradiction between the morally neutral nature of the container consciousness and the simultaneity of good and evil states It is rather the good and evil that are in mutual opposition 
If maturation itself were good or evil then there would be no way to attain liberation from passion 
And since there would be no way to engender either goodness or passion there could be no liberation and no bondage for these two qualities of being not occluded and not dened would not exist 
In sum they are three the otherdependent pattern the imagined pattern and the reality pattern 
constructed dierentiations that have the foundational consciousness as their seed and that are included within unreal imagining 
These dierentiations are the conscious construction of the body the conscious construction of the embodied person the conscious construction of the experiencing person the conscious construction of the content experienced the conscious construction of valid experiencing the conscious construction of time the conscious construction of number the conscious construction of place the conscious construction of language the conscious construction of a dierence between oneself and others and the conscious construction of being born and dying in good and evil destinies 
The conscious construction of the body the embodied and the experiencer the experienced content valid experiencing time number place and language are all engendered from the seminal permeation of language 
 The conscious construction of the dierence between oneself and others is engendered from the seminal permeation of belief in self 
The conscious construction of being born and dying in good and evil destinies is engendered from the seminal permeation of the factors of existence 
It is because such conscious constructions are the salient features of otherdependence found in the delements of all worlds and destinies that unreal imagining becomes manifested 
These conscious constructs are comprised in unreal imagining for they exist only as conscious constructs 
The otherdependent pattern is the support whereby these nonexistent unreal objects appear 
The conscious constructs that are the content of experience correspond to the six external sense spheres of perceptible objects 
The conscious construction of valid experience corresponds to the six sense consciousnesses 
The remaining conscious constructs are dierentiations of these basic constructs 
because there are no external objects They are like a dream In a dream everything is only a conscious construct without any relationship to any external object All the objects that appear as real therein such as the various material forms voices odors tastes touches villas gardens lands mountains and so on have no real objective being whatsoever 
This example shows how in all cases there is only conscious construction 
The term and so on above indicates other examples such as magic tricks mirages optical illusions and so forth 
You say that in all cases those things that are seen by a person who is awake are only conscious constructions like objects in a dream 
But when a person awakens from a dream he recognizes that the dreamed objects are only constructs of consciousness Why then does one not similarly awaken from  Answer 
It is similar for a person who has attained a wisdom awakening to suchness does not lack such an understanding 
Just as a person yet dreaming does not wake up as long as he remains dreaming but a person already awakened does have this awareness 
So one who has not yet attained an awakened wisdom to suchness lacks this awakening but one who has already attained a wisdom awakening to suchness certainly has this awareness 
to conscious constructiononly then how can he infer this understanding 
He can do so by reecting upon the scriptures and by true reasoning 
In scriptures such as the Scripture on the Ten Stages the Worldhonored Buddha taught Buddha sons the three worlds are mindonly And in the Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning the great Bodhisattva Maitreya asked the Worldhonored Buddha Worldhonored One are these images of things which are the objects of the concentrated mind dierent from mind or identical with mind The Worldhonored Buddha answered Maitreya they are not dierent from mind because I have taught that they are only conscious constructs 
It is just as one sees on a mirror surface an image that appears to be dierent from that surface while in fact he sees the surface 
In like fashion that which appears in the concentrated mind seems to be objectively real ie to dier from the concentrated mind but in fact it is only a construct of that mind  By reasoning upon this scripture we can clarify the meaning of conscious constructiononly 
How so 
When the mind of a practitioner of meditation is already in the meditations of totality he enters into a totality of colorimage as when he sees blue or yellow but this mind does not itself see these material forms of blue or yellow as external objects 
From this reasoning a bodhisattva can infer the meaning of conscious construction in regard to all consciousnesses 
ness of memory because the object seen is immediately present 
In the mental consciousness of remembering what has been heard or reected upon consciousness has as its object things past which arise as past 
Therefore does demonstrate the meaning of conscious constructiononly 
From this inference a bodhisattva even if he has not yet attained a wisdom awakening to suchness can infer the meaning of conscious constructiononly 
structs explained above to be like magic tricks or dreams those of the visual consciousness and so on are only conscious constructs 
But how can this interpretation of conscious construction apply to material forms grasped by the eye consciousness 
As stated above it can be understood both from scripture and from reasoning that these also are conscious constructs only 
Objection If material forms are conscious constructs then how do they appear as material 
How do they perdure in solid homogeneity 
They do so because they are supported by the dele ments such as inverted thinking etc 
If this were not so the inversion of taking as an object what is not an object would not occur 
And if these two obstacles did not occur then states of purication would not occur 
Therefore all conscious constructs are engendered in such fashion that they can be believed to be real 
We present a verse The cause of confusion and confusion itself are Constructs of material form and immaterial form If the rst conscious construct did not exist The second conscious construct would not arise 
person the experiencer the content of experience and valid experiencing come about in synergy and unison in all places of rebirth 
Because they reach their term precisely in the experience of rebirth 
Why do the conscious constructs of time and the other dierentiations treated above come about 
Because the environmental world is unlimited  Because the mutual communication of aairs is unlimited  Because the dierentiations in appropriations and experiences are unlimited dierentiations between self and others arise Because the maturations of actions whether experienced as agreeable or disagreeable are unlimited and because the dierences in dying and being born thus realized are unlimited  
structs as conscious constructs only 
 since all constructs have been shown to be only conscious constructs then the only criterion is conscious construction for external objects have no existence  there are only two components in conscious construction ie image and insight and  because the images variously produced are included in conscious construction 
What does this mean 
Because all consciousnesses have no objects we validate conscious constructiononly as endowed with image and insight for all sense consciousnesses have material form as their image and the sense consciousnesses as their insight while the thinking consciousness has all the conscious constructs of sense perception as its image and thinking consciousness as its insight 
How can this be 
Because the thinking consciousness is able to imagine and appear discriminately in the guise of all these conscious constructs 
We present a verse When practitioners of meditation who understand The single criterion Its two components and their varieties Reach an understanding of Conscious constructiononly They eradicate the standpoint of consciousness 
consciousness takes dierent supports it is referred to under dierent names just as acts of volition are referred to as acts of body speech and so on inasmuch as they depend on the body the voice etc In all its various congurations engendered by its supports it appears as dual 
In all realms it appears as contact but in form realms this thinking consciousness arises only in dependence on the support of the body It is analogous to the material senses which are also supported by the body 
We present a verse Those who have journeyed far and have journeyed alone Bodiless and abiding in the cave of emptiness Who have suppressed that which is dicult to suppress They are liberated from the bondage of enmity 
As a scripture says The thinking consciousness apprehends each of the objects of the ve senses for this thinking consciousness in its discrimination is their cause 
A further passage also says When we describe discrimination Among the twelve spheres  The group of the six sense consciousnesses Is termed the thinking sphere 
the conscious constructor of objects one must understand that herein all conscious constructs are termed the conscious construction of its image component while the thinking consciousness and its supporting sense consciousnesses must be termed its conscious construction of the insight component 
Because conscious constructions of images are the supports that engender the activity of insight since being the cause for the occurrence of insight they appear as external objects 
It is as the Worldhonored Buddha has taught When a bodhisattva attains the four understandings he is able to comprehend and understand that all conscious constructs are without external object What are these four 
Because all objects conform to these three wisdoms and because of the abovecited reasons for conscious constructiononly we conclude that only conscious construction exists and that external objects do not 
There are six verses that reiterate the above interpretation 
Be cause these verses appear later in the chapter on wisdom training they will be treated extensively there They begin with the phrase Hungry ghosts animals humans  
Why is it said to be otherdependent 
Because arising from its own seminal permeation it is interwoven with causes and cannot be independent it is dependent on others 
Because it does not arise spontaneously and cannot even for an instant be independent it is termed otherdependent 
If the imagined pattern is the otherdependent appearance of external objects as real when they really do not exist then how does it come to be imagined 
Why is it termed imagined 
Because the discriminations of thinking consciousness in unlimited ways cause error it comes to be imagined 
Because it has no specic character of its own but is only the seeing of imagined distinctions it is termed imagined 
If the reality pattern is characterized as the eternal absence of the imagined pattern how does it come to be reality 
Why is it termed reality 
Because suchness is never not suchness it is reality 
Because it perfectly puries all realms and is the highest of all good states in the fullness of ultimate meaning it is termed reality 
Here what state is referred to as imagining 
What is referred to as the imagined pattern 
Imagining is thinking consciousness endowed with three kinds of imagining  
This consciousness arises because its seeds are its own language permeations and the language permeations of all the sense consciousnesses Because of its unlimited imagining in all places it is termed the imagining  
The imagined pattern refers to the basic activity of taking the otherdependent pattern as the content of imagining 
What object does it encounter 
How does it see them and how does it dependently arise 
How does it express itself in language and how does it increase 
It names all its objects in the otherdependent pattern it grasps images it engenders seeing in judgmental categories its intelligence dependently arises as presented in language its four kinds of language about what is seen and so on arm that which is actually without being to be existent and fantasize that which does exist to be nonexistent 
tical with each other 
They are neither dierent nor identical One must explain them as  
In one specic sense the otherdependent pattern is dependent on others 
In another sense it becomes imagined and in yet another specic sense it becomes reality 
In what sense is it termed otherdependent 
In that it is bound to the other in its issuance from seminal permeation 
In what sense does it become imagined 
In what sense does it become reality 
In that this otherdependent pattern when it becomes reality does not really exist as it was imagined 
Furthermore in what sense does this one consciousness take on all the various congurations of consciousness 
In that the conscious constructs that arise by virtue of both the fundamental consciousness and the other consciousnesses have these various congurations and in that arise because of those congurations 
In sum there are two The rst is that which occurs in tandem with seminal permeation while the second is that which is unformed in regard to purication or delement Thus we speak of otherdependence in virtue of these two mutual relationships 
The imagined pattern is also of two varieties The rst is the imagining of essences while the second is the imagining of specic qualities 
The reality pattern is also of two varieties The rst is essential perfection while the second is puried perfection 
is the imagining of essences and the second is the imagining of specic qualities while the third is that of intelligent persons and the fourth that of unintelligent persons 
The intelligent are those persons who engender imagination from their ability to understand and dierentiate names and words 
The unintelligent are those who engender imagination with no such ability 
Moreover in yet another schema there are ve varieties of imagination The rst is to imagine an essence in objects because of their names as when one sees names as themselves implying objects 
The second is to imagine an essence in names because of their objects as when one takes objects to be intrinsic to names 
The third is to imagine an essence in names because of those names as when one imagines a name for a yet unknown object 
The fourth is to imagine an essence in objects because of those objects as when one imagines an object for a yet unknown name 
The fth is to imagine an essence in both names and objects because of both as when one identies names with objects and objects with names 
The second is imagining images that is the conscious constructs of perceptible forms 
The third is imagining because of the appearing  that is all the conscious constructs of the sense consciousnesses together with their supporting  
The fourth is imagining changes in those images that is the changes of old age and so forth the changes of sensations of pain and pleasure of lust and delusion of oppressive times or the changes of being reborn in the hells or in the world of desire 
The fth is imagining changes because of the appearing of those images that is the arising of the changes described above 
The sixth is imagining that is elicited by others that is the imagining that comes from hearing either false or true doctrine 
The seventh is incorrect imagining that is the imagining of false doctrine of those outside the true doctrine 
The eighth is correct imagining that is the imagining that comes from hearing the true doctrine of those within the true doctrine 
The ninth is imagining that clings to its judgments that is the imaginings that arise in tandem with the sixtytwo views that are based on belief in selfhood in all its varieties of incorrect reection 
the Worldhonored One has taught in all the Perfection of Wisdom teachings that nonimaginative wisdom is able to counter these ten distractions 
Thus one should recognize that the full signicance of the Perfection of Wisdom scriptures lies in how the bodhisattva is to practice these perfections of wisdom in accord with the explanation of those scriptures 
They teach riputra a bodhisattva is indeed a bodhisattva in order to counter the image of nonbeing They teach One does not see an existent bodhisattva  They teach One does not see the name bodhisattva the perfection of wisdom practice or the absence of practice perceptible form sensation conceptualization volitional dispositions or consciousness for the essence of form is empty  They teach They are not empty because of that emptiness in order to counter the negation of that which is 
They teach That emptiness within perceptible forms is not identical with those forms  
They teach No form is dierentiated from emptiness in order to counter clinging to dierentiation for form is emptiness and emptiness is form They teach This is because riputra these are only names in order to counter the distraction about totality 
They teach That which is referred to as the essence of form neither arises nor passes away and is neither deled nor puried in order to counter distractions about specic qualities 
They teach Of such names none are seen by the bodhisattva who consequently engenders no attachment for if he should take note of the aggregates he would also elicit this reection 
From these passages from the Perfection of Wisdom scriptures one should accordingly reect upon the meaning of the ten distractions 
 all three patterns then how can there be three patterns 
Because it is contradictory that any substance to things be intrinsic to its name since prior to the acquisition of names no understanding arises in regard to objects and many names would indicate many objects but this is contradictory 
It is also contradictory that since names are undetermined objects should also be disunied substances 
We present verses on this There is no understanding prior to naming Names are many and indeterminate It is contradictory for objects to be Identical with substances to be many or to be disunied 
The nonbeing of beings appears as being The undeled yet becomes puried Thus it is like a magic trick Like the empty sky 
it appears how does one know that it is not entirely nonexistent 
If there were no otherdependent pattern then the reality pattern would also be nonexistent and one would then come to arm universal nothingness 
And then if the otherdependent pattern and the reality pattern both did not exist one would fall into error about the being and nonbeing of delement and purication 
But since these states can be known not to be nothing it is not true that all is nothing 
We present a verse If there is no otherdependent pattern Then the reality pattern also does not exist Then there could never be the two states Of delement and purication 
It should be understood through the teaching that such states do not exist 
How should one understand the otherdependent pattern 
It should be understood through the teaching on such similes as a magic trick a mirage a dream trace a shadow a reection a valley echo the moon in water a transformation 
How should one understand the reality pattern 
It should be understood through the teaching on the four kinds of pure states 
These are  original essential purity that is suchness emptiness the reality limit the imageless reality the reality realm  undeled purity that is the above state separated from all adventitious obstacles  the purity of the path whereby one reaches that  that is all the factors favorable to awakening all the perfections and so on and  the purity of the object that engenders that path that is the truly enunciated doctrine of the Great Vehicle 
Because this teaching is the cause for purication it is not imagined 
Because it is an outow from the pure reality realm it is not otherdependent 
These four pure states encompass all pure states without exception 
We present a verse Such similes as magic refer to the otherdependent The teaching of nonbeing refers to the imagined The teaching of the four purities treats reality 
These purities are the origin the undeled The path and the object All pure states are encompassed in these four 
 explained in the scriptures through similes such as the magic trick and so on In order to eliminate the delusions and doubts of others about the otherdependent pattern 
How can these others be shown that their doubts about the otherdependent pattern are unjustied 
In order to resolve the doubts of those who say If there really are no things then how can one validate the objective world it is taught that it is like a magic trick 
In order to resolve the doubts of those who say If there really are no objects then how can the mind and its activities arise it is taught that it is like a mirage 
In order to resolve the doubts of those who say If there really are no external things then how can one experience pleasure or pain it is taught that it is like a dream trace 
In order to resolve the doubts of those who say If there really are no beings then how do the various understandings arise it is taught that it is like a reection 
In order to resolve the doubts of those who say If there really are no beings then how can language arise it is taught that it is like a valley echo 
In order to resolve the doubts of those who say If there really are no beings then how can one actually encounter real beings as objects of the concentrated mind it is taught that it is like the moon in water 
In order to resolve the doubts of those who say If there really are no beings then how could bodhisattvas resolve unerringly to experience birth in the six destinies to benet others it is taught that it is like a transformation 
Scripture of Brahms Questions that a Tathgata sees neither the cycle of birth and death nor cessation 
His underlying intention was to teach the undierentiation whereby the cycle of birth and death is cessation because they are grounded within the otherdependent pattern as the imagined and reality patterns 
This is because the otherdependent pattern in its imagined aspect becomes the cycle of birth and death and in its reality aspect becomes cessation 
What was his intention in teaching these three aspects 
While the deled aspect is the imagined pattern within the otherdependent pattern and the pure aspect is the reality pattern within the otherdependent pattern the deled and pure aspect is the otherdependent pattern itself 
This was his intention in teaching these three aspects 
What analogies can be oered for his intention 
It is like a lump of gold with three aspects elemental earth gold and a lump of soil 
In the elemental earth a lump of soil is visible although it does not exist  while the gold which does really exist is not visible 
But when the lump of soil is heated in the furnace then the previously invisible gold appears 
When the lump of soil appeared as the elemental earth this was an illusory appearance 
But when the gold appears this is the appearance of reality 
Thus the elemental earth has two aspects 
In a similar way when the fundamental consciousness has not yet been heated in the furnace of nonimaginative wisdom this consciousness appears as the unreal imagined pattern and the reality pattern does not appear 
But when it is heated in the furnace of nonimaginative wisdom this consciousness appears as the perfected reality pattern and the unreal imagined pattern does not appear 
Therefore the consciousness of unreal imagination that is the otherdependent pattern has two aspects It is like the primal matter that contains gold covered over by dirt 
taught that all things are eternal in other passages that all things are transient and in yet other passages that they are neither eternal nor transient 
This was his intention in teaching the eternal transient and neither eternal nor transient natures of all things This same interpretation holds for suering pleasure and the absence of either for good evil and the absence of either for emptiness nonemptiness and the absence of either for self nonself and the absence of either for quiescence nonquiescence and the absence of either for essence nonessence and the absence of either for arising nonarising and the absence of either for passing away no passing away and the absence of either for original quiescence no original quiescence and the absence of either for original cessation no original cessation and the absence of either for the cycle of birth and death cessation and the absence of either 
One should interpret the underlying intent of all the distinctions taught by all Buddha Tathgatas by following the structure of the three patterns as above 
We present verses  As things have no reality And as they appear in various ways He explained their nonduality As neither reality nor unreality 
From a single perspective he taught Either being or nonbeing From a double perspective he taught Neither being nor nonbeing 
But beings actually do exist in their appearances Thus he taught their absence of nonbeing 
Because substances do not of themselves exist Because substances do not of themselves perdure Because they do not exist as apprehended The three patterns validate the three absences of essence 
Because of nonessences One establishes their momentary basis Their original quiescence as neither arising nor passing away And their original cessation 
The four intentions are  the intention to make an identication as for example when it is taught that At that time I was called Vipayin who had attained Buddhahood  the intention to declare a future event as for example when it is taught that If a person recites and bears in mind the name of Bahuratna Buddha he is assured of attaining supreme awakening without ever again falling back or when it is taught that Only those who have elicited the vow to be born in the Buddha Land of Bliss will be born there  the intention of indirect reference as for example when it is taught that One can attain full comprehension of the Great Vehicle by serving Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River and  the intention to accord with the dispositions of sentient beings as for example when the Tathgata rst eusively praised the charity of a certain person and then afterward severely censured it  
As with charity the same applies to discipline and the other perfections 
These are termed the four intentions 
The four aims are  the aim of causing one to enter as when in the great or lesser vehicles the Worldhonored Buddha taught the conventional truths that identify the general and specic characteristics of persons and things  the aim of disclosing patterns as when he taught that the three patterns necessarily exist in the teaching on the specic nature of things  the aim of countering as when the practices that counter the eightyfour thousand passionate actions of sentient beings are claried and  the aim of interpreting as when a meaning dierent from the literal sense is expressed in order to elucidate a dierent meaning 
The elucidation of the character of dependent coarising is as the verse declares All things arise from the permeations of language and these from those  that is the maturing consciousness and the actively evolving consciousnesses are causes one of the other 
The elucidation of the true character of dependently coarisen states of being means that the nature of all things being characterized as active evolutions of consciousness is conscious construction endowed with image and insight 
Furthermore all states of being are characterized as support imagined and reality In these words the nature of all states of being is elucidated within the context of the three patterns 
We present a verse Issuing from that which has both image and insight One knows that all states of being have the three patterns 
How can one elucidate the characters of these states 
Within the otherdependent pattern the imagined pattern lacks any reality whereby it might exist but the true reality pattern really does exist therein 
It is in virtue of this nonbeing and this being that at the same time spontaneously perfected suchness is realized or not seen already or not yet seen 
For in the otherdependent pattern the imagined pattern does not exist but the true reality pattern does exist If one sees one one does not see the other 
We present a verse In the otherdependent the imagined does not exist But true reality does exist 
The elucidation of what has been taught consists of explaining and analyzing texts that have previously been taught by the Buddha in the light of later commentaries whether concerning the assemblage of good qualities or the various aims of practice  
 Worldhonored Buddhas good qualities  consists of the purest wisdom  his nondual action  his unmarked state of being the highest refuge  his arrival at the Buddha abode  his realization of equality with all Buddhas  his attainment of unhindered activity  his unerring and unopposable doctrine  his unchanging sphere  his inconceivable establishment of doctrine  his equality in regard to the three times  his manifestation of bodies in all world realms  his unhindered wisdom in all things  his wisdom joined with all his practices  his wisdom without doubt in regard to all things experienced by all bodhisattvas  the perfection of his nondual Buddha abode  his attainment of the undierentiated liberation wisdom of a Tathgata  the nality of his attainment of equality in all Buddha lands  the ultimacy of his reality realm and  his extension to the limit of the realm of empty space 
Just as the initial phrase purest wisdom is interpreted later by the commentarial explanations so one must in turn distinguish and interpret each of the following phrases 
If one would correctly explain the meaning of the doctrine he must expand upon the purest wisdom by explaining that the wisdom of the Buddhas and Tathgatas is pure and without misunderstanding in regard to all things In this basic meaning are comprised all twentyone good qualities  the quality of arising without any obstacle to knowledge whatsoever  the quality of causing entrance into the highest purity of true suchness without duality in regard to being and nonbeing  the quality of the Buddha abode wherein the Tathgatas activity is eortless and uninterrupted and action in the Dharma body  the quality of countering all obstacles to practice  the quality of suppressing all heretical doctrines  the quality of arising in the world without being deled by worldly states  the quality of true doctrine validly established four skillful answers  the quality of manifesting enjoyment bodies in all world realms  the quality of resolving the doubts of others  the quality of introducing others to various practices the quality of manifestation in accord with the aspirations of sentient beings  the quality of taming sentient beings by the true doctrine through convening unlimited assemblies  the quality of the fullness of perfection of the equal Dharma body  the quality of manifesting pure Buddha lands in accord with the aspirations of sentient beings  the quality of the inseparability and undierentiation of the three Buddha bodies  the quality of engendering benet and gladness for all sentient beings to the limit of the cycle of birth and death and  the quality of inexhaustibility 
as If a bodhisattva has thirtytwo qualities he is called a bodhisattva They embrace the intention to bestow benet and gladness upon sentient beings 
 their intention to lead sentient beings to enter the wisdom of omniscience  their wisdom to accord with their present situations  their abandonment of pride  the rmness of their good intentions  their intention of being benevolent without simulation of not currying favor of being impartial to friend and foe and of always being good teachers until they enter nal cessation  their quality of speaking in good measure and gently smiling before beginning to talk  their compassion for all sentient beings without dierentiation  their not faltering or growing fainthearted in carrying out their tasks  their quality of not becoming bored  their quality of never being satiated with hearing doctrine  their quality of confessing their own faults while disregarding and not censuring the faults of others deportment  their quality of practicing disinterested charity of not displaying fear in any destiny of maintaining discipline of being unerringly patient to all sentient beings of zealously engendering all good states and practices of cultivating contemplation except those of the world of formlessness and their wisdom joined to skillful means  that is yoked to the four enticements the undisciplined without distinction of being respectful in serving good teachers of being respectful in hearing doctrine of enjoying dwelling in forest places of not being fond of worldly fads of taking no joy in the lesser vehicle of appreciating the Great Vehicle and of avoiding evil friends and respecting and serving good friends of maintaining unlimited purity of mind of sporting in the ve supernatural powers and taking refuge in wisdom and  their quality of not abandoning people of either proper or improper conduct but including everybody of speaking in a denitive manner of revering truth and of prioritizing and respecting action 
The word bodhisattva is associated with these states 
Through these commentarial explanations we have interpreted the previous passages 
Here is a verse When one takes up the previous phrases They are analyzed as a sequence of good qualities When one takes up the previous passages Each is analyzed in light of its intention 
Entry into the Distinguishing Characteristics of the Knowable able how are we to understand the distinguishing characteristics of entry into the knowable 
is supported by the permeations of much hearing and is not comprised within the container consciousness Rather just as with that container consciousness so is a seed that develops  
 Such correct reection in turn arises from images that appear as doctrine and its meaning are discriminated in mental words that are accompanied by insight and that appear as if connected to apprehended  
who have permeated the continuities with much hearing of the Great Vehicle who have already rendered service to all the innumerable Buddhas who appear in the world who have already entered a true state of denitive commitment and who through wellmatured meditation have increased their good roots and thus accumulated the two stores of merit and wisdom 
In virtue of a discrimination of the images and mental words accompanied by insight that appear as doctrine and its meaning and in virtue of the arising of insight into the doctrine of the Great Vehicle they enter the state of practicing earnest commitment upon rmly believing what they have heard they enter the path of insight upon intelligently understanding  they enter the path of meditation upon countering all obstacles  and they enter the nal path upon going beyond obstructing delement to the utmost purication 
The reality of all things exists only as conscious construction as explained in virtue of an earnest commitment to what is heard of an intelligent understanding of a countering of all obstacles and of a going beyond obstructing delement to utmost purication 
by the force of good roots because they have sharpened their minds in three aspects because they have eradicated the four basic barriers and because with uninterrupted and reverent meditation upon the doctrine and its meaning in quietude and insight they have not been distracted 
Innumerable and immeasurable sentient beings in the human realmsince world realms in the ten directions are innumerable and immeasurablefrom moment to moment realize supreme awakening The second sharpening of their minds is expressed in the thought that In virtue of correct intentions the perfections of giving and so forth inexorably mature 
I too have committed myself and attained such stability and in virtue of my correct intention will without diculty progress in the cultivation of the perfections of giving and so forth and attain their fullness The third sharpening of their minds is expressed in the thought that Persons with good mental states after death in all their rebirths eortlessly attain pleasant and joyful destinies for they have attained a limited goodness 
Even with their limited goodness these persons still come to such attainments How then would I who have achieved perfect and unlimited goodness not come to attain pleasant and joyful destinies at will Here stanzas refer  
Sentient beings in the human realm Realize awakening at each and every moment In places beyond reckoning 
The commitment of good persons enables them To engender the perfections of giving and so forth Since the Victors attain these dispositions They are enabled to cultivate giving and so forth 
When good persons die they attain superior joy How then would not those whose puried goodness In its perfection eliminates gradations Be lacking in these accomplishments 
thoughts of wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones perverse notions are destroyed  because they engender a mind of faith in and clear understanding of the Great Vehicle they destroy all perverse ideas and doubts  because they abandon perverse attachments to I and mine in regard to the doctrine they have heard and reected upon they destroy attachment to doctrine and  because thoughts about images standing over against are not discriminated they are able to eradicate discrimination 
Herein a stanza states Because the wise do not discriminate Thoughts about all the images That appear and stand before  They attain supreme awakening 
concerning doctrine and its meaning 
because of the discrimination of mental words accompanied by insight that are linked to the permeation of hearing that are comprised in correct reection and that appear as doctrine and its meaning 
because of the four inquiries on the designations of names objects essences and dierences 
because of the four reality wisdoms for in these four kinds of reality wisdoms names objects essences and dierences do not exist 
When entering into the understanding of these things bodhisattvas zealously endeavor to gain insight into conscious constructiononly through the appearance of the mental words involved in such insight which appear as written words and meanings to be discriminated 
They fully comprehend that the images of those written words are merely the discriminations of mental words that objects depending on names and words are merely discriminations of mental words and that such names objects essences and dierences are valid only as conventional designations 
Then at this stage upon realizing that they are only the discriminations of mental words these practitioners of meditation see that designations are neither names nor objects neither essences nor dierences since in their real character there are no objective essences or dierences 
Thus they gain insight into conscious constructiononly through the four inquiries and the four reality wisdoms that bear upon the names and objects that appear in the discrimination of mental words 
What is it like 
Because many apparently dierent patterns of things do appear simultaneously  
It is just as in the dark a rope might appear to be a snake while in fact that snake is an illusion and does not exist in the rope 
Thus when people have clearly examined the objective rope their previously confused awareness of a snake is to be without objective foundation and falls away while only the rope is known to be present 
Yet this knowledge of the rope when subtly analyzed is also chimerical and without objective foundation because it is characterized by material form odor taste and contact none of which have any stable and objective foundation 
When the mind encounters these objects its knowledge of the rope is also negated 
When with a parallel insight one eradicates the apparent names and objects that appear in these six images then discriminative deled understanding in mental words will no longer arise just as in the knowledge of the snake 
In suppressing objectivity in these six images just as was the case with the knowledge of the rope by relying on the wisdom of suchness the understanding of conscious constructiononly itself can be rejected 
by the mental words appear as objective the bodhisattva fully understands the imagined pattern In understanding the meaning of conscious constructiononly he fully understands the otherdependent pattern But how does he understand the reality pattern 
By abandoning any idea about conscious constructiononly At that moment the bodhisattva clearly understands the imagining of mental words which long since had been yoked to the permeations of hearing doctrine and he suppresses any idea of their correspondence with the external world These no longer arise because their apparent objective status no longer has any cause and thus they do not even arise as an imagining of the mental words of conscious constructiononly 
This implies that the bodhisattva dwells only in nonimagination in regard to all objects and names and in virtue of nonimaginative wisdom he realizes and abides in the reality realm of suchness 
 Things and persons texts and meanings Statements both concise and extended Beings deled and puried and the nal stage These ten are the dierent spheres of naming 
constructiononly he has attained understanding of the characteristics of the knowable Through fully understanding these characteristics he has attained entry into the rst stage of joy well penetrated into the reality realm attained birth in the lineage of all Buddhas in the ten directions and attained impartiality in thinking about all sentient beings bodhisattvas and Buddhas This is termed the bodhisattvas path of insight scious constructiononly 
Through a transcendent wisdom of quietude and insight focused on the allpervading doctrine and through a wisdom characterized by a variety of images and conscious constructs attained subsequent to nonimaginative wisdom he eradicates all the causal seeds in his fundamental container consciousness and nurtures all the seeds that enable one to contact the Dharma body He converts his support and comes to attain the true qualities of all Tathgatas and he attains the wisdom of omniscience This is why he becomes aware of conscious constructiononly 
Seeing magical illusions in all the constructs that arise from the container consciousness and all the images of those imagined constructs that wisdom attained subsequently to nonimaginative wisdom is fundamentally exempt from error 
Just as a magician is himself undeceived by his magic tricks so the bodhisattva when enunciating the path of cause and result always remains free from error in all his descriptions 
tiononly there are four concentrations that support the good roots of the four aids to penetration 
How should a bodhisattva understand this 
Through the four inquiries during the inferior eorts at recognizing the absence of objectivity the concentration of the acquisition of clarity supports good roots for aid to the penetration of fervor 
In superior eorts at recognizing the absence of objectivity the concentration of increased clarity supports the good roots for aid to the penetration of crowning practice 
In the four reality wisdoms when the bodhisattva has gained insight into conscious constructiononly and clearly understands the absence of objectivity the concentration of partially penetrating reality supports recognition that is welldisposed toward truth not mediated through language 
Immediately following this concentration the clear suppression of the idea of conscious constructiononly becomes an uninterrupted concentration that supports the highest worldly state 
These four concentrations are methods whereby bodhisattvas gain insight into and bring to presence the truth not mediated through language 
How does he enter into the path of meditation 
He attains presence as described in the teachings in the extensive discourses of the Buddha on the ten bodhisattva stages which summarize the twelvefold scripture of the Great Vehicle taught by all Tathgatas because he masters both the general and the specic since he engenders transcendent nonimaginative wisdom that focuses on the farreaching universal import and a wisdom of quietude and insight acquired subsequently to that nonimaginative wisdom  because for immeasurable and incalculable millions of eons he relies on these many practices of meditation because by virtue of his conversions of support both previously and presently attained he intensies his meditative practices in order to bring about an attainment of the three Buddha bodies 
There are eleven dierences herein 
The bodhisattva must inquire into the fact that The interdependence of name and object is incidental He must meditate on the duality as unitary And as a conventional designation  
From this he engenders reality wisdom apart from Objectifying the three ideas of name essence and dierence If he sees that these do not exist He enters into the three absences of essence Treatise on Meditating on Conscious Construction Fen pieh kuan lun state 
In states of quiescence the bodhisattva Understands that images exist only in his mind And abandoning externalized ideas of objects He assuredly understands them to be only his own thoughts 
Abiding within himself the bodhisattva Understands that the objective realm does not exist And also that the subjective realm is empty 
Having nurtured the two stores of merit And wisdom without limit A bodhisattva in virtue of his certainty In reection on doctrine Is able to understand that the varied objects Are caused by ideas 
Knowing that the varied objects are only ideas He abides in conscious constructiononly Wherein objects appear Therefore a practitioner of meditation realizes The Dharma realm And is liberated both from duality and From a nonduality  
If one knows that there nothing remains apart from mind Then he realizes also that mind does not exist either Seeing both to be nonexistent the sage Abides in the true reality realm of nonduality 
The sage through nonimaginative wisdom Is constantly impartial in all his actions And the dense thicket of Error with its deled support is banished and eliminated Just as a medicine expels a poison 
The sage who is wellgrounded in the true doctrine Taught by the Buddha Places his mind at its root upon the reality realm and Knowing that memory is merely imagination Arrives at the shore of the ocean of good qualities 
How then should we understand the distinguishing characteristics of the cause and result of this entry 
By means of the six perfections 
How are these six perfections the cause for gaining insight into conscious constructiononly How are they the result of such insight 
Having already entered the realm of conscious constructiononly in virtue of these six perfections the bodhisattvas then attain the six perfections of a puried and committed disposition 
Therefore even if they do not intensify their eorts in regard to the six perfections in commitment to true discourse and in their reections of spiritual relish pleasure and delight they continually cultivate without respite Therefore they cultivate the six perfections to their nal fullness 
Cultivating radiant qualities to perfection Bodhisattvas attain a subtle patience in This great discourse  deep and broad Of their own vehicle 
Aware that there are only ideas and Attaining a wisdom that clings not Their purity of commitment Is described as a stage of puried disposition 
Abiding in the outow of doctrine Bodhisattvas see all Buddhas past and future Knowing that awakening is near Without diculty they will attain it easily 
six deled obstacles that they are meant to counter because they are the basis for all Buddha qualities and because they are a support toward maturing all sentient beings 
The perfections of giving and discipline are meant to counter the causes that prevent embarking  ie attachment to possessions and home 
When one has embarked upon practice the perfections of patience and zeal are meant to counter the causes of retrogression and spiritual debility ie the opposition from other transmigrating sentient beings and weariness in ones eorts at bolstering virtues over a long period of time 
After one has embarked upon practice and overcome this retrogressive debility the perfections of meditation and wisdom are meant to counter the causes of loss ie distraction and false wisdom 
Therefore the perfections are established to counter these six deled obstacles 
They are numbered as six because they are a basis for all the Buddha qualities The rst four perfections are causes of nondistraction and the perfection is the essence of nondistraction 
By relying on this state of nondistraction one can truly understand the truth of all things in the perfection of wisdomwhereupon all the true qualities of a Tathgata are generated 
Therefore they are six because they are a basis for all the Buddha qualities and because they are a support toward maturing all sentient beings 
The perfection of discipline avoids injury to sentient beings The perfection of patience enables those who suer abuse from others to avoid feelings of revenge The perfection of zeal brings forth good roots in others and eliminates bad roots Thus beneted in this fashion all sentient beings become docile and their distracted minds are led to concentration and thence to liberation for this is the signicance of meditation and wisdom 
Because bodhisattvas teach them through these six perfections sentient beings mature They are six because they support the maturation of sentient beings 
These are the reasons why there are six perfections fections 
of supreme awakening  unparalleled resourcesall three levels of resources that are attributed to the perfections are fully cultivated by the bodhisattvas  unparalleled tasksthe tasks of gladdening and beneting sentient beings for all the perfections of bodhisattvas are intended to accomplish these two tasks  unparalleled skillful means ie nonimaginative wisdomall the perfections practiced by the bodhisattvas are included within their nonimaginative wisdom  unparalleled orientationall the perfections practiced by the bodhisattvas who turn toward supreme awakening are assuredly directed toward the result of universal wisdom and  unparalleled puricationthe two obstacles of passion and to knowledge are utterly eliminated without remainder for all the perfections practiced by bodhisattvas progressively eradicate these two obstacles until they are obliterated 
Are perfections always giving 
It can be that giving is not a perfection and that there is a perfection that is not giving It is also possible for giving to be a perfection and for there to be a nonperfection that is not giving 
The same four possibilities apply to the other perfections also 
Because the earlier ones lead toward the arising of the later ones and because the former ones are puried by the later ones 
From what etymologies are they derived 
The term perfection pramit means that in surpassing and going beyond the good roots of the perfections of persons in the world wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones one is enabled to reach that far shore  
Giving dna is called d because it destroys miserly envy and eliminates bitter poverty  
It is called na because it makes one a wealthy lord prosperous and resourceful 
Discipline la is called  because it abates depraved and evil practices 
It is called la because it is conducive to good practices and concentration 
Patience knti is called k because it eradicates anger and hatred 
It is called ti because it is conducive to peace for self and others 
Zeal vrya is called v because it eradicates indolence and evil states 
It is called rya because without failure its practice leads to innumerable good states 
Meditation dhyna is called dhy because it eliminates distractions 
It is called na because it elicits a mind focused on an inner object 
Wisdom prajñ is called pra because it eradicates all false views and wisdoms 
It is called jñ because it truly knows all things in their varieties 
On the rst four see above 
The cultivation of benet for others means that in their spontaneous activity and nonabandonment of Tathgata deeds all Buddhas cultivate the perfections again and again until they reach fullness 
Now the cultivation of reection refers to the practices comprised in the reections of spiritual relish pleasure and delight includes six aspirations the vast aspiration the longterm aspiration the joyous aspiration the benevolent aspiration the great resolve aspiration and the good aspiration 
 the vast aspiration means that the bodhisattva considers the millions of eons it takes him to reach supreme awakening as a single instant and at each instant he abandons his physical life and worships the Tathgatas making oerings of all the sevenjeweled world realms more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River From his initial commitment until he enters and abides in puried awakening that bodhisattvas aspiration toward giving is insatiable 
Similarly on innumerable occasions at each instant that bodhisattva in the burning re that lls the trichiliocosm assumes the four deportments in all his actions and even though bereft of all possessions he always keeps present and practices thoughts of discipline patience zeal meditation and wisdomuntil he enters and abides in the nal puried awakening 
The bodhisattvas aspiration for the other perfections is also insatiable 
It is this insatiable mind for the perfections that is meant by the bodhisattvas vast aspiration 
The longterm aspiration means that from his initial commitment until he becomes awakened the bodhisattva does not abandon this insatiable mind 
The joyous aspiration means that in his deeds of beneting others through the practices of the six perfections the bodhisattva always elicits unparalleled joy such as cannot be realized by those sentient beings whom he benets 
The benevolent aspiration means that after beneting sentient beings through his practice of the six perfections the bodhisattva sees those sentient beings as more benevolent than he himself rather than the reverse 
The great resolve aspiration means that the bodhisattva provides all sentient beings with good roots of virtue generated through his six perfections and with an unattached intent directs to lead them to attain their longedfor reward 
The good aspiration means that the bodhisattva makes available for the common use of sentient beings all the meritorious good roots of his practice of the six perfections so that they all may be directed toward supreme awakening 
It is thus that the bodhisattva practices the reection of spiritual relish embodied in these six aspirations The bodhisattvas reection of spiritual pleasure embodied in the six aspects means that he takes pleasure in the meritorious good roots engendered in these six aspects by innumerable other bodhisattvas 
The bodhisattvas reection of spiritual delight embodied in these six aspirations means that he delights in all sentient beings cultivating the six perfections with these six aspirations and that he himself vows to do the same until such practices lead to awakening 
Those who hear about the bodhisattvas practice of reection in these six aspirations and who engender a single mind of faith will attain immeasurable and limitless accumulations of merits and all obstacles from their evil actions will be utterly obliterated 
If ordinary people upon hearing attain such immeasurable and limitless merit what can we say about the exhaustive practices of a bodhisattva 
that which restrains that which assembles good qualities and that which benets sentient beings 
that which endures harm from others that which accepts suering and that which observes things  
that which establishes pleasant residences that which engenders supernatural powers and that which benets others 
preparatory to nonimagination nonimagination and that which is attained subsequent to nonimagination are fundamentally present in these six perfections since these are the outowing results of these perfections and since are conducive to all good qualities 
Because of their nature  because they cause the arising of those states of greed anger and delusion and because they are the results that ow from those states 
migratory course bodhisattvas have mastery over positions of great wealth high birth an assembly of followers success in their eorts to produce great riches absence of sickness and pain a lessening of desire and intelligence in all arts and learning At will without losing the pleasures of their wealth they benet sentient beings since this is their proper activity 
The merits of the six perfections cultivated by those bodhisattvas remain unchanging until they enter and abide in nal puried awakening 
honored One has spoken of all these perfections under the name of any single perfection for his intent was to show that the cultivation of any perfection is aided by all the others 
The Distinguishing Characteristics of the Diverse Practices in Regard to Entering the Cause and Result cause and result of entry into the characteristics  
They are the ten bodhisattva stages 
 the stage of joy   the stage of stainlessness   the stage of bright radiance   the stage of blazing re   the stage dicult to conquer   the stage of presence  imperturbability   the stage of subtle wisdom  and  the stage of the Dharma cloud  
Why is their number xed at ten 
Because they counter the ten ignorances that occlude these stages for the ten ignorances act as obstacles to the ten manifestations of the reality realm 
What are the characteristics of these ten manifestations of the reality realm 
In the rst stage one should understand the reality realm as omnipresent 
In the second stage one should understand the reality realm as most excellent 
In the third stage one should understand the reality realm as an excellent outow 
In the fourth stage one should understand the reality realm as ungraspable 
In the fth stage one should understand the reality realm as undierentiated in its continuity 
In the sixth stage one should understand the reality realm as undeled and unpuried 
In the seventh stage one should understand the reality realm as undivided by multiplicity 
In the eighth stage one should understand the reality realm as without increase or decrease 
In the ninth stage one should understand the reality realm as supporting the mastery of concentrations lands and wisdoms 
In the tenth stage one should understand the reality realm as supporting mastery over actions and the methods of meditative formulas and concentrations 
On this point stanzas state Omnipresent and most excellent Excellent outow and ungraspable Undierentiated and neither deled nor puried Undivided by multiplicity Without increase or decrease and Supporting four kinds of mastery Support for actions as well as for formulas and concentrations 
These two stanzas from the Analysis of the Middle and the Extremes should be understood 
Note that these ignorances are undeled for adherents of the two vehicles but deled for bodhisattvas 
rst attains the ability to benet both self and others 
Why is the second stage called that of stainlessness 
Because therein one is far removed from stains that would violate the bodhisattva discipline 
Why is the third stage called that of bright radiance 
Because therein relying on unfaltering concentrations and contemplations one supports the light of the great doctrine 
Why is the fourth stage called that of blazing re 
Because therein the virtues favorable to awakening burn up all obstacles 
Why is the fth stage called dicult to conquer 
Because therein the two wisdoms of truth and convention stand in sharp contrast and are dicult to unify and bring together 
Why is the sixth stage called that of presence 
Because therein relying on a wisdom of the twelvefold dependent coarising one is able to bring to presence the perfection of wisdom 
Why is the seventh stage called farreaching 
Because therein one arrives at the nal limit through energetic practices 
Why is the eighth stage called that of imperturbability 
Because therein one cannot be moved by any image or mental activity 
Why is the ninth stage called that of subtle wisdom 
Because therein one supports the most excellent and unoccluded wisdoms of investigation 
Why is the tenth stage called that of the Dharma cloud 
Because therein an awareness of the unity of all doctrines lies silent within meditative formulas and concentrations because one removes from view the gross obstacles just as a cloud covers the sky and because one brings the Dharma body to perfection 
of having attained commitment ie one assuredly engenders commitment at each stage  in virtue of having attained practice ie one has attained the ten true practices of doctrine proper to each stage  in virtue of having attained penetration ie when one has rst penetrated to the reality realm of suchness at the rst stage he can then penetrate all stages and  in virtue of attaining accomplishment ie one arrives at the summit of practice through these ten stages 
all the bodhisattvas in each and every stage embark on their practices of quietude and insight they accomplish them through ve practices 
All the stages have these ve practices These ve practices in all stages engender ve results 
 at each instant one can destroy the bases for all downward proclivities  one transcends the confused notion of multiplicity and delights in doctrine  one sees the light of the good doctrine everywhere as unlimited and undiscriminated  as the pattern of imagining is converted one attains the constant pattern of its puried aspect and his continuity fully perfects the Dharma body and  one assembles the proper causes stretching continuously forth from one high stage to the next 
 the perfection of skillful meansone gives the merits from good roots nurtured through the six perfections to all sentient beings equally so that they may be directed toward supreme awakening  the perfection of vowsthis perfection encompasses the variety of vows whereby one excites future causes for engendering the six perfections  the perfection of powers through the practices of thoughtful investigation powers subdue everything that counters the perfections and brings forth the six perfections in an uninterrupted continuity  the perfection of knowledgethis perfection establishes the understanding of the rst six perfections and causes bodhisattvas in the great assemblies to experience delight in doctrine and to mature sentient beings 
The last four perfections are comprised within that wisdom that is attained subsequently to nonimagination 
As taught in the scriptural collections on the perfections not all the perfections are practiced simultaneously in all stages 
Practitioners arrive at their fullness in ve gradationssome after three incalculable eons some after seven and some after thirtythree 
What are these ve gradations 
In the case of those who will arrive after three eons the practitioner engaged in practicing resolve completes in one incalculable eon  
That practitioner is engaged in practicing puried aspiration  in practicing with images  and in the fourth gradation of  practicing without images  which accounts for the second incalculable eon 
Thereafter that practitioner is engaged in eortlessly practicing until in the tenth stage he completes the third incalculable eon 
At times it takes seven incalculable eons 
Before entering the stages there are three 
During the stages there are four eons one based on reality and truth one based on abandonment one based on quiescence and one based on wisdom 
At times it takes thirtythree 
Three eons in the stage of skillful means one of faith practice one of zealous practice and one of oriented practice 
Then for each of the ten stages there are three eons entry abiding and departure 
Thus the ten stages of true practice are fullled over these eons 
With good roots and vow power Firmness of intent and excellence of progress In three incalculable eons It is said true practice becomes perfected 
The Distinguishing Characteristics of Learning Discipline causes of entry and its results 
What then are the distinguishing features of learning discipline 
It is as taught in the chapter On Receiving the Bodhisattva Discipline in the Bodhisattva Stages  
Herein discipline that restrains is the support of the other two Furthermore discipline that accumulates good states is the support for engendering the Buddha qualities while discipline that benets sentient beings is the support for maturing sentient beings 
hearers means that this is a discipline whereby the bodhisattva is far removed from what is fundamentally sinful such as murder theft and illicit sensual desire 
Its excellence in rules specic indicates a discipline whereby a bodhisattva is far removed from prohibitions about sinthus where a wordhearer would sin a bodhisattva remains sinless or contrariwise a bodhisattva can sin where a wordhearer would remain innocent 
Bodhisattva discipline governs body speech and mind while a wordhearers discipline governs only body and speech Therefore mental sins can occur for a bodhisattva that do not hold for a wordhearer 
In sum the benet to sentient beings brought about by his acts of body speech and mind are faultless In such deeds all bodhisattvas must put into practice the training they have received 
This is how to understand the excellence of these disciplines both common and specic 
would in his superior wisdom and as a skillful means commit the ten acts of murder and so on he would nevertheless remain unsullied and guiltless gaining instead immeasurable merits and quickly attaining the excellent result of supreme awakening 
Furthermore the acts of body and speech brought about through transformation also pertain to the profound discipline of a bodhisattva 
Through such discipline at times he assumes the role of a king even inicting torment on sentient beings to establish them in the code of discipline 
Or he may manifest varieties of former lives thereby bringing some to suer distress and resentment against their suering while he leads others by cajoling beneting and bringing them security 
When they have rst elicited a mind of faith then he causes them to mature their good roots in the holy paths of the three vehicles This is the excellence of the bodhisattvas profundity of discipline by the bodhisattva 
The Distinguishing Characteristics of Thought Training What then is the excellence of thinking 
In sum it is sixfold 
 its object  its varieties  its countering force  its aptitude  its evocations and  its deeds 
things this wisdom uproots all the debilitating obstacles in the foundational consciousness just as one wedge dislodges another wedge 
world one can at will be born into eminent stations 
in all world realms 
natural powers to make tremble to blaze up to pervade  to bring about manifestations to transform things to go and to come to bring near that which is far to render minute that which is large and vice versa to incorporate all material forms into ones own body to take on the same form in entering the great assemblies to appear and disappear to suppress and block the supernatural powers of others through the eight masteries whether to bestow on others abilities memory and happiness or to emit light on them 
 the dicult practice of ones own personal acceptance in taking on the good vows for awakening  the dicult practice of not faltering for the many suerings of transmigration do not cause one to turn back  the dicult practice of not turning ones back despite the fact that the evil done by sentient beings confronts one on all sides  the dicult practice of being visible for one is present to resentful sentient beings in bringing benet to them  the dicult practice of being undeled for bodhisattvas born into the world are not deled by worldly conditions  the dicult practice of being committed for in practicing the unplumbable Great Vehicle one is committed to its broad and deep meaning  the dicult practice of clearly understanding for one clearly understands the nonself of both persons and things  the dicult practice of comprehending for one truly discerns the scriptures of implicit meaning of all Tathgatas  the dicult practice of not abandoning nor being deled for while not rejecting transmigration one is not deled by it and  the dicult practice of exerting eort in dicult tasks for all Buddha Tathgatas liberated from all obstacles spontaneously bring benet to all sentient beings and until the nal limit of transmigration is over desire to cultivate such eorts 
above in number eight how is one to understand the implicit meaning of the scriptures preached by all the Buddha Tathgatas 
As the scriptures teach a bodhisattva must investigate according to truth  How is it that a bodhisattva neither loses anything nor gives to anyone 
In that a bodhisattva has well practiced giving everywhere in an unlimited and incalculable fashion his practice of giving arises in continuity even though he does not at any particular moment give anything to anyone 
How is it that a bodhisattva takes pleasure in giving In that he does not take pleasure in any gift 
How is it that a bodhisattva believes in giving In that he does not place his faith in any Buddha Tathgata 
How is it that a bodhisattva initiates giving In that in his giving he does not lay plans for himself 
How is it that a bodhisattva constantly delights in giving 
How is it that a bodhisattva is capable of great giving 
How is it that a bodhisattva is pure in his giving In that he engenders avarice 
How is it that a bodhisattva is perfected in giving 
How is it that a bodhisattva masters giving In that he attains no mastery over his giving 
How is it that a bodhisattva is inexhaustible in giving In that he does not reach inexhaustibility 
One should understand the other perfections of discipline patience zeal meditation and wisdom according to the principle employed in these scriptural passages on giving 
How is it that a bodhisattva takes what is not given to him by others In that he takes sentient beings not given to him by others 
How is it that a bodhisattva acts perversely and lewdly In that he elicits thoughts about the perversity of the sensual desire  
How is it that a bodhisattva speaks falsehood In that he identies what is false as false 
How is it that a bodhisattva tells lies 
How is it that a bodhisattva utters harsh words 
In that he reaches the far shore of knowledge 
How is it that a bodhisattva utters inappropriate speech In that he divides the doctrine and interprets it according to its genre 
How is it that a bodhisattva becomes covetous 
How is it that a bodhisattva becomes mean In that he attacks all the passions in his own mind and the minds of others 
How is it that a bodhisattva engenders false views In that he truly examines falsity everywhere and at all times qualities 
What are these profundities 
In this treatise we shall analyze them extensively  
Eternity is the nature of all Buddha qualities because the Dharma body is eternal 
Abandonment is the nature of all Buddha qualities because all obstacles are completely severed 
Arising is the nature of all Buddha qualities because transformation bodies constantly arise 
Attainment is the nature of all Buddha qualities because one attains the parallel counteragent to the eightyfour thousand passionate actions of sentient beings 
Desire is the nature of all Buddha qualities because one fullls his identity by encompassing desirelled sentient beings 
hatred delusion and worldliness are the nature of all Buddha qualities 
Nondelement is the nature of all Buddha qualities because having fully realized suchness no obstacle can dele  
Undeleability is the nature of all Buddha qualities because although Buddhas appear in the world they cannot become deled by worldly things 
These are the reasons for the profundity of the Buddha attributes 
beings to purify Buddha lands and to generate all the Buddha attributes that the actions of the concentrations of a bodhisattva are dierentiated 
The Distinguishing Characteristics of Learning Wisdom What then is the excellence in wisdom training 
The excellence of wisdom training consists in the superiority of nonimaginative wisdom in  its essence  its support  its cause  its object  its modality  its establishment  its solution of diculties  its maintenance  its aids  its reward  its outow  its issue of the good attributes of preparatory nonimaginative and subsequently attained wisdoms  examples of nonimaginative and subsequently attained wisdoms  its august and spontaneous activity and  its profundity 
Nonimaginative wisdom identied as the wisdom that is liberated from these ve states is described in the verses 
For all bodhisattvas the essence Is liberation from the ve states For nonimaginative wisdom is nonimaginative In regard to reality 
For all bodhisattvas the support is Neither thinking nor the absence of thinking For nonimaginative wisdom is not a notthinking But is something that rapidly  
For all bodhisattvas the cause is The permeation of hearing discourse For nonimaginative wisdom is True and correct reection 
For all bodhisattvas the object is Ineable reality For nonimaginative wisdom The true suchness of the nonessence of both self and things 
For all bodhisattvas its modality is Focused on true suchness For nonimaginative wisdom is Imageless and undierentiated 
Since words form a continuum Its meaning is established by conjunction 
Apart from words and language Wisdom does not occur in regard to knowables since the two are not the same Everything is inexpressible 
The rm basis for all bodhisattvas is Nonimaginative wisdom For it supports practices subsequently attained In their development to nal perfection 
For all bodhisattvas the aids Are the two paths For nonimaginative wisdom is characterized By the mental states of the ve perfections 
For all bodhisattvas the reward occurs in The two assemblies of the transformation and enjoyment bodies For nonimaginative wisdom in virtue of Preparatory eort and attainment  
For all bodhisattvas the outow occurs In one life after another For nonimaginative wisdom Develops and progresses 
For all bodhisattvas the issue Is yoked to attainment and perfection For nonimaginative wisdom Is known in the ten stages 
For all bodhisattvas the term Is the attainment of the puried three bodies For nonimaginative wisdom Reaches the most excellent mastery 
This nonimaginative wisdom is Like space undeled By sundry and grievous evil acts Simply because of its commitment 
Pure like space This nonimaginative wisdom Is liberated from all obstacles Because it has reached perfection 
Undeled like space This nonimaginative wisdom Even though it appears in the world Is not deled by worldly things 
These three wisdoms are Like a mute who tries to perceive objects Like a mute who does perceive objects and Like a nonmute who does perceive objects 
These three wisdoms are Like a fool who tries to perceive objects Like a fool who does perceive objects and Like a nonfool who does perceive objects 
These three wisdoms are Like the ve senses that try to perceive objects Like the ve senses that do perceive objects and Like that which is not the ve senses ie the thinking consciousness that does perceive objects 
These three wisdoms are respectively Like one of no learning who seeks to understand  Like one who is wellread who does understand a doctrine and Like one who understands and perceives the meaning of a doctrine 
Nonimaginative wisdom is Like a person who has his eyes closed Subsequently attained wisdom is Like a person who has his eyes opened 
Nonimagination is like space Without delement obstruction dierentiation or limit Subsequently attained wisdom is Like the appearance of forms in that space 
Just as maijewels or heavenly drums Accomplish their deeds without reection Just so without discrimination The various Buddha deeds are accomplished 
This wisdom called nonimaginative Is not dierentiated from its object Either as this or not as this  Either as not wisdom or as not not wisdom 
The Buddha has taught that all things Are originally not imagined Because that which is imagined does not exist 
The preparatory nonimaginative wisdom has also three varieties inasmuch as it arises  from causes  from evocation and Nonimaginative wisdom has three varieties inasmuch as it is dierentiated as  the completion of knowing  inerrancy and Wisdom attained subsequent to nonimaginative wisdom has ve varieties inasmuch as its manifestations are dierentiated as magical creations 
Hungry ghosts animals humans All godseach have their own Dierent ideas about a single object Concluding that the object is valid 
As in regard to the past and the future And to dreams and double images Knowledge objecties things without any existent object So objects are posited even though they do not occur 
If external things became objects of understanding There would be no nonimaginative wisdom If this did not exist Then the attainment of Buddhahood would also be impossible 
Bodhisattvas who have attained mastery Because of the power of their commitment Create lands at will As do those in concentration 
Those perfected in investigation Those with wisdom and concentration All things appear as objects Within their own minds 
When nonimaginative wisdom is cultivated No object appears Know then that no external object exists And thus there is no conscious construction either 
synonymous As a scripture teaches When a bodhisattva dwells in the perfection of wisdom through the cultivation of nonabiding he is able to cultivate the other perfections to their fullness Why is it that by cultivating nonabiding he can cultivate these other perfections to their fullness 
On this point a stanza states Because of the ve superiorities in wisdom and On account of their compassion and cultivation of merit In riches both mundane and transcendent We say they are not far from perfection 
This is because bodhisattvas see that if they were to bestow riches the actions of sentient beings in their consequent stage of wealth would constitute obstacles that would result in suering and that this would hinder the good that they might engender 
It is because bodhisattvas see that if they lack riches they will be able to realize detestation of evil transmigration 
It is because bodhisattvas see that if they were to bestow riches on them then they would nurture the causes for all manner of evil states 
It is because bodhisattvas see that if they were to bestow riches on them this would be cause for them to oppress an untold number of other sentient beings 
 These are the reasons why although bodhisattvas are not lacking in such capabilities yet sentient beings are seen in the world 
On this point a stanza states Seeing the obstacle of their actions the good hindered The manifestation of detestation and increase of evil And the injury to other sentient beings Bodhisattvas are not moved toward giving  
The Distinguishing Characteristics of Quiescent Abandonment as a Result of the Trainings then should we understand the excellence of quiescent abandonment 
The destruction of delement by bodhisattvas is their nonabiding cessation 
What are its characteristics 
It is characterized by a twofold conversion of support whereby they denitively abandon delement but not transmigration 
Herein transmigration refers to the deled aspect of the otherdependent pattern 
Cessation refers to the puried aspect of the otherdependent pattern 
The basic support refers to both these aspects of the puried and deled otherdependent pattern 
The conversion of support means that when its counteragent arises the otherdependent pattern forever alters its basic nature as the deled aspect and forever realizes its puried aspect 
This conversion occurs from the rst to the sixteenth stages  conversion of practiceno images appear in the supporting of those not yet freed from the obstacle  but reality does appear 
What fault would there be for a bodhisattva to remain in an inferior conversion 
He would fail to perceive what is of benet to sentient beings be far distant from all bodhisattva states and attain a liberation identical to that of the adherents of the lesser vehicles 
What merit is there in a bodhisattva maintaining an extensive conversion 
Because in transmigratory conditions he converts his own support he attains mastery in all destinies and he manifests his bodies both in valued positions in the world and in the three vehicles His skillful capability in various ways of teaching and converting establishes others in the true teaching This is the merit of an extensive conversion 
For common worldlings reality covered over Appears to them as illusion For bodhisattvas having abandoned everything Reality appears 
The nonappearance of illusion and The appearance of reality are The bodhisattvas conversion of support Liberation at will 
If wisdom engenders the equality Between transmigration and cessation Then transmigration is precisely cessation And they are not two separate things 
Therefore in regard to transmigration Do not abandon or refuse to abandon Likewise in regard to cessation Have no attainment and no lack of attainment 
The Distinguishing Characteristics of the Excellence of Wisdom abandonment we now treat the excellence of wisdom 
The excellence of wisdom is to be understood as the three bodies of the Buddha which are the essence body the enjoyment body and the transformation body 
Among these the essence body is the Dharma body of Tathgatas because it is the support for mastering all things 
The enjoyment body is the body that is manifested in the various Buddha lands and assemblies of great persons It is supported upon the Dharma body in that its cause is the complete purication of the Buddha lands and the experience of delight in the doctrine of the Great Vehicle 
The transformation body is also supported upon the Dharma body because it manifests itself in many perceptible manners such as residing in and descending from the Tuita  being born  undertaking learning indulging in desire for the material world leaving home going to the heretics place practicing asceticism attaining perfect awakening turning the wheel of the Dharma and entering into nal cessation 
In brief it is characterized in ve manners 
On this point a summary stanza states Characteristic realization and attainment mastery support constitution distinction good qualities profundity recollection and activity These clarify the Buddha bodies 
port because when the dependent pattern in its deled aspect with all its obstacles has been eliminated one is liberated from all those obstacles and is converted into the dependent pattern in its pure aspect with mastery over all things 
It is characterized as being composed of radiant qualities because through the completion of the six perfections one obtains the excellent capabilities of the ten masteries 
Among these ten masteries the mastery over the duration of life the mastery over mind and the mastery over necessities are through the fullness of the perfection of giving 
The mastery over act and the mastery over birth are through the fullness of the perfection of discipline 
The mastery over commitment is through the fullness of the perfection of patience 
The mastery over vow is through the fullness of the perfection of zeal 
The mastery over miraculous powers which include the ve supernatural faculties is through the fullness of the perfection of meditation 
The mastery over understanding and the mastery over doctrine are through the fullness of the perfection of wisdom 
The Dharma body is characterized by nonduality because being characterized by the nonduality of existence and nonexistence all things are nonexistent and their characteristic of emptiness is not nonexistent 
It is also characterized by nonduality of the conditioned and the unconditioned because it is not engendered by acts and passions but is powerful in manifesting itself in conditioned images 
It is also characterized by the nonduality of unity and dierentiation because the support of all Buddhas is not dierent and yet innumerable individual attain perfect awakening 
On this point there are stanzas Because there is no clinging to self there is no dierentiation in the support  But since many individuals are enlightened in consequence of their former states as bodhisattvas their designated names are said not to be a unity 
Because of the division of lineages of usefulness of totality of beginninglessness they are not a unity Because of the absence of dierentiation in support which is suchness there is no multiplicity 
The Dharma body is characterized by eternity because the purity of suchness as its characteristic because it is under the impulse of former vows  and because its activity and action are unending 
The Dharma body is characterized by inconceivability because the purity of suchness is to be known by a personal realization because it cannot be compared to anything and because it is beyond the scope of intelligent knowing 
initially attained through contact by the nonimaginative and subsequently attained wisdoms which have as their object the unied doctrine of the Great Vehicle are accomplished matured and cultivated in the ve aspects of practice explained in Chapter V and have well accumulated the equipment in all the stages  by the diamondlike concentration since destroys the subtle obstacles that are dicult to destroy Having been separated from all obstacles immediately after that concentration the Dharma body is thus acquired through the conversion of support 
In short there are three so supported 
The Dharma body is the support of the diverse residences of Buddha Tathgatas the following stanzas All Buddha Tathgatas because they have realized and attained their own realm acquire a vefold joy but adherents of the two vehicles lack such a joy because they have not realized it Therefore one who desires such joy should realize the realm of the Buddha 
Because they are capable of establishing immeasurable deeds and because delighting in the beauty of doctrine their desire comes to fulllment Buddhas who attain the highest irreproachable joy gain constant insight into the four immeasurable activities 
The Dharma body is the support for the diverse bodies of enjoyment because brings the good roots of bodhisattvas to maturity 
It is the support of the diverse bodies of transformation because generally brings wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones to maturity 
The Dharma body of all Buddha Tathgatas is to be understood as consisting of these six kinds of Buddha factors 
Just as with the Dharma body so the enjoyment body is also not dierentiated because its support and activity are not dierentiated 
The transformation body is to be understood in a parallel manner 
Dharma body is endowed with the perfectly puried four immeasurable activities the eight liberations the eight governing spheres the ten entire spheres noncontentious concentration vow wisdom the four unimpeded understandings the six supernatural knowledges the thirtytwo major marks of a great person the eighty minor marks the four purications of all aspects the ten powers the four fearlessnesses the four things that need not be guarded against the three focuses of mindfulness the entire destruction of the propensities nonforgetfulness great compassion the eighteen exclusive qualities of a Buddha and the excellent wisdom of all excellent aspects O you who have great compassion on sentient beings you who have the aspiration to separate from bondage you who have the aspiration not to separate from sentient beings you who have the aspiration for happiness and welfarehomage to you 
spheres O you who are liberated from all obstacles the sage who overcomes the entire world you whose wisdom is universally replete you whose mind is liberatedhomage to you 
O you who destroy all the passions of all sentient beings without remainder who crush the delement of the passions who always take pity on the passionatehomage to you O you who are spontaneous unattached unimpeded continually quiescent you who answer all the questions of sentient beingshomage to you 
O you who are unimpeded in teaching with regard to the support and that which supports and the language and wisdom needed you the teacherhomage to you 
O you who having approached through their words know their conduct in regard to their coming going and deliverance you who well instruct sentient beings homage to you 
After having seen you all sentient beings revere you as a noble person O you who upon being seen by others inspire a puried mindhomage to you 
O you who have attained mastery over concentrations and wisdoms in regard to taking up maintaining and forsaking  and in regard to transformations and changes in things Worldhonored Onehomage to you

endowed not only with these virtues but also with the qualities of essence cause result activity associated qualities and function Therefore the qualities of all Buddhas are to be understood as supreme 
On this point stanzas state You have accomplished suchness you have been delivered through cultivating all the stages you have attained preeminence among others you are the liberator of all sentient beings 
You are associated with inexhaustible and unequaled qualities you are seen in the world and in the three assemblies and yet you are invisible in every way to gods and humans profound 
How should that profundity be examined 
The unborn Buddha is born abides in nonabiding does everything spontaneously and eats the fourth food 
are undierentiated and immeasurable their one activity is beyond calculation endowed with the three bodies their action both continual and interrupted is supreme 
There is nothing that can be awakened but it is not the case that there is no perfectly awakened one at all At every moment are immeasurable and are manifested through the nonexistence of existence 
After having known desire and nondesire he has entered into the reality of desire 
The Buddha has gone beyond the ve aggregates and yet he dwells in the ve aggregates He is neither identical with nor separated from the aggregates for he has entered a cessation that does not abandon the aggregates 
All the actions of Buddhas completely interpenetrate just like water in the ocean 
They have no intention of beneting others thinking I have done am doing or will do  The Worldhonored One is not seen because of the faults of sentient beings just as the moon in a broken basin like the sun he lls all worlds with the light of the Dharma 
At times like a re manifest perfect illumination and at times like a re they are extinguished for these two in fact do not exist but of all Buddhas abides forever 
The Tathgata abides in the supremely abiding self in unholy conditions in human and evil  and in unchaste conditions 
They do appear in all states of birth and yet they are beyond the sphere of the six senses 
The passions have been destroyed and suppressed just like a poison counteracted by a magical spell They have exhausted passion through passion and have attained universal wisdom 
For those who practice the great means passions become factors of awakening and transmigration is identied with cessation Therefore awakening is inconceivable 
Buddhas how many recollections do they employ 
In sum in relying on the Dharma body they cultivate the recollection of Buddhas in seven ways 
 They cultivate the recollection of Buddhas by considering All the Buddhas have unequaled mastery over all things for they have acquired the six unimpeded and unbounded supernatural knowledges over all world realms 
Here is a stanza on this Buddhas do not have entire mastery over the realm of all those sentient beings who are obstructed without potential or yoked to the twofold inevitability 
The body of the Tathgata is eternal because with suchness uninterrupted they are liberated from impurities 
The Tathgatas abide in great richness and enjoyment because all the wondrous purity of all Buddha lands is their richness and enjoyment 
The Tathgatas are never soiled nor attached because they are not soiled by any worldly thing even though they depart from and appear in the world just as dust cannot soil the sky 
The Tathgatas are of great use in the world because by manifesting supreme awakening and nal cessation they mature those sentient beings who are not completely mature and liberate those who are completely mature 
Here are stanzas  are perfected in relying on the mind of the Tathgata and are perfected in good qualities in eternity in irreproachability in spontaneity and in granting great joy in doctrine to sentient beings 
In all their actions they are unimpeded and equally benet many men Wise men should base themselves upon such recollections of all Buddhas universally 
In the manner in which it is described in the preface of the One Hundred ThousandStanza Scripture Pai chien ching of the bodhisattvapiaka the Worldhonored Buddha dwells in a great palace The Buddha dwells in a great palace which is ornamented with the seven gems and emits a great light completely lling immeasurable world realms The conguration of its immeasurable and wondrous distribution of ornaments constitutes a vast area Its boundaries cannot be crossed or measured 
Thus the pure land is completely puried in color conguration extent domain cause result lords confreres servants sustenance action benecence fearlessness abode path vehicles entrance gates and foundation 
In these above descriptions its complete purity is manifested 
The enjoyment of the perfectly puried Buddha land is completely pure completely pleasurable completely irreproachable completely masterful 
It should be understood that these ve actions are the same for all Buddha Tathgatas 
Here is a stanza on this equality of actions among all Buddhas When cause support function intention and endeavor dier then it is true that there results a dierence of action in the world but because these ve dierences do not obtain for Buddhas the actions of the Worldprotectors are identical 
good qualities and such perfections is not common to wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones then with what intention has the Buddha taught that they also should journey in a single vehicle ie the Buddha vehicle 
Here are stanzas on this point has taught a single vehicle to lead wordhearers of undetermined  other bodhisattvas  and of determined lineage into the Great Vehicle 
He taught a single vehicle because of the identity of reality of nonself and of liberation because of the dierences of lineage because of the acquisition of cessation in two aspirations and because of ultimacy 
body then how can we enumerate dierent Buddhas 
Here is a stanza on this point Because in one realm there are not two  because innumerable simultaneously complete causal practices and because a sequential realization of Buddhahood is impossible therefore one can validly arm that there are many dierent Buddhas at the same time 
Here is a stanza Because they are liberated from all obstacles and since their action is without end Buddhas both enter nal cessation and do not enter nal cessation 
are six reasons  because appears as a material body and as an activated body  because it appears dierently among the innumerable great assemblies  because being seen in accordance with the aspirations  it manifests fundamental dierences  because being seen in a variety of dierent ways it appears as fundamentally changeable sattvas wordhearers gods and so forth it is relational and  because of the appearance of the two conversions of support of the container consciousness and of the active consciousnesses It is therefore not reasonable that the enjoyment body be identied with the essence body 
are eight reasons 
 it is not possible that a bodhisattva who has long since obtained irreversible concentrations should be born in the Tuita or among men  it is not possible that one who has remembered his rebirths should not have complete understanding of writing calculation mathematics illustrating crafts scholarship and the enjoyment of and indulgence in sensual desire  it is not possible that one who has understood the dierence between good and bad presentations of doctrine should go to heretics and take them as his teachers  it is not possible that a bodhisattva who long since has understood the validity of the noble paths of the three vehicles should have engaged in useless austerities in searching for the path  it is not possible that upon leaving behind a hundred millions of Jambudvpas a bodhisattva should realize complete awakening and set in motion the wheel of doctrine at a single location  if without manifesting the skillful means of complete awakening were to perform the action of a Buddha in the other by means of transformation bodies then he might also attain complete awakening in the Tuita   if this is not so then why did the Buddha not appear equally in all the Jambudvpas at the same time 
No scripture or reasoning invalidates this  and  a multiplicity of transformation bodies does not contradict the scripture that says that two Tathgatas do not arise in world since the term world realm indicates the four continents  It is like the impossibility of two universal monarchs arising together in a single world realm 
Here is a stanza on this subject The subtle transformation bodies of Buddhas in an identical manner enter into many wombs in order to manifest the awakening of all aspects to the world 
 because of the completion of their actions since they have nished delivering and maturing the sentient beings whom they were to deliver and mature  to cause those who are already liberated and who desire cessation to abandon this aspiration for cessation in seeking to attain an eternal Buddha body  to eradicate disrespect toward the Buddha and engender an understanding of the profound reality of true suchness and the enunciated doctrine  to arouse longing  lest those who see him continually take him for granted  so that might themselves develop zeal knowing that the True Teacher cannot be found and  to cause them quickly to reach maturity by not abandoning their own zealous eorts for the task 
Here is a stanza on this point Because their actions are complete to avoid desire for cessation to eradicate disrespect toward the Buddha to arouse longing  to bring about their own zeal and quickly to attain maturity it is impossible for the Buddha permanently to abide in transformation bodies  supreme awakening through their vows and practices 
body is eternal how can it be said that the Tathgatas body is eternal 
Because both the apparitional body and the transformation body are supported upon the eternal Dharma body because the apparitional body is never abandoned and because the transformation shows itself again and again It is like the expressions He always experiences happiness or He always gives food  These two bodies should be understood in this fashion 
Here is a stanza on this point The realization and attainment of all Buddhas are identical and innite If this causes sentient beings to abandon eort then this realization and attainment would be forever without cause but it is impossible to discard the true cause 
Among the collected scriptures of the Great Vehicle Abhidharma is called the Summary of the Great Vehicle This true explanation is completed 

At one time the Worldhonored One was dwelling in an immeasurable abode adorned with seven gems that shone brilliantly and emitted a great light illuminating all the immeasurable world realms Its limitless regions were brilliantly adorned and well arranged They had no boundaries Their quantity was beyond reckoning and they surpassed anything found in the triple world 
Like clouds great bodhisattvas gathered together there An immeasurable number of gods ngas yaksas gandharvas asuras garudas kimnaras mahoragas humans nonhumans and similar beings were in attendance There the great taste of the doctrine sustained their delight and happiness and brought about all benefit for sentient beings It had destroyed the oppressive defiled inclinations of passion and it was far removed from all inimical forces 
He entered into the unmarked doctrine He dwelled in the Buddha abode realized b  The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning the equality of all Buddhas and reached the state of no obstacles The irreversible teaching of the doctrine he propounded was unhindered That which he established was inconceivable 
That unified wisdom of the Tathagatas liberation was indeed ultimate He had realized the equality of Buddha lands He reached to the reality realm He exhausted space and would never come to an end 
He was accompanied by an immeasurable multitude of great wordhearers all of whom were docile sons of the Buddha Their thinking was well liberated Their understanding was well liberated Their discipline was well purified and they had set their aim upon joy in doctrine 
They had heard much and retained and accumulated what they had heard 
They thought good thoughts spoke good words and did good deeds 
Their wisdom was swift quick incisive salvific penetrating great expansive unequaled 
They had attained the happiness of the highest state in the present world 
They dwelled in the field of pure merit Their deportment was tranquil and in no way imperfect 
The perfection of their great patience and gentleness was without decrease Already good they revered and practiced the holy teachings of the Tathagata 
Also present were an immeasurable number of great bodhisattvas assembled from various Buddha lands 
Appearing before them they mitigated the oppressive lands that torment sentient beings The principal ones were named the Bodhisattva Gambhirarthasamdhinirmocana the Bodhisattva Vidhivatpariprcchaka the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata the Bodhisattva Suvisuddhimati the Bodhisattva Visalamati the Bodhisattva Gunakara the Bodhisattva Paramarthasamudgata the Bodhisattva Aryavalokitesvara the Bodhisattva Maitreya and the Bodhisattva MafijuSri 
Chapter II The Descriptive Marks of the Truth of Ultimate Meaning At that time the Bodhisattva Vidhivatpariprcchaka questioned the Bodhisattva Gambhirarthasamdhinirmocana in the presence of the Buddha and said 
Son of the Victor it is said that all things are not dual What does all things mean 
And why are they not dual The Bodhisattva Gambhirarthasamdhinirmocana answered the Bodhisattva Vidhivatpariprechaka and said 
Good son in sum all things are of two kinds conditioned and unconditioned 
Herein conditioned things are neither conditioned nor unconditioned and unconditioned things are neither unconditioned nor conditioned The Bodhisattva Vidhivatpariprechaka again questioned the Bodhisattva Gambhirarthasamdhinirmocana and said 
Son of the Victor what does it mean to say that conditioned things are neither conditioned nor unconditioned or that unconditioned things are neither unconditioned nor conditioned Gambhirarthasamdhinirmocana addressed the Bodhisattva Vidhivatpariprcechaka and said 
Good son the term conditioned is a provisional word invented by the First Teacher 
Now if itis a provisional word invented by the First Teacher then it is a verbal expression apprehended by imagination 
And if it is a verbal expression apprehended by imagination then in the final analysis such an imagined description does not validate a real thing 
Therefore the conditioned does not exist 
Good son the term unconditioned is also invented from language  Furthermore besides the conditioned and the unconditioned any other expression that exists in language is the same 
But it a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning might be objected is it not true that there are no expressions without some reality 
What then is the reality here 
I would reply that it is that reality apart from language and realized in the perfect awakening of the saints through their holy wisdom and insight apart from all names and words 
It is because they desire to lead others to realize perfect awakening that they provisionally establish as the conditioned as verbal descriptions Good son the term unconditioned is also a word provisionally invented by the First Teacher 
Now if the First Teacher provisionally invented this word then it is a verbal expression apprehended by imagination And if it is a verbal expression apprehended by imagination then in the final analysis such an imagined description does not validate a real thing 
Therefore the unconditioned does not exist 
Good son the term conditioned is also invented from language  
Besides the unconditioned and the conditioned any other expression that exists in language is the same 
But some may object is it not true that there are no expressions without some reality 
What then is that reality here 
I would reply that it is that reality apart from language and realized in the perfect awakening of the saints through their wisdom and insight apart from all names and words 
It is because they desire to lead others to realize perfect awakening that they establish such expressions as the unconditioned as verbal descriptions Then the Bodhisattva Vidhivatpariprcechaka again questioned the Bodhisattva Gambhirarthasamdhinirmocana and said 
Son of the Victor why is it that those saints being freed from language through holy wisdom and insight realizing perfect awakening in that ineffable nature of reality and desiring to lead others to realize perfect awakening provisionally establish verbal descriptions such as conditioned and unconditioned The Bodhisattva Gambhirarthasamdhinirmocana addressed the Bodhisattva Vidhivatpariprcchaka and said 
Good son one can liken to skillful magicians or apprentices who  Chapter II setting themselves up at a crossroads make things like broken tiles grass leaves pieces of wood etc appear to be magical things herds of elephants horses chariots soldiers gems pearls catseyes conches crystal coral treasure grain storehouses etc 
Other people not dull nor slowwitted of good understanding and having acumen see and hear those magical things and understand that what they see are not really elephants horses etc but rather magical tricks that confuse the eye and cause it to engender the concept of a herd of elephants the imagined concept of a herd of horses the many imagined concepts of grain storehouses or other magical illusions 
Afterwards they do not have to reconsider In like manner some sentient beings foolish and profane have not yet attained to the transcendent understanding of the saints and are not able to recognize that in all things reality is apart from language 
After they have seen and heard about all conditioned and unconditioned  they think that what they have learned is most certainly really existing conditioned and unconditioned things 
Rather they are descriptions engendered from imagination and are magical confused understandings in which one produces concepts about the conditioned and the unconditioned concepts about whether they exist or not They do not tenaciously cling to verbal expressions that are engendered from what they have seen and heard or think that only are true and everything else false in order to express the meanings they know they follow the accepted language Afterwards they are not forced to reconsider 
Thus good son the saints being freed from language through their holy wisdom and insight in this regard realize the perfect awakening that reality is truly apart from language 
It is because they desire to lead others to realize perfect awakening that they provisionally establish names and concepts and call things conditioned or unconditioned At that time the Bodhisattva Gambhirarthasamdhinirmocana recited these verses to emphasize his meaning 
In their idiotic confusion fools delight in duality and rely upon verbal fabrications 
Whether without understanding or with perverse understanding they will revolve in the suffering of transmigration for a great length of time 
They are indeed far from the discourse of true wisdom and will certainly be reborn as cows sheep and so forth 
At that time the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One at a distance from this eastern sector equal to the sands of seventytwo Ganges there is a world realm named Visalakirti whose Tathagata is named Visalakirti Tathagata 
I used to live there before I came here In that Buddha land I once saw seventyseven thousand heretics together with their teachers gathered in one place to consider the descriptive marks of the ultimate meaning of all things 
But although  Chapter II they thought pondered investigated and thoroughly examined these marks of the ultimate meaning of all things in the end they were unable to reach any conclusion 
I then thought to myself The appearance of a Tathagata in the world is indeed a rare occurrence 
But because of his appearance it becomes possible to understand the marks of ultimate meaning which transcend the sphere of any reasoning Then the Worldhonored One addressed the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata and said 
Good son it is just as you have expressed it 
am perfectly awakened to the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning which transcend any reasoning 
Being already perfectly awakened I declare preach explain teach and illumine those marks for others 
Why do I do this 
Because I have preached that ultimate meaning is realized internally by each saint while reasoning is attained in the give and take among common worldlings 
Dharmodgata from this principle you should understand that ultimate meaning transcends the descriptions of reasoned meaning 
Furthermore Dharmodgata I have preached that ultimate meaning does not function through images but the functioning of reason does move within the realm of images 
From this principle Dharmodgata you should understand that ultimate meaning transcends the descriptions of reasoned meaning 
Furthermore Dharmodgata I preach that ultimate meaning is ineffable but the functioning of reason moves within the realm of language 
From this principle Dharmodgata you should understand that ultimate meaning transcends the descriptions of reasoned meaning 
Furthermore Dharmodgata I teach that ultimate meaning severs all expression but the functioning of reason moves within the realm of expression 
From this principle Dharmodgata you should understand that ultimate meaning transcends the descriptions of reasoned meaning 
Furthermore Dharmodgata  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning I preach that ultimate meaning severs all disputation but the functioning of reason does move within the realm of disputation about meaning 
From this principle Dharmodgata you should understand that ultimate meaning transcends the descriptions of reasoned meaning 
Furthermore Dharmodgata you should understand that it is like a man who all his life long was accustomed to tart and bitter tastes 
He would be incapable of comprehending evaluating or appreciating the wonderful taste of honey or rock candy 
With his desires burning like fire he would be unable to comprehend evaluate or appreciate the wonderful inner detachment that severs the images of all sense objects sounds smells tastes and touches 
It is like a man who for ages has placed his concern upon and taken his delight in fine worldly conversations 
He would be unable to comprehend evaluate or appreciate the joy of the inner holy silence of tranquility 
It is like a man who for ages has placed his concern upon and taken his delight in all the worldly ideas he had heard expressed and understood 
He would be unable to comprehend evaluate or appreciate the final cessation that forever eradicates all ideas and destroys personality Understand Dharmodgata it is like a man who for ages has placed his concern upon and taken his delight in worldly disputation 
He would be unable to comprehend evaluate or appreciate the fact that in north Kuru where I have preached there are no disputes over the constituents or over noself 
In like fashion Dharmodgata reason is entirely unable to comprehend evaluate or appreciate the descriptive marks of ultimate meaning which transcend the functioning of any reasoning At that time the Worldhonored One recited these verses to emphasize his meaning The sphere that is internally realized without descriptions cannot be spoken and severs expressions Ultimate meaning laying to rest all disputes transcends all the descriptive marks of reasoning 
 Chapter II At that time the Bodhisattva Suvisuddhimati addressed the Buddha and said 
Wonderful it is Worldhonored One that I have been able to hear these words of yours 
It is just as you have said for the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning being subtle and profound can be characterized as neither identical with nor different from all things 
They are indeed difficult to fathom Worldhonored One I once saw an assembly of bodhisattvas gathered together and seated They were in the stage of fully cultivating their commitment and were all considering the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning whether they were identical with or different from the descriptive marks of conditioned states of being 
Some of these bodhisattvas said that there was no difference between the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning and the marks of conditioned states of being Others said that it was not true that there was no difference between the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning and the marks of conditioned states of being but that the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning do differ from the marks of conditioned states of being 
Yet other bodhisattvas in doubt and perplexed said Which bodhisattvas are speaking truth and which falsity 
Good son it is just as you have expressed it All those good sons were indeed foolish and slowwitted They did not have insight and behaving poorly did not reason intelligently in regard to the subtlety and profundity of the truth of  b c The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning ultimate meaning for it does transcend being characterized as either identical with or different from conditioned states of being Why is this so Suvigsuddhimati 
It is because one cannot comprehend the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning in names by performing such exercises 
Why is this so Suvisuddhimati 
It is because if the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning were not different from conditioned states of being at all then at this very moment all common worldlings would have already gained insight into truth 
They all necessarily would have already attained the quiescent cessation of supreme skill or would have realized full perfect awakening 
But if the descriptive marks of ultimate meaning were entirely different from the marks of conditioned states of being then those who have already gained insight into truth would not have expunged images of conditioned states of being 
And if they had not expunged images of conditioned states of being then they would not have attained liberation from bondage to those images 
Not being liberated from those images they would not be freed from bondage to their gross weaknesses 
Not being freed from bondage to gross weaknesses those who have gained insight into truth would have been unable to attain the quiescent cessation of supreme skill or full perfect awakening 
But Suvisuddhimati it is not the case that at this very moment all the common worldlings have already gained insight into truth are already capable of attaining the quiescent cessation of supreme skill or have realized full perfect awakening 
Therefore the opinion that the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning are not different from the descriptive marks of conditioned states of being is not reasonable 
If someone were to say that the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning were not different from the descriptive marks of conditioned states of being from this above argument you should understand that this opinion is neither intelligent nor truly reasonable Suvisuddhimati neither is it the case that those who have gained insight into truth have not been able to expunge all the images of conditioned states of  Chapter IL being for they have indeed been able to expunge them 
It is not the case that those who have gained insight into truth have been incapable of liberation from bondage to the images of conditioned states of being for they have indeed been capable of such liberation 
It is not the case that those who have gained insight into truth have been incapable of liberation from bondage to gross weaknesses for they have indeed been capable of such liberation 
It is precisely because they have been capable of liberation from these two obstacles that they have been able to attain the quiescent cessation of supreme skill and to realize full perfect wisdom 
Therefore the opinion that the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning are entirely different from the descriptive marks of conditioned states of being is not reasonable 
If some say that the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning are entirely different from the marks of conditioned states of being from the above argument you should understand that this opinion is neither intelligent nor truly reasonable 
Moreover Suvisuddhimati if the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning were identical with the marks of conditioned states of being then just as the marks of conditioned states of being are defiled so also the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning would be defiled 
Suvisuddhimati if the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning were entirely different from the marks of conditioned states of being then the common mark that describes conditioned states of being could not be termed the mark of the truth of ultimate meaning 
But Suvisuddhimati the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning are not defiled and the common marks of conditioned states of being are termed the mark of the truth of ultimate meaning 
Therefore it is not reasonable to say that the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning are identical with the descriptive marks of conditioned states of being nor that they are entirely different one from the other 
From this argument you should understand that both those who speak for the identity of marks and those who speak for their complete difference are neither intelligent nor reasonable 
 la The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning Moreover Suvisuddhimati if the descriptive marks of ultimate truth were identical with the descriptive marks of conditioned states of being then just as the mark of the truth of ultimate meaning is undifferentiated in all conditioned states so all the marks of those conditioned states would be undifferentiated 
Then those who practice meditation would not have to search for ultimate meaning in all the conditioned states of being that they have seen heard understood and known 
On the other hand if the descriptive mark of the truth of ultimate meaning were entirely different from conditioned states of being then it would not be true that all conditioned states of being are manifestations only of the absence of self of the absence of essence 
The marks of ultimate truth would then simultaneously be held to be characterized in two different manners one of defilement and one of purity 
Those who practice meditation do search for ultimate meaning in the conditioned states of being they have seen heard understood and known 
Also all conditioned states of being are indeed manifestations only of the absence of self the absence of essence and they are rightly termed marks of ultimate truth 
It is not true that it is simultaneously characterized in two manners one of defilement and one of purity 
Therefore the opinion that the marks of the truth of ultimate meaning are either identical with or entirely different from the marks of conditioned states of being is not reasonable 
If some say that these marks of the truth of ultimate meaning are either identical with or entirely different from the marks of conditioned states of being from this argument you should understand that they are neither intelligent nor truly reasonable 
It is like unto the fresh white color of a conch shell for it is not easily ascertained whether is identical with or different from the shell 
The yellow color of gold presents a similar case 
Or consider the melodies from the sound of a guitar for it is difficult to ascertain whether that sound is identical with or different from the guitar 
Or take the fragrance that wells up from  Chapter IT aloes for it is difficult to tell whether it is identical with or different from the aloes 
Or take the bitter taste of pepper for it is difficult to tell if it is identical with or different from the pepper 
A similar case is the insipid taste of an astringent nut 
It is like the silky skin of a moth and its softness for it is difficult to ascertain if that silky texture is identical with or different from the softness 
Or take the rich liquor on the top of boiled butter Is it identical with or different from the boiled butter 
Likewise it is difficult to tell whether impermanence is identical with or different from conditioned states of being whether suffering is identical with or different from impure states of mind whether the noself of personality is identical with or different from all things whether inquietude is identical with or different from covetousness 
The same is true about anger and delusion visavis covetousness 
Thus Suvisuddhimati the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning cannot be said to be either identical with or different from the descriptive marks of conditioned states of being 
Suvisuddhimati I have perfectly understood the descriptive marks of the truth of ultimate meaning which are subtle indeed profound indeed hard to fathom indeed which transcend all descriptions as being identical with or different from all things 
Having perfectly understood I declare preach explain and illumine for the sake of others Then the Worldhonored One recited these verses to emphasize his meaning The descriptive marks of the realm of conditioned states of being and of ultimate meaning are apart from being described either as identical or as different 
If one imagines them to be either identical or different one is acting unreasonably 
Because of bondage to images and to gross weaknesses sentient beings must assiduously cultivate quietude and vision and then they will be able to attain liberation 
At that time the Worldhonored One addressed the venerable Subhiti and said 
Subhiti in the world of sentient beings how  b  he Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning many do you know who cherish their pride and in a prideful manner state their understanding 
Worldhonored One in the world of sentient beings I know a few who state their understanding without pride but I know innumerable untold sentient beings who cherish their pride and state their understanding in a prideful manner 
Worldhonored One once I was dwelling in a grove in a forest A large number of monks lived nearby 
I saw them assemble after sunrise to discuss various issues and to propose their understandings each according to his insight Some proposed their understanding of the aggregates their descriptive marks their arising their exhaustion their destruction and the realization of their destruction Others in like fashion proposed their understanding of the bases of consciousness and of dependent coarising while yet others proposed their understanding of sustenance its descriptive marks arising exhaustion destruction and the realization of its destruction 
At the same time others proposed their understanding of true severance of the supernatural abilities of the sense faculties of the powers of the factors of awakening while yet others talked about the eightfold path its descriptive marks the states it is able to control its arising from a state of being nonarisen its assured unforgettableness once it has arisen and its increase from repeated practice 
 Chapter IT Worldhonored One when I saw them I thought that all those venerable persons were engaged in addressing these various issues and proposing their interpretations each according to the insights he had attained 
But note well all of them cherished their pride and because they clung to that pride they were unable to comprehend the one universal taste of the truth of ultimate meaning 
But you Worldhonored One have already explained that the descriptive mark of the truth of ultimate meaning is rare most subtle indeed most profound difficult to fathom 
Worldhonored One if practicing monks find it difficult to fathom this one universal taste of the truth of ultimate meaning in this holy teaching then how much harder will it be for heretics to understand it Then the Worldhonored One addressed Subhiti and said 
This is so Subhiti for I have been awakened to the truth of ultimate meaning which is of one universal taste most subtle most profound most difficult to fathom 
Having been awakened I declare preach explain and illumine it for the sake of others 
What is it that I have preached Subhiti 
I have preached that the purified content of understanding in all the aggregates is the truth of ultimate meaning 
I have preached that the purified content of understanding in all dependent coarising in sustenance in the realms in recollection in true severance in the supernatural abilities in the factors of awakening and in the factors of the path is the truth of ultimate meaning This purified content of understanding is characterized as being of one taste being undifferentiated in all the aggregates in all the bases in all they discussed  for it is of one taste and not differentiated 
It is from this principle that the truth of ultimate meaning is of one universal taste 
Furthermore Subhiti once those practicing monks who cultivate centering have understood the suchness of a single group  the selflessness of the teaching on ultimate meaning then they will not engage in analyzing one after the other the aggregates bases dependent coarising sustenance truth the  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning realms recollection true severance the supernatural abilities the faculties the powers the factors of awakening or the factors of the path 
The selflessness of the teaching of suchness and ultimate meaning is based upon the nondual wisdom of suchness and ultimate meaning They then will come to awareness and realize the truth of ultimate meaning which is of one universal taste 
Therefore Subhiti from this principle understand that the truth of ultimate meaning is of one universal taste 
Furthermore Subhiti if like all the aggregates like all the bases dependent coarising sustenance truth realms recollection true severance supernatural abilities sense faculties powers factors of awakening and factors of the path all of which are described by differentiating one from the other if like these suchness ultimate meaning and noessence had descriptive marks that differentiated one from the other then these would issue from causes they would be caused 
And if they arose from causes they would themselves be conditioned And if conditioned they would not be ultimate meaning And if they were not ultimate meaning then one would once more have to seek the truth of another ultimate meaning 
It is because suchness ultimate meaning and the noessence of all things are not said to be caused do not arise from causes and are not conditioned that they are the truth of ultimate meaning Once one attains this ultimate meaning there is no further need to seek another ultimate meaning 
Only it is eternal and permanent whether a Tathagata appears in the world or not for in all things reality is established the reality realm perdures 
Therefore Subhiti from this principle you should understand that the truth of ultimate meaning is of one universal taste 
Subhiti in empty space there are differences in the multiple varieties of color while remains unmarked undifferentiated and unchanged by them Rather it encompasses all those marks within its one taste 
In a similar fashion the truth of ultimate meaning is in all things which are of different natures and do have differing marks and it encompasses all those marks with its one taste  Chapter II Then the Worldhonored One recited these verses to emphasize his meaning 
Encompassing all marks with one taste ultimate meaning is taught by all Buddhas to be undifferentiated 
If one were to discriminate it in those differentiations one should assuredly be foolish and prideful 
  Chapter III The Descriptive Marks of Mind Thought and Consciousness At that time the Bodhisattva Visalamati addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have spoken about bodhisattvas skilled in the secrets of mind thought and consciousness 
Why do you speak of these bodhisattvas as being skilled in the secrets of mind thought and consciousness 
What do you mean by describing them in this fashion Then the Worldhonored One addressed the Bodhisattva Visalamati and said 
It is very good Visalamati that you are able to question the Tathagata about this profound theme 
You raise this question because you desire to benefit and gladden unlimited sentient beings because you have compassion for the world and all its gods men angels and so forth so that they may be led to realize meaning benefit and happiness 
Attend then and I will explain the meaning of the secrets of mind thought and consciousness Visalamati you should understand that sundry sentient beings fall into sundry destinies in their transmigrations through the six destinies Whether eggborn wombborn moistureborn or magically born they issue from birth From the very first instant  the maturation evolution unification increase and growth of their minds together with all their seeds depend upon two appropriations 
The first is their appropriation of the material senses in the body 
The second is their appropriation of the propensity toward verbal fabrication in discriminating  b c The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning images and words 
In the worlds of form have these two appropriations but not in the world of noform Visalamati this consciousness is also termed the appropriating consciousness because it is taken up together with the body 
It is also termed the receptacle consciousness because this consciousness joins itself to and lies hidden in a common security and risk 
It is also termed mind because this consciousness mines and accumulates material forms sounds odors tastes and touches Visalamati because the appropriating consciousness is the support and ground there evolves the group of the six consciousnesses of seeing hearing smelling tasting touching and thinking 
The conditions that produce visual consciousness are the eye and material forms In synergy with such visual consciousness there evolves a thinking consciousness that simultaneously discriminates those very objects  
The conditions that elicit aural olfactory gustatory and tactile consciousness are the ear nose tongue and body together with sound odor taste and touch In synergy with these aural olfactory gustatory and tactile consciousnesses there evolves a thinking consciousness that simultaneously discriminates these same objects 
Visalamati when a single visual consciousness evolves at that very instant a discriminative thinking consciousness arises in synergy with that visual consciousness 
When two three four or five consciousnesses develop at that very instant a discriminative thinking consciousness arises in synergy with those same five consciousnesses Visalamati it is like a great rush of flowing waters 
If the conditions for one wave are present only one wave will develop 
If the conditions for two or more are present then many waves will develop 
But that great rush of waters itself flows on constantly without interruption or cessation 
It is also like the surface of a very pure mirror If the conditions for one image are present then only one image will appear  
If the conditions for two or more images are present then many images will appear 
 Chapter III But the mirror surface does not alter itself into the image and suffers no change at all 
Likewise Visalamati the appropriating consciousness is similar to those rushing waters for it is the support and ground When the conditions for the arising of a single visual consciousness are present then a single visual consciousness develops 
When the conditions for the arising of the five sense consciousnesses or however many are present then those consciousnesses develop 
Visalamati although in this fashion the bodhisattvas supported upon the wisdom of abiding in doctrine are skilled in the secrets of mind thought and sense consciousness yet it is not on this account that the Tathagata described them as skilled in mind thought and sense consciousness 
They do not see objects of thought nor thinking consciousness  
Visalamati it is on this account that they are called bodhisattvas skilled in the secrets of mind thought and sense consciousness and are so described by the Tathagata Then the Worldhonored One recited these verses to emphasize his meaning 
Fearing that they would imagine and cling to it as to a self I have not revealed it to the foolish   Chapter IV The Characteristic Patterns of All Things At that time the great Bodhisattva Gunakara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have spoken about bodhisattvas skilled in the characteristic patterns of all things Why do you so speak of them 
Why do you describe them so Then the Worldhonored One addressed the Bodhisattva Gunakara and said 
It is excellent Gunakara that you have been able to question the Tathagata about this profound theme 
You bring forth this question because you desire to benefit and gladden unlimited sentient beings because you have compassion for the world with all its gods men angels and so forth so that they might be led to attain meaning benefit and happiness 
Attend and I will explain the marks of all things for you In sum the marks of all things are threefold 
The first is the characteristic pattern of clinging to what is entirely imagined 
The second is the characteristic pattern of otherdependency 
The third is the characteristic pattern of full perfection 
The pattern of clinging to what is entirely imagined refers to the establishing of names and symbols for all things and the distinguishing of their essences whereby they come to be expressed in language 
The pattern of otherdependency refers to the pattern whereby all things arise codependently for if this exists then that exists and if this arises then that arises This refers to the twelvefold conditions starting with conditioned by ignorance are karmic formations conditioned by origination is this grand mass of suffering  
 a b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning The pattern of full perfection refers to the universally equal suchness of all things Bodhisattvas penetrate to this suchness because of their resolute zeal intelligent focusing and true reflection 
By gradually cultivating this penetration they reach unsurpassed true awakening and actually realize perfection 
Good son the pattern of clinging to what is entirely imagined is like the defective vision of one who has cataracts in his eyes 
The pattern of full perfection is like the unconfused objects seen by the pure vision of one with sound eyes and no cataracts 
Good son it is just as when a pure crystal comes into contact with and is tinted with the color blue it appears to be a blue sapphire or a blue gem 
Because it takes on the appearance of a blue sapphire or a blue gem it confuses sentient beings 
When it comes into contact with the color red it appears to be a ruby and so confuses sentient beings 
When it comes into contact with the color green it appears to be an emerald and so confuses sentient beings 
When it comes into contact with the color yellow it seems to be gold and so confuses sentient beings 
Similarly Gunakara just as those tinted colors appear upon the pure crystal so the propensity toward language of the characteristic pattern of clinging to what is imagined is superimposed upon the otherdependent pattern 
Just as upon that pure crystal one falsely clings to blue sapphires rubies emeralds or gold so upon the otherdependent pattern of consciousness one clings to the imagined for that otherdependent pattern is like the crystal 
Just as when in a constant and continual fashion the pure crystal no longer has any images of sapphires rubies emeralds or gold it is without reality or essence so when the pattern of otherdependency no longer has imagined images in it it is also in fact without reality or essence and is then the pattern of full perfection 
The  Chapter IV otherdependent pattern can be understood as caused by the grasping of those imagined images upon that otherdependent pattern 
The pattern of full perfection can be understood as caused by the absence of grasping the imagined pattern upon the otherdependent pattern 
If bodhisattvas are truly able to understand the imagined pattern as it arises upon the otherdependent pattern in all things they then will be truly able to understand all things as unmarked 
If bodhisattvas are truly able to understand the otherdependent pattern  they then will be truly able to understand all things as defiled 
If bodhisattvas are truly able to understand the fully perfected pattern they then will be truly able to understand all things as purified 
If bodhisattvas truly understand all things as unmarked in the otherdependent pattern they then will be able to abandon defiled things 
If they are able to abandon defiled things they will be able to realize things as purified 
In this fashion Gunakara since they truly understand all three patterns  they will truly know things as unmarked defiled and purified 
Because they abandon defiled things they will realize things as purified 
And this is why those bodhisattvas are described by the Tathagata as skilled in the characteristic patterns of all things Then the Worldhonored One recited these verses to emphasize his meaning 
Not being able to abandon defiled things one will obstruct the realization of wondrously purified things 
Not gaining insight into the sinfulness of all ones actions one will be wild sinful and injurious to sentient beings 
Sadly enmeshed in transient things are not such people lost and pitiable  c  Chapter V The Absence of Essence At that time the great Bodhisattva Paramarthasamudgata addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One once when I found myself alone in a quiet place I thought to myself The Worldhonored One in an immeasurable number of sermons has explained the aggregates their specific characteristics their arising their destruction their abandonment their full understanding 
In like fashion he has explained the bases of consciousness dependent coarising and sustenance 
In an immeasurable number of sermons he has explained the truths their specific characteristics full understanding abandonment and the practices that lead to their realization 
In an immeasurable number of sermons he has explained all the realms their specific characteristics varieties differentiation nondifferentiation abandonment and full understanding 
In an immeasurable number of sermons he has explained the stations of recollection their specific characteristics the act of controlling  which are controlled how by meditation what has not yet arisen can be produced how what has already arisen can be maintained their unforgettableness repeated practice growth and increase 
And just as he has explained the stations of recollection so he has explained true abandonment the supernatural abilities the sense faculties the factors of awakening 
In an immeasurable number of sermons he has explained the eightfold holy path its specific characteristics the act of controlling  which are thus controlled how by meditation what has not yet arisen can be produced and what has already arisen can be maintained its unforgettableness repeated practice growth and increase  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning Worldhonored One you also have explained that all things have noessence no arising and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation 
Excellent indeed good son that you have been able to question the Tathagata concerning this profound theme You raise this question because you desire to benefit and gladden immeasurable sentient beings for you have compassion for the world and all its gods men angels etc so that they may be led to attain meaning benefit and happiness 
Attend and I will explain my underlying intent in saying that all things have noessence no arising no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation 
Paramarthasamudgata you should understand that in reliance upon the three kinds of noessence I have explained that all things whatsoever have noessence for descriptive marks have noessence arising has noessence and ultimate meaning has noessence 
This is so because it is names and symbols that establish those marks and there is no inherent characteristic in things This then is what I call the noessence of marks 
The arising of things has noessence for all things arise in dependence upon others 
This is so because they depend upon the causal power of others and do not arise from themselves Therefore this is what I call the noessence of arising 
The ultimate truth of all things has noessence for from their arising all things have noessence 
This is what I call the noessence that is identical with the conditioned arising of things 
I also call it the noessence of ultimate meaning because I preach that among all  Chapter V things that realm of the purified content of understanding is to be regarded as the noessence of ultimate meaning 
The characteristics of the otherdependent pattern of consciousness are not however themselves this realm of the purified object of understanding 
Therefore I call this the noessence of ultimate meaning Moreover that fully perfected pattern of all things I also term the noessence of ultimate meaning for the absence of selfhood in all things whatsoever I call ultimate meaning or noessence because this is the truth of ultimate meaning because it is manifested by the absence of essence 
For these reasons I call it the noessence of ultimate meaning 
Good son flowers in the sky are like the essential noessence of descriptive marks 
The arising of magical images is like the essential noessence of arising as well as one aspect of the essential noessence of ultimate meaning 
Just as empty space is manifested everywhere by the absence of material forms so is the other aspect the essential noessence of ultimate meaning which is manifested everywhere by the absence of selfhood in all things 
Good son this is my underlying intent about the three kinds of essential noessence whereby I have preached that all things have noessence 
Paramarthasamudgata you should understand that it was with this underlying intent about the essential noessence of marks that I preached that all things have no arising and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation For if the descriptive marks of things do not exist in themselves then they do not arise 
If they do not arise then they do not pass away 
If they do not pass away then they are originally quiescent 
If they are originally quiescent then they are essentially in cessation for herein there is not the slightest part that could be led once again into final cessation 
Therefore with this underlying intent concerning the essential noessence of marks I have preached that all things have no arising and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation 
Good son it was with this underlying intent about the essential noessence of ultimate truth manifested through the noself of  b c lhe Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning things that I preached that all things have no arising and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation 
This noessence of ultimate meaning manifested through the noself of things is for all times and forever because the reality nature of all things abides in an unconditioned state and is not associated with any of the defilements 
Because at all times and forever the reality nature of all things abides it is unconditioned Because it is unconditioned it has no birth and no passing away 
Because it is not yoked to any of the defilements it is originally quiescent and essentially in cessation 
Therefore with this underlying intent concerning the noessence of ultimate meaning manifested by the absence of selfhood in things I have preached that all things have no birth and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation 
Moreover Paramarthasamudgata I am not propounding these three kinds of noessence because among the varieties of sentient beings in the world some regard the pattern of imaginative clinging as a distinct essence or because they regard the pattern of otherdependency or the pattern of full perfection as distinct essences 
Rather it is because sentient beings superimpose the pattern of imaginative clinging over that of otherdependency and full perfection that I propound these three kinds of noessence Sentient beings because they imagine there are essences and characteristics to be clung to in the otherdependent and fully perfected patterns produce language about this and that 
To the degree that they produce language they cling to images of essences in the otherdependent and fully perfected patterns because their minds are permeated with language their understanding follows upon language their inclinations are toward language Thus they cling to various imagined essences and characteristics in their otherdependent and fully perfected patterns of consciousness And clinging to such in those patterns they cling to the imagined pattern 
Therefore they will bring forth their otherdependent pattern in future  
Defiled by passion actions and birth they will gallop about in transmigration for a long time For a long time  Chapter V they will circle about without surcease and experience suffering whether in the hells among animals among ghosts in the heavens among angels or among men Moreover Paramarthasamudgata I preached the teaching on the essential noessence of arising for all those sentient beings who have not yet planted roots of goodness who have not yet purified themselves from obstacles who have not yet matured their continuity  who have not yet cultivated liberation who have not yet been able to accumulate the two requisites of merit and wisdom 
When they attend to this teaching they will partially be able to understand that all conditioned states which are dependently coarisen are impermanent inconstant not comforting grievously transient and destructive 
Then their minds will produce deep dread and detestation for all conditioned states When this has happened then they will reject all evil When they no longer do evil they will be able to cultivate and practice good 
And practicing good they will be able to plant roots of goodness not previously planted they will be able to purify obstacles not previously purified they will be able to mature their continuities not previously matured 
Because of this they will cultivate liberation and accumulate the two requisites of merit and wisdom 
They will not yet perfectly be able to detest all conditioned states They will not yet be able to sever their desires or be perfectly liberated They will not be altogether liberated from the defilements of passion action and birth 
It is for them that the Tathagata once more preaches this doctrine on the essential noessence of marks and the essential noessence of ultimate meaning 
He indeed desires to lead them to be able perfectly to detest all conditioned states perfectly to sever their desires perfectly to be liberated and to transcend the defilements of all passion action and birth  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning When they attend to this teaching then in the essential noessence of arising they will be perfectly able to believe and understand the essential noessence of marks and ultimate meaning They will ponder think and really understand for in their otherdependent pattern of consciousness they will cling to no imagined essences or marks 
Because of a wisdom not permeated by language because of an insightful wisdom not formed by language because of a wisdom freed from inclinations toward language they will be able to destroy the pattern that arises dependent upon others for sustained by the wisdom power of this teaching they will eternally be able to sever all causes for future forever 
Because of this they will be able to detest all conditioned states they will be able to sever all their desires and be perfectly liberated They will be able to be entirely liberated from the three defilements of passion action and birth 
Moreover Paramarthasamudgata because they follow this path all those sentient beings who belong to the wordhearers vehicle will realize unsurpassed quiescent cessation as will all those who belong to the solitary enlightenment vehicle or to the Tathagata vehicle 
For all wordhearers solitary enlightened ones and bodhisattvas this is the one wondrous path of purification This is the one ultimate purification There is no other 
It is with this underlying intent that I have preached that there is only one vehicle It is not that in the world of sentient beings there are not sentient beings of various different lineages for some are slow to understand some are not so slow and some are quick to understand Good son a person of the wordhearers lineage turned toward quiescence even if he were to be skillfully led by the energetic perseverance of all the Buddhas would yet be unable to be led to sit upon the wisdom seat and realize full supreme awakening 
This is so because from their origin they possess only an inferior lineage because their compassion has been weak because they have lived in fear of suffering 
Since their compassion has been weak they have turned their backs upon deeds that benefit and  Chapter V gladden all sentient beings 
Since they have lived in fear of suffering they have turned their backs upon engendering any conditioned activities 
I have never taught that one who turns his back upon deeds to benefit and gladden all sentient beings who turns his back upon engendering conditioned activities will sit upon the wisdom seat and realize supreme awakening Therefore I teach that such persons are termed wordhearers totally intent upon quiescence 
But if a person of the wordhearers lineage were to turn toward wisdom I would identify him as a bodhisattva 
This is so because having already been liberated from the obstacle of passion when he receives the universal awakening of all Tathagatas his mind will also be liberated from the obstacle to knowing Because initially was intent upon his own benefit the intensity of his practices liberated him from the obstacle of passion and therefore the Tathagata designated him as belonging to the lineage of the wordhearers 
Moreover Paramarthasamudgata sentient beings have various commitments both to the doctrinal discipline I have well presented and to the doctrine of the good teaching enunciated by my fully purified intent 
But a Tathagata relies upon the three kinds of essential noessence and with such a profound intent he has presented a summary of that doctrine when he preached the scriptures of implicit meaning saying that all things have noessence and no arising are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation for such are their hidden and profound marks If then sentient beings who have already planted roots of superior goodness who have already been purified from all obstacles who have already matured the continuities  who have already repeatedly cultivated liberation who have already been able to accumulate the requisites of superior merit and wisdom if such were to attend to the doctrine of these scriptures  they would truly understand the underlying intent of my words and would engender a deep faith in and understanding of this doctrine for they would truly penetrate  b c The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning this meaning in an infallible understanding 
Relying upon the practices of that penetration they would quickly be able to realize the final stage 
Because of their deeply engendered pure faith in me they would know that the Tathagata is supremely awakened and manifests true wisdom in all things There are sentient beings of upright disposition who have already planted roots of superior goodness who have already been purified from all obstacles who have already matured the continuities  who have already repeatedly cultivated liberation but who are yet unable to accumulate the requisites of superior merit and wisdom Although such upright dispositions they lack the ability thoughtfully to make judgments on propositions 
Yet because they do not set up their own views when they attend to this doctrine even though they lack the ability truly to understand the underlying intent of my words yet they will be able to engender a deep faith in this teaching They will believe in this scripture The teaching of the Tathagata is a most profound revelation is associated with the most profound emptiness is difficult to glimpse difficult to understand is beyond thinking is not within the sphere of rational reflection is to be subtly interpreted is understood by the wise But they abide in it with humility and say The wisdom of all the Buddhas is profound indeed 
For the sake of sentient beings of various commitments all the Buddha Tathagatas have turned the wheel of the true doctrinal teaching for the wisdom and insight of all Buddha Tathagatas is infinite while our wisdom and insight follows in their wake Although they are able to revere this scripture and declare it to others to copy it and protect it to unroll it and disseminate it to venerate and honor it to recite it and review it yet they will still be incapable of the effort of meditating upon it and thus they will be incapable of penetrating the underlying intent of my words 
But those sentient beings  Chapter V will be able to increase the requisites of merit and wisdom and they will be able to mature the continuities that have not been matured 
Although they do have the ability to make judgments on propositions yet abiding in their own views even if they hear this doctrine they will be unable truly to understand the underlying intent of my words 
Even if they were to engender faith and understanding in this doctrine they would only be clinging to the words that express the meaning that is that all things most certainly have noessence and no arising are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation Consequently they take up the view of nihilism and the nonexistence of all marks 
With this view of nihilism and the nonexistence of all marks they negate all marks for everything is unmarked They dispense with and negate not only those marks of things clung to in imagination but also the marks of otherdependency and full perfection 
Now the very ability to designate the imagined pattern presupposes that otherdependency and full perfection are described by marks If then in dispensing with and negating the descriptive marks of the imagined they regard the marks of otherdependency and full perfection as unmarked they in fact dispense with and negate all three characteristic patterns 
They do form concepts about my teaching but in their negation of meaning they do not form concepts of its meaning 
Because while forming concepts of my teaching in their negation of meaning they do not form concepts of its meaning They do maintain this doctrine but they do not maintain its meaning 
Nevertheless because they have engendered faith and understanding in regard to this doctrine their merit will increase but they will turn away from and lose wisdom because they engender clinging to what is meaningless 
Because they turn away from wisdom they will lose that wide limitless doctrine  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning Yet other sentient beings listen to them and take their doctrine as the doctrine and their negation of meaning as meaning If they follow that view they will form their concept of doctrine from that doctrine and their concept of meaning from that negation of meaning they will devote themselves to that doctrine as doctrine and to that negation of meaning as meaning 
Therefore they likewise will turn away from and lose the good doctrine 
Other sentient beings do not follow this view but as soon as they hear that all things have noessence and no arising are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation they feel dread Feeling such dread they say This is not the teaching of the Buddha but rather the teaching of a demon With such an understanding they attack and curse this scripture 
Therefore they encounter great misfortune and are blocked by the obstacle of their action  
This is why I have taught that if one forms the view that all descriptive marks are no marks and propounds this meaninglessness as meaning this will bring about the obstacle of action  
Because they beguile limitless sentient beings they cause them also to be blocked by this obstacle of action  
Good son there are other sentient beings who have not yet planted roots of goodness who have not yet been purified from all obstacles who have not yet matured their continuities  who have not repeated their commitments who have not yet accumulated the requisites of merit and wisdom and whose lineage is not of an upright disposition or character 
Even though they are able thoughtfully to judge propositions yet they always maintain their own views 
Even if they hear this doctrine they will be unable truly to understand the underlying intent of my words or to have deep faith in this doctrine They will form the concept that this doctrine is not doctrine and that this meaning is not meaning 
Clinging to the idea that this doctrine is not doctrine and that this meaning is not meaning they publicize their evaluation saying This is not the teaching of the Buddha but of a demon With such an  Chapter V understanding they slander reject curse and revile this scripture as useless and mistaken and in untold ways they attack criticize and discard this scripture They regard all those who have faith in this scripture as a rival faction 
From the very beginning they are blocked by the obstacle of their action against doctrine and thus they impede by means of this obstacle of action  It is easy to describe the beginning of this obstacle of action and to estimate how many hundreds of thousands of eons it will take for it to be overcome 
Good son these are the differences in the various kinds of commitments of sentient beings to my wellenunciated and wellcontrolled doctrinal discipline and my good doctrinal teaching expressed with a purified intent At that time the Worldhonored One recited these verses to emphasize his meaning 
What wise man speaks thus without an underlying intent 
All those paths of purity and all the purifications rely upon this one only for there is no second Thus herein I have established the single vehicle but this does not mean that there are no differences in the lineages of sentient beings 
In the world of sentient beings unlimited beings simply are delivered in their individual persons and enter quiescence for it is difficult to attain that cessation realized together with the great compassion and courage that does not turn away from sentient beings 
In the uncontaminated realm subtle and difficult to conceive liberations are equal and undifferentiated for all meaning is complete and free from delusion and suffering without duality or comparison for this is eternal happiness 
 b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning At that time the Bodhisattva Paramarthasamudgata addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One the intent underlying the words of all Buddha Tathagatas is rare rare indeed 
It is subtle subtle indeed 
It is profound profound indeed 
It is difficult to penetrate difficult to penetrate indeed 
The Worldhonored One has designed so that the marks of all things are essentially without essence in reference to the pattern of clinging to what is imagined whereby the attribution of names and symbols to conditioned images that support those imagined descriptive marks clung to within the range of discrimination are taken to be the aggregate of material form the descriptive marks of its essence the descriptive marks of its specific difference whereby the attribution of names and symbols is taken to be the mark of the essence or difference of the arising of material form the passing away of material form or of the eternal severance from material form 
The Worldhonored One has designed that the arising of all things is essentially without essence and one aspect of is that ultimate meaning is essentially without essence in reference to the pattern of otherdependency which is the conditioned image supporting those imagined descriptive marks clung to within the realm of discrimination 
I now understand this meaning enunciated by the Worldhonored One as follows for those marks clung to by imagination upon the conditioned images that support such imaginative clinging within the range of discrimination validate nothing real and this is their essential nature as noessence The Worldhonored One has designed the other aspect of the teaching that ultimate meaning is without essence in reference to the pattern of full perfection the purified content of understanding that is the noself of things that is suchness that is termed the pattern of full perfection 
This is how the material aggregate or the other aggregates should be explained 
This is how each of the twelve bases should be explained 
This is how each of  Chapter V the twelve branches of existence should be explained 
This is how each of the four sustenances should be explained 
The Worldhonored One has designed that the marks of all things are essentially without essence in reference to the pattern of clinging to the imagined ie the fact that the attribution of names and symbols to the conditioned images that support clinging to imagined descriptive marks within the realm of discriminations is taken to be the truth on suffering 
The Worldhonored One has designed that the arising of all things is essentially without essence in reference to the pattern of otherdependency ie those conditioned images that support clinging to imagined descriptive marks within the realm of discrimination 
I now understand this meaning enunciated by the Worldhonored One as follows Since those conditioned images that support clinging to the imagined within the realm of discrimination validate nothing real their essence is precisely without essence for this is the noself of things suchness the purified content of understanding It is this that is termed the pattern of full perfection 
In reference to this the Worldhonored One has designed the other aspect of that ultimate meaning is essentially without essence 
The Worldhonored One has designed that the marks of all things are essentially without essence in reference to the pattern of clinging to the imagined ie the fact that the attribution of names and symbols to the conditioned images that support clinging to the imagined within the realm of discrimination is taken to be either the essential or the specific mark of true concentration its ability to control that which it  c a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning must control its true cultivation to elicit what has not yet been elicited its strengthening of what has already been elicited its unforgettableness its repeated cultivation its increase and its expansion 
The Worldhonored One has designed that the arising of things is essentially without essence and one aspect of is that ultimate truth is essentially without essence in reference to the pattern of otherdependency ie those conditioned images that support clinging to the imagined within the realm of discrimination 
I would explain the meaning enunciated by the Worldhonored One as follows if in those conditioned images that support clinging to imagined marks in the realm of discrimination those marks clung to by imagination validate nothing real then this is the essence that is essentially without essence the noself of things suchness the purified content of understanding It is this that is termed the pattern of full perfection 
Worldhonored One just as dried ginger must be put into the prescriptions of all medicinal powders and elixirs just so WorldHonored One the explicit teaching that all things have noessence no arising and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation must be put into all the scriptures of implicit meaning 
Worldhonored One just as pigments pervade all they color with the identical single hue of their coloring whether blue yellow red or white and thus demonstrate that coloring action just so Worldhonored One the explicit teaching that all things have noessence etc pervades all scriptures of implicit meaning with its identical single hue and thus demonstrates the implicit meaning of those scriptures 
Worldhonored One just as the addition of warm cheese to cooked delicacies like cakes or fruit produces an exquisite taste just so Worldhonored One the addition of the explicit teaching that all things have noessence etc to scriptures of implicit meaning produces exquisite delight 
WorldHonored One just as empty space pervades everywhere with its identical single flavor and obstructs no activity just so WorldHonored One the explicit teaching that all things have noessence etc pervades all scriptures of implicit meaning with its identical  Chapter V single flavor and obstructs no activity performed by wordhearers solitary enlightened ones or bodhisattvas At that time the Worldhonored One praised the Bodhisattva Paramarthasamudgata and said 
Excellent excellent it is good son that you have been able to understand so well the underlying intent enunciated by the Tathagata 
Also the similes of the dried ginger the pigment the warm cheese and empty space were right to the point 
It is exactly as you have maintained At that time the Bodhisattva Paramarthasamudgata addressed the Buddha and said 
In the country of Benares at Rsipatana in the Deer Park the Worldhonored One first turned the wheel of doctrine the four holy truths for those setting out in the wordhearers vehicle 
This turning of the wheel was marvelous and wonderful such as nobody whether gods or men had been able to turn in the world before 
Nevertheless there were superior teachings for had to be interpreted and occasioned controversy 
Then the Worldhonored One with an underlying intent turned the wheel for the second time for the sake of those setting out in the great vehicle that all things have noessence no arising and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation 
This turning of the wheel was marvelous and wonderful indeed Nevertheless there were teachings superior to this for it also had to be interpreted and occasioned controversy 
The Worldhonored One then with an explicit meaning for the third time turned the wheel of doctrine for those setting out in all the vehicles that all things have noessence no arising and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially in cessation 
It had no superior nor did it contain any implicit meaning nor occasion any controversy Worldhonored One if a good son or good daughter having heard this teaching that all things have noessence no arising and no passing away are originally quiescent and are essentially  b c The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning in cessation with the explicit meaning as it was enunciated by the Tathagata were to believe copy protect honor disseminate recite or meditate and reflect upon it how much merit would they engender through their effort of meditating upon it At that time the Worldhonored One addressed the Bodhisattva Paramarthasamudgata and said 
Paramarthasamudgata the merit engendered by that good son or good daughter would be limitless incalculable incomparable 
I can but suggest a small part of it for you like a bit of dirt on ones fingernail in comparison to the earth It does not amount to onehundredth part nor onethousandth part nor onehundredthousandth part It cannot be reckoned as even the tiniest part 
Or it is like the pool in a cows tracks compared to the waters of the four great oceans which does not reach onehundredth part etc 
Worldhonored One how should we designate this teaching on the explication of underlying intent 
Good son it is designated the explicit teaching on ultimate meaning and you should reverence it as such When this explicit teaching on ultimate meaning was enunciated in the great assembly six hundred thousand sentient beings produced the mind of supreme awakening three hundred thousand wordhearers removed themselves far from defilement and pollution and in this doctrine attained the wisdom eye of doctrine one hundred fifty thousand wordhearers separated themselves definitively from all contaminated states of mind and attained liberation and seventyfive thousand bodhisattvas attained the patience of the doctrine of no arising 
 Chapter VI The Analysis of Centering At that time the Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One in the great vehicle when a bodhisattva practices the meditation of quietude and vision what is his support 
Maitreya good son you should understand that in the great vehicle when a bodhisattva practices the meditation of quietude and vision his support and station is the conventional exposition of the doctrine and the commitment not to cast off full supreme awakening The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
The Worldhonored One has taught four kinds of content 
Among these four which is the content of quietude 
And which is the content of both together The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said Good son the single content of quietude is not accompanied by an image for reflection 
The double content of both together is the limit of phenomenal reality and the fulfillment of duty The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how is the bodhisattva able to seek quietude and to be well trained in vision by supporting himself upon these four kinds of contents of quietude and vision  a ue ocripture on tne mxpiicauon or Underlying Meaning The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son the conventional exposition of the doctrine as I have enunciated it for bodhisattvas consists in the scriptures the metrical verses the prophecies the hymns the discourses the narratives the parables the apothegms  the accounts of previous lives the extensive discourses the accounts of miracles and the expositions 
Bodhisattvas listen attentively and accept these docilely With their words well understood their ideas well considered their views well clarified alone in a forested place they focus their thought upon the doctrines they have heard and pondered for they are now capable of thinking reflectively upon those doctrines 
In the continuity of their inner minds they focus and reflect and repeatedly abide in this correct practice 
They place their bodies and their minds at ease This is what is termed quietude and this is the quietude bodhisattvas seek 
With their body and mind at ease while abandoning the modalities of thinking they thoroughly examine and understand that doctrine upon which they have so well reflected in the images brought about by concentration 
In those meanings known through the images brought about by inner concentration they are able to correctly investigate and examine to ponder and search out everything whether patience happiness wisdom views or awakening 
It is this that is termed vision and this is how bodhisattvas are able to be well trained in insight The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One if the bodhisattvas internally reflect upon and think about the mind without having yet attained ease of body and mind what do you call that type of reflection The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Rather it is a reflection concomitant with the commitment to quietude Worldhonored One if the bodhisattvas not having yet reached ease of body and mind attentively reflect upon images as the content of inner concentration in accord with the doctrines upon which they have reflected what is that type of reflection called  Chapter VI Good son that is not the focusing of quietude at all 
Rather it is a reflection concomitant with the commitment leading to quietude The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One are the paths of quietude and vision to be described as different or identical The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son they are to be described as neither different nor identical 
They are not identical because images for reflection are not the objective  The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One are the images brought forth by all concentrations and vision to be described as different from or identical with thinking The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
This is so because those images are nothing but ideas 
Good son I have taught that the object of consciousness is nothing but a manifestation of conscious construction only Worldhonored One if those images brought about in this manner are identical with thinking then how can thinking reflect back and look upon itself Good son nothing ever looks at anything 
Rather when thinking occurs as such or such then such and such images make their appearance 
Good son when a well polished and cleaned surface of a mirror encounters a material shape it reflects the underlying material thing and we say that we see the image  the image appears as an object 
In this manner when thought arises it seems to differ from the images that appear in concentration Worldhonored One all the images that sentient beings have which occur because their minds encounter material form etc present themselves as distinct essences 
Are these identical with thinking  b ne Scripture on tne xpucation or Underlying Meaning Good son they are indeed identical even though with their mistaken awareness the foolish are unable truly to understand that these images are nothing but conscious constructions and consequently misunderstand them The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how can we describe the singleminded practice of vision of the bodhisattvas The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Worldhonored One what are the varieties of vision The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said Good son in sum there are three kinds 
The second is vision from inquiry 
The third is vision from penetration 
Vision from inquiry is that vision which through wisdom attentively reflects upon those things not yet well understood in order to understand them well 
Vision from penetration is that vision which attentively reflects upon those things already well understood by encompassing them within wisdom in order to realize them and attain liberation The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what are the general varieties of quietude The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son since they follow upon that thinking uninterrupted by images you should understand that here also there are three kinds 
There are also eight kinds for each meditation is a kind of quietude from the first to the of neither conceptualization nor nonconceptualization 
Again there are four kinds for each of the four immeasurable activities of friendliness compassion joy and abandonment is a kind of quietude The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have taught about quietude and vision supported by the doctrine and not supported by doctrine 
What do these terms mean The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said Good son the quietude and vision supported by the doctrine are that quietude and vision attained through the doctrine and its meaning first received and pondered by the bodhisattvas 
The quietude and vision not supported by the doctrine are the quietude and vision attained not through the images of the doctrine the bodhisattvas have received and pondered but through the instructions and meanings of other teachings such as meditation upon decaying and rotting or upon the impermanence of all things the suffering of all conditioned states of being the noself of all things or the final quiescence of cessation 
Such quietude and vision I designate as not supported by doctrine 
But if they have attained a quietude and vision supported by the doctrine those bodhisattvas I have  c a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning designated as followers of the doctrine and they have keen faculties while if they attain a quietude and vision not supported by doctrine those bodhisattvas I have designated as followers of faith and they have dull faculties The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have taught about quietude and vision that take as their object different doctrines and about quietude and vision that take as their object a unified doctrine 
What do these terms mean The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said Good son when a bodhisattva takes as his object of understanding each point of the doctrine of the scriptures etc and practices quietude and vision in regard to these doctrines which he has received and pondered that is termed quietude and vision that take as their object different doctrines 
When a bodhisattva takes as the object of his understanding the doctrine of all the scriptures etc and attentively reflects upon all these doctrines as one lump one accumulation one whole one gathering up all in harmony with suchness turning toward suchness approaching suchness in harmony with wisdom with cessation with the conversion of the support going toward these if in approaching these doctrines he proclaims the unlimited incalculable doctrine and with this reflection practices quietude and vision that is termed quietude and vision that take as their object a unified doctrine The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have taught about quietude and vision that take as their object a minor unified doctrine about quietude and vision that take as their object a great unified doctrine and about quietude and vision that take as their object an unlimited unified doctrine 
What do these terms mean The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son if one takes as the object of understanding the meaning of each of the scriptures and of the other eleven divisions of the teachings and attentively reflects upon them as one lump etc this is to be known as the quietude and vision that take as  Chapter VI their object a minor unified doctrine 
But if one takes as the object of understanding the doctrine of the scriptures etc received and pondered and attentively reflects upon them as one lump etc without considering them separately then this is to be known as the quietude and vision that take as their object a great unified doctrine 
If one takes as the objects of understanding the unlimited doctrinal teaching of the Tathagata the unlimited words and expressions of that doctrine and the unlimited clarifications of ever more excellent wisdom and attentively reflects upon them as one lump etc without considering them separately then that is to be termed the quietude and vision that take as their object an unlimited unified doctrine The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why do you say that the bodhisattvas attain quietude and vision that take as their object of understanding the unified doctrine The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son there are five reasons that should be understood The first is that when they reflect from moment to moment they purge away support for all weakness 
The second is that they sever all varieties of concepts and take their joy in doctrine 
The third is that they understand the unlimited light of doctrine which has no differentiating marks anywhere 
The fourth is that they bring forth purified nonrefiective images for the accomplishment of duty 
The fifth is that in order to bring the Dharma body to fulfillment they encompass that preeminent wondrous cause for everincreasing development The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One when are this quietude and vision that take as their object the unified doctrine said to be understood 
At what point are they attained The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said Good son they are said to be understood from the very first stage of utmost joy and are said to be attained from the third stage of expanding light 
Good son bodhisattvas just beginning their  b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning practices should also study and focus upon without remiss even though they are yet unable to be praised  The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
To be a concentration having no inquiry but only judgment 
To be a concentration having neither inquiry nor judgment The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said Good son that quietude and vision are termed a concentration with both investigation and inquiry when they experience and realize doctrinal descriptions as received investigated and inquired about even though they be grossly obvious 
That quietude and vision are said to be a concentration having no investigation but only inquiry when they experience and realize doctrinal descriptions as remembered in their subtle light even though not experiencing or realizing what is grossly obvious 
Furthermore good son quietude and vision accompanied by investigation is termed a concentration with both investigation and inquiry 
Quietude and vision that take as the content of understanding the unified doctrine are termed a concentration that has neither investigation nor inquiry The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what are the marks of quietude 
What are the marks of the initiative  
What are the marks of abandonment The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son whenever thinking becomes flighty or is about to become flighty quietude is characterized as a focusing upon those things that can engender disgust or by a focusing upon thinking  Chapter VI uninterrupted  
Whenever thinking becomes languid or is about to become languid initiative is characterized as a focusing upon those things that can bring joy or by a focusing upon the images of that thinking 
Whenever one becomes defiled by these two passionate inclinations whether in the practice of quietude the practice of vision or the practice of both in synergy abandonment is characterized as an effortless focusing and spontaneity of mind The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One that entire multitude of those bodhisattvas who practice quietude and vision know both doctrine and its meaning 
What is knowing doctrine 
What is knowing its meaning The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son all those bodhisattvas understand and know doctrine in five aspects for they know its names its phrases its descriptions its differences and its unity 
The knowledge of its names consists in conceptual designations which delineate essences in all defiled and purified things 
The knowing of its phrases consists in the ability to maintain and establish in discourse all defiled and purified things among that collection of names 
The knowing of its writings consists in the words that are based upon these two supports  
The knowing of its differences consists in focusing which objectifies each of those differences 
When all of these come together into one that is knowing doctrine 
This is why it is said that those bodhisattvas know doctrine 
Good son those bodhisattvas know meaning in ten aspects for they know the limit of being the suchness of being the meaning of subject the meaning of object the meaning of environment the meaning of enjoyment the meaning of mistakes the meaning of the absence of mistakes the meaning of defilement and the meaning of purification 
Good son the limit of being refers to the limit to the analysis of all that exists among all defiled and purified things 
This includes  c a A POU Uae UR Ue Ua a CS all that exists such as the five aggregates the six bases of internal consciousness and the six bases of external consciousness The suchness of all things refers to suchness existing in all defiled and purified things This term includes the suchness of all things 
There are seven kinds The first is the suchness of the transmigratory flow for all conditioned states of being have neither beginning nor end 
The second is the suchness of descriptive marks for in all things both persons and things have noself 
The third is the suchness of conscious construction for all conditioned states of being are nothing but conscious construction 
The fourth is the suchness of what is given that is the truth about suffering that I have preached 
The fifth is the suchness of false conduct that is the truth about the origin that I have preached 
The sixth is the suchness of purification that is the truth of the destruction that I have preached 
And the seventh is the suchness of correct practice that is the truth of the path that I have preached 
Understand that because of the suchness of the transmigratory flow of the suchness of what has been given and the suchness of false conduct all sentient beings are entirely equal 
Because of the suchness of descriptive marks and the suchness of conscious construction all things are entirely equal 
Because of the suchness of purification the supreme awakenings of all wordhearers all solitary enlightened ones and all bodhisattvas are entirely equal 
Because of the suchness of correct practice the wisdoms encompassed in the hearing of doctrine and in the quietude and vision that take as their object the unified realm of doctrine are entirely equal The meaning of subject consists in the five sense organs mind thought sense consciousness and concomitant mental states The meaning of object consists in the six external bases for the meaning of subject is also the meaning of object since the object is nothing but conscious construction 
The meaning of environment consists in that encompassing environment within which all sentient beings dwell whether a single town a hundred towns a thousand towns or a hundred  wuapuce va thousand towns whether a single great land bordering the ocean a hundred such a thousand such or a hundred thousand such whether a single continent of Jambudvipa a hundred such a thousand such or a hundred thousand such whether a single group of four continents a hundred such a thousand such or a hundred thousand such whether a single chiliomicrocosmos a hundred such a thousand such or a hundred thousand such whether a large dichiliomedzocosmos a hundred such a thousand such or a hundred thousand such whether a trichiliomegacosmos a hundred such a thousand such a hundred thousand such or a hundred hundred thousand such a single billion such a hundred billion such a thousand billion such or a hundred thousand billion such whether a single trillion a hundred trillion such a thousand trillion such or a hundred thousand trillion such in number equal to the minute atoms contained in a hundred thousand trillion trichiliomegacosmos in the unlimited and incalculable encompassing universes in the ten directions 
The meaning of mistakes consists in errors of conceptualizing errors of thinking errors of seeing in regard to the meaning of subjectivity and objectivity such as imagining what is impermanent to be eternal errors of conceptualizing errors of thinking and errors of seeing such as imagining suffering to be happiness or defilement to be purity or imagining the noself to be a self 
One must however know their marks  The meaning of defilement is triple for there are three kinds of defilement in this triple world the defilement of passion the defilement of our actions and the defilement of birth 
The meaning of purification consists in the factors of awakening whereby one is separated from bondage to those three kinds of defilement 
 b rhe Scripture on the Kxplication of Underlying Meaning These ten aspects encompass all meaning 
Moreover good son those bodhisattvas are said to know meaning because they are able to know and understand five kinds of meaning for they know all matters all meanings and all causes they attain the results of perfect knowing and they understand them 
Good son herein the knowing of all matters consists in knowing all that is knowable ie all aggregates all internal bases and all external bases 
In like fashion the universal knowing of all meaning consists in knowing the meanings that must be distinguished as to their varieties whether conventional meaning or ultimate meaning whether virtuous or defective whether about conditions or times whether about arising abiding or passing away whether about sickness etc whether about suffering its origin etc whether about suchness the reality limit the reality realm etc whether extensive or specific whether categorical analytic oppositional or dismissive whether underlying or explicit 
ie discipline and complete severance from covetousness anger and delusion the results by monks and the common and exclusive worldly or transcendent good qualities of wordhearers or Tathagatas all of which I have explained The communication of them ie the communication of the things  consists in broadly proclaiming and announcing to others all those liberating wisdoms of the doctrine that one has realized 
These five meanings encompass all meaning 
Moreover good son those bodhisattvas are said to know meaning because they know the four aspects of meaning 
Good son these four aspects of meaning encompass all meaning 
Moreover good son those bodhisattvas are said to know meaning because they know the three aspects of meaning 
The meaning of realms is fivefold 
the realm of the surrounding world the realm of sentient beings the realm of doctrine the realm of discipline and the realm of the methods of discipline 
Good son these three aspects encompass all meaning The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what is the difference between meaning known through wisdom gained from hearing  meaning known through wisdom gained from thinking and meaning known through wisdom gained from the cultivation of quietude and vision The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son the wisdom gained from hearing  rely upon the literal meaning of a text without really understanding its intent or making it clear They move toward liberation without being able to realize the meaning that brings about that liberation 
the wisdom gained from thinking also rely upon the text but not just to the letter for they are able really to understand its intent But they are not yet able to make clear and although they turn toward liberation they are yet unable to realize the meaning that brings about that liberation 
the  c The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning wisdom gained from cultivation bodhisattvas both rely upon the text and do not rely upon the text they both follow the letter and do not follow the letter for they are able really to understand its intent They make clear by means of images wrought in concentration that conform to the matters to be known They turn toward liberation well and are able to realize the meaning that brings that liberation about 
Good son these are what are termed the three kinds of differences in knowing meaning The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what is the wisdom and what is the insight of all those bodhisattvas who know doctrine and its meaning through their cultivation of quietude and vision The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son I have already on numerous occasions proclaimed the two differences between wisdom and insight Nevertheless I will now summarize the main point for you 
Wisdom is that wondrous discernment which occurs through the cultivation of that quietude and vision which take as their object the unified doctrine of the great vehicle 
Insight is that wondrous discernment which occurs through the cultivation of that quietude and vision which take as their object the different doctrines  The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One when the bodhisattvas cultivate quietude and vision what images do they abandon 
By means of what reflections The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said Good son because they reflect upon true suchness they abandon images of doctrine and images of meaning 
When they lack anything to be attained in names and nameessences then they no longer pay any regard to the images that support those names and nameessences In such a fashion they abandon them 
As it is with names so it is with phrases and all kinds of meanings 
Even in regard to realms and essences of realms they lack anything to be attained and so they no longer pay any regard to their images 
Is this image of true suchness also to be abandoned or not Good son in the meaning of true suchness which they discern there is no image whatsoever and nothing to be attained 
Good son as I have explained it that meaning of true suchness which they discern dispenses with any kind of image that might any meaning 
Thus it is not the case that this discernment itself can be replaced with anything else Worldhonored One you have given the examples of the broken water basin the dirty mirror and the bubbling spring as being surfaces that do not sustain any surface image for consideration 
The opposite of these would then sustain  
In like fashion if one has a mind not cultivated then one will not sustain a true understanding of suchness but when that mind is well cultivated then one will sustain such an understanding 
What kind of suchness were you talking about Good son in that explanation there are three kinds of thinking capable of penetrating understanding the thinking that is capable of understanding from what has been heard the thinking that is capable of understanding from what has been thought and the thinking that is capable of understanding from what has been cultivated 
I presented that explanation in light of the suchness of conscious construction Worldhonored One those bodhisattvas have discerned and know both doctrine and meanings and have been earnest in their cultivation to abandon all images How many kinds of difficulttoabandon images do they abandon 
And how do they in fact abandon them Good son there are ten kinds of such images and those bodhisattvas are able to abandon them through emptiness 
First because they discern and know both doctrine and meanings there are the various images of writings and words which they are able  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning to abandon through the emptiness of all doctrine 
Second because they discern and know the meaning of the suchness of the given they have images of arising passing away abiding differentiation continuity and development which they are able to abandon through first the emptiness of images and then the emptiness of beginnings and endings 
Third because they discern and know the meaning of the subject they have lustful images of bodies and of selfpride which they are able to abandon through cultivating meditation on the emptiness of interior and the emptiness of nonattainment 
Fourth because they discern and know the meaning of object they have images of desired possessions which they are able to abandon through the emptiness of externals 
Fifth because they discern and know the meaning of enjoyment they have internally established images of the flirtations and endowments of men and women which they are able to abandon through the emptiness of the internal and the external and on original emptiness 
Sixth because they discern and know the meaning of environment they have unlimited images which they are able to abandon through the greatness of emptiness 
Seventh because they discern and know the immaterial they have images of internal quiescence and liberation which they are able to abandon through the emptiness of the conditioned 
Eighth because they discern and know the meaning of the true suchness of images they have images of the noself of persons and things which whether images of only conscious construction or of ultimate meaning they are able to abandon through the emptiness of the ultimate the emptiness of noessence the emptiness of the essence of noessence and the emptiness of ultimate meaning 
Ninth because they discern and know the meaning of the suchness of purification they have images of the unconditioned and of the unchanging which they are able to abandon through cultivating meditation on the emptiness of the unconditioned and the emptiness of the  Chapter VI unchanging 
Tenth because they attentively reflect upon the nature of emptiness whereby they discipline what has to be disciplined they have images of the nature of emptiness which they are able to abandon through the emptiness of emptiness Worldhonored One once they have abandoned these ten kinds of images what other images do they abandon and from what images are they liberated Good son they abandon the images wrought in concentration 
They are liberated from and abandon the binding images of defilement 
Good son you should understand that strictly speaking each of these emptinesses counteracts its respective images but yet it is not true that each one does not counteract all the images 
It is similar to the case of ignorance for it is not true that it is unable to engender all the defiled things even up to old age and dying 
However strictly speaking ignorance is said to engender only karmic formations because all the karmic formations are immediately caused by ignorance 
This same principle also applies  At that time the Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what is the overall image of that emptiness which the bodhisattvas discern without discarding and yet without pride in regard to that image of emptiness Then the Worldhonored One praised the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son you have been able to question the Tathagata on this profound meaning in order to lead all the bodhisattvas not to discard the image of the nature of emptiness 
Why is this so good son 
It is because if the bodhisattvas were to discard the image of the nature of emptiness then they would discard the great vehicle altogether 
Therefore attend well for I will explain the overall image of emptiness for you 
Good son in the great vehicle the overall image of emptiness refers to the final separation of those images clung to by imagination with all their varieties of defilement and purity from both  b c The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning the pattern of otherdependency and the pattern of full perfection 
the complete nonattainment in those  The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how many concentrations are included within this quietude and vision The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son as I have explained the unlimited wordhearers bodhisattvas and Tathagatas have unlimited varieties of concentration all of which are included within  Worldhonored One what is the cause of this quietude and vision Good son it is purified discipline and true insight accomplished through purified hearing and reflection Worldhonored One what are the results of this quietude and vision Good son their results are wellpurified discipline wellpurified thought and wellpurified understanding 
Moreover good son all the good qualities both worldly and transcendent of all wordhearers Tathagatas etc are included as results of this quietude and vision Worldhonored One what activity is performed through this quietude and vision Good son their activity is the liberation from the two bonds the bonds of images and the bonds of gross weakness Worldhonored One among the five kinds of entanglements you have explained which are obstacles to quietude which to vision and which to both together Good son lust for bodies and possessions is the obstacle to quietude 
Lack of interest in the holy doctrines is the obstacle to knowledge 
The various ways of abiding in the welter of pleasurable images and being fully content with shallowness are the obstacles to both together 
Because of the first  one is unable to perform meditation 
Because of the second the effort cultivated never reaches accomplishment  Chapter VI Worldhonored One among the five obfuscations which impede quietude which vision and which both together Good son flightiness and evildoing are obstacles to quietude 
Melancholy laziness and doubt are obstacles to vision 
Good son if bodhisattvas reject attending to the great vehicle and fall into the attending of wordhearers and solitary enlightened ones that is distraction in regard to attending 
If they allow their minds to be scattered among the passionate inclinations perceived upon all the confusing images of the five external sense attractions that is distraction in regard to externals 
If they become immersed in melancholy attached to the taste of trance through laziness or defiled by the accompanying passion for any other trance state that is the distraction in regard to internals 
If in attending to and thinking upon the images wrought by means of interior concentration they rely upon images of external things that is the distraction in regard to images 
If internally they attend to sensations that arise conditionally and yet because of their gross weakness imagine a self and engender pride that is the distraction of gross weakness  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning Worldhonored One what are the obstacles that this quietude and vision are capable of counteracting from the initial bodhisattva stage to the Tathagata stage Good son in the first stage they counteract the obstacles of the passions that lead to evil destinies and of the defilement of action and birth 
In the second stage they counteract the obstacle of the appearance of subtle sins 
In the third stage they counteract the obstacle of the desires 
In the fourth stage they counteract the obstacle of attachment to concentration and to doctrine 
In the fifth stage they counteract the obstacle of rejecting transmigration altogether and going to cessation 
In the sixth stage they counteract the obstacle of the frequent appearing of images 
In the seventh stage they counteract the obstacle of the appearing of subtle images 
In the eighth stage they counteract the obstacles of expending effort in regard to the imageless and of not having attained mastery in regard to images 
In the ninth stage they counteract the obstacle of not having attained mastery of all the varieties of skillful speech 
In the tenth stage they counteract the obstacle of not having attained the realization of the fully perfected Dharma body 
Good son in the Tathagata stage this quietude and vision counteract both the obstacle of the most subtle passion and the obstacle to the knowable 
Because they are thus able to completely eradicate these obstacles they finally realize universal wisdom and insight unattached and unhindered and supported upon the accomplishment of objective they are installed in the ultimately pure Dharma body The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how do bodhisattvas supported upon their intense cultivation of quietude and vision realize supreme awakening The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son having already attained quietude and vision the bodhisattvas support themselves upon the seven suchnesses With minds well concentrated upon the doctrine heard and pondered within themselves they truly reflect upon the nature of  Chapter VI suchness as it has been well considered well examined and well established 
Because of their reflection upon suchness they are able to abandon the appearances of all subtle images not to mention gross images 
Good son these subtle images refer to images of the appropriation of thinking images of experience images of conscious construction images of defilement and purification images of the interior images of the exterior images of both interior and exterior images that one must act for the benefit of sentient beings images of true wisdom images of suchness images of the four truths of suffering its origin its destruction and the path images of the conditioned images of the unconditioned images of eternity images of transience images of the nature of suffering and change images of the unchanging images of the different characteristics of the conditioned images of the identical characteristics of the conditioned the image that there is a universal just because one knows a universal images of the noself of persons and images of the noself of things 
They are able to abandon all thoughts that appear in their minds and because they continually abide in such an activity over a period of time they cultivate a mind to counteract all entanglements obfuscations and distractions 
Afterwards they internally engender penetrating discernment in regard to each of the seven suchnesses for this is the path of insight 
Because of this attainment they are said to have entered the assured status of a bodhisattva exempt from rebirth for they are born into the household of the Tathagata and entering into the first stage they are able to enjoy the superior good qualities of this stage 
During this initial period because they have attained quietude and vision they have already attained the two objectsthe objects accompanied by images for reflection and the objects that are not accompanied by images for reflectionfor it is at this point that they attain the path of insight 
They also realize as the object of their understanding the limits of the phenomenal 
Then afterwards in all the stages they cultivate the path of meditation while attentively reflecting upon these three kinds of objects 
Just like a man  b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning who removes a large wedge by means of a small wedge so these bodhisattvas banish internal images by the method of relying upon this as the small wedge to remove the large wedge of all their images 
Since they destroy forever that weakness in all its images afterwards in all the stages they gradually refine their thoughts as one refines gold until they realize supreme awakening until they realize the objective they set out to accomplish 
Good son thus because these bodhisattvas have well cultivated meditation within themselves they realize supreme awakening The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how does this cultivation produce the great majesty of a bodhisattva Good son when the bodhisattvas become aware of the six supports they are able to produce that great majesty of a bodhisattva 
The second is that they know well the abiding of thought 
The third is that they know well the departure of thought 
The fourth is that they know well the increasing of thought 
The fifth is that they know well the diminution of thought 
The sixth is that they know well the methods 
They know well the arising of thought for they truly know the differences that engender thought in its sixteen activities and this is what is meant by knowing well the arising of thought These sixteen activities of thought are as follows 
The first is the arising of conscious construction as the unconscious foundational receptacle that is the appropriating consciousness 
The second is the arising of conscious construction in tandem with its numerous different objects that is the imaginative thought consciousness that immediately apprehends all the object realms of material forms etc the understanding which immediately apprehends internal and external objects or alternately the imaginative thought consciousness which in an instant a single moment enters into concentration and sees many Buddha lands and many  Chapter VI Tathagatas 
The third is the arising of conscious construction objectified in small images that is thinking bound to the world of desire 
The fourth is the arising of conscious construction objectified in large images that is thinking bound to the world of material form 
The fifth is the arising of conscious construction objectified in unlimited images that is thinking bound to infinite space and infinite consciousness 
The sixth is the arising of conscious construction objectified in subtle images that is thinking bound neither to conceptualization nor to nonconceptualization 
The eighth is the arising of conscious construction in no images that is transcendent thinking and objectless thinking 
The ninth is the arising of conscious construction activated in tandem with suffering that is the thinking of the inhabitants of the hells 
The tenth is the arising of conscious construction in tandem with the complex of sensation that is thinking activated through desire 
The eleventh is the arising of conscious construction activated in tandem with joy that is the thinking of the first two meditations 
The twelfth is the arising of conscious construction activated in tandem with happiness that is the thinking of the third meditation 
The thirteenth is the arising of conscious construction activated in tandem with neither suffering nor happiness that is thinking from the fourth meditation to neither conceptualization nor nonconceptualization 
The fourteenth is the arising of conscious construction in tandem with defilement that is the thinking associated with passions and passionate inclinations 
The fifteenth is the arising of conscious construction in tandem with goodness that is thinking associated with faith etc 
The sixteenth is the arising of conscious construction in tandem with morally neutral states that is thinking unassociated with either that  How do they know well the abiding of thought 
This means that they truly know the suchness of understanding How do they know well the departure of thought 
This means that they truly know deliverance from the two bonds those of images and those of weakness for such knowing enables them to lead their thinking  c a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning away from them 
How do they know well the increase of thought When they truly know the thoughts that are able to counteract the bonds of images and the bonds of weakness for at the moment when those increase and accumulate they attain an increase and accumulation  This is what is meant by knowing the increase of thought How do they know well the decrease of thought 
They truly know the images that have to be counteracted the weak defiled thoughts and when they discard them or lessen them this is a rejecting and a decreasing This is what is meant by knowing the decrease of thought How do they know well methods 
They truly know the liberations the of mastery and totality either when cultivating or terminating  
Good son this is how the bodhisattvas the great majesty of a bodhisattva whether they have already done so are going to do so or are presently doing so The Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One as you have taught in cessation without remainder all sensations without remainder are forever destroyed 
Which are these sensations that are forever destroyed Good son in sum there are two kinds of sensations destroyed without remainder 
The first are the sensations of bodily weakness while the second are the sensations of the objects that are their results 
There are four kinds of sensations of bodily weakness the sensations of bodies of material form the sensations of formless bodies the sensations of weakness already brought to term as result and the sensations of weakness not yet brought to term as result 
Sensations already brought to term as result refer to present sensations while sensations not yet brought to term as result refer to the objects of sensation to be caused in the future  
Sensations of objects that result are also of four kinds 
In cessation with remainder all sensations not yet brought to term as result have  Chapter VI already been destroyed for there is generally present the experiencing of sensations born from wisdom contact which counteract the experiencing both of those sensations not yet brought to term as result and of those sensations already brought to term as result 
Those two kinds of sensation are already destroyed and one experiences only that sensation born of wisdom contact 
But in cessation without remainder at the time of final cessation even this is eternally destroyed 
Thus it is said that in the realm of cessation without remainder all sensations are destroyed without remainder Thus the Worldhonored One finished his explanation 
He again addressed the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
All good sons and good daughters must with diligent effort cultivate it Then the Worldhonored One recited verses to emphasize his meaning 
If looking to what they can attain some reject and criticize and take their view to be the way to realize doctrine Maitreya they will be as far from centering as is the sky from the earth 
Obdurate people who do not work to benefit beings once enlightened do not bother about benefiting sentient beings but the wise do act until the end of the eons and they attain supreme undefiled joy 
If one enunciates doctrine from  b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning desire although one be said to have rejected desire one will revert to desire Thus fools having attained the priceless doctrine turn back and wander about begging alms 
At that time the Bodhisattva Maitreya addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how should we designate this teaching in this doctrinal discourse on explicating underlying intent 
How should we revere it The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Maitreya and said 
Good son it is designated the teaching on the explicit meaning of centering and you should revere it as such When this teaching on the explicit meaning of centering was preached in the assembly six hundred thousand sentient beings attained supreme awakening three hundred thousand wordhearers attained purification of their doctrineeye undefiled and unpolluted in regard to this doctrine one hundred fifty thousand wordhearers exhausted their contaminants and their thought attained liberation and seventyfive thousand bodhisattvas came to attend to expansive centering  Chapter VII The Stages and Perfections At that time the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have taught the bodhisattva stages which are the stage of utmost joy the stage of purification the stage of expanding light the stage of flaming wisdom the stage of invincibility the stage of presence the stage farreaching the stage unshakable the stage of wisdom discernment and the stage of the doctrine cloud 
You have furthermore described the Buddha stage as an eleventh stage 
What are the purifications of these stages 
In what are those purifications included At that time the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said Good son you should understand that all these stages are included in the four purifications and the eleven aspects 
The four purifications are able to encompass the ten stages because the purification of superior intention encompasses the first stage the purification of superior discipline encompasses the second stage the purification of superior thought encompasses the third stage and the purification of superior wisdom encompasses the excellences evolved in the subsequent stages 
You should understand that is able to encompass all the stages from the fourth to the last Buddha stage 
You should understand that in this fashion these four purifications are able to encompass all the stages How do the eleven aspects encompass all these stages 
In the first stage of practicing commitment the bodhisattvas well cultivate patience in their commitment by relying upon the ten practices   The Scripture on the Explication ot Underlying Meaning lof copying honoring propagating attending to reading maintaining explaining intoning pondering and cultivating doctrine Therefore upon transcending this stage they enter the assured status of a bodhisattva exempt from rebirth 
Having thus brought this aspect to perfection those bodhisattvas are yet unable truly to know and practice because of the presence of subtle sins and mistakes Therefore in this aspect they are yet imperfect 
But they are able to realize this perfection by the earnest cultivation  
Having thus perfected this aspect they are yet unable to attain a worldly perfect concentration or recollection or a perfect memory of they have heard Therefore in this aspect they are yet imperfect 
But they are able to realize this perfection by the earnest cultivation  
But they are able to realize this perfection through the earnest cultivation  
But they are able to realize this perfection through their earnest cultivation  
Having thus perfected this aspect they are yet unable to examine the evolution of transmigration as it is in reality because they frequently engender disgust for that  They are unable to abide for long in imageless reflection on transmigration Therefore in this aspect they are yet imperfect 
But they are able to realize this perfection through the earnest cultivation  
Having thus perfected this aspect they are yet unable to abide for long in the meditation of imageless reflection in a nondefective and uninterrupted fashion 
But they are able to realize this perfection through the earnest cultivation  
Having thus perfected this aspect they are yet unable to abandon effort in regard to imageless mastery They are unable to attain mastery over images Therefore in this aspect they are yet imperfect 
But they are able to realize this perfection through the earnest cultivation  
Having thus perfected this aspect they are yet unable to attain mastery over different ways of saying things images interpretations and distinctions in their preaching Therefore in this aspect they are yet imperfect 
But they are able to realize this perfection through the earnest cultivation  
Having thus perfected this aspect they are yet unable to attain the sense of the presence of the perfect Dharma body Therefore in this aspect they are yet imperfect 
But they are able to realize this perfection through the earnest cultivation  
Having thus perfected this aspect they are yet unable to attain that wondrous wisdom and insight unattached and unimpeded in all knowable realms whatsoever Therefore in this aspect they are yet imperfect 
But they are able to realize this perfection through the earnest cultivation  
Thus this aspect is brought to perfection and being perfected all these aspects are brought to perfection 
Good son understand how in this manner these eleven aspects entirely include the ten stages The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why is the first stage termed the stage of utmost joy 
Why are the other stages termed what they are termed The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
Good son the first stage is termed the stage of utmost joy because in accomplishing great meaning and attaining a transcendent mind not hitherto attained in the world one engenders great delight and joy 
The second stage is termed the stage of purification because in it one removes all subtle transgressions against discipline 
The third stage is termed the stage of expanding light  a b The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning because the concentrations and memory formulas attained in it are able to be the support for unlimited wisdom light 
The fourth stage is termed the stage of flaming wisdom because the factors of wisdom attained in it burn away all passion and wisdom flares up like fire 
The fifth stage is termed the stage of invincibility because when in it one attains mastery in the cultivation of skillful methods over those same factors of wisdom which are most difficult to overcome 
The sixth stage is termed the stage of presence because when in it one brings to presence and examines all the evolutions of conditioned states of being and abides in their presence by the continual cultivation of reflection upon the imageless 
The seventh stage is termed the farreaching stage because when in it one is able to enter into an imageless and farreaching reflection without defect and without interruption and thus one draws near to images of pure lands 
The eighth stage is termed the unshakable stage because when in it one attains spontaneity in regard to the imageless and does not evince any movement of any passion in regard to images 
The ninth stage is termed the stage of wisdom discernment because in it one obtains irreproachable and expansive wisdom which understands and masters all doctrinal enunciations 
The tenth stage is termed the stage of the doctrine cloud because in it just as a great cloud is able to cover over the sky this mass of weakness is encompassed by the Dharma body 
The eleventh stage is termed the Buddha stage because in it one is forever freed from the obstacle of even the subtlest passion and from the obstacle to the knowable in supreme awakening to all knowable realms The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One in the stages how many delusions and how many weaknesses to be counteracted are found The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and said 
Good son in these stages there are twentytwo delusions and twelve kinds of weakness to be counteracted In the first stage there are two delusions the delusion of clinging to personality  Chapter VII and to things and the delusion of being defiled in evil destinies 
These together with the weakness  are what has to be counteracted  
In the second stage there are two delusions the delusion of subtle mistakes and the delusion of destinies from various actions 
These together with the weakness that  are what are to be counteracted  
In the third stage there are two delusions the delusion of being covetous and the delusion in regard to perfecting the memory of what is heard 
These together with the weakness  are what are to be counteracted  
In the fourth stage there are two delusions the delusion of being attached to concentration and the delusion of being attached to doctrine 
These together with the weakness  are what are to be counteracted  
In the fifth stage there are two delusions the delusion of an exclusive focus in rejecting transmigration and the delusion of an exclusive focus in aiming at cessation 
These together with the weakness that issues from them are what are to be counteracted  
In the sixth stage there are two delusions the delusion of bringing to presence and examining the evolutions of conditioned states of being  and the delusion in frequently bringing to presence images  
These together with the weakness that issues from them are what are to be counteracted by this sixth stage 
In the seventh stage there are two delusions the delusion of bringing to presence subtle images and the delusion by the method of focusing exclusively upon the imageless 
These together with the weakness  are what are to be counteracted by this seventh stage 
In the eighth stage there are two delusions the delusion of exerting effort in regard to the imageless and the delusion in regard to mastering images 
These together with the weakness that issues from them are what are to be counteracted by this eighth stage 
In the ninth stage there are two delusions the delusion that one has mastered the unlimited doctrinal explanations the  c The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning unlimited doctrinal literature and the successive wisdom interpretations and formulas and the delusion of having mastered the art of interpretation 
These together with the weakness  are what are to be counteracted by this ninth stage 
In the tenth stage there are two delusions the delusion in regard to great clairvoyance and the delusion in discerning subtle intentions 
These together with the weakness that issues from them are what are to be counteracted  
In the Tathagata stage there are two delusions the delusion of a most subtle attachment to all the knowable realms of meaning and the delusion of their extremely subtle obstacles 
Good son it is because of these twentytwo delusions and eleven weaknesses that there are these stages and that supreme awakening being encumbered by  remains absent The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One supreme awakening is rare indeed for it is the attainment of the great benefit the great result whereby all bodhisattvas are enabled to break asunder the net of great delusion are enabled to pass through the thicket of great weaknesses and realize supreme awakening The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One by how many supremacies are these stages established The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said 
Good son these purities in sequence become increasingly superior from the first stage up to the Tathagata stage 
Excluding the purity of birth in the Tathagata stage the good qualities of the first stage are equally present in the higher stages for you should understand that these stages  Chapter Vil are superior in good qualities  
The good qualities of all the ten bodhisattva stages can be surpassed but the good qualities of the Tathagata stage are unsurpassed The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why do you say that the birth of a bodhisattva is far superior to the births of all other sentient beings The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
Good son there are four reasons First is engendered from the most pure good roots 
Second it is taken up through the power of their penetrating thought 
Third the compassion delivers sentient beings 
And fourth being undefiled they are able to remove the defilement of others The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why do you say that all bodhisattvas produce an expansive vow a wondrous vow a superior vow The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
Good son there are four reasons All bodhisattvas are well able to realize the happiness of abiding in cessation 
They could quickly realize it yet they renounce that rapid realization of a joyful abode 
Without causes or necessity they produce the mind of that great vow because they desire to benefit all sentient beings They remain among great sufferings of various kinds for a prolonged time 
Therefore I have said that they produce an expansive vow a wondrous vow a superior vow The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how many precepts must all the bodhisattvas observe The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and said 
Good son the precepts of the bodhisattvas are the six perfections of giving discipline patience zeal meditation and wisdom The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One of these six kinds of precepts how many are included within the precept of high discipline how many within  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning the precept of high thinking and how many within the precept of high wisdom The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said 
I teach that of zeal pervades them all The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One among these six precepts how many are included within the requisite of merit and how many are included within the requisite of wisdom The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said 
Good son that which is included within the precept of high discipline is synonymous with that which is included within the requisite of merit 
That which is included within the precept of high wisdom is synonymous with that which is included within the requisite of wisdom 
I teach that both zeal and meditation pervade both  The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how do the bodhisattvas observe these six precepts The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
Good son there are five aspects under which they must observe these precepts The first is that from the first they must have an intense faith in the wondrous doctrinal teachings about the perfections as found in the bodhisattva canon 
The second is that they must zealously cultivate the wondrous wisdoms accomplished through hearing reflecting and meditating in the ten practices concerning doctrine 
The third is that they must nurture thoughts of wisdom 
The fourth is that they must draw near to a spiritual counselor 
The fifth is that they must cultivate good qualities without interruption The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
in order to benefit sentient beings and in order to counteract all the passions for the first three precepts benefit sentient beings while the latter three counteract all the passions 
The first three benefit sentient beings for by giving all bodhisattvas provide requisites to benefit sentient beings 
By being disciplined they benefit sentient beings in sparing them from injury oppression and irritation 
By their patience under abuse they are able to benefit sentient beings enabling them to patiently sustain injury oppression and irritation 
The latter three counteract all the passions for by zeal the bodhisattvas although they may not yet have suppressed all their passions forever or may not yet have eliminated all their passionate inclinations are able diligently to cultivate good qualities and all those passions become incapable of reversing their efforts toward goodness 
By meditation they do suppress their passions forever and by wisdom they eliminate their passionate inclinations forever The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why have you presented the other perfections as four The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and said 
Good son it is because they are aids to the former six perfections 
Bodhisattvas who assist sentient beings by means of the first three perfections  establish sentient beings in good by means of taking care of them in the skillful methods of all the kinds of attractions which are giving to beings encouraging them with speech benefiting them with action and identifying with them Therefore I have taught that the perfection of skillful methods is an aid to the first three perfections 
But because of bodhisattvas present condition  their passions are numerous and they are yet incapable of uninterrupted practice Because of their fragile commitment and the worldly quality of their understanding they are incapable of abiding within their minds Because they are incapable of properly practicing the exercises heard in the bodhisattva canon the  b  The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning meditation they do have is unable to produce transcendent discernment 
However they have accumulated the requisite of merit in some small part and in their minds they do engender a vow to lessen their passions in the future 
Because of this vow their passions weaken and they become capable of practicing zeal Therefore I have taught that the perfection of vow is an aid to the perfection of zeal 
When bodhisattvas draw near a spiritual counselor and listen to doctrine with true attention this becomes a cause for their turning away from an inferior commitment and toward a superior commitment for they become able to attain an otherworldly understanding It is this that is termed the perfection of power 
Due to such power they become capable of abiding within their minds Therefore I have preached that the perfection of power aids the perfection of meditation 
If such bodhisattvas are able to properly cultivate the exercises they have heard they become able to produce meditation And this is what is termed the perfection of wisdom 
Because of this wisdom they are able to produce transcendent discernment Therefore I have preached that the perfection of wisdom is an aid to the perfection of discernment The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what is the reason for the sequence of the six perfections in your preaching The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
This means that bodhisattvas are able to acquire purified discipline through being generous with their physical possessions  
They practice patience because they guard discipline 
By practicing patience they become capable of producing zeal 
By producing zeal they become capable of accomplishing meditation 
Endowed with meditation they become able to obtain transcendent discernment 
This then is the reason for the sequence of the six perfections in my preaching The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
The three subdivisions of giving are the giving of doctrine the giving of material goods and the giving of fearlessness 
The three subdivisions of discipline are the discipline to turn away from what is not good the discipline to turn toward what is good and the discipline to turn toward benefiting sentient beings 
The three subdivisions of patience are the patience to endure insult and injury the patience to abide peacefully in suffering and the patience to investigate doctrine 
The three subdivisions of zeal are the zeal which protects one like armor the zeal to exert effort in engendering good and the zeal to exert effort in benefiting sentient beings 
The three subdivisions of meditation are the meditation of abiding in happiness which counteracts all the suffering of passion because it is nondiscriminative tranquil very tranquil and irreproachable the meditation that engenders the good quality  and the meditation that produces benefit for sentient beings 
The three subdivisions of discernment are the discernment that has as its object worldly conventional truth the discernment that has as its object the truth of ultimate meaning and the discernment that has as its object the benefiting of sentient beings The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why are these perfections called perfections The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
They are unattached because they are not attached to the opposites of the perfections 
They are disinterested because the thought is not bound to the maturation or reward resulting from any of the perfections 
They are irreproachable because such perfections have nothing in common with defiled states and are apart from implementing evil methods 
They are nondiscriminative because the specific descriptions of these perfections do not cling to their literal meaning 
They are fruitful  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning because such perfections when practiced and accumulated turn toward and seek the result of supreme awakening Worldhonored One what are the opposites of these perfections Good son you should understand that there are six such  
The first is looking out for ones own advantage in seeking happiness by hankering after pleasure wealth and power 
The second is looking out for ones own advantage in indulging the pleasures of body speech and mind 
The third is looking out for ones own advantage in being impatient when humiliated by others 
The fourth is looking out for ones own advantage in not bestirring oneself to practice and in being attached to pleasure 
The fifth is looking out for ones own advantage in the hectic confusion and wild activity of the world 
The sixth is looking out for ones own advantage in the fabrication of what one sees hears understands knows and says Worldhonored One what is the resultant maturation of all these perfections Good son you should understand that in sum there are six kinds 
The second is going to and being born in good destinies 
The third is the full joy and happiness of peace and concord 
The fourth is being a ruler over sentient beings 
The fifth is the absence of bodily torment 
The sixth is great renown and fame Worldhonored One how do these perfections become mixed up with defiled states Good son in sum there are four such situations 
A situation is unreasonable when by practicing one perfection one puts off and neglects the practice of the other perfections Worldhonored One what is meant by unskillful methods Good son if the bodhisattvas in benefiting sentient beings through their perfections were to rely only upon material goods  Chapter VII to bring benefit and render them happy and would not bother to lead them away from evil or establish them in good that would be an unskillful method 
Why is that good son 
It is because it is not true that the one who does such things is really benefiting sentient beings 
Whether one has a small amount or a great heap of excrement and urine it can never be used as perfume 
Similarly because sentient beings suffer because of their actions and because their nature is suffering it is impossible to lead them to happiness simply by the method of providing them with fleeting images of material things 
The best benefit would be to establish them in good The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how many purifications do all these perfections have The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and said 
Good son I have never said that they have purifications other than the five enumerated above of nonattachment disinterestedness irreproachability nondiscrimination and fruitfulness 
However with these as the basis I will explain the common and specific characteristics of the purifications of these perfections The purifications common to all the perfections number seven 
The first is that bodhisattvas need not seek after knowledge other than that of the doctrine 
The second is that after they have gained insight into this doctrine they do not engender attachment to it 
The third is that they do not engender doubt about this doctrine or question whether or not it is capable of leading to great awakening 
The fourth is that they never congratulate themselves deprecate others or engage in ridicule 
The fifth is that they never become prideful or lax 
The sixth is that they never denigrate their achievement or become surfeited  
The seventh is that they never become jealous of or stingy with others because of this doctrine The purifications specific to each perfection also number seven 
As I have taught the bodhisattvas are characterized by seven purifications of giving 
The first is that because the gift is pure they practice a purified giving 
The second is that because their  b c The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning discipline is pure they practice a purified giving 
The third is that because their insight is pure they practice a purified giving 
The fourth is that because their thought is pure they practice a purified giving 
The fifth is that because their speech is pure they practice a purified giving 
The sixth is that because their wisdom is pure they practice a purified giving 
The seventh is that because they are purified from defilement they practice a purified giving 
They are endowed with constantly prevailing discipline They accept and learn all lessons These are the seven characteristics of the purification of discipline Having deep faith in the maturation that results from all their own actions the bodhisattvas do not become exasperated in any unfavorable situation in which they might find themselves 
In order to overcome trouble they do not become abusive enraged pugnacious threatening or flippant 
They do not harbor resentment or reckon up their due 
When criticized they do not become vexed but neither do they invite criticism from others 
It is not from fear or defiled affection that they practice patience but they do not spurn kindnesses 
These are the seven characteristics of the purification of patience Having understood the equality of zeal the bodhisattvas neither boast of their resolute practice of zeal nor denigrate others 
They are endowed with great power and with great zeal 
Their profound abilities are strong and resolute 
They never cast off the yoke of the good These are the seven characteristics of the purification of zeal In their meditation the bodhisattvas have acquired the concentration that penetrates images the concentration of perfection  Chapter VII the concentration of two aspects the concentration of spontaneity the concentration without support the concentration of inculcating control and the unlimited concentration of practicing the lessons learned in the bodhisattva canon 
Discernment means that the bodhisattvas have separated themselves from the two extremes of imposing imagined essences upon doctrine or of deleting  for they practice the middle path Because of this discernment they truly understand the meaning of liberation methods 
that is the three liberation methods of the empty the desireless and the imageless 
They truly understand the meaning of essence that is the three patterns of the totally imagined the otherdependent and the fully perfected 
They truly understand the meaning of noessence that is the three kinds of essential noessence in marks arising and ultimate meaning 
They truly understand worldly conventional meaning that is the five stations of learning which are literature craftsmanship medicine logic and doctrine 
They truly understand the true meaning of ultimate meaning that is the seven emptinesses 
These are the seven characteristics of the purification of discernment The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what are the specific actions of these five characteristics  The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
Good son you should understand that these characteristics of purification have five actions Because they are unattached the bodhisattvas always exert diligent effort in their present practice of the perfections without laxity 
Because they are disinterested they encompass the causes to avoid laxity in the future 
Because  a The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning they are irreproachable they are able correctly to practice completely purified and wholly radiant perfections 
Because they are nondiscriminative in their perfection of skillful methods they speedily attain fullness 
Because they are generous in all their destinies they attain inexhaustibility in regard to all perfections whatsoever and all consequent favorable maturations of those perfections and finally reach unexcelled supreme awakening The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why are the bodhisattvas who have mastered these perfections extensive 
Why are they undefiled 
Why are they most radiant 
Why are they unshakable 
Why are they purified The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and said 
They are undefiled because they are irreproachable and nondiscriminative 
They are radiant because the action of their penetrating understanding is supreme 
They are unshakable because they have already entered the state of nonreturners 
They are purified because they have completed the ten stages and the Buddha stage The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why are all the favorable results and maturations of the perfections inexhaustible The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said 
Good son this is so because dependent one upon the other these are cultivated without interruption The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One why do the bodhisattvas in faith pursue the perfections but not the agreeable rewards resulting from them The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said 
Good son there are five reasons First it is the perfections and not their rewards that are the causes for the highest joy and happiness 
Second it is the perfections that are the causes for the highest benefit for oneself and for others 
Third it is the  Chapter VII perfections that are the causes for the maturation of favorable results in future times 
Fourth the perfections are the support for the negation of all defilement 
Fifth the perfections are beyond all change The Bodhisattva Avalokitevara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what are the august qualities of each of these perfections The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and said 
Good son you should understand that each of the perfections has four august qualities First when one cultivates these perfections correctly one becomes capable of abandoning their opposites stinginess laxity exasperation idleness distractions and false meanings 
Second when one cultivates them correctly one becomes capable of the true requisites for unexcelled supreme awakening 
Third when one cultivates them correctly even in the present world one becomes capable of encompassing within oneself benefit for sentient beings 
Fourth when one cultivates them correctly one becomes capable of attaining inexhaustible favorable results from their maturation in the future The Bodhisattva Avalokitevara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One what is the cause the result and the benefit of these perfections The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
The benefit is that fully perfected and expansive great awakening The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One if the bodhisattvas are endowed with inexhaustible riches and if they are most compassionate then how can there be poor sentient beings in this world The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said Good son it is because the very actions of sentient beings are sinful 
If this were not so then how would there be poverty in  b  The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning the world for the bodhisattvas always cherish the mind to benefit others and they are indeed endowed with inexhaustible riches if sentient beings did not set up obstacles by their own actions 
The bodies of hungry ghosts are oppressed by a great thirst but even if they encounter the waters of the great sea still they remain parched 
This is not the fault of that great sea It is the fault of the actions of those hungry ghosts themselves 
Similarly the riches to be given by the bodhisattvas like the sea are not at fault Rather like those hungry ghosts the force of evil actions deprives of the fruits  The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One by means of which perfection do the bodhisattvas perceive the essential noessence of all things The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
Good son it is because of the perfection of discernment that they are able to perceive the essential noessence of all things Worldhonored One if it is by means of the perfection of discernment that they are able to perceive the essential noessence of all things then why are they not able to perceive the essential essence  Good son I have never taught that one perceives the essential noessence by means of their essential essence Although that essential noessence is apart from all descriptions and is realized internally nevertheless one is unable to enunciate it by rejecting all verbal descriptions 
Therefore I explain that it is by means of the perfection of discernment that one is able to perceive the essential noessence of all things The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One you have taught about perfection near perfection and great perfection 
What is perfection 
What is near perfection 
And what is great perfection The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said 
Good son the bodhisattvas through unlimited periods of time cultivate and practice giving etc and bring to completion  Chapter VII good states yet there still remain passions They are not yet capable of vanquishing them but rather are themselves vanquished by them Perfection refers to the development of such weak commitment during the stage of practicing commitment 
Passions still do make their appearance but they are able to vanquish them and are not themselves vanquished by them Near perfection then refers to this stage of development in the initial stage and above Those bodhisattvas during further unlimited periods of time cultivate and practice giving etc develop further increases and bring to completion good states No passion now appears at all 
Great perfection refers to this in the eighth stage and above The Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how many varieties of passionate inclinations are to be found in all these stages The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva AvalokiteSvara and said 
Good son there are three varieties The first are the passionate inclinations that are removed from their companions These occur in the first five stages 
Why is this so 
Good son all the passions that do not arise connaturally are companions to the arising of connatural passions Since they no longer are present at the time  they are said to be removed from their companions 
The second are debilitated passionate inclinations which appear subtly in the sixth and seventh stages But if one cultivates their suppression they will appear no longer 
The third are the subtle passionate inclinations found in the eighth stage and above Herein all passions have been removed and no longer appear There remains only the support for the obstacle to the knowable The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara addressed the Buddha and said 
Worldhonored One how many varieties of abandoning the weakness of these passionate inclinations are manifested The Buddha answered the Bodhisattva Avalokitevara and said
