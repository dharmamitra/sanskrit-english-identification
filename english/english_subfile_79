we spoke because of what we had heard about Dabbabut now weve seen him ourselves copulating with the nun MettiyaThey gave them those namesand then told the monksEarlier we spoke about what we had heardbut now weve seen Dabba copulating with the nun MettiyaThe monks repliedDont say such a thingVenerable Dabba wouldnt do thatThe monks told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned DabbaDabba do you remember doing as these monks sayVenerable Sir you know about meand a third time the Buddha askedthe same questionand got the same responseHe then said Dabba the Dabbas dont give such evasive answersIf it was done by you say soif it wasnt done by you then say thatSir since I was born I dont recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream much less when I was awakeWell then monks call those monks to accountand he got up from his seat and entered his dwellingThe monks then questioned Mettiya and Bhūmajaka who told them what had happenedThe monks saidDid you charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion using an unrelated legal issue as a pretextThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can Mettiya and Bhūmajaka charge Venerable Dabba like thisThey rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that you charged Dabba the Mallian with an offense entailing expulsion using an unrelated legal issue as a pretextIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked them Foolish men how can you charge Dabba like thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk who is angry and displeased using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext charges a monk with an offense entailing expulsion aiming to make him leave the monastic lifeand then after some time whether he is questioned or not it is clear that the legal issue is unrelated and used as a pretext and he admits

pretext is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing suspensionThe training rule on satisfying ones own desiresAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in SāvatthīOne morning Udāyī robed up took his bowl and robe and went to the house of a beautiful widow where he sat down on the prepared seatThat woman approached Udāyī bowed and sat downUdāyī then instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teachingAnd she saidVenerable please say what you needIm able to give robes almsfood a dwelling and medicinesIts not hard for us to get those requisitesGive instead whats hard for us to getWhats that VenerableSexual intercourseIs it wanted nowIt is SisterSaying Comeshe entered her bedroom took off her wrap and lay back on the bedUdāyī approached her and spat outWho would touch this foulsmelling wretchand he leftThat woman then complained and criticized himThese Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liarsThey claim to live according to the Truth to be celibate and of good conduct to be truthful moral and of good characterBut they dont have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmintheyve lost the plotHow can the ascetic Udāyī request sexual intercourse from me but then spit out Who would touch this foulsmelling wretch and departWhats bad about me How am I foulsmellingIn what way am I inferior to whomOther women too criticized himin the same wayThe monks heard the criticism of those womenand the monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow can Venerable Udāyī commend the satisfaction of his own desires in the presence of a womanThose monks rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the BuddhaThe Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned UdāyīIs it true Udāyī that you commended the satisfaction of your own desires in the presence of a womanIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked himIts not suitable foolish man its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can you commend the satisfaction of your own desires in the presence of a womanHavent I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion not for the sake of passion for the stilling of the fevers of sensual desireThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk overcome by lust and with a distorted mind encourages a woman to satisfy his own desires Sister she provides the highest service who in this way satisfies one like me who is virtuous celibate and of good character and if it is a reference to sexual intercourse he commits an offense entailing suspension The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this caseOvercome by lusthaving lust longing for in love withDistortedA desiring mind is distorted an angry mind is distorted a deluded mind is distortedBut in this case distorted refers to the desiring minda human female not a female spirit not a female ghost not a female animalShe understands and is capable of discerning bad speech and good speech what is decent and what is indecentnear a woman close to a womanHis own desireshis own sensual desires for the sake of himself aiming at himself satisfying himselfThe highestthis is the highest this is the best this is the foremost this is the utmost this is the most

this waywith sexual intercourseSatisfiesgives pleasure toIf it is a reference to sexual intercourseif it is a reference to the sexual actHe commits an offense entailing suspension Therefore too it is

the training rule on satisfying ones own desires is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing suspensionThe training rule on emission of semenVenerables these thirteen rules on suspension come up for recitationAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time Venerable Seyyasaka was dissatisfied with the spiritual lifeand he became thin haggard and pale his veins protruding all over his limbsVenerable Udāyī saw him in this condition and said to himSeyyasaka youre not looking wellAre you perhaps dissatisfied with the spiritual lifeWell then eat as much as you like sleep as much as you like and bathe as much as you likeAnd whenever you become discontent and sensual desire overwhelms you emit semen with your handBut is that allowableYes I do it tooThen Seyyasaka ate slept and bathed as much as he likedand whenever he became discontent and sensual desire overwhelmed him he emitted semen with his handAfter some time Seyyasaka became satisfied and he had a good color with a bright face and clear skinMonks who were his friends said to himSeyyasaka you used to be thin haggard and pale your veins protruding all over your limbsBut now youre satisfied and you have a good color with a bright face and clear skinHave you been taking medicineNo I haventI just eat sleep and bathe as much as I likeand whenever I become discontent and sensual desire overwhelms me I emit semen with my handDo you eat the food given in faith with the same hand you use to emit semenThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow can Venerable Seyyasaka emit semen with his handThey rebuked Seyyasaka in many ways and then told the BuddhaThe Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned SeyyasakaIs it true Seyyasaka that you emit semen with your handYes SirThe Buddha rebuked himFoolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can you emit semen with your handHavent I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion not for the sake of passionfor freedom from bondage not for the sake of bondagefor the sake of nongrasping not for the sake of graspingWhen Ive taught like this how can you be intent on passion bondage and graspingHavent I given many teachings for the fading away of sensual desire for the clearing away of intoxication for the removal of thirst for the uprooting of attachment for the cutting off of the round of birth and death for the stopping of craving for fading away for ending for extinguishmentHavent I given many teachings the abandoning of worldly pleasures the full understanding of the perceptions of worldly pleasure the removal of thirst for worldly pleasures the elimination of thoughts of worldly pleasures the stilling of the fever of worldly pleasuresFoolish man This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsThen after rebuking Seyyasaka in many ways for being difficult to support the Buddha said And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIntentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspensionIn this way the Buddha laid down this

the ears and ornaments for the chest And they had others do the sameThey then took these things or sent them to the women the daughters the girls the daughterinlaws and the female slaves of good familiesThey ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vesselsThey sat on the same seats as them and they lay down on the same beds on the same sheets under the same covers and

forwardsThey whistled clapped their hands wrestled and boxedThey spread their outer robe on a stage and said to the dancing girls Dance here Sister and they made gestures of approval And they misbehaved in a variety of waysJust then a certain monk who had completed the rainyseason residence in Kāsī was on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī when he arrived at KīṭāgiriIn the morning he robed up took his bowl and robe and entered Kīṭāgiri to collect almsfoodHe was pleasing in the way he entered and returned in looking at and in looking away in drawing in and stretching out his arms his eyes were lowered and he was perfect in deportmentWhen people saw him they said Who is this acting like a fool like a dullard continuously frowningWho will give almsfood to himAlmsfood should instead be given to our Venerables Assaji and Punabbasuka for they are gentle congenial pleasant to speak with greeting one with a smile welcoming friendly open the first to speakA certain lay follower saw that monk walking for alms in KīṭāgiriHe approached him bowed and said Venerable have you received any almsfoodNo I haventCome lets go to my houseHe took that monk to his house and gave him a mealWhere are you going VenerableIm going to Sāvatthī to visit the BuddhaWell then would you please pay respect at the Buddhas feet in my name and sayVenerable Sir the monastery at Kīṭāgiri has been corruptedAssaji and Punabbasuka are the resident monks there They are bad and shamelessand they are misbehaving in a variety of waysThey plant flowering trees water them  And they are misbehaving in a variety of waysThose people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost itand there is no longer any support for the SanghaThe good monks have left and the bad monks are staying onSir please send monks to stay at the monastery at KīṭāgiriThe monk consented got up and left for SāvatthīWhen he eventually arrived at Sāvatthī he went to the Buddha in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery He bowed to the Buddha and sat downSince it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monksthe Buddha said to himI hope youre keeping well monk I hope youre comfortableI hope youre not tired from travelingAnd where have you come fromIm keeping well Sir Im comfortableIm not tired from travelingHe then told the Buddha all that had happened at Kīṭāgiriadding Thats where Ive come from SirSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that the bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are misbehaving like this at KīṭāgiriAnd is it true that those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost itthat there is no longer any support for the Sanghaand that the good monks have left and the bad monks are staying onIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them Monks how can those foolish men misbehave like thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  After criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed Sāriputta and MoggallānaSāriputta the two of you should go and do a legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from KīṭāgiriThey are your studentsSir how can we do a procedure of banishing these monks from KīṭāgiriThey are temperamental and harshWell take many monksAnd monks this is how it should be doneFirst you should accuse the monks Assaji and PunabbasukaThey should then be reminded of what they have done before they are charged with an offenseA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThese monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are corrupters of families and badly behavedTheir bad behavior has been seen and heard about and the families corrupted by them have been seen and heard aboutIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should do a legal procedure of banishing them from Kīṭāgiri prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at KīṭāgiriPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThese monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are corrupters of families and badly behavedTheir bad behavior has been seen and heard about and the families corrupted by them have been seen and heard aboutThe Sangha is doing a legal procedure of banishing them prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at KīṭāgiriAny monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of banishing them from Kīṭāgiri should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upFor the second time For the third time I speak on this matter Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen  should speak upThe Sangha has performed the legal procedure of banishing them prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at KīṭāgiriThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusSoon afterwards a sangha of monks headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to Kīṭāgiri and did the procedure of banishing those monks prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at KīṭāgiriAfter the Sangha had done the procedure those monks did not conduct themselves properly or suitably so as to deserve to be released nor did they ask the monks for forgiveness Instead they abused and reviled them and they slandered them as acting from desire ill will confusion and fear And they left and they disrobedThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themWhen the Sangha has done a legal procedure of banishing them how can these monks act like thisThey rebuked the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka in many ways and then told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that when the Sangha had done a procedure of banishing them the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka didnt act properly  and they disrobedIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk who lives supported by a village or town is a

daysWhen this is completed he is to be rehabilitated wherever there is an Sangha of at least twenty monksIf that monk is rehabilitated by an Sangha of even one less than twenty that monk is not

finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing suspensionThe training rule on schism in the SanghaAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time Devadatta went to see Kokālika Kaṭamodakatissaka Khaṇḍadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta and he said to themCome lets create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama a break in transmissionKokālika said to DevadattaThe ascetic Gotama has great supernormal powersHow can we do thisWell lets go to the ascetic Gotama and request five thingsSir in many ways the Buddha praises fewness of wishes contentment erasing of defilements ascetic practices being inspiring reduction in things and being energeticAnd there are five things that lead to just thatIt would be good SirIf the monks stayed in the wilderness for lifeand whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offenseIf they ate only almsfood for lifeand whoever accepts an invitational meal would commit an offenseIf they were ragrobe wearers for lifeand whoever accepts a robe from a householder would commit an offenseIf they live at the foot of a tree for lifeand whoever takes shelter would commit an offenseIf they didnt eat fish or meat for lifeand whoever does would commit an offenseThe ascetic Gotama wont allow thisWell then be able to win people over with these five pointsKokālika said It might be possible to create a schism in the Sangha with these five pointsfor people have confidence in austerityDevadatta and his followers then went to the Buddha bowed and sat downand Devadatta made his requestThe Buddha replied No DevadattaThose who wish may stay in the wilderness and those who wish may live near inhabited areasThose who wish may eat only almsfood and those who wish may accept invitational mealsThose who wish may be ragrobe wearers and those who wish may accept robes from householdersI have allowed a resting place at the foot of a tree for eight months of the year as well as fish and meat which are pure in three respectsone hasnt seen heard or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monasticDevadatta thoughtThe Buddha doesnt allow the five points and he was glad and elated He got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and left with his followersDevadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five pointssaying The ascetic Gotama doesnt agree to thembut we practice in accordance with themThe foolish people with little faith and confidence saidThese Sakyan ascetics are practicing asceticism and they live for the sake of erasing defilementsBut the acetic Gotama lives in luxury and has chosen to live in abundanceBut the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized DevadattaHow can Devadatta pursue schism in the Sangha of the BuddhaThe monks heard the criticism of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized himin the same wayAfter rebuking Devadatta in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned DevadattaIs it true Devadatta that you are pursuing schism in the Sangha a break in transmissionIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you pursue schism in the SanghaThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And

rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing suspensionThe training rule on matchmakingAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in SāvatthīAt this time when Udāyī saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband he would praise the young woman in the presence of the parents of the young manThe young woman of suchand such a family is beautiful intelligent skilled and diligentShe is suitable for your sonThey would replyVenerable they dont know who we areIf you would persuade them to give the girl we would take her for our sonAnd he praised the young man in the presence of the parents of the young womanThe young man of suchandsuch a family is handsome intelligent skilled and diligentHe is suitable for your daughterThey would replyVenerable they dont know who we areand we would be ashamed to speak to them for the sake of the girlBut if you would persuade them to ask us we would give our girl to the young manIn this way he arranged for the taking of a bride for the giving of a bride and for marriageAt that time there was a certain former courtesan who had a beautiful daughterOn one occasion some lay followers of the jīvaka religion came from another village and said to that courtesanLady please give your girl to our boySirs I dont know who you areAnd I wont give my only daughter to be taken to another villageSome people asked those jīvaka lay followerswhy they had comeand they replied We came to ask that courtesan to give her daughter to our sonbut she has refusedBut why did you ask the courtesanYou should speak to Venerable UdāyīHell persuade herThey then approached Udāyī and saidVenerable weve asked that courtesan here to give her daughter to our sonbut she has refusedWould you please persuade her to give us her daughterUdāyī agreed Soon afterwards he went to that courtesan and saidWhy didnt you give them your daughterI dont know who they are Sirand I wont give my only daughter to be taken to another villageI know themPlease give her to themIf you know them Ill give her awayShe then gave her daughter to those jīvaka followersand they took her away For a month they treated her like a daughterinlawbut after that like a slaveThe girl sent a message to her motherMum Im unhappy and miserableFor a month they treated me like a daughterinlawbut after that like a slaveCome mum and take me homeSoon afterwards the courtesan went to those jīvakas and saidPlease dont treat my girl like a slavetreat her like a daughterinlawThey repliedWe deal with the ascetic not with youWe dont want to know youBeing dismissed she returned to SāvatthīA second time the girl sent the same message to her motherThat courtesan then approached Udāyī and saidVenerable my girl is unhappy and miserableThey treated her like a daughterinlaw for a monthbut then like a slavePlease tell themto treat her like a daughterinlawAnd Udāyī went to the jīvakas and saidPlease dont treat this girl like a slavetreat her like a daughterinlawThey repliedWe deal with the courtesan not with youAn ascetic shouldnt get involvedyou should behave like a good asceticWe dont want to know youBeing dismissed he returned to SāvatthīA third time that girl sent the same message to her motherand a second time the courtesan approached Udāyī and told him the same thingHe replied When I went the first time they just dismissed mePlease go yourselfIm not goingThen that courtesan complained and criticized himMay Venerable Udāyī be miserable and unhappy just as my girl is miserable and unhappy because of her nasty motherinlaw nasty fatherinlaw and nasty husbandAnd the girl too complained and criticized him in the same wayas did other women who were unhappy with their mothersinlaw their fathersinlaw and their husbandsBut those women who were happy with their mothersinlaw their fathersinlaw and their husbands wished him wellMay Venerable Udāyī be happy and well just as we are happy and well because of our good mothersinlaw good fathersinlaw and good husbandsThe monks heard that some women were criticizing him whereas others were wishing him wellAnd the monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmakerThey told the BuddhaThe Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned UdāyīIs it true Udāyī that you acted as a matchmakerIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you act as a matchmakerThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk acts as a matchmaker conveying a mans intentions to a woman or a womans intentions to a man for marriage or for an affair he commits an offense entailing suspensionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksSoon afterwards a number of scoundrels who were enjoying themselves in a park sent a messenger to a prostitutePlease come lets enjoy ourselves in the parkShe repliedSirs I dont know who you areI am wealthy already and I dont want to go outside the cityThe messenger returned the messageA certain man then said to those menWhy did you ask the prostituteYou shouldve spoken to Venerable UdāyīHell persuade herBut a certain Buddhist lay follower saidThats not allowable for the Sakyan asceticsVenerable Udāyī wont do itAnd they made a bet on whether he wouldThose scoundrels approached Udāyī and saidVenerable while we were enjoying ourselves in the park we sent a message to suchandsuch a prostituteasking her to comebut she refusedWould you please persuade herUdāyī agreed And he went to that prostitute and saidWhy dont you go to those menI dont know them VenerableI know themPlease goIf you know them Sir Ill goAnd those men took her to the parkThen that lay follower complained and criticized himHow can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affairThe monks heard itand the monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affairThey rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned UdāyīIs it true Udāyī that you acted as a matchmaker for a brief affairIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you act as a matchmaker for a brief affairThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk acts as a matchmaker conveying a mans intentions to a woman or a womans intentions to a man for marriage or for an affair even if just a brief one he commits an offense entailing suspension The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this caseActs as a matchmaker conveyingsent by a woman he goes to a man or sent by a man he goes to a womanA mans intentions to a womanhe informs a woman of a mans intentionA womans intentions to a manhe informs a man of a womans intentionFor marriageyou will be his wifeFor an affairyou will be his mistressEven if just a brief oneyou will be in a short relationshipHe commits an offense entailing suspension Therefore too it is called an offense entailing

and he makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monks concerning the training rules that are recited sayingVenerables dont say anything to me either good or bad and I wont say anything to you either good or badplease refrain from correcting methen the monks should correct him like thisVenerable be easy to correct not incorrigibleAnd please give legitimate correction to the monks and the monks will do the same to youFor its in this way that the Buddhas community has grown that is through mutual correction and mutual clearing of offensesIf that monk continues as before the monks should press him up to three times to make him stopIf he then stops all is wellIf he does not stop he commits an offense entailing suspensionIf a monk is difficult to correctif he is difficult to correct endowed with qualities that make him hard to correct resistant not receiving instructions respectfullyConcerning the training rules that are recitedconcerning the training rules of the Monastic CodeThe monksother monksLegitimatelyabout whatever training rule has been laid down by the Buddhathis is called legitimatelyWhen he is corrected concerning that he makes himself

all is wellIf he does not stop he commits an offense of wrong conductIf those who hear about it do not say anything they commit an offense of wrong conductThat monk even if he has to be pulled into the Sangha should be corrected like thisVenerable be easy to correct not incorrigible And please give legitimate correction to the monks and the monks will do the same to you For its in this way that

offense of wrong conductShould press himAnd monks he should be pressed like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk soandso makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monksHe keeps on doing itIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should press him to make him stopPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk soandso makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monksHe keeps on doing itThe Sangha presses him to make him stopAny monk who approves of pressing him to make him stop should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upFor the second time For the third time I speak on this matterPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk

should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has pressed monk soandso to stopThe Sangha approves and is therefore silentI will remember it thusAfter the motion he commits an offense of wrong conductAfter each of the first two announcements he commits a serious offenseWhen the last announcement is finished he commits an offense entailing suspensionFor one who commits the offense entailing suspension the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulledHe commits an offense entailing suspension Therefore too it is called an offense entailing suspensionIf it is a legitimate legal procedure and he perceives it as such but he does not stop he commits an offense entailing suspensionIf it is a legitimate legal procedure but he is unsure of it

offense of wrong conductIf it is an illegitimate legal procedure and he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conductif he has not been pressedif he stopsif he is insaneif he is the first offenderThe twelfth rule training rule on being difficult to correct is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing suspensionThe training rule on building hutsAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time the monks of ḷavī were building huts by means of begging The huts were intended for themselves did not have a sponsoring owner and were inappropriate in sizeMoreover they were never finishedand so the monks kept on asking and beggingGive a man give a servant give an ox give a cart give a machete give a hatchet give an ax give a spade give a chisel give a creeper give bamboo give reed give grass give clayPeople felt oppressed by all the asking and begging so much so that when they saw a monk they became alarmed and fearful and they ran away took a different path turned away and closed their doorsThey even ran away when they saw cows thinking they were monksJust then Venerable Mahākassapa after completing the rainyseason residence at Rājagaha set out for ḷavīWhen he eventually arrived in ḷavīhe stayed at the Aggāḷava ShrineIn the morning Venerable Mahākassapa robed up took his bowl and robe and entered ḷavī for almsWhen people saw him they became fearful and alarmed and they ran away took a different path turned away and closed their doorsAfter finishing his almsround and eating his meal Venerable Mahākassapa returned and said to the monksḷavī used to have plenty of food and it wasnt difficult to get by on almsfoodBut now ḷavī is short of almsfood and its not easy to get by on almsWhy is thatThe monks told Venerable Mahākassapa what had happenedSoon afterwards after staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked the Buddha too set out wandering toward ḷavīWhen he eventually arrived at ḷavīhe too stayed at the Aggāḷava ShrineVenerable Mahākassapa approached the Buddha bowed sat downand told the Buddha what had happenedThe Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks of ḷavīIs it true monks that youre building huts through begging huts intended for yourself without a sponsoring owner and inappropriate in sizeAnd that because they were never completedyou kept on asking and beggingfor all sorts of thingsand people felt oppressed to the point where they now avoid monksIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked them Foolish men how can you act like thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it After rebuking them he gave a teaching and addressed the monksOnce upon a time monks two sages who were brothers lived near the river GangesOn one occasion the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sage He encircled him with seven coils and spread his large hood over his headBecause of his fear of that dragon the younger sage became thin haggard and pale his veins protruding all over his limbsThe older sage saw him like thisand asked him what was the matterAnd the younger sage told himThe elder sage said Would you like that dragon not to returnI wouldWell then did you see anything belonging to that dragonI saw an ornamental gem on his neckIn that case ask the dragon for that gemSoon the dragon king again emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sageAnd the sage said to himSir give me the gemI want the gemAnd the dragon thoughtThe monk is asking for the gem and he quickly leftOnce more the dragon king emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sageThe sage saw him comingand said to himSir give me the gemI want the gemWhen the dragon heard himhe turned around right thereYet again the dragon king emerged from the GangesThe younger sage saw him emergingand said to himSir give me the gemI want the gemThe dragon king then spoke these verses to the sageMy food and drink are abundant and sublimeAnd they appear because of this gemI wont give it to youyou ask too muchNor will I return to your hermitageLike a youth holding a clean stoneYou frighten me asking for this gemI wont give it to youyou ask too muchNor will I return to your hermitageAnd the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha thoughtThe monk is asking for the gem he wants the gemand he left and never returnedBecause he did not get to see that beautiful dragon the young sage became even thinner more haggard and pale his veins protruding even moreThe older sage saw him like thisand asked what was the matterHe replied Its because I no longer get to see that beautiful dragonThe older sage then spoke to him in verseOne shouldnt beg from those one wishes to be dear toOne is detested for asking for too muchWhen the brahmin asked the dragon for his gemIt left and was never to be seen againOne will be disliked even by animals monks for asking and begginglet alone by human beingsAt one time monks a certain monk lived in a forest grove on the slopes of the HimalayasNot far from that grove was a large lowlying marshA great flock of birds fed in the marsh during the day and entered the grove to roost at nightThe monk was disturbed by the noise of the flocking birds and so he came to see me He bowed sat downand I said to himI hope youre keeping well monk I hope youre comfortableI hope youre not tired from travelingAnd where have you come fromIm keeping well Sir Im comfortableAnd Im not tired from travelingOn the slopes of the Himalayas theres a great forest groveand close by a large lowlying marshA large flock of birds feeds in that lowlying marsh during the day and comes at night to roost in that forest groveThats where Ive come from Sirand I left because I was disturbed by the noise of that flock of birdsWould you like that flock of birds not to returnI would SirWell then go back to that forest grove In the first part of the night call out three timesListen to me good birdsFrom whoever roosts in this forest grove I want a featherEach one of you must give me a featherAnd in the middleand third part of the night do the same thingThe monk returned to that forest grove and did as instructedThat flock of birds thoughtThe monk is asking for a feather he wants a featherand they left that groveand never returnedOne will be disliked even by animals monks for asking and begginglet alone by human beingsThe father of Raṭṭhapāla monks once spoke to his son with this verseAll these people RaṭṭhāpālaWho come to me and begI dont even know themSo why dont you beg from meThe beggar isnt likedNor is one who doesnt give when askedThats why I do not beg from youPlease dont hate me for thisIf Raṭṭhapāla who came from a good family could speak like this to his own fatherhow much more then can people do so to each otherIts hard monks for householders to acquire and protect their possessionsAnd still foolish men you kept on asking and beggingfor all sorts of thingsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisWhen a monk by means of begging builds a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself it is to be no more than twelve standard handspans long and seven wide insideHe must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sidesIf a monk by means of begging builds a hut on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides or he does not get monks to approve the site or he exceeds the right

man either a lay person or one gone forthIntended for himselffor his own useIt is to be no more than twelve standard handspans longmeasured outsideAnd seven wide insidemeasured insideHe must get monks to approve a siteThe monk who wishes to build a hut should clear a site He should then approach the Sangha put his upper robe over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the senior monks squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerables I wish by means of begging to build a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for myselfI request the Sangha to inspect the site for the hutHe should make his request a secondand a third timeIf the whole Sangha is able to inspect the site they should all goIf the whole Sangha is not able to inspect the site then those monks there who are competent

finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing suspensionThe training rule on building dwellingsAt one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghositas MonasteryAt that time a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to himVenerable please find a site for a dwelling and Ill have one built for youWhile Venerable Channa was clearing a site for that dwelling he had a tree felled that had served as a shrine and that was revered by village town district and kingdomPeople complained and criticized himHow can the Sakyan ascetics have such a tree felledThey are hurting life with one sense facultyThe monks heard the criticism of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticizedVenerable Channa in the same mannerAfter rebuking Venerable Channa in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned ChannaIs it true Channa that you had a tree felled that had served as a shrine and that was revered by village town district and kingdomIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you do such a thingPeople perceive trees as living beingsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisWhen a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himselfhe must get

useHe must get monks to approve a siteThe monk who is building a dwelling should clear a site then approach the Sangha put his upper robe over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the senior monks squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerables I wish to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myselfI request the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwellingHe should make his request a secondand a third timeIf the whole Sangha is able to inspect the site they should all goIf the whole Sangha is not able to inspect the sitethen those monks there who are

and it lacks a space on all sides they should sayDont build hereIf no harm will be done and it has a space on all sides they should inform the SanghaNo harm will be done and it has a space on all

Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing suspensionThe training rule on physical contactAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wildernessHe had a beautiful dwelling with a room in the middle and corridors on all sidesThe bed and bench were nicely made upand the water for drinking and the water for washing had been well placedThe precincts were well sweptMany people came to see Udāyīs dwellingAmong them was a certain brahmin and his wife They approached Udāyī and saidVenerable we would like to have look at your dwellingWell then brahmin have a lookUdāyī took the key unlocked the upper bolt opened the door and entered the dwellingThe brahmin entered after himand then the brahmin ladyOpening some windows and closing others Udāyī walked around the inner room and came up from behind the brahmin lady touching her all overThen the brahmin thanked Udāyī and leftThe brahmin then expressed his delightThese Sakyan ascetics who live in the wilderness are superbVenerable Udāyī is superbBut the brahmin lady saidWhats superb about himJust as you touch me all over so did heThe brahmin then complained and criticized himThese Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liarsThey claim to live according to the Truth to be celibate and of good conduct to be truthful moral and of good characterBut they dont have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahminTheyve lost the plotHow can the ascetic Udāyī touch my wife all overIts not possible to go to a monastery or a monks dwelling with wives of respectable families with daughters girls daughtersinlaw or female slaves of respectable familiesIf you do the Sakyan ascetics might molest themThe monks heard the criticism of that brahminThe monks of few desires complained and criticized UdāyīHow can Venerable Udāyī make physical contact with a womanThey then told the BuddhaThe Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned UdāyīIs it true Udāyī that you made physical contact with a womanIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked himFoolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can you make physical contact with a womanHavent I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion not for the sake of passion for the stilling of the fever for sense pleasuresThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk overcome by lust and with a distorted

rule on angerAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time Venerable Dabba the Mallian had realized perfection at the age of sevenHe had realized all there is to be realized by a discipleand had nothing further to doWhile he was in seclusion he reflected on thisand he thought How may I be of service to the SanghaPerhaps I could assign dwellings for the Sangha and designate the mealsIn the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and approached the Buddha He bowed sat downVenerable Sir while I was in seclusion I reflected that Ive attained all that can be attained by a disciple and I was wondering how I might be of service to the SanghaI could assign dwellings for the Sangha and designate the mealsGood good Dabbaplease do soSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks the Sangha should appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of mealsAnd he should be appointed like thisFirst Dabba should be askedA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of mealsPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of mealsAny monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of mealsThe Sangha approves and is therefore silentI will remember it thusDabba assigned dwellings to the monks according to their characterHe assigned dwellings in the same place to those monks who were experts on the discourses thinkingTheyll recite the discourses togetherAnd he did likewise for the experts on the Monastic Law thinkingTheyll deliberate on the Monastic Lawfor the expounders of the Teaching thinkingTheyll discuss the Teachingfor the meditators thinkingThey wont disturb each otherand for the gossips and the bodybuilders thinkingIn this way even these venerables will be happyWhen monks arrived at night he entered the fire element and assigned dwellings with the help of that lightMonks even arrived late on purposehoping to see the marvel of Dabbas supernormal powersThey would approach Dabba and sayVenerable Dabba assign us a dwellingWhere would you like to stayThey would intentionally suggest somewhere far awayPlease assign us a dwelling on the Vulture Peak at Robbers Cliff on Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Mount Vebhāra in Cool Grove on the hill at the Snakes Pool at Gotamaka Gorge at Tinduka Gorge at Tapoda Gorge in Tapoda Park in Jīvakas Mango Grove in the deer park at MaddakucchiDabba then entered the fire element and with his finger glowing he walked in front of those monksThey followed closely behind him with the help of that lightAnd he would assign them dwellingsThis is the bed this the bench this the mattress this the pillow this the place for defecating this the place for urinating this the water for drinking this the water for washing this the walking stickthese are the Sanghas agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to departDabba then returned to the Bamboo GroveAt that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained They had little meritand they obtained inferior dwellings and mealsThe people of Rājagaha were keen to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monksghee oil and special foodsbut to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food of porridge and broken riceAfter the meal when they had returned from almsround they asked the senior monksWhat did you get at the dining hallSome saidWe got ghee oil and special curryBut the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka saidWe didnt get anything except ordinary food of porridge and broken riceAt that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monksHe made his offering in the dining hall together with his wives and childrenSome of them offered rice others curry others oil and others special foodsOn one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and BhūmajakaJust then that householder went to the monastery on some businessHe approached Dabba bowed and sat downDabba then instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teachingAfter the talk he asked DabbaSir who has been designated to receive tomorrows meal in our houseMettiya and BhūmajakaHe was disappointed and thoughtWhy should bad monks eat in our houseAfter returning to his house he told a female slaveFor those who are coming for tomorrows meal prepare seats at the gateway and serve them broken rice and porridgeYes sirThe monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to each otherYesterday we were designated a meal from that householder who offers fine foodTomorrow hell serve us together with his wives and childrenSome of them will offer us rice others curry others oil and others special foodsAnd because they were excited they did not sleep properly that nightThe following morning they robed up took their bowls and robes and went to the house of that householderWhen the female slave saw them coming she prepared seats at the gateway and said to themPlease sit VenerablesThey thoughtThe meal cant be ready since were given seats at the gatewayShe then brought them broken rice and porridge and saidEat SirsBut Sister weve come for the regular mealBut yesterday I was told by the head of the household to serve you like thisPlease eatThey said to each otherYesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with DabbaDabba must be responsible for this split between this householder and usAnd because they were dejected they did not eat as much as they had intendedAfter the meal they returned to the monastery put their bowls and robes away and squatted on their heels outside the monastery gateway using their upper robe as a backandknee strap They were silent and humiliated their shoulders drooping and their heads down glum and speechlessJust then the nun Mettiyā approached them and saidI pay respect to you VenerablesBut they did not respondA second timeand a third time she saidthe same thingbut they still did not respondHave I done something wrongWhy dont you respondIts because weve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian and youre not taking an interestWhat can I doIf you like you could make the Buddha expel DabbaWhat should I do How am I able to do thatGo to the Buddha and sayVenerable Sir this isnt proper or appropriateTheres fear distress and oppression in this district where none of these should existFrom where one would expect security theres insecurityIts as if water is burningVenerable Dabba the Mallian has raped meSaying Alright she approached the Buddha bowedand then repeated what she had been told to saySoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned DabbaDabba do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā saysVenerable Sir you know about meA second anda third time the Buddha askedthe same questionand got the same responseHe then said Dabba the Dabbas dont give such evasive answersIf it was done by you say soif it wasnt done by you then say thatSir since I was born I dont recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream much less when I was awakeThe Buddha addressed the monksWell then monks expel the nun Mettiyāand call these monks to accountThe Buddha then got up from his seat and entered his dwellingWhen the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyāthe monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to themDont expel the nun Mettiyāshes done nothing wrongShe was urged on by us because we were angry displeased and aiming to make Dabba leave the monastic lifeBut did you groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsionThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsionThey rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that you groundlessly charged Dabba the Mallian with an offense entailing expulsionIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked them Foolish men how can you groundlessly charge Dabba with an offense entailing expulsionThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk who is angry and displeased groundlessly charges a monk with an offense entailing expulsion aiming to make him leave the monastic lifeand then after some time whether he is questioned or not it is clear that the legal issue is groundless and he admits to his ill will he commits an offense entailing suspension The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this caseanother monkupset dissatisfied discontent having hatred hostilebecause of that upset that ill will that dissatisfaction and that discontent he is displeasedGroundlesslynot seen not heard not suspectedWith an offense entailing expulsionWith one of the fouraccuses or causes to be accusedTo make him leave the monastic lifeto make him leave the monkhood leave the state of an ascetic leave his morality leave the virtue of asceticismAnd then after some timethe moment the instant the second after he has laid the chargeHe is questionedhe is questioned about the grounds of his chargehe is not spoken to by anyoneThe legal issuethere are four kinds of legal issues legal issues arising from disputes legal issues arising from accusations legal issues arising from offenses legal issues arising from businessAnd he admits to his ill willwhat I said was empty what I said was false what I said was unreal I

saidWhat are you doing monkSir Ive been given this robecloth outside the robe seasonbut its not enough to make a robeThats why I lift it up and smooth it out again and againAre you expecting to receive more clothSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks I allow you to keep outofseason robecloth if you are expecting to receive moreWhen they knew that the Buddha had given this allowance some monks kept outofseason robecloth for more than a monthin a bundle on a bamboo roberackWhile walking about the dwellings Venerable nanda saw that robeclothand he asked the

Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had become skilled at making robesHe made an upper robe of old cloth welldyed and beautifully executed and he wore itJust then a certain wanderer who was wearing an an expensive robe approached Upananda and saidYour upper robe is beautifulPlease give it to me in exchange for my robeBut do you know what youre doingSaying Alright then he gave itThe wanderer put on the upper robe and went to the wanderers monasteryAnd the wanderers said to himThis upper robe of yours is beautifulHow did you get itI swapped it for my robeBut how long will this upper robe last youThat robe of yours was betterThe wanderer realized they were rightand so he returned to Upananda and saidHeres your upper robe give me back my robeBut didnt I ask you if you knew what you were doingI wont give it backThen that wanderer complained and criticized himEven householders give back to other householders who have regretsHow then can an ascetic not give back to another asceticThe monks heard the complaints of that wandererand the monks of few desires complained and criticized UpanandaHow can Venerable Upananda barter with a wandererAfter rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned UpanandaIs it true Upananda that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you barter with a wandererThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk barters in various ways he commits

on robesThe training rule on asking nonrelationsAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was skilled at teachingOn one occasion the son of a prominent merchant approached Upananda bowed and sat downAnd Upananda instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teachingAfterwards that merchants son said to UpanandaVenerable please tell me what you needIm able to give you robes almsfood a dwelling and medicinesIf you wish to give me something then give me one of your wrap garmentsIts shameful for the son of a good family to walk around in only one wrapPlease wait until I get back homeIll send you this wrap or a better oneA second timeand a third time Upananda saidthe same thing to that merchants sonand he got the same replyHe then said Whats the point of inviting if you dont want to giveBeing pressured by Upananda that merchants son gave him one of his wraps and leftPeople asked him Why are you walking around in only one wrapAnd he told them what had happenedPeople complained and criticized himThese Sakyan ascetics have great desires they are not contentEven to make them an appropriate offer isnt easyHow can they take his wrap when the merchants son was making an appropriate offerThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized UpanandaHow can Venerable Upananda ask the merchants son for a robeAfter rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned UpanandaIs it true Upananda that you acted like thisIts true SirIs he a relative of yoursFoolish man people who are not related dont know whats appropriate and whats inappropriate in dealing with each other whats right and whats wrongAnd still you asked the merchants son for a robeThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk asks an unrelated male or female householder for a robe he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksAt that time while traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī a number of monks were robbed by banditsKnowing that the Buddha had laid down this training rule and being afraid of wrongdoing they did not ask for robesThey walked naked to Sāvatthī and bowed down to the monksThe monks said These jīvaka ascetics are good people in that they bow down to the monksWere not jīvakas were monksAnd the monks said to Venerable Upāli Upāli please examine themThe naked monks then told Upāli what had happened and he told the monks They are monksGive them robesThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can monks go nakedShouldnt they have covered up with grass and leavesAfter rebuking those monks in many ways they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks if a monks robes are stolen or destroyed I allow him to ask an unrelated householder for robesAt the first monastery where he arrives if the Sangha has a monastery robe a bedspread a floor cover or a mattress cover he should take that and put it on thinking When I get a robe Ill return itIf theres none of these things he should cover up with grass and leaves before going on He should not go on while nakedIf he does he commits an offense of wrong conductAnd so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk asks an unrelated male or female householder for a robe except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionThese are the appropriate occasions his robes are stolen or his robes are destroyed The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this caseUnrelatedanyone who is not a descendant of ones

monks it should be relinquished like thisVenerables this robecloth which I received after asking an unrelated householder but not on an appropriate occasion is to be relinquishedI relinquish it to the Sangha the Sangha should give you should give I give this robecloth back to youIf the person is unrelated and the monk perceives them as such and he asks them for a robecloth except on an appropriate

allowed three robes the monks from the group of six entered the village in one set of three robes stayed in the monastery in another set and went to bathe in yet another setThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks from the group of six keep extra robesAfter rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that you keep extra robesIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked them Foolish men how can you keep extra robesThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk keeps an extra robe he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksSoon afterwards Venerable nanda was given an extra robeHe wanted to give it to Venerable Sāriputtawho was staying at SāketaKnowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against having extra robes nanda thoughtWhat should I do in this situationHe told the Buddha who saidHow long is it nanda before Sāriputta returnsNine or ten daysSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks you should keep an extra robe for ten days at the mostAnd so monks this training rule should be recited like thisWhen his robe is finished and the robemaking season has ended a monk

it to the SanghaAfter relinquishing it he should confess the offenseThe confession should be received by a competent and capable monkThe relinquished robecloth is then to be given backPlease

be given backIf you dont give it back you commit an offense of wrong conductThe first rule the training rule on the robemaking season is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on relinquishmentThe subchapter on robesThe training rule on storehousesAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time the monks stored one of their robes with other monks and then left to wander in the country with a lower and an upper robeBecause they were stored for a long time the robes became moldyThe monks put them out in the sunWhile walking about the dwellings Venerable nanda saw the monks sunning those robesHe asked themWhose moldy robes are theseAnd they told him what had happenedVenerable nanda complained and criticized themHow can those monks store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to wander in the country with a lower and an upper robeAfter rebuking those monks in many ways Venerable nanda told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that some monks are acting like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them How can these foolish men store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to wander in the country with a lower and an upper robeThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisWhen his robe is finished and the robemaking season has ended if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksAt one time a certain monk at Kosambī was sickThe relatives of that monk sent him a messageCome Venerable we will nurse youOther monks urged him to gobut he saidThe Buddha has laid down a training rulethat you cant be apart from your three robesBecause Im sickIm not able to travel with all three robesand therefore I cant goThey told the BuddhaSoon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks I allow you to give permission to a sick monk to stay apart from his three robesAnd it should be given like thisAfter approaching the Sangha the sick monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerables Im sickIm not able to travel with my three robesI ask the Sangha for permission to stay apart from my three robesAnd he should ask a secondand a third timeA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk soandso is sickHe is not able to travel with his three robesHe is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robesIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should give permission to monk soandso to stay apart from his three robesPlease Venerables I ask the

afterwards the Sangha at Sāvatthī made the following agreementThe Buddha wishes to be on solitary retreat for three monthsNo one is to approach him except the one who brings him almsfoodAnyone who approaches him should be made to confess an offense entailing confessionJust then Venerable Upasena of Vaṅganta and his followers approached the Buddha bowed and sat downSince it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks the Buddha said this to UpasenaI hope youre keeping well Upasena I hope youre comfortableI hope youre not tired from travelingWere keeping well Sir were comfortablewere not tired from travelingOne of Upasenas students was seated not far from the Buddha and the Buddha said to himDo you like ragrobes monkI dont like ragrobes SirWhy then do you wear themMy preceptor wears them and so I do it tooAnd the Buddha said to Upasena Upasena your followers are inspiringHow do you train themWhen anyone asks me for the full ordination I tell him thisI stay in the wilderness I eat only almsfood and I wear ragrobesIf you do the same Ill give you the full ordinationIf he agrees I ordain him otherwise I dontAnd I do the same when anyone asks me for formal

make Venerable Upasena confess an offense entailing confessionUpasena and his followers got up from their seats bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him and leftAnd those monks said to Upasena Upasena do you know the agreement of the Sangha at SāvatthīThe Buddha asked me the same question and I replied that I didntHe then told me what it was and I saidVenerable Sir the Sangha at Sāvatthī will become known for this agreementWe however dont lay down new rules nor do we get rid of the existing onesWe practice and undertake the training rules as they areAnd the Buddha has allowed those monks who stay in the wilderness who eat only almsfood and who wear ragrobes to go and visit him whenever they pleaseThose monks thought Its true what Venerable Upasena saysThe monks

their blankets and undertook the practice of staying in the wilderness of eating only almsfood and of wearing ragrobesSoon afterwards the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings and he saw discarded blankets here and thereHe asked the monks Whose are these discarded blanketsThe monks told the BuddhaSoon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then monks I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasonsfor the wellbeing of the Sangha for the comfort of the Sangha for the restraint of bad people for the ease of wellbehaved monks for the

tonicsAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time Venerable Pilindavaccha wanting to build a shelter was having a hillside cleared near RājagahaOn that occasion King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha went to Pilindavaccha bowed sat down and said Venerable Elder what are you having madeIm clearing the hillside great king because I want to build a shelterDo you need a monastery workerThe Buddha hasnt allowed monastery workersWell then Sir please ask the Buddha and tell me the outcomeYes great kingAnd Pilindavaccha instructed inspired and gladdened King Bimbisāra with a teachingafter which the king got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated Pilindavaccha with his right side toward him and leftSoon afterwards Pilindavaccha sent a message to the BuddhaVenerable Sir King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wishes to provide a monastery workerWhat should I doThe Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks I allow monastery workersOnce again King Bimbisāra went to Pilindavaccha bowed sat down and saidVenerable has the Buddha allowed monastery workersYes great kingWell then Ill provide you with a monastery workerBut after making this promise he forgot and only remembered after a long time He then addressed the official in charge of all practical affairs Listen has the monastery worker I promised been providedNo sir he hasntHow long is it since we made that promiseThe official counted the days and said Its five hundred daysWell then provide him with five hundred monastery workersThe official provided Pilindavaccha with five hundred monastery workers and a separate village was establishedThey called it The Monastery Workers Village and Pilinda VillageAnd Pilindavaccha began associating with the families in that villageAfter robing up one morning he took his bowl and robe and entered Pilinda Village for almsfoodAt that time they were holding a celebration in that village and the children were dressed up with ornaments and garlandsAs Pilindavaccha was walking on continuous almsround he came to the house of a certain monastery worker where he sat down on a prepared seatJust then the daughter of the house had seen the other children dressed up in ornaments and garlands and she cried Give me a garland Give me ornamentsPilindavaccha asked her mother why the girl was cryingShe told him adding How can poor people like us afford garlands and ornamentsPilindavaccha took a roll of grass and said to the mother Here place this pad of grass on the girls headShe did and it turned into a beautiful golden garlandEven the royal compound had nothing like itPeople told King Bimbisāra In the house of a particular monastery worker theres a beautiful golden garlandEven in your court sir theres nothing like itSo how did those poor people get itNo doubt it was taken by theftAnd King Bimbisāra had that family imprisonedOnce again Pilindavaccha robed up in the morning took his bowl and robe and entered Pilinda Village for almsfoodAs he was walking on continuous almsround he came to the house of that monastery worker And he asked the neighbors Where is the family of this monastery workerVenerable the king had them imprisoned because of that golden garlandPilindavaccha then went to King Bimbisāras house and sat down on a prepared seatKing Bimbisāra approached Pilindavaccha bowed and sat downAnd Pilindavaccha said Great king why have you had the family of that monastery worker imprisonedSir in the house of that monastery worker there was a beautiful golden garlandEven the royal compound has nothing like itSo how did those poor people get itNo doubt it was taken by theftPilindavaccha then focused his mind on turning King Bimbisāras stilt house into goldAs a result the whole house became goldAnd he said Great king how did you get so much goldUnderstood Sir this is your supernormal powerAnd he released that familyPeople were saying It seems Venerable Pilindavaccha has performed a superhuman feat a wonder of supernormal power for the king and his courtBeing delighted and gaining confidence in Pilindavaccha they brought him the five tonics ghee butter oil honey and syrupOrdinarily too Pilindavaccha was getting these five tonicsSince he was getting so much he gave it away to his followersAs a consequence his followers acquired an abundance of tonicsAfter filling up basins and waterpots and setting these aside they filled their water filters and bags and hung these in the windowsThe tonics were dripping all over and the dwellings became infested with ratsWhen people walking about the dwellings saw this they complained and criticized themThese Sakyan ascetics are hoarding goods indoors just like King Seniya Bimbisāra of MagadhaThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monksHow can these monks choose to live in such abundanceAfter rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that some monks are living like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them How can those foolish men choose to live in such abundanceThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisAfter being received the tonics allowable for sick monksthat is ghee butter
