This is a subtle affair because such alluring pleasures are really only concerned with lust sexual desire and cravingThese instigate the mind to swerve out through the five senses after delightful objects remembered from beforeLong past impressions  whether good or bad  are conjured up which we deludedly grasp at and sink ourselves in anguish and total sorrowTo understand these myriad diseasecarrying germs within yourself is difficultAlthough you may well discern and dispose of some of the more external problems overall its of little helpWherever they are concentrated together this master problem is stubborn and determined to remain master however much you may try to overcome itRemember that if your mindfulness and wisdom arent yet strong enough the battle will also upset the basic calmness of mindDhamma practice requires a careful balancing  neither too tense nor too slack  so that you always strive with the appropriate response which is the Middle WayYou will have to notice in yourself the state of mind that is controlled by mindfulness and wisdom and constantly support and sustain it with diligent attentionThis allows calm and stability to arise for longer periods until you become intimately acquainted with itAt times you will recognize the need to put on extra pressure to force the results because even though it may be hard to do you cant just give up halfheartedlyWeakness means theres no way to stop the mind drifting back into its old wilful ways so you must apply force strong mindfulness and wisdom vigorous exertion to the point of sacrificing life if need beWhen the time comes to battle it out youll have steadfastly to fight on sometimes using a vow to fortify your resolve until you can vanquish the minds stubborn obsession with coarse pleasure and desire for thingsOtherwise the mind scrambles distractedly after whatever attracts and lures it through the sensesUnable to resist it becomes increasingly frantic and agitatedThe easygoing acceptance of whatever comes up means that when it is desire that arises you go overboard for itThis then becomes a habitual attitude of giving free rein to your desires because the defilements now know your weak spot and will continually tempt and provoke youIts like breaking an addiction to betel nut and cigarettes or indulgence in meat eatingEven though its on a very coarse level such habits are still very difficult to break because craving constantly waits for its chance to tempt youJust a little bit it invites it doesnt really matter just a taste They entice like the bait on the hook for as soon as the fish is bold enough to take one nibble and then another its sure to be caughtSo whenever we fall for a pleasant taste the defilements are waiting to draw in the line while we struggle helplessly impaled on the baited hookYou must realize that the overcoming of the defilements isnt a trivial affair but requires steadfast practiceWeakness wont do but you must also consider and gauge your strength in this battle because the defilements have the power of a demon yet lie hidden deep within your personalityHow can you harass them to force them outIn some cases for instance in breaking an addiction you can have a fullblooded fight and complete victory without also killing yourself in the processBut an all out battle isnt always called for  especially in those deeper more refined aspects that require a more subtle gradual approach and need careful thinking outYou must learn how steadily to undermine the defilements roots so that they gradually weakenWhen your base of mindfulness and wisdom is strong enough youll then be able to turn the tide against themHowever if you still find yourself outmanoeuvred youll need carefully to analyze the situationOtherwise the defilements will frustrate your every effort for when they decide they want something theyll brush mindfulness and wisdom aside and insist I must have thatI wont listen to any objectionsThey really are that stubbornSo this isnt a trifling matterIts as if you are face to face with your enemy confronted by a maneater of a wild beastWhat will you doThis confrontation with the defilements needs very careful handlingIf they should appear right before your eyes are your mindfulness and wisdom sufficient to counter themThis is the horde of the enemy come to offer battle to burn and destroyHow should we handle themWhat stratagem can we use to overcome them right there and thenConfronted with bodily or mental pain or worse still with desired bodily or mental pleasure  what to doThe pleasant feeling is a much more treacherous affliction because of its insidious ability to mislead us without our even realizing itBut you can be sure that nobody is seduced by unpleasant feeling because its just too painfulSo how can you find in this present existing confrontation a means of disengaging yourself from both the pleasant and the unpleasantIts not a matter of practicing and accepting the pleasant but rejecting the painfulIts not like that at allYou must see through to both characteristics and realize that both pleasure and pain are impermanent and therefore unsatisfactoryIf you dont discern this you will fall for the deception of craving that is only interested in pleasure whether its of the fleshly variety or whateverIn every posture isnt there always an obsession with finding pleasureBy trying to lose yourself in pleasure with its multifarious forms  it doesnt matter what as long as it gives only pleasure  youll fall unaware into the mire of sufferingYoull be stuck there because of a lack of investigation into impermanence suffering and notselfYou will be deceived into welcoming bodily and mental pleasure as beneficial whereas on careful examination they are found to be sufferingBy understanding all of this youll start really to comprehend the truth of impermanenceWhen the mind no longer continually insists on pleasure your suffering and anguish will lightenFurthermore youll see that in reality there is no pleasure to grasp hold of anyway  but only sufferingYour grasping should therefore start to come under controlWhen we have chanted the scriptures together it has been about this r pa vedanaa sanyaa  form feeling perception are all sufferingYet you still fail to penetrate to the truth of this within yourself  which is made up of just these thingsWithout a new perspective on true knowledge you must fall into delusion trying to attain pleasure always pleasureWhen in fact all you get is sufferingYou shut your eyes and ears and refuse to understand anythingIf you really did understand the mind would become much more peaceful calming down from its wild chasings after nonexistent pleasuresCraving is an initiative that startles and frantically agitates the mindIt arises from the desire for pleasure so you will have to investigate to see that such pleasure doesnt really exist that the natural state is one of suffering and that it isnt me or mineYou will need to analyze and differentiateFirst take the integrated body apart into its separate elements without allowing any of them to be seized on as being me or mineContinually go over and over it in this way until you realize its truthThe same idea is contained in the Recollection of Using the Requisites of Life that we chant togetherIf we dont analyze and understand this properly then we must fall into the delusion of loving and pining after this body  its me its mine We repeatedly seize upon it without quite realizing what were doing even though Dhamma teaching is ready and waiting and completeWe may have tried in a cursory way to consider it all yet only achieved a very vague understanding that tended to wander away into distractionSuch investigation does not penetrate because the mind has no foundation and is not based in calmThe mind chases after and fabricates various agitating concerns yet never catches anything of real importanceIts like a halfblind man seeing a blur and managing as time flies by just to snatch the odd idea or twoThose who are unconcerned with pursuing Dhamma who are indifferent about what is right and wrong remain unquestioning and have no uncertainty or doubtThey are enveloped in the darkness of ignoranceWhen you start to examine Dhamma any points not yet fully understood must naturally arise as doubts or queries Whats thisHow should I understand thatHow can I dispose of thisThese questions need to be taken up and worked atIf you dont it plainly shows your lack of mindfulness and wisdomHowever a cursory investigation picking it up and then leaving it unfinished means you will never be able to penetrate to the root principles of practiceYoull know a little  and thats allWith mindfulness and wisdom still underdeveloped and an exertion effort thats inadequate you will lack the courage to penetrate into the Noble TruthTrying to estimate for oneself about whats right in ones practice may become selfdeception which will then make it impossible to overcome sufferingIf you happen to understand something dont go out and brag about it or else it will turn and befuddle you in many inextricable waysWise people and sages have always been careful to press on with their investigations  even if they really have gained some insight  never getting stuck and satisfied with their present level of practiceThey never boast about their accomplishments for that would surely be the mark of a foolThe clever person constantly searches out the obstacles ahead which are always more subtle than those already overcomeThey never rest content with the present lucidity but always want to penetrate furtherWith the defilements still burning and scorching one how can one afford to stop to brag of such and such an achievement  even if it might be a genuine insightWithout a firm foundation youll always need to be careful and cautious about thisIn your investigations with mindfulness and wisdom its the danger of carelessness and heedlessness that takes on the greatest significanceOnly when heedful can you reckon to keep abreast with your lifes span the term of which is always ebbing awayBut what exactly is this heedfulness this avoidance of negligenceThis is the vital questionIf you remain ignorant of it however much tranquillity you may gain  by guarding the sense doors for instance  will eventually falter and youre back with the old turmoilBe carefulThe defilements will provoke and force you to speak and bray they wont allow you to keep your mouth closed and quietWithout understanding the underlying intentions and basic situation you will only deceive yourself and end up going the rounds bragging of your past attainments I attained calm for so many yearsIts a deceiving of both yourself and othersFor in reality you are still in bondage to stupidity following the dictates of the defilements within yourself without even realizing itThen if anyone should offer praise the ears prick up and you puff yourself outInstead of explaining about suffering and the harm of the defilements that you have managed to understand you just boast about yourselfYou cant just bumble foolishly along for this Way demands the alertness of mindfulness and wisdomAfter proper examination youll find theres nothing to be idly amused and preoccupied about that both externally and internally its all really one great deceptionIts like being alone in midocean with no island or shore in sightCan you now afford just to sit back and relax or make a temporary show of effort and then boast about itOf course notWhen a persons investigation penetrates through to ever more subtle levels of mind they will steadily become both calmer and more reserved as wellThis is comparable to the increasing knowledge and mature circumspection of the child as it develops to become a teenager and then an adultMindfulness and wisdom must be continually developed in this way so that you can discern in whatever arises what is right or wrong true or falseThis will enable you to relinquish and let go of it allAttaining to this true Dhamma practice will make your path through life smooth and evenOtherwise youll fall into boasting of temporary success in techniques of tranquillity practice and eventually find yourself in even greater distressThis is where the defilements proliferate and one plunges headlong into their conflagrationYoull elevate your head into a mass of internal fireUse the torch of mindfulness and wisdom to neutralize and extinguish the blaze of the defilements that sears your mindDo so with an increasing faith in your own efforts Dont allow the defilements a chance to insinuate their command post with its various stratagemsYou must be alert and equal to themBe circumspect  dont fall for themWhatever rationale they come up with can only succeed when your mindfulness and wisdom are deficientThe defilements lead you away by the nose openly scorching you with their fire yet you are still able to open your mouth to brag and boastTurn and inspect this in yourselfCheck every aspect because right and wrong truth and falsity are all withinIts not a matter of external observationsAny external damage is nothing compared to the internal hurt from the defilements blazeWhen I myself raises its head if you are not wholeheartedly committed to Dhamma practice theres no way you can overcome sufferingA little knowledge a little renunciation cant get to the root problem that lies buried deep downThis must be dug outIts not just a matter of resting easy after some temporary and superficial successThis wont do because the defilements lie deep in the basis of personality which can only be searched out with the delicate but thorough examination of mindfulness and wisdomOtherwise if you stay on the coarse level you can practice until your body lies rotting in its coffin but it wont have affected the basic personality problemAnyone with a careful and scrupulous manner of practice is able to see their own deficiencies and faults of characterThey will need to control and overturn pride in all its aspects not allowing it to act big to become inflatedHowever the actual elimination of this disease isnt so easyFor those who havent persevered with a rigorous enough selfinspection the process may actually only increase their conceit their bragging and teachingYet should they turn within and discern the conceit and deceit of self a profound feeling of weariness and sadness will ariseOne will pity oneself for the stupidity of such self deceptionSo you must set yourself to battle onHowever much pain however many tears  persevereDont be only concerned with pleasure seekingDetermine that Come what may I will keep on with my striving with my practice of chastity throughout this lifeDont grumble about the first small difficulty that Its a waste of timeIm quite content with giving in to the defilements And then quit the taskYou must take just the opposite stanceWhen temptations and provocations to grab this take a lot of that arise  dont indulge dont takeHowever marvellous it seems give a firm refusal I dont want it This is the only way to withstand the snares and deceptions of the defilementsThey scare and trick in every manner of ways so that even if you get wise to one stratagem they simply change to another and anotherAcknowledge the situationI have been continually and variously deceived by the wiles of the defilements and Im still ignorant of the truth inside myselfOther people may fool me a little but the defilements do so all the timeI fall for them and follow them the whole wayMy trust in the Lord Buddha is nothing compared to my belief in these defilementsIm a disciple of the demons of desire passively allowing myself to be led ever deeper into their jungle wildernessIf you cant see this for yourself then you really are out there lost and being burned alive among the corpses of that jungle charnel groundThere the demons forever spit and roast you with desires and every form of distressThough you may have come to stay in a place void of distractions these demons are still at work persuading tempting and trying to draw you awayJust notice how the saliva flows when you come across any delicious objectSo you must make the decision to be either a warrior or a victim and in your practice to struggle to overcome this horde of defilements and desiresBe always on your guard no matter which way they enter to seduce and deceive youNobody else can come in to lead you away but the demons of your own desires can and do so with relishYou must break this bondage through scrupulous attention and examination of yourself and thereby attain freedomStrenuously develop your mindfulness and wisdom gaining insight and letting go of everything until all your suffering is extinguishedToday I wish to comment on the principles of Dhamma practice because when applied properly they steadily offer insight into the truth and falseness within oneselfThis is valued highly because all of us must come to see in ourselves the Truths of Suffering its Origin its Cessation and the Way Leading to its CessationWhoever remains totally ignorant of this falls into the suffering of the worldEven though they may reside in a monastery they wont gain any benefit from their vocationIts the same for those who live at home all they possess there are precepts because lack of true understanding means their practice will tend to wander away towards worldly pleasures and finally sufferingThe practice of investigation must continue until one comprehends suffering and its origin the power base of defilements in the mindThe steady elimination of these defilements is truly the Supreme WayThose who dont practice at all are left behind blind and ignorant in the midst of defilementsThey are led unaware into suffering and unless they find Dhamma and the way of practice they are doomed to birth and death making kamma for their next round of sufferingWhen you catch sight  through your practice  of what suffering is really about you will strive to overcome it and never again be heedless of the dangerThis means a constant struggle for victory always cutting away at your faults until arriving at the more subtle aspects of suffering craving and defilementA deep probing and a delicate examination are required while a mere superficial inspection proves inadequateTherefore the mind must be firmly established with mindfulness and focused inwards without any outside distractionsWhen you do turn within you will be able to see the truth of suffering and its origin craving and the defilementsYou will then know their features and traits and be able to destroy themTruly speaking Dhamma practice is only concerned with one thing it all comes down to suffering and its originThis is the central pivotal point in human life and even all the animals are in this same predicamentIgnorance and wrong view insinuate a propensity to grab and consume every sort of thing but right view will clearly reveal the truth of suffering and its originYou can also think of it in terms of fixing attention on seeing the truth for without fixing on suffering you can only remain ignorantThe unsecured mind will always tend to drift away following and becoming absorbed in emotional objectsTherefore when you try to focus attention on Dhamma the mind  which has been habitually allowed to wander away  may well resist and struggleYou must then rely on repeated effort to secure the mind until you realize the way to tame it and bring it back under constant controlIt then becomes easier because the mind no longer tends towards distractionHowever stubborn a problem it may have appeared at first it can now always be tamed and brought back to calmBut never underestimate the strength of the defilementsShould the mind prove intractable you must apply maximum effort to seek out the reasons why it wont calm downA halfhearted approach wont succeed for it needs a fight to the death attitudeIf your only concern is for pleasure and comfort then be assured you will never gain release from the domination of the defilementsThe mastery of the defilements envelops the whole of the basic personality structure making it formidably hard for anyone to find out the truth about themselvesA mere smattering of knowledge certainly wont stop you from going astrayYoull thereby abandon the quest and involve yourself in various excursions without recognizing the vital importance of Dhamma practiceYoull no longer bother to be strict and vigorous in the Dhamma work but instead will absorb yourself in grabbing things under the defilements directionBy weakly groping along like this the clear seeing of suffering is made all the more difficult by allowing the mind to abscondIt is concerned only with swallowing the defilements baitWhen the defilements announce their slight discomfort you will quickly pander to them and take the lureYou neither appreciate the power and mastery of craving as it swerves away after sights tastes smells and sounds nor the resulting harm of such obsessionsThis ceaseless activity means you will never be able to bring the mind to stillnessIt leaves one squarely sunk in suffering even though you may try to shut your eyes to it allThrough Dhamma practice one gradually realizes ones situation and this conveys a steady easing of the suffering  as long as you arent heedlessWhereas before you were always defeated and burned now you prevail by turning the flame of mindfulness and wisdom back onto the defilementsSo abandon your delinquent and heedless ways and realize for yourself the benefits of DhammaWhen you take Dhamma to heart it will keep the practice progressing but inadequate effort will only reap you more and more miseryResolve to practice until your final breathDont be feeble and easily led astrayThose with mindfulness and wisdom will understand this advice but those deficient and unpracticed will instead swallow the defilements luresRather than surmounting suffering their practice will then regress to its former stateTheir attempt at skillfulness will mutate  through delusion  to become suffering and unskillfulnessThey will criticize Dhamma practice as being futile and badIf such a person submits to the defilements Dhamma practice becomes impossibleThe practice of Dhamma involves great struggle and enduranceIts comparable to rowing against the current for one needs great exertion to succeedGoing counter to the defilements is just as demanding for theyre always waiting their chance to drag one down to a lower levelIf you arent alert and dont utilize the Lord Buddhas Dhamma in examining yourself your strength will failThis is because mindfulness and wisdom remain weak and vacillating especially when compared to the strength of the defilementsIf you go over and combine with these tempters and agitators you will be led wildly astray into turbulent obsessionsDhamma practice is then a going against the current of suffering  because suffering is the crux of the problemThis is where you must focus your practice because its only by actually seeing suffering that you will be drawn to discover its root sourceWisdom will then be able to track down exactly where suffering springs fromFor those with mindfulness and wisdom the arising of suffering is taken as the ideal opportunity to search out its original source  to be able cut it off thereSuch investigation proceeds on many levels from the coarse to the refinedIt therefore also requires consultation and advice so that you wont stumbleOtherwise you might fancy that you can figure it all out in your headAnd that wont do at allThere are many principles of Dhamma that the Lord Buddha left for our examinationHowever its not mandatory to learn about every one of themTaking up just some of the more important schemes such as the five aggregates or nameandform will be of much valueHowever it does require a rigorous allround examination not just an occasional probeThis will lead to the arising of a feeling of weariness with the whole situation so that the shackles of lust are loosenedAlertly guarding the sensedoors with tight supervision will enable mindfulness to outdo any lapses into negligenceWhether talking acting or thinking be aware of whatever leads you into errorThis persistent sustaining of mindfulness must continue with resolution for it is the way to end your sufferingMindfulness and wisdom stay retarded because the concern and interest in you are still not sensitive and subtle enoughThe more refined and circumspect you become the more mindfulness and wisdom are strengthenedSo the Lord Buddha said Develop yourselves fullyMake mindfulness strong in the mindThe development of your practice through daily tasks follows on from the examination and control of the mindThis will become evident in its accomplishments and benefits whether great or smallIncrease your effort and dont be so easily disheartenedDont forfeit such a golden opportunity for your life is steadily dwindling and ebbing awayThe development of mindfulness and wisdom leads on to Dhamma maturityHowever if your defilements are gross and your wisdom coarse you will have to take extra special care when you arrive at old age  and that eventually comes to us allSo grasp this moment to develop the faculties of faith energy mindfulness samadhi and wisdom all in balance togetherKeep up a steadfast scrutiny and investigation and youll find that the temptations of the world have lost their appealWhen you can see them as poisoned bait the longing for worldly gains will ceaseDhamma then becomes the refuge and beacon of your lifeWith this assurance in yourself you can only stride forward without any slipping back while any uncertainty about the merit of Dhamma practice will make you waver and turn astraySo be very careful that you arent pulled away towards the chasm and pit of fireIf you cant free yourself you will be tugged at from every direction because the basic game plan is the tendency to be dragged downBut for those who are more circumspect and have enough mindfulness and wisdom to discern suffering theres no more falling away and no more worldly hardships to endureYou will then feel a weariness and distaste for lust and the temptations of the world will lose their color and attractivenessYour Dhamma practice will shake off whatever misled you into grasping at alluring objectsYou will recognize that death may come soon  it isnt so very far away  and then therell be no concern for owning or supervising worldly treasures however vastWith such realization a great disenchantment and coolness towards worldly pleasures will arise and they will lose all their lusterThey will no longer be cherished and esteemed however whenever required for Dhamma they may still be of useYour ardour cools downAfter all even this body that is perceived as me and mine is steadily wearing out and falling apartDefilement and desire stand ready with their troublemaking for any lapse into careless abandonThey then stab and punch through with the suffering involved in nameandform and the five aggregatesWhen your investigation really penetrates the gross external concerns about good and bad people or things are all swept awayYour attention is then wholly fixed on insight to destroy this eminent self this conceit of selfExternal affairs fade in importance because the vital concern is the penetration to lucidity within where the bright light arisesThis bright clarity of insight isnt the same as common or ordinary lightYou must know it for yourself otherwise it evades descriptionMindfulness and wisdom will cleanse the mind ejecting renouncing eliminating and liberating according to their abilityAny lack of mindfulness and wisdom with its scrutiny and renunciation leaves one surrounded by internal darkness  a gloom permeated with fireThe defilements conceal their poisonous fuel so that the internal fires always blaze fiercely  what can be more terrifying than thisEven though this conflagration may lack substance as soon as there is contact with objects it flares upThe bombs dropped on people are nothing compared to the three bombs of lust hatred and delusionThese are perpetually tearing the mind apart whereas an air raid brings death in just the one lifetimeBut until there is practice of Dhamma you wont be able to comprehend the gravity of the situation which is like a slow roasting of the mind by the defilements whenever there is contactTo catch sight of the defilements cunning agility so that one can destroy them requires proper tools and careful attention to avoid heedlessnessThose who stay and practice here without the concerns and involvements of the world will find they can progress relatively quicklyDepending on the proficiency of mindfulness and wisdom they will be able to refine their investigation and reduce sufferingEach one of you will know for yourself the extent to which a life dedicated to Dhamma practice is advancing towards the end of sufferingPeople who can never find any free time to come and rest here and those who come but dont truly leave their worldly concerns behind will be lost in a fog of diversions and preoccupationsThey often like to claim It doesnt matter where you practiceOne can practice anywhere This is really just hot airIn actual fact their practice is stuck in the groove of the defilementsYet they still manage to brag about being able to practice anywhere at allOne might remark that their mind and mouth are out of alignmentTheir mind though seething under the attack and heat of defilements and craving isnt aware of their predicamentIts as if something lives in filth and prefers to exist and die in that filthThose people whose mindfulness and wisdom remain quite coarse will quite happily play about in the mire of their sullied mindsThose with a more mature and penetrating mindfulness and wisdom will feel disgust at such filthAs ones insight grows so this feeling of revulsion deepens and intensifiesOne then sees the danger in preoccupations delusions and desire because theyre entirely concerned with sufferingOne sees that its all a matter of impermanence suffering and notselfThen the questions What do I want from lifeWhat was I born for ariseThose who are ignorant answer My life is for acquiring money and things to get rich But that sort of life is the same as falling into hellAnyone who understands the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha realizes that theres absolutely nothing that is worth wishing for or concerning oneself withEverything ought to be relinquished and releasedThose who are still attached to the five aggregates thinking they are my self must investigate to see that each of them really embraces sufferingAlternatively in a more condensed format they should realize that nameandform is suffering or even more broadly that body and mind are sufferingWhen you can see all of this from the coarse to the subtle level you will be able to rise above pleasure and pain for both are then given upHowever without a full understanding you will still yearn for pleasure and the more you desire the more you will sufferThis also applies to any attachment based in the peace and happiness arising from tranquillitymeditationThis then becomes almost like an addictionOne craves and must consume the narcotic that one considers is able to bring one pleasureInsight into the nature of the continual craving and its concomitant suffering never occurs to the addictThey want and they get the drug and think themselves very happy and contentedThe feature that continually foils the addicts bid to break their habit is that after taking the drug they feel quite contentThus it is with sensual desire it is sated only to flare up again when the briefly assuaged appetite returnsPeople think that the gratification of an intense longing brings even greater pleasure without realizing the inherent danger and suffering it involvesSuch is the state of those with weak wisdom and gross defilementsThey dont see the turmoil of desire as suffering and instead of extinguishing it they try to allay it by taking poisonThis poison is the pandering to the craving so that its briefly gratified then having to do it again and again and again until one is stupefied and deludedA person with mindfulness and wisdom focuses on the question Why must I repeatedly indulge my desiresThey realize that its the craving itself that must be attacked because by overcoming this one element they will not only escape the frantic effort to satisfy the craving but will also do away with future desireThis is the way that enables one to transcend sufferingHowever the obsession with the pleasure taken in consuming things makes the disowning of such desire an arduous taskAll one knows about is how to feed on the bait and this makes one afraid to forgo and stopIts the dread of the addict not getting his drug or on another level the meateater not being able to give up their attachment to tastesIts all a matter of being a save to desireIf you cant overcome such gross cravings how can you ever deal with the much more subtle longings rotting within yourselfWith just a little persuasion off you go swallowing the coarsest of baits fussily arranging it to suit and satisfyYoull notice neither your exhaustion nor comprehend that the source of all the terrible suffering that deludes and dominates all creatures in the world is found right here in this processEven though the Lord Buddhas Teaching sets out the most appropriate way to investigate and meditate to get to the root of all this you ignore it and continue to swallow the baitStaying immersed in pleasure you can only apply yourself to follow defilements and desireOur practice here is concerned with going against the current of craving and the deviating mindIt means a multifaceted supervision together with restraint regarding any sensecontacts  sight sound smell or taste for exampleSuch contacts arise to lure and obsess one into liking some object and then swiftly tiring of it racing frantically after something elseContinuing on in this way can only lead to complete agitationThe malignancies in the mind are many and if you dont know how to curb and eliminate them you cant help but fall under their menacing powerThose who have seen the nature of suffering will make it a life and death struggleJust as the Lord Buddha did when he was prepared to give his life to overcome sufferingDont think its something that can be done with ease and leisureIn each of his lives the futureBuddha had to endure hardship and suffering to help himself and othersWe too must be willing to sacrifice all possessions and wealth however greatIt just cant be done in comfortDhamma practice is a battle and struggle and whoever endures and perseveres will gain success and peerless victoryThis supreme victory means that any problem can be examined and then resolvedSo please keep on tryingIts not a matter of gaining some limited success and then turning away to something else for after every successful encounter mindfulness and wisdom will be strengthenedSo you must be on your guard and inspect whatever arises through the sense doors  the eyes ears nose tongue body and mindWith application your mindfulness will become sharper and more penetrating and you will start to understand about releasing and extinguishingIts similar to grasping a live glowing coal and perceiving its heat  and therefore quickly releasing itDhamma practice is of supreme worth but victory over the might of the defilements is arduous and should never be underestimatedTherefore strenuously apply yourself to reinforcing mindfulness and wisdom and the defilements will correspondingly lose their potencyThis is called progress in Dhamma because its the quenching of the suffering withinSo while you still have life and strength apply it all to this taskThe Lord Buddha declared Whatever is still unclear make it clear whatever is not penetrated pierce it through whatever is not complete finish it offSo dont be feeble and vacillating always making excusesThe leavinghome for ordination is also considered a sacrificeIn the Lord Buddhas time people from every level of the householders life  royalty the very wealthy the middle class ordinary citizens  went forth cutting themselves off from home and family and entering the Lord Buddhas clan with no returnHe said that the fallingback into the former petty life was badThe Lord Buddhas only concern was earnestly to pull people out of sufferingSo if we want to escape we must follow his example cutting away worry and concern for former relatives by entering the lineage of the Lord BuddhaThis life and practice under the Lord Buddhas discipline is truly the supreme way and refugeThose who follow the principles and discipline of Dhamma will pledge their life to the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaEven those who have only managed an occasional taste of its resulting peace without penetrating to the whole truth will make their commitmentThey realize that there is no alternative way that leads to freedom from sufferingWhen their mindfulness and wisdom become more penetrating they will see that on this shore there is only anguish with a neverending circle of birth and deathThey then become determined to cross to the farther shore making unceasing effort to renounce selfThere is nothing mysterious about this crossing over to the farther shoreBut first you must give up the view of self in the five aggregates by investigating to see them all as suffering  none of them are me or mineFocus on not grasping or holdingThe Lord Buddha once spoke of the past as below the future as above and the present as in the middleHe also said that unskillfulness was below skillfulness was above and neutrality a was in the middleTo each of these characteristics he said Dont grasp themYou should not even grasp at what you think is Nibbana the farther shoreConsider the scope of the true realization of non attachment concerning any objectThose of you who cant fathom why even Nibbana isnt to be grasped at must reflect on this Nothing must be either grasped or heldThis is set down as a Dhamma principle and is really the perfect summary of them allDetermined things and nondetermined things submit to all things are notselfThey should not be grasped and heldThis summarizes the whole matter including the investigation to see the Dhamma Truth in both the world and in the TeachingOnes mindfulness and wisdom need to see through the world penetrating from determined things to the nondetermined from the worldly to the worldtranscendingYet this is all concerned with whats inside oneself and not with anything externalThis insight into the essence of Dhamma requires a deep and profound understandingThen its just a matter of releasing and letting goThe dictum Dont grasp will suffice throughout your practice from beginning to endBy not holding to me or mine it can be said that you are truly following the Lord Buddhas Way and will eventually win through to the complete cessation of all sufferingThen mindfulness and wisdom will penetrate throughout without attachment to matter feeling perception conditions and consciousnessThe Lord Buddha explained about ignorance about delusion concerning form about craving that arises in the mind making it agitated and about kamma the action that seeks to obtain what is desiredWhen you perceive this your practice will be correctly aimed at eliminating desire and understanding yourself in both body and mindThis needs a repeated examination to stop the concern and obsession with external thingsThe deeper your understanding the more pathetic such desires appearThey are simply not worth the total absorption they demandSuch exuberant distractions originated in ignorance resulting in a continued raving about people or involvements in the myriad thingsYour talk becomes pervaded with worldly concerns this is good that is bad she is good he is bad In such a condition you wont be able to see either the affliction of desire or the defilements within yourselfThe Lord Buddha resolved Mogharajas Problem by advising him to see the world as empty as notself as being composed of elements and aggregatesThe aggregates must be stripped away and concepts and assumptions such as person or animal must be disestablishedThe elements aggregates sense bases and concepts need to be all exposed so that theres no more grasping at themWhat remains is the Deathless DhammaThis is without birth or death and is also called the WorldTranscending Dhamma or NibbaanaThere are many names but they all essentially refer to the same thingWhen mundane things are spurned the result is the Transcendent Dhamma the NonDetermined Dhamma Pure DhammaJust consider the runningon the coursingon from birth to death from death to birth in the different realms of existenceThen decide if Nibbana is really worth attainingOn that farther shore theres no suffering no birth or death because the King of Death cant reach thereYet because we cant fathom this out we persist in repeatedly choosing to be born on this nether shore amidst its endless sufferingWith true understanding about suffering your course will become firmly set straight for the farther shore where all desires and defilements are extinguishedInsight allows the penetration to see the common characteristics of impermanence suffering and notself in the aggregatesThose with mindfulness and wisdom must concentrate on annihilating the defilements for should its germ remain it will lead to renewed sufferingTherefore steadily investigate release and eliminate  this is certainly the right way to proceedBut do you care about any of thisIts not as if theres some mystery involved every one of you whether woman or man can come to accomplish itSo develop yourselves through right moral behavior through calming and stabilizing the mind and through mindfulness and wisdomThen you will realize its true worthThe stupid person enjoys dismissing Dhamma with Why should I botherSuch a person can neither safeguard precepts nor bring the mind to calm and they turn away from that greatest of all tasks the resolute striving to end sufferingIt is these people who are crazily rushing around snatching and consuming competing together until they all lie rotting in their coffinsExactly where is the value in any of thisWeve gone astray for far too long already our lives almost spent after spanning the yearsIt doesnt matter which generation you come fromThe air you breathe isnt just for your convenience and comfort but for you to learn about suffering and the way to extinguish your sufferingDont imagine that your family and relatives are anything fundamental  you are aloneYou came alone and youll go aloneIts the same for all of usOnly when there isnt any self to go is Dhammainsight achievableIf there is still a self to be born then you are stuck in the orbit of sufferingSo its up to each one of you to investigate for a way of escapeThose who trust in the Lord Buddha will have to go the same Dhamma wayThose who would rather count on the demons and defilements will thrust themselves down into the mireThey may then try to bully and be assertive but their only gain will be more sufferingTrue understanding on the other hand leads to a profound weariness and a loosening of the bonds of lustHowever if people appear to understand while still going out following after desires then they truly are a disciple of the demonsThey declare a weariness and fatigue with it all but really their mind isnt at all tired and finds it still very attractiveIt still wants to get to have to possessYet insight can still arise through selfinspection of mind and then the stupidity and delusion start to diminishThey will come to their senses from misguided delusions and will realize the foolishness of selfpraise and conceitThis is the way steadily to rid oneself of such follyYour investigations must always be directed within As selfinspection steadily becomes increasingly subtle and penetrating your investigations must always be directed withinIts not concerned with expert knowledge in external affairs but with the seeing within yourself of all thats impermanent suffering and notselfIgnorance stands as the source of any misguided attraction but youve already closed your eyes and ears and even tried to show off your presumed knowledgeYou wont be able to blame anyone else though for youll see that its all due to your own foolishnessThis means that you must strive to clear up such backwardness before you dieDont waste your breath in gratifying desires to get to be and generally to make merryFor this is being possessed by the demons of the defilements with their multifarious mania to procure and become great and famousFocusing on this conceit will subdue it and it will then withdraw until its death for youll start to realize that more conceit means more sufferingWhen your practice spins fully within yourself you will be able steadily to clean out the defilements and find your reward in the emptied mindBut if you continue to connive with the conceits they will sweep away any Dhamma virtue you may haveThen only the demons will keep you company for its only when they are all driven out that their antithesis the virtuous ones will enter inTurmoil and unrest are the manifestations of your possession by demons while freedom serenity and peace demonstrate your fellowship with the virtuousWill all of you please go and check how many of these demons have been driven outIs the situation improvingWhen they show their faces point your finger at them and accuse them of being demons and devils come to eat your heart and drink your bloodPreviously youve allowed them in but now you can stop them and reduce your sufferingThe former bloated self shrivels as the demons lose their powerConceit of self withers awayIts like administering antitoxin to someone bitten by a rabid dog for by fixing ones attention back on to the disease one eliminates itThe mind is then undisturbed and at peace because the dictum Dont grasp or hold anything has been followed to the final cessation of sufferingThose who practice Dhamma by developing mindfulness and wisdom will come truly to understand the way to extinguish sufferingIf they should ever lapse into heedlessness and grasp on to something their steady training in controlling the mind will quickly notice and check the situationThis in itself is of great benefitThe important point about defilements and suffering is that they lie deep down in the personality structure thus one must probe and examine within oneselfWe are all intimately acquainted with observing external things and should realize that they bring unrest and they clutter the mindWe must therefore aim to achieve a condition of mind characterized by centeredness and a stability of mindfulnessYou should notice in yourself the extent of the minds restraint under various circumstances and whether mindfulness is sustained in every postureHow should we handle the mind as it loses its balance through its habitual tendency to allow thoughts to proliferate out of controlHow can we bring it back under controlYou must realize that the mind without calm is full of endless imaginings and thought fabricationsIt is all aimed at acquiring and obtaining and that this is sufferingYou must continually examine within yourself to see that such things are all impermanent subject to change to arising and ceasing and are sufferingThis must be seen clearly and distinctlyWhen we understand this arising and ceasing  by turning to examine such conditions inside oneself  we will realize that its neither something good nor badIt is just a natural process of arising persisting and ceasingTry to penetrate and see thisThe regular cleansing of the mind will show up any impurity like dirt in an otherwise tidy roomEach moment you should clean out any attachmentWhatever should arise persist and then cease  dont grasp and hold onto itTake this principle of not wanting not grasping deeply to heart for then the mind will be undisturbed and freeThis is such a worthwhile realizationIt doesnt involve extensive knowledge  we just penetrate to see the impermanence in form feeling perception conditions and consciousnessAlternatively you can examine the continually changing emotions within yourself as they arise and ceaseEven if you dont go astray by chasing after these moods perceptions and notions you should still carefully stabilize the mind so that it doesnt grasp after anything  including any memory or thought which may ariseJust concentrate on doing this and you will sweep clean the mind wiping out whatever suffering is presentEvery condition arises and then ceases comes and disappearsDont go and grasp hold of anything thinking its good or bad or taking it as oneselfStop all such thinking and conceptualizingWhen you understand this the mind will calm down of itself it will naturally become freeWhatever thoughts arise see that they just come and will go so dont grasp at themThen theres not much else to doJust carefully scrutinize and detach yourself from any entanglements withinThere are then no fantasies and thought fabrications about the past or futureTheyve all stoppedThings arise and cease  just thatWhen you truly penetrate to see the present with its arisings and ceasings its really no great affair at allWhatever one thinks about will naturally come to a closeBut if you cant foresee its cessation then whatever comes up will be grasped and held plunging you into turmoil and continuing thought proliferationsYou must stop this stream of conceivings and imaginingsCut it offSecure mindfulness and fix your total attention on the mind and the chain of thought and fantasy  which had become an obsession  can be broken and stoppedYou can do this at any time and the mind will always release its hold and become still and freeThis must then be guarded as the normal state of mind by repeatedly keeping the thought proliferations in checkWhenever they run out of control you must be aware of the situation and stop themYou should practice like this until you become skilled until the mind is no longer stuck in its obsessionsTake the driver of a motor car as a modelWhenever he or she wants to stop the brakes can immediately be appliedIts the same with the runaway mind for when mindfulness is in attendance it will brake at onceWhatever the situation with mindfulness firmly established you will be able to stop disengage and free the mindThis is by far the quickest and easiest way to deal with any circumstance that may ariseAny other way is not quick enough to copeThis method of self reflection and selfknowledge is very worthwhile because anyone can apply it at any timeEven right here where there is speaking and listening always bring the mind back to its normal stateBefore we knew anything about all this we allowed the mind to go chasing after concerns and fantasies spinning a web to trap ourselves in all kinds of difficultiesWhatever meditation technique we tried wasnt really able to stop the confused dreamingDont underestimate this method because of its apparent simplicityPlease train yourself to become skillful in its application to combat any emotion that may intrude or any opinion that may interject itselfWhen such opinions and conceits issue forth cry HaltFirst stop and listen to what I have to say But the self and such conceits will immediately counter with their own arguments even before youve finished telling themThis is similar to suddenly encountering a wild animal such as a tiger or poisonous snakeLacking any escape route you will have to stop and radiate lovingkindnessLikewise this will be able to quench the defilements and the self which is ever ready to emerge and show its faceYou must be able to hold back the defilements otherwise they will vastly expand their powerBy enduring and holding them back you will allow mindfulness time to adapt to the situationThen if a halt is called it will be able to stop it all immediately without any resistanceIf you sit in meditation for one hour it must be in order to know the state of the mind with mindfulness not just for pleasureseekingBy realizing the minds condition you can make it firmly established and then you will lose interest in pleasant feelings or desiresEven if painful feeling should arise dont commit your attention to itKeep mindfulness constantly established not allowing the mind to swerve away dependent on what pleases or displeasesDetach yourself from everything for its all just suffering involved with the aggregates which are all impermanentFeeling is impermanent the body is impermanentThats the way it isCraving is characterized by wanting pleasure by being fully satisfied in any pleasurable feeling that arises by abandoning oneself to entrancement with that pleasure and by wanting that pleasure to last as long as possibleBut what about the suffering and pain that stand opposed to itIf one sits a long time the body becomes stiff and painful and the mind becomes agitated as the craving insists one change positionIt suggests one should do this or that but instead you must train yourself to become detached and see it as merely the suffering involved in the aggregatesThen the minds agitation and anxiety will be allayedIf this cant be fully achieved never mind just make sure theres no struggle to change the situationYou must restrain and extinguish the desire and agitationIf the mind is still very agitated and frantic dont change your posture even if it is extremely painfulWait and calmly observe the extent of the pain and catch the right moment to change positionsCarefully straighten out your leg with the mind remaining firmly concentrated and unattachedThis may last for five minutes after which the pain should have subsidedHowever you should remain in complete control of the mind so that ones centeredness is not disturbed by attraction towards the pleasant feeling that has replaced the painThis control needs to be established in all postures and especially when pleasant feeling arises because there will then be a tendency to become entranced by itEven the feeling of equanimity  when theres neither pain nor pleasure  can be entrancing so mindfulness must always be in attendanceYou should realize that in truth feeling is impermanent and sufferingTheres really no happiness involved at allYou will need to examine to see both pleasant and unpleasant feeling in the same lightThis should be repeated until you are no longer enamoured with pleasant feelingOtherwise it will lead to great suffering because craving wants only unalloyed pleasure which simply does not exist in this world of sufferingIf the mind can go beyond pleasure pain and feeling then it is truly going the transcendent wayBut please understand right here that if you havent truly transcended feeling there will still be desire for pleasure and therefore grasping and holding onto sufferingSo this is something you must check out should you consider yourself detached from all feelingYou should thoroughly train yourself to deal with the feeling that arises from bodily painHowever the pleasant feeling stemming from the subtle form of sensual desire isnt so easily understood and you may then take it for happinessYou will want to obtain happiness and this is where craving comes inIts therefore always taught that wanting and lust must be abandoned and given upLust here means wanting only pleasureSatisfaction in lust or dissatisfaction in lust indicate that the mind is helplessly entangled in the tastes of both bodily and mental feelingSometimes bodily feeling can manifest as great pain and anguish and mindfulness should be used to find relief through stopping and detaching from the minds frantic strugglingThen even though the body is upset the mind doesnt follow after itHowever this needs to be practiced first under moderate conditions before the situation becomes criticalIf you eagerly gather up the sensations stemming from the defilements your load of suffering will increase more and moreTo think that its all very comfortable and troublefree is falling into enchantment with feelingDont do itYou must carefully follow through with every type of feeling to see it all as impermanent suffering and notselfIf you can disengage from feeling you will become totally disenchanted with the pleasant feeling involved in the five aggregatesWhen you dont investigate and arent circumspect enough you will fall into desire and pining just notice whether the mind is free or notThe mind entangled and satiated in its desires is obviously dirty and sulliedThis occurs because the mind deludedly grasps after things which brings struggle and extreme agitationIf the mind is still attached to feeling  whether pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant nor unpleasant  it must endure sufferingYou should investigate to see impermanence suffering and notself in both body and mind and not grasp or hold onto anythingWhether looking out or in you will then not be attached to anything and realize that this is indeed freedomThe deeper you penetrate the more you will realize that nonattachment is the overcoming of sufferingThis is the easiest way to end suffering but if you dont properly understand it really is the hardest wayIt is therefore imperative to train and investigate so that you can detach yourself and gain true release from the mind and its graspingThen when you command the mind to stop and detach to release and be free it truly does find freedomThis way of knowing the mind is of the greatest value yet we never seem concerned enough to be as resourceful as possible in ridding ourselves of sufferingWith such a relaxed and intermittent effort you will never understand exactly where and how to remedy to eliminate and relinquishYou will whirl around with attachments and sufferingYou must know how to find your way to the end of suffering and not just sit back taking it easyLook around and use mindfulness and wisdom as the means to free yourself from such conceits as me and mine and from all attachmentsIf you are lacking in mindfulness and wisdom you will never be able to extinguish suffering for each and every defilement is stubborn and difficult to overcomeYou need to understand how each of the sixteen defilements arises although they wont all arise simultaneouslyBy seeing the characteristics of their birth you will then be able to detach yourself from themInitially you must clearly recognize them all as being hot and bothersome When one is discontented this is relatively easy but when one is happy and contented its much more difficultYou have to find the normal state of mind body and speechNormal here means being disinterested and impartial and involves the keeping of pure preceptsIn guarding the sense doors this normality becomes an important indicator of failed vigilance when for example one is being attracted or repelled by an object that contacts the sensesIf you become careless and indulge in desire then its no longer just a small lapse but a very damaging failure that stains ones precepts and virtueThe result is always agitation and distressSo even in apparently minor affairs dont carelessly dismiss any desire as negligible thinking it doesnt matterAlways be mindful with wisdom ready to remedy and eliminateBy assiduous investigation even a very dangerous situation can be relieved and put down and such incidents will then become more and more infrequentThe intermediate defilements such as the five hindrances must be similarly consideredThe first hindrance is sensual desire the satisfaction in sights sounds smells tastes and tangiblesThe dissatisfaction in such sense experience is aversionBoth attraction and repulsion sully the mind making it agitated and frantic unable to come to calmThe important point to recognize here is that when the mind is dominated by the five hindrances it is in a state of distress and sufferingCan you recognize these intermediate defilements that shroud your mindThe hindrance of sensual desire can be likened to dye which clouds clear water making it murky and this turbidity equates with sufferingAversion as a hindrance is irritability and dissatisfaction and the hindrance of slothandtorpor is a state of drowsiness and lassitudeThis is a condition of burying oneself in sleep and childish forgetfulnessAll the hindrances  including the final two restless thought proliferations that interminably burden the mind and sceptical doubt  cloak and cloud the mind in darknessYou must therefore forcefully struggle to investigate these hindrances so that they and every form of defilement from the gross to the subtle level are weakened and ejectedThe practice of Dhamma is a very subtle and profound task requiring mindfulness and wisdom to probe and comprehend body and mindRepeatedly strive to see the truth of the body that is impermanent suffering and composed of mere elementsIf you dont practice in this way to achieve insight you will be left vainly groping about with no chance of extricating yourself from the mass of sufferingThe mind is full of intrigue and trickery that can adapt and expand in myriad waysSometimes you may gain some insight through mindfulness and wisdom becoming calm clear and free only to find the defilements intruding to spoil and cloak the mind in total darknessThen thought obsessions becloud your lucidityEach one of you must find a special means or stratagem to employ in understanding about yourself so that you dont get lost in a maze of distractionsThe obsessional thought proliferations together with heedlessness are of vital concernTo become disheartened and indifferent to this danger means that your enemies effectively bar your way thwarting your penetration to DhammaYou must find a way to destroy them and this needs proper attention  a resourceful clever and ingenious attackCarefully probe to see how they originated and how they ceaseRepeatedly attend to the characteristics of impermanence suffering and notselfWhen you truly see impermanence you will also know how to put down the defilements and craving or at least how to weaken and thin them outIts as if we take up a broom and sweep out whatever attachments arise until eventually theres nothing left to grasp at because everything was found to be tainted with impermanence and swept awayBy persevering in your investigation to see impermanence suffering and notself you will gain relief and ease for you will be far from attachmentsThis is the wonder of Dhamma ease of body and mind and complete freedom from entanglement in the defilementsIts nescience that enshrouds the mind and causes one to wander about entranced by sights and sounds a victim under the tyranny of craving and the defilementsMindfulness and wisdom will break your entrancement by seeing that really theres no self involved in any of it only things that arise and ceaseSuch insight sweeps away every trace of me and mine leaving pure Dhamma with neither pleasure nor sufferingThe Lord Buddha declared Sabbe dhammaa anattaa  All things are notself Theres just Dhamma that is essential but notselfThis doesnt mean the wrong view of complete annihilationism but the extinction of all attachment and holding me and mineTheres only that which is called the Undying Dhamma  without birth without aging without pain and without deathOnly the defilements and suffering are annihilatedThis is also known as Sunyo the voidness of a substantial selfThis Undying Dhamma is the true marvel that the Lord Buddha discovered and expounded to awaken usShouldnt we therefore hurry to penetrate through the impermanence suffering and notself in the five aggregates to that condition of Dhamma that is without birth old age illness and deathThis is also called Nibbaana Sunyataa and the Undetermined DhammaThey are really the same but have been given various mundane names and titlesDont grasp at themJust stay in the condition of mind free of selfThe Path Fruit and Nibbaana are not something to hope for in a future life by developing a vast heap of PerfectionsSome people like to point out that the Lord Buddha had to accumulate so many many virtues  but what about yourselfYou dont consider how many lives have passed yet you still havent attained to the GoalIts all because of your stupidity in ever devising excusesThe Lord Buddha expounded principles of Dhamma such as the Four Foundations of Mindfulness the Four Noble Truths and the Three MarksThese are to be found inside yourself so probe and examine and search out the defilements withinThen disengage and eject them and all their concerns for me and mine to overcome all sufferingIts not a case of excusing oneself from exertion by relying on the miraculous powers of some object or by building up the perfectionsBring the mind back to the present defilements  is it better to eliminate them or fall in with themDoes that lead to sufferingYou must find out the truth within yourself about getting rid of stupidity and the delusion that living in the structure of suffering is really happinessEach one of us is stuck in such delusion because we wont open our eyes to the predicamentYou must discuss together gain advice and dig out the truth so that mindfulness and wisdom can lead to selfknowledgeThis acknowledgement and seeing of the defilements and suffering within yourself brings great benefitsBut you must also consult about this to learn the basic truths of suffering its origin and the way of investigating body mind and Dhamma to extinguish that sufferingThen your suffering will diminish because mindfulness and wisdom probe and extract the defilements that burn in the mindWith correct Dhamma practice and insight your suffering will declineThis will of itself encourage and attract other people to follow your example without having to go out to proclaim your successHere theres nothing like I received this diploma or that degree Our talk is all about suffering defilements and notselfTrue penetration using mindfulness and wisdom can scrape away all the defilements but only if you persevere and take advantage of this opportune moment to achieve such results in yourselfDont abandon your life to the service of the defilements and cravingYou must constantly adjust your exertion to make it increasingly effective in destroying craving and extinguishing sufferingThe renouncing of self and defilements is essential because of the resulting state of peace and freedom in the mindYou must concern yourself with this otherwise the defilements will never be destroyed and together with every other ignorant person in the world you will only find vexation and sufferingMaara the Evil One attempted to stop the Lord Buddhas exertion by telling him that within seven days he was to become a World Ruling MonarchBut the Lord Buddha was wise to such deceptions and trickery and answered I know that alreadyThe Lord Buddha had the ability instantly to know such things for himself so Maara was continually defeatedBut what about usAre you a disciple of the Lord Buddha or still a follower of MaaraWhen a temptation appears  there you go following him the whole way never wearying of the lust involvedDisciples of the Lord Buddha must turn against the stream of craving and establish themselves in pure precepts and virtue the perfect qualities of self controlBy exertion from the level of precepts to that of developing calm and wisdom to see impermancnce suffering and notself they attain to the end of sufferingThis level of notself is also where highwisdom must be brought to bearBut the essential point is never to believe the wiles of the defilementsWhether its the canker of nescience or of craving you must establish mindfulness and wisdom to check clear and renounceTemptations will then fail and stop because you reject their offersOne doesnt want one relinquishesIf you accept and follow their lure then you will fall for more and more desire until the mind is frantic and aflameBut by steadily turning away and resisting such cravings lessen and diminish until finally they ceaseThe training of the mind takes desire for its battlefieldOtherwise it is like an addict who with no intention to beat his habit becomes inescapably a slave to his own cravingYou must establish mindfulness as your rampart and wisdom as the weapon you use to break through and destroyYou can then make steady progress penetrating to an ever deepening awareness of the structure of cravingBy selfpenetration you will be able to destroy the defilements and realize the escape route used by all the Noble DisciplesYou will then see that it was because of ones own previous blindness that one felt able to assert that Nibbana didnt existThe true elimination of suffering is only concerned with yourself in this present momentBy being mindful you can stop and disengage yourself so that suffering is relievedAs your Dhamma practice develops the defilements steadily lose strengthIts Ehipassiko  inviting one to come and see  because everyone is capable of extinguishing sufferingBy discerning the impermanence suffering and notself in everything and breaking off all attachments the mind is free becoming DhammaTheres no need to rush out to follow anyone else whether heavenly protectors or miracle men because success is wholly found within the mindOne penetrates thoroughly clearing out all attachments making the mind worthy of EhipassikoBut if the mind is still full of defilements ones invitation is to come and see oneself being burned aliveTherefore such an invitation always has a double edgeWhen craving and attachments are entirely quenched one knows right there and then that one is freeSo come and see this liberated mind right nowYou are perfectly capable of realizing this for yourselfIts not so difficultTo enter and examine the mind is easy because its evident in every posture and at every momentYou dont have to take any trip by car or boat to see the various forms of truth and falsehood within yourselfBut if you only learn about external things by studying mundane affairs as worldly people do you can never gain insightYou must turn within to learn about Dhamma truly penetrating to the impermanence suffering and notself of body feeling mind and mindobjectsOne sees each thing as impermanent  it arises persists and ceases suffering therefore one doesnt grasp it and its all free of selfIt all comes together in this state of Dhamma and then if one has true insight its simple for the mind to gain freedomBut if you understand wrongly  its like switching an electric light off instead of onWith proper understanding one flicks the switch and all is light while wrong understanding plunges one into instant darknessIts the same with the mind insight brings light and improper understanding brings darknessYou need to examine to see why there is a constant wanting of thingsSuch concerns are all suffering based in ignorance wishful thinking and fantasizing about self people and possessionsIts all frantic and nonstop news and information gatheringBut by concentrating the mind within you will find theres no problem or concernIts just a detaching and emptyingDhamma arises here as easily as the defilements can develop on the opposite sideSo you must choose either the bright or dark side to stop and be free or to continue rushing frantically aboutMake this decision within yourselfDhamma insight is remarkable for if one begins by seeing correctly it leads on to full penetrationIf one becomes snagged on any obstacle one must then probe and examine to see where ones attachment still liesThen it will all become clearYou have learned and followed the ways of the defilements long enoughNow turn and use mindfulness and wisdom to investigate themDont continue conniving with themResist their advances and refuse to follow themWhen you understand this you will find that all desire and delinquency all love and hatred are completely swept awayBut without insight the self inflates with desires for this and that masterly arranging its banquet fantasiesJust consider the following People are just like actors in a large theaterIts a drama of life with a cast of Maara and demons and hero and heroine  all contained within yourselfYou must rip away the conventional forms to reveal the pure Dhamma that remainsThis is freedom from self and everything will end thereThe language used in these talks is that of Forest DhammaThis means that apart from some Paali quotations  usually taken from the chants that many of the listeners would be familiar with and most of the monks would have learned by heart  it is usually ordinary ThaiMany Thai words are rooted in Paali and this can be seen in their spellingHowever both the present pronunciation and the meaning of the word have often been transformedForest Dhamma therefore should not be treated as if it was classical Paali and scholars should beware of trying to track definitions through the textIts important to remember that this is an oral teaching which afterwards was warmed up between pagesAs this book is mainly concerned with meditation here are some Sutta passages with descriptions of generosity and moral preceptsDaana GenerosityIn contrast to the modern emphasis on consuming and possessing the Lord Buddha spoke of the virtue of giving and being content with whatever one hasThere are always circumstances where one can giveFor instance one can offer ones time help and sympathyAnd one can forgiveIf one has wealth he explained the use of possessions the benefits which one should get from wealth reasons for earning and having wealthii to share this happiness and comfort with ones friendsiii to make oneself secure against all misfortunesiv to make the fivefold offeringto guests by receiving themto the departed by dedicating merit to themto the king by paying taxes and duties and so onto the deities ie those beings who are worshipped according to ones faithv to support those monks and spiritual teachers who lead a pure and diligent lifeSappurisa Daana Gifts of a good manii to give choice thingsiii to give at fitting timesiv to give suitable thingsv to give with discretionvi to give repeatedly or regularlyvii to calm ones mind on givingviii to be glad after givingThe basic guidelines for the actions and speech of any Buddhist can be appreciated by anyone of any religion or noneThere is no dogma involved it is a plain and simple way of living without harming or hurting any creatureThe other feature to bear in mind is that it is accepted voluntarily by the individualThis is not something that one is commanded to receiveIt is the individuals volition that changes a list of precepts into a way of livingWith that change the appreciation and mindfulness of ones actions and speech become more subtle and which automatically leads on to meditationThere are the basic Five Precepts and these become more refined with the Eight PreceptsEveryone who listened to the original Dhamma talks would be keeping the Eight PreceptsThese Precepts can be received by simply sayingI undertake the training rulepreceptii to abstain from taking what is not giveniii to abstain from sexual misconductiv to abstain from false speechv to abstain from intoxicants causing heedlessnessvi to abstain from untimely eatingvii to abstain from dancing singing music and unseemly shows from wearing garlands smartening with scents and embellishment with unguentsviii to abstain from the use of high and large luxurious couchesWhen it comes to the Dhamma we have to understand that our opinions are one thing the Dhamma is something elseAs for the practice start out by establishing your powers of endurance and then contemplateContemplate your activities your comings and goingsContemplate what youre up toWhatever arises the Buddha has us know all aroundWhatever direction things come in from he has us know all aroundIf we know all around whatever comes at us from this way we see itWhatever comes at us from that way we see itRight we knowWrong we knowHappy we knowGlad we knowWe know all aroundBut our minds when they contemplate arent yet all aroundWe know just this side but leave that side wide openIts like putting a fence around a field or a house but it doesnt go all aroundIf we put it up just on this side thieves will come in that side the side that the fence hasnt gone aroundWhy is thatWe havent closed the gateOur fence isnt yet goodIts normal that theyll have to come through that openingSo we contemplate again adding more fence closing things off continuallyPutting up a fence means establishing mindfulness and always being alertIf we do this the Dhamma wont go anywhere elseItll come right hereGood and bad the Dhamma we should see and should know will arise right hereAs for whatever we dont need to know we let it go for the time beingWe dont waste our time with the logs we arent yet strong enough to liftWait until we have a tractor or a tenwheel truck before trying to move themFocus for the time being just on the things you can liftKeep at it using your powers of endurance bit by bitIf you stick with this steadily your happy moods and sad moods your desirable moods and undesirable moods will all come in right thereThats when you get to watch themYour moods and preoccupations are one thing the mind is something elseTheyre two different kinds of thingsUsually when a mood hits one that we like we go running after itIf its one we dont like we turn our backs on itWhen this is the case we dont see our own mindWe just keep running after our moodsThe mood is the mood the mind is the mindYou have to separate them out to see what the mind is like what the mood is likeAs when were sitting here still We feel at easeBut if someone comes along and insults us we go running after the moodWeve left our spotThe mind that gets deluded by the mood goes running after the moodWe become a moody person a person who panders to his moodsYou have to understand that all your moods are liesTheres nothing true to them at allTheyre far from the Buddhas teachingsAll they can do is lie to us about everything of every sortThe Buddha taught us to meditate to see their truth  the truth of the worldThe world is our moods our preoccupationsOur preoccupations are the worldIf we arent acquainted with the Dhamma arent acquainted with the mind arent acquainted with our preoccupations we grab onto the mind and its preoccupations and get them all mixed upWhewMy mind feels no ease Its like you have many minds and theyre all in a turmoilActually thats not the caseYou dont have many mindsYou have many moods and preoccupationsWere not acquainted with our own mind so we keep running after our preoccupationsIf you sit meditating like that things just keep running along in that wayThe Buddha taught us to look at things right there right where they ariseWhen they arise they dont stayThey disbandThey disband and then they ariseWhen they arise they disband  but we dont want them to be that wayWhen the mind is quiet we want it to keep on being quietWe dont want it to get stirred upWe want to be at our easeOur views are in opposition to the truthThe Buddha taught us first to see these things all around from all sidesOnly then will the mind really be quiet and stillAs long as we dont know these things as long as we dont understand our moods we become a moody personWe lay claim to our moodsThis turns into stubbornness and prideWhen we see this happening the Buddha tells us to turn our attention to contemplating right there This kind of thinking is thinking this kind of knowing is knowing when things are like this theyre like this Tell yourself that these things simply follow their own natureThis is what moods are likeThis is what the mind is likeWhen this is the way things are what can you do to be at your easeWhat can you do to be at your easeWell just contemplate right thereWe dont want things to be like that Thats the reason for our discomfortNo matter where you go to run away from these things theyre still just like thatSo we should understand that these things are just the way they are thats allThats the truthTo put it simply thats the Buddha but we dont see him thereWe think its Devadatta not the Buddha at allThe inconstancy of the Dhamma  inconstancy stress and notself Theres nothing wrong with these thingsTheyre just the way they areWe place too many labels and intentions on themWhen you can see that happening its really goodTo put in simple terms Suppose that when you sit in concentration today the mind is stillYou think to yourself MmmThis is really nice Just sitting there you feel at easeThis keeps up for two or three daysMmmI really like this Then the next day when you sit down to meditate its like sitting on a red ants nestYou cant stay seatedNothing worksYoure all upsetYou ask yourself Why isnt it like the other dayWhy was it so comfortable then You cant stop thinking about the other dayYou want it to be like the other dayRight there is where youre deludedPreoccupations changeTheyre not constant or sure theyre not stableThey just keep following their natureThe Buddha taught us to see that thats the way they areWhatever arises is just old stuff coming backTheres nothing to it but we fix labels and make rules about things This I likeThis I dont like Whatever we like makes us happy  happy because of our delusion happy because of our delusion not happy because its rightWhen the mind is quiet the Buddha tells us not to be intoxicated by itWhen its distracted he tells us not to be intoxicated by itThings happen in all kinds of waysTheres addition subtraction multiplication and divisionThats how we can calculate numbers but we want there to be just multiplication so that we can have lots of everythingWe want to do away with addition do away with subtraction do away with division  and our calculations will all be stupidIf we had nothing but multiplication would we have any space to put everythingIf thats how we think well stay in a turmoilThe Buddha said that that sort of thinking has no discernmentStillness of mind  tranquility  comes from being far away from preoccupationsIf you dont hear much of anything the mind settles down and is stillTo get this kind of stillness you have to go off into seclusion to a place thats quiet and stillIf you can get away from your preoccupations not seeing this not knowing about that the mind can settle downBut thats like a disease a disease like cancerTheres a swelling but it doesnt yet hurtIts not yet tormenting us it doesnt yet hurt so we seem to be well  as if there were no defilements in the mindThats what the mind is like at times like thatAs long as you stay there its quietBut when it comes out to look at sights and hear sounds thats the end of itIts not at its ease anymoreHow can you keep on staying alone like that so as not to see sights hear sounds smell aromas taste flavors or touch tactile sensationsWhere can you goTheres no place in the world like that at allThe Buddha wanted us to see sights hear sounds smell aromas taste flavors or touch tactile sensations hot cold hard softHe wanted us to be acquainted with everythingHe didnt want us to run away and hideHe wanted us to look and when weve looked to understand OhThats the way these things are He told us to give rise to discernmentHow do we give rise to discernmentThe Buddha said that its not hard  if we keep at itWhen distractions arise OhIts not for sureIts inconstant When the mind is still dont say OhIts really nice and still That too isnt for sureIf you dont believe me give it a trySuppose that you like a certain kind of food and you say Boy do I really like this food Try eating it every dayHow many months could you keep it upIt wont be too long before you say EnoughIm sick and tired of this UnderstandIm really sick and tired of this Youre sick and tired of what you likedWe depend on change in order to live so just acquaint yourself with the fact that its all inconstantPleasure isnt for sure pain isnt for sure happiness isnt for sure stillness isnt for sure distraction isnt for sureWhatever it all isnt for sureWhatever arises you should tell it Dont try to fool meYoure not for sure That way everything loses its valueIf you can think in that way its really goodThe things you dont like are all not for sureEverything that comes along isnt for sureIts as if they were trying to sell you things but everything has the same price Its not for sure  not for sure in any way at allIn other words its inconstantIt keeps moving back and forthTo put it simply thats the BuddhaInconstancy means that nothings for sureThats the truthWhy dont we see the truthBecause we havent looked to see it clearlyWhoever sees the Dhamma sees the Buddha If you see the inconstancy of each and every thing you give rise to nibbida disenchantmentThats all this is no big dealThats all that is no big deal The concentration in the mind is  no big dealWhen you can do that its no longer hard to contemplateWhatever the preoccupation you can say in your mind No big deal and it stops right thereEverything becomes empty and in vain everything thats unsteady inconstantIt moves around and changesIts inconstant stressful and notselfIts not for sureIts like a piece of iron thats been heated until its red and glowing Does it have any spot where its coolTry touching itIf you touch it on top its hotIf you touch it underneath its hotIf you touch it on the sides its hotWhy is it hotBecause the whole thing is a piece of redhot ironWhere could it have a cool spotThats the way it isWhen thats the way it is we dont have to go touching itWe know its hotIf you think that This is good I really like it dont give it your seal of guaranteeIts a redhot piece of ironWherever you touch it wherever you hold onto it itll immediately burn you in every waySo keep on contemplatingWhether youre standing or walking or whatever  even when youre on the toilet or on your almsround When you eat dont make it a big dealWhen the food comes out the other end dont make it a big dealWhatever it is its inconstantIts not for sureIts not truthful in any wayIts like touching a redhot piece of ironYou dont know where you can touch it because its hot all overSo you just stop touching itThis is inconstantThats inconstant Nothing at all is for sureEven our thoughts are inconstantWhy are they inconstantTheyre notselfTheyre not oursThey have to be the way they areTheyre unstable and inconstantBoil everything down to thatWhatever you like isnt for sureNo matter how much you like it it isnt for sureWhatever the preoccupation no matter how much you like it you have to tell yourself This isnt for sureThis is unstable and inconstant And keep on watchingLike this glass Its really prettyYou want to put it away so that it doesnt breakBut its not for sureOne day you put it right next to yourself and then when you reach for something you hit it by mistakeIt falls to the floor and breaksIts not for sureIf it doesnt break today itll break tomorrowIf it doesnt break tomorrow itll break the next day  for its breakableWere taught not to place our trust in things like this because theyre inconstantThings that are inconstant The Buddha taught that theyre the truthThink about itIf you see that theres no truth to things thats the truthThats constantFor sureWhen theres birth there has to be aging illness and deathThats something constant and for sureWhats constant comes from things that arent constantWe say that things are inconstant and not for sure  and that turns everything around Thats whats constant and for sureIt doesnt changeHow is it constantIts constant in that thats the way things keep on beingEven if you try to get in the way you dont have an effectThings just keep on being that wayThey arise and then they disband disband and then ariseThats the way it is with inconstancyThats how it becomes the truthThe Buddha and his noble disciples awakened because of inconstant thingsWhen you see inconstancy the result is nibbida disenchantmentDisenchantment isnt disgust you knowIf you feel disgust thats wrong the wrong kind of disenchantmentDisenchantment isnt like our normal disgustFor example if you live with your wife and children to the point where you get sick and tired of them thats not disenchantmentIts actually a big defilement it squeezes your heartIf you run away from things like that its being sick and tired because of defilementThats not nibbidaIts actually a heavy defilement but we think its disenchantmentSuppose that youre kind to peopleWhatever you have you want to give to themYou sympathize with them you see that theyre pretty and lovely and good to youYour defilements are now coming around from the other sideWatch outThats not kindness through the Dhamma its selfish kindnessYou want something out of them which is why youre kind to themIts the same with disenchantmentIm sick and tired of thisIm not going to stay any longerIm fed up Thats not right at allIts a big defilementIts disenchantment only in nameThe Buddhas disenchantment is something else leaving things alone putting them downYou dont kill them you dont beat them you dont punish them youre not nice to themYou just put them downEverythingThe same with everythingThats how it has to beOnly then can you say that your mind has let go that its empty empty of clinging empty of attachmentEmptiness doesnt mean nobody existsOr like this glass Its not the case that it has to not exist for us to say that its emptyThis thermos exists people exist everything exists but those who know feel in their hearts that these things are truths theyre not for sure they simply follow their conditions Theyre dhammas that arise and disband thats allTake this thermos If we like it it doesnt react or say anythingThe liking is all on our sideEven if we hate it and throw it into the woods it still doesnt reactIt doesnt respond to usWhyBecause its just the way it isWe like it or dislike it because of our own attachmentWe see that its good or no goodThe view that its good squeezes our heartThe view that its no good squeezes our heartBoth are defilementsSo you dont have to run away from things like thisJust understand this principle and keep contemplatingThats all there is to itThe mind will see that these things are no big dealTheyre just the way they areIf we hate them they dont respondIf we like them they dont respondWere simply crazy of our own accordNothing disturbs us but we get all worked upTry to see everything in this wayIts the same with the body its the same with the mind its the same with the moods and preoccupations that make contact See them as inconstant stressful and notselfTheyre just the way they areWe suffer because we dont want them to be that wayWe want to get things that we simply cant getIs there something you wantI guess its like when I want concentrationI want the mind to be quietOkay its true that you want thatBut whats the cause that keeps your mind from being quietThe Buddha says that all things arise from causes but we want just the resultsWe eat watermelons but weve never planted any watermelonsWe dont know where they come fromWe see when theyre sliced open and theyre nice and red MmmLooks sweet We try eating them and they taste good and sweet but thats all we knowWhy watermelons are the way they are we have no ideaThats because we arent allaroundAllaround in what wayIts like watering vegetablesWherever we forget to water doesnt growWherever we forget to give fertilizer doesnt growContemplate this principle and youll give rise to discernmentWhen youve finished with things outside you look at your own mindLook at the affairs of your body and mindNow that were born why do we sufferWe suffer from the same old things but we havent thought them throughWe dont know them thoroughlyWe suffer but we dont really see sufferingWhen we live at home we suffer from our wife and children but no matter how much we suffer we dont really see suffering  so we keep on sufferingIts the same when the mind doesnt get concentratedWe dont know why it wont get concentratedWe dont really see whats actually arisingThe Buddha told us to look for the causes of whats arisingAll things arise from causesIts like putting water in a bottle and giving it to someone to drinkOnce hes finished drinking it hell have to come back and ask for more  for the water isnt water in a springIts water in a bottleBut if you show the spring to the person and tell him to get water there he can sit there and keep on drinking water and wont ask you for any more for the water never runs outIts the same when we see inconstancy stress and notselfIt goes deep for we really know we know all the way inOrdinary knowledge doesnt know all the way inIf we know all the way in it never grows staleWhatever arises its already rightWhen it disbands its already rightAs a result its right without stopThe view that says Thats the way it isIts right the way it is Thats when youve got itThats when youre skilled and at easeYou dont have to sufferThe problems that we get involved with and cling to will gradually unravelAs the Buddha said see simply that things arise and then disband disband and then arise arise and then disbandKeep watching this Dhamma constantly doing it constantly developing it constantly cultivating it constantly and youll arrive at a sense of disenchantmentDisenchanted with whatDisenchanted with everything of every sortThe things that come by way of the ears we already understand them by way of the eyes we already understand them by way of the nose we already understand them by way of the tongue we already understand themThe things that arise at the mind we already understand themTheyre all the same sort of thing  all of them the same sort of thing eko dhammo one DhammaThis Dhamma is inconstant stressful and notselfYou shouldnt cling to anything at allThat way disenchantment will ariseWhen the eye sees a form you already understand itWhen the ear hears a sound you already understand itYou understand all about itThese things will sometimes make us happy sometimes sad sometimes make us feel love sometimes make us feel hatredWe already know all about these sorts of thingsIf we cling to them they turn into issuesIf we let them go  let forms go the way of forms sounds the way of sounds  if we send them back and let them go their own way When we can stay at this level the Buddha said that well see all about inconstancyWhatever the preoccupations that arise theyre all empty and in vainTheyre all deceptionsWhen we see through the things that used to deceive us  when were intent on staying at ease mindful alert and discerning  its not that we see anything elseWe simply see that all the preoccupations that arise are simply the way they areEven if while were sitting perfectly still the mind thinks about this or that it doesnt matterIts just an affair of thinkingYou dont have to believe what its thinking aboutIf the mind is peaceful and you feel Ah its nice and peaceful the peace doesnt matter eitherPeace is inconstant tooTheres nothing but things that are inconstantYou can sit and watch the Dhamma right thereDiscernment arises What reason is there to sufferWe suffer over things that never amount to muchWe want to get this we want it to be like that we want to be somethingIf you want to be an arahant you immediately suffer right here and nowArahants have stopped wanting to be like this or like that but we want to get this and get that to be this and be that  so were sure to sufferIf you see that this spot is good or that spot is excellent it all comes out of youIf you see yourself thats the end of saying things like thatIll give you a simple comparisonThis food is goodThis tray is worth this many hundreds that tray this many tensTheyre all nothing but good thingsWhen theyre on plates This is mineThis is yours But when theyve gone into the stomach and come out the other end nobody argues over whose is whose  or would you still want to argueThats what its likeWhen youre willing to admit the way things are thats just what its likeIf we dont really understand we argue over whats mine and whats yoursBut when they all come together as the same sort of thing nobody lays any claimsTheyre simply the condition they areNo matter how wonderful the food might be when it comes out the other end if you wanted to give it as a gift to your brothers and sisters no one would want it  or would you still want itNobody would fight over it at allFor this reason if we gather things together as eko dhammo  one single dhamma  and see that their characteristics are all the same it gives rise to disenchantmentThis disenchantment isnt disgustThe mind simply loosens its grip its had enough its empty its sobered upTheres no love no hatred no fixating on anythingIf you have things okayIf you dont its still okayYoure at easeAt peaceNibbana is the ultimate happinessNibbana is the ultimate peace emptinessListen carefullyWorldly happiness isnt the ultimate happinessWorldly emptiness isnt the ultimate emptinessThe ultimate emptiness is empty of clingingThe ultimate happiness is peaceTheres peace and then theres emptiness the ultimate emptinessAt the moment though the mind is at peace but its not ultimateIts happy but its not ultimateThis is why the Buddha described nibbana as the ultimate emptiness its happiness as the ultimate happinessIt changes the nature of happiness to be peaceIts happy but not fixated on any objectPains still exist but you see the pains and pleasures that arise as equal to each otherThey have the same priceThe objects we like and dont like are equal to each otherBut as for us right now these things arent equalThe objects we like are really pleasingThe objects we dont like we want to smashThat means theyre not equalBut their reality is that theyre equalSo think in a way that makes them equalTheyre not stableTheyre not constant  like the food I mentioned just nowThis is goodThats wonderful But when theyre all brought together theyre equalNobody says Give me a little moreI didnt get enough Its all been brought together to the way it isIf we dont drop the principles of inconstancy stress and notself were on the pathWe see with every momentWe see the eye we see the mind we see the bodyLike when you sit in meditationAfter a moment the mind goes off in a flash so you pull it backNo matter what you do it wont stayTry holding your breathWill it go away thenYybIt goes but not farIts not going to go nowIt circles around right here  because your mind feels like its about to dieThe same with soundsI once stuffed my ears with beeswaxNoises bothered me so I stuffed my earsThings were totally quiet with just the sound from within my ears themselvesWhy did I do itI contemplated what I was doing I didnt torment myself just out of stupidityI thought about the matterOhIf people could become noble ones from not hearing anything then every deaf person would be a noble oneEvery blind person would be a noble oneTheyd all be arahants So I listened to my thoughts and  Oh discernment aroseIs there any use in stuffing your earsIn closing your eyesIts selftorment But I did learn from itI learned and then stopped doing itI stopped trying to close things offDont go wrestling and attacking dont go cutting down the trunks of trees that have already diedIt gets you nowhereYou end up tired and stand there looking like a foolThey were such a waste such a real waste my early years as a meditatorWhen I think about them I see that I was really deludedThe Buddha taught us to meditate to gain release from suffering but I simply scooped up more suffering for myselfI couldnt sit in peace couldnt lie down in peaceThe reason we live in physical seclusion is to get the mind in mental seclusion from the objects that stir up its moodsThese things are synonyms that follow one after the otherUpadhiviveka refers to seclusion from our defilements When we know whats what we can pull out of them we pull out from whatever the state the mind is inThis is the only purpose of physical seclusionIf you dont have any discernment you can create difficulties for yourself when you go off into physical seclusionWhen you go live in the wilderness dont get stuck on the wildernessIf you get stuck on the wilderness you become a monkeyWhen you see the trees you miss the treesYou start jumping around just like the monkey you were beforeThe Buddha never taught us to be this or be thatWhen you live in a peaceful place the mind becomes peacefulMmmPeace at lastThe mind is at peace But when you leave the wilderness is the mind at peaceNot any moreSo what do you do thenThe Buddha didnt have us stay in the wildernessHe had us use the wilderness as a place to trainYou go to the wilderness to find some peace so that your meditation will develop so that youll develop discernmentThats so that when you go into the city and deal with people with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations youll have strength youll have your strategiesYoull have your firm foundation for contemplating things to see how theyre not for sureGoing to the wilderness in this way is something that can really help give you strengthIf you think that you can live anywhere that you can live with lots of people its like a knife with a doubleedged bladeIf you dont have inner strength you can create difficulties for yourselfIts like monks who study the AbhidhammaThey say that when you study the Abhidhamma you dont have to cling to anything dont have to fixate on anythingIts nice and easyYou dont have to observe the preceptsYou just focus right on the mindThats what monks who study the Abhidhamma sayAs for women whats the matter with getting near themWomen are just like our mothersWe ourselves were born right out of that spot Thats bragging too muchThey ordained just yesterday and yet they refuse to be careful around womenThats not the real AbhidhammaThats not what the Abhidhamma saysBut they say that the Abhidhamma is on a level higher than the human levelWhen youre that high it doesnt matter whether youre near someone or notTheres no near no farTheres nothing to be afraid ofWomen are people just like usJust pretend that theyre menThat way you can get near them touch them feel themJust pretend that theyre menBut is that the sort of thing you can pretendIts a doubleedged bladeIf we were talking genuine Abhidhamma there wouldnt be a problemBut this Abhidhamma is fakeThe Buddha taught us to live in the wildernessThe proper way when a monk goes into the wilderness is to stay in a quiet place to wander in the quiet wilderness not to be entangled with friends and companions and other sorts of thingsThats the right way to do itBut most of us dont follow the right wayWe live in a quiet place and get attached to the quietAs soon as we see a form it gives rise to defilementIn our ears theres nothing but defilementThats going too farIt lacks discernmentIf you bring things together they come together at the path  the right path or right viewThats where things come togetherIf you have right view you can live with a large group of people and theres no problemYou can live with a small group of people and theres no problemYou can live in the forest or in a cave and theres no problemBut this is something you cant just attain without any effortYou have to get so thats the way the mind really isMake the mind know the DhammaWhen it knows the Dhamma make it see the DhammaPractice the Dhamma so that the mind is DhammaYou dont want to be able just to speak about the DhammaIts something very differentThe Buddha taught all the way to the truth but we only go halfway in half measuresThats why progress is difficultIf we come to live in the wilderness we get to train ourselves  like training ourselves to grow riceOnce we plant it it grows graduallyIf nothing eats it its okayBut what happensAs soon as the rice grains begin to appear a baby water buffalo comes to eat themWe chase it away and look after the plant but as soon as more grains appear the baby water buffalo comes to eat them again keeps on eating as soon as the grains begin to fill outIf thats the case how are we going to get any riceThe strategies youll need will grow from within the mindWhoever has discernment gains intuitive knowledgeWhoever has intuitive knowledge gains discernmentThats the way it isAre intuitive knowledge and discernment different from each otherIf you say they arent why are there two different wordsOne is called intuitive knowledge one is called discernmentCan you have only intuitive knowledgeNoYou need to have discernment tooCan you have only discernmentNoYou need to have intuitive knowledge tooWhoever has discernment gains intuitive knowledgeWhoever has intuitive knowledge gains discernmentThese things arise from your own experienceYou cant go looking for them in this book or thatThey arise in your own mindDont be timidI once read in a Jataka tale about our Buddha when he was still a bodhisattaHe was like you He had ordained and encountered a lot of difficulties but when he thought of disrobing he was ashamed of what other people would think  that he had ordained all these years and yet still wanted to disrobeStill things didnt go the way he wanted so he thought hed leaveHe came across a squirrel whose baby had been blown into the ocean by the windHe saw the squirrel running down to the water and then back up againHe didnt know what it was doingIt ran down to the water and stuck its tail in the water and then ran up to the beach and shook out its tailThen it ran down and stuck its tail in the water againSo he asked it What are you doingOh my baby has fallen into the waterI miss it and I want to fetch it outHow are you going to do thatIm going to use my tail to bail water out of the ocean until its dry so that I can fetch my baby outOhoWhen will the ocean ever go dryThats not the issueThis is the way it is with the practiceYou keep bailing out the water bailing out the water and dont care whether it ever goes dryWhen youre going to be a Buddha you cant abandon your effortsWhen the bodhisatta heard this it flashed in his heartHe got up and pushed through with his effortsHe didnt retreatThats how he became the BuddhaIts the same with usWherever things arent going well thats where they will go wellYou make them happen where they arent yet happeningWherever youre deluded thats where knowledge will ariseIf you dont believe me spit right hereThatll make it dirtyBut when you wipe it away itll be clean right here  right where its dirtyIt wont become clean out there in the grounds of the monasteryKeep coming back to the same place over and over againAjahn Thongrat once said to me Chah drill the hole right in line with the dowelThats all he saidI had just started practicing and didnt understand what he was sayingIf it comes low jump over its head Thats what he saidIf it comes high slip under itI didnt know what he was sayingSo I went off to meditate and kept contemplating itActually he was telling me how to solve my problemsDrill the hole right in line with the dowel means Wherever the problem arises contemplate right there wherever youre deluded contemplate right thereIf youre attached to a sight contemplate the sightRight around right there Thats what it means Drill the hole right in line with the dowel Dont go drilling far awayDrill right there at the dowelIts the same as when we step on a thornYou take a needle and probe right there where the thorn isDont go probing anywhere elseProbe right where the thorn is stuck in your footEven if it hurts you have to endure itKeep probing all around it and then pry it outThats how you get the thorn outIf the thorn is stuck in your foot but you go probing around your rear when will you ever be done with itSo I contemplated thisOhTeachers meditate in line with the language of their own mindsThey dont go groping around in the formulations in the books the way we doTheir own formulations arise from realitySo what comes low and what comes highIf it comes low jump over its headIf it comes high slip under it I kept contemplating thisHere he was talking about my moods and preoccupationsSome of them come low some of them come highYou have to watch them to see how you can avoid themIf they come low jump over their headsIf they come high slip under themDo what you can so that they dont hit youThis is the practiceYou contemplate right where youre deluded so that youll know right thereAny other issue is just duck shit and chicken shitYou dont have to go groping after itThats how you have to take things on in meditationBut actually its not a matter of takingYou take them on by abandoning themThis is how the suppositions of language have things all backwardsYou let things goYou practice letting goYou dont have to become a streamwinner or a oncereturnerYou dont have to make those suppositionsYou dont have to be those thingsIf you are anything its a turmoilIf you are this or are that you are a problemSo you dont have to be anythingTheres nothing but letting go  letting go and then knowing in line with what things doWhen you know in line with what things do in every way theres no more doubtAnd you arent anythingThink about it in a simple wayIf someone yells at you but you dont rear up in response thats the end of the matterIt doesnt reach youBut if you grab hold of it and wont let go youre in bad shapeWhy put their words into yourselfIf they yell at you just leave it at thatBut if they yell at you over there in the ordination hall and you bring it into your ears while youre sitting here its as if you like to sufferThis is called not understanding sufferingYou stir things up with your thinking and give rise to all kinds of issuesThe practice is actually something short and not at all longIf you say its long its longer than longIf you say its short its shorter than shortWhen it comes to the practice you cant use your ordinary ways of thinkingYou need to have patience and enduranceYou need to make an effortWhatever happens you dont have to pick it up and carry it aroundWhen things are a certain way thats all they areWhen we see the Dhamma in this way we dont hold onto anythingPleasure we knowPain we knowThe Buddha and his arahant disciples when they gain awakening Its not the case that coconutmilk sweets arent sweet for themTheyre sweet in the same way theyre sweet for usWhen the noble ones eat a sour tamarind they squeeze their eyes shut just like usDo you understandThings are just the same way they were before simply that noble ones dont hold onto them or get fixated on themIf you argue with them that the tamarind is sour theyll say Sour is fineSweet is fineNeither sour nor sweet is fine Thats what theyll sayThe same principle applies hereWhen people come and say wrong things we can hear them and it doesnt matterWe just leave it at thatIf you can do this then even though youre as old as you are now you can be youngYou can get a lot youngerYou dont have to carry these things over your shoulderIve seen some old monks wandering dhutangastyle but I dont know what theyre going forThey carry huge umbrella tentsOld monks dont like small umbrella tents the way young monks do you knowThey like to carry around big umbrella tentsIn the morning they fold up their umbrella tentsAs soon as the sun comes up they fold up their tentsThey cant leave them up in the open fields to protect themselves from the wind for the tents wont stand up to the windSo they fold up their tents and carry them off under the hot sunThen in the evening they put their umbrella tents up againI dont know why  theres no more sunThey wake up the next day and fold up their tents and carry them off under the hot sun againI did this sort of thing until I got sick and tired of itI went wandering dhutangastyle but ended up suffering in the jungleThen I realized that it wasnt for the purpose of suffering in the jungle so I kept finding my way out of the jungleThats why I became a findyourwayoutofthejungle monkActually the reason why the Buddha taught us to go into the wilderness is for us to gain discernmentYou encounter suffering you encounter reality so that you can see and understand it and eventually you get tired of the actions that cause itIts not that going into the wilderness isnt goodIt is goodIt gives rise to discernmentSpeaking of dhutanga its not a matter of slinging your bowl and umbrella tent over your shoulder exposing yourself to the sun and wind until youre about to die the way farmers go to sell water buffaloes in the Central PlainsIts a matter of the practiceYou learn to be content with littleYou learn a sense of moderation in eating a sense of moderation in sleepYou get to grow thin to make things shrink make them shorter gather them in wellIts like casting a net for fishYou gather one end firmly under your belt and then you gradually gather the net in gather it in gradually graduallyYou tie off one end and then when youve got your fish you quickly tie off the otherTie up the fish behind the gills and youve got itYou dont have to look elsewhereYou dont have to read a lot of booksWatch your own mindThe basic principles lie right hereThis way you can meditate without getting deludedIf people speak to you in a way that grates against your ears that makes you mad tell yourself Its not for sureIts inconstant If you eat something delicious and think MmmIts really good remind yourself that its not for sureWhatever comes your way tell yourself Its not for sure WhyBecause thats where the Dhamma liesGather things in in the direction of the Buddha the direction of inconstancyInconstancy  that things arent for sure Thats the Buddha on the level of the mindIf you really see inconstancy you see the DhammaWhy wouldnt you see it for the truth lies right thereIf you see the Dhamma you see the BuddhaThese things go in both directionsIf you see the Buddha you see the DhammaWhen you see in this way you can live anywhere at allWhen you sit the Buddha is giving you a sermonWhen you lie down hes giving you a sermonWhatever you do hes giving you a sermonThe Dhamma arises and the Dhamma looks after those who practice it so that they dont fall into the evil pathWhen the Dhamma is in charge the mind is always aware of thingsIt knows that This is wrongThis is rightThis is goodThis is evilThis is sufferingThis is the cause of sufferingThis is the disbanding of sufferingThis is the practice that reaches the disbanding of sufferingThats the pathEverything gathers into the pathAs you strengthen the path your defilements decreaseThe defilements are like an army you knowIf they increase the path decreasesIf the path gets strengthened the defilements gradually go away go awayTheir strength decreasesYou stay only with whats rightWhatevers wrong you give it up give it all up and the wrong path peters outThats when the right path gets established and you can live wherever you wantGaining is the same as losing losing the same as gainingTheres no problem any moreThe mind is at peace  at peace through discernmentWhen you see in this way youre not fixated on this or thatIf someone brings you something to trade this for that youre not interestedYou dont believe themThats when things are for sureRemember this point wellIts like knowing fruits This is an olive this is a guava this is a mangoOnce you know them people can pour them all into a tray and someone can pick them up one by one and ask you what they areWhats thisA guavaWhats thisAn oliveWhats thisA mangoThe person can keep doing this for a hundred trays of fruit a thousand trays of fruit and you wont be deceived by any of themYou see a mango as a mango a guava as a guava  whatever it is you see it for what it isThats when things are for sureNobody can deceive youYou cant wander off the path for everything in the mind is the right pathWhen youre sitting you have right viewWhen youre walking you have right viewWhen youre lying down you have right viewThe mind is all the same always like it has been at ease at peaceThese sorts of things are hard to describePleasure isnt the highest level of DhammaIts peace because its no longer disturbed by pleasure or painIts emptyIt stays unfixated unattachedWherever you go it keeps staying that wayFor instance if somebodys mood comes to hit you  You know venerable father youre just like a dog  you stay at your easeOnce youre sure of yourself thats the way it isBut if they call you a dog and you really become a dog biting them that shows youre not sure of yourselfYoure not for sureOnce youre for sure youre not anythingWhy would you want to be anythingVenerable Father Sii Venerable Father Saa Venerable Father Maa Its not the case that youve had these names all alongThey were given to you not all that long agoLike that eightprecept man over there Where did he come fromWas he born with a label affixed to himHis parents gave him a name just a little while agoIf they call you a person whats there to get so happy aboutIf they call you a dog whats there to get so upset aboutIsnt that a sign youre already in sad shapeSo we keep on contemplating keep on looking until we keep on getting it right getting it rightYou get it right while youre sitting down right while youre lying downWhatever you do its rightIt keeps on staying rightBut if you start arguing about the Dhamma you cant escape sufferingIts like the piece of iron thats redhot all overIt doesnt have any cool spotIf you touch it on top its hotIf you touch it underneath its hotIf you touch it on the sides its hotWhy is it hotBecause the whole thing is a piece of redhot ironWhere would it be coolIts the same hereOnce you latch onto anything  whatever it is  youre immediately wrongEverything is wrong everything is sufferingIf you latch onto whats evil you sufferIf you latch onto whats good you sufferFor the most part the good things are what lead people to be very deludedTheyre deluded by whats goodWhen good isnt just right its not good you knowHave you noticed the rainfall this yearIt was so good that it went past just right flooding peoples housesThis is what happens when good goes past just rightThe Buddha taught us to be intelligentIf it comes high slip under itIf it comes low jump over its headDrill the hole right in line with the dowelTake these three principles with youFocus right there and the problem wont get away from youThis is the genuine truthThis is what its likeDont focus on whether youre old or young or how many days and nights have passed or which day of the week it isJust keep working on your mind in this wayIn practicing dont think that you have to sit in order for it to be meditation that you have to walk back and forth in order for it to be meditationDont think like thatMeditation is simply a matter of practiceWhether youre giving a sermon sitting here listening or going away from here keep up the practice in your heartBe alert to whats proper and whats notDont decide that its okay to observe the dhutanga practices during the Rains retreat and then drop them when the retreat is overIts not okayThings dont balance out in that wayIts like clearing a fieldWe keep cutting away cutting away and then stop to rest when were tiredWe put away our hoe and then come back a month or two laterThe weeds are now all taller than the stumpsIf we try to clear away the area we cleared away before its too much for usAjaan Mun once said that we have to make our practice the shape of a circleA circle never comes to an endKeep it going continuallyKeep the practice going continually without stopI listened to him and I thought When Ive finished listening to this talk what should I doThe answer is to make your alertness akaliko timelessMake sure that the mind knows and sees whats proper and whats not at all timesIts like the water in this kettleIf you tilt it so that theres a long time between the drops  glug glug  those are called water dropsIf you tilt it a little further the drops become more frequent glugglugglugIf you tilt it a little bit further the water flows in a streamWhat does the stream of water stream come fromIt comes from the drops of waterIf theyre not continuous theyre called drops of waterThe water here is like our awarenessIf you accelerate your efforts if your awareness is continuous your mindfulness will become fullBoth by day and by night itll keep staying full like thatIt becomes a stream of waterAs were taught the noble ones have continuous mindfulnessThe water is a stream of waterMake your awareness continuousWhenever theres anything wrong or lacking in any way youll know immediatelyYour awareness will be a circle all aroundThats the shape of the practiceIts not that you have to drive yourself really hardSome people get really earnest when they sit in concentration Let my blood drain away let my skin split open if I dont gain awakening Im willing to die Theyve read that in the biography of the Buddha but when it comes to them the body starts pulsating in pain all the way up to the base of the skullTheir determination gradually deflates until they finally open their eyes to look at the incense stick burning in front of themGosh I thought itd be almost burned out but theres still a lot leftSo they take a deep breath and make the determination that as long as the incense stick hasnt burned all the way out they wont open their eyes no matter whatBut after a while the pain gets really heavy and dull at the base of the skull so they open their eyesGosh I thought itd be all burned out but theres still a lot leftEventually they give up even before the incense has burned outLater they sit and think Im really a sad case They dont know who to get mad at so they get mad at themselvesIm not true to my word They curse themselvesTheres no hope for meIm making a lot of bad kammaIm a denizen of hell All kinds of thingsWhy should I stay on as a monk if I cant even do thisAll my bad kamma is going to eat up my head Theyve given themselves a reason to jump shipWouldnt it be better to live as a layperson and observe the five precepts They think to themselves and dont tell anyone elseThe more they think the more convinced they areWhy should we set goals for ourselves like thatThe Buddha taught that when we meditate we should have a sense of ourselvesLike merchants when they put merchandise into their carts They have a sense of what theyre doing  how many oxen they have how big and strong the oxen are how big their carts areThey know that sort of thing how many sacks of rice they can put in each cartThey know how much to put in in line with the strength of their oxen and the strength of their cartsWhen you practice it has to be in line with your own strengthHere you have a single cart and your ox is the size of your fist and yet you want the cart to carry as much as a tenwheeled truckYou see tenwheeled trucks passing you on the road and you want to be like themBut youre not a tenwheeled truckYoure just a cartIts sure to break downYoure whats called a fruit thats ripe even before its halfripe food thats burned even before its cookedSo in the end those earnest meditators end up disrobingAfter theyve disrobed they start thinking againYou know back when I was ordained things were going a lot better than they are nowMaybe I should ordain againThat path was a lot brighterIt wasnt as dark as this After they think about it for a while they ordain againMake a fresh startAt first they look like theyre going to do well like a new boxer who doesnt yet need waterTheir strength is good theyre diligent they make good progressBut then they gradually grow weaker weakerIt looks like Im going to fail againThis is my second time around and still it looks like I wont make itIf I stay in the robes Im going to break down even moreId better disrobeIm not going to get anywhereSome of the Buddhas disciples ordained and disrobed up to seven times Theyre now taking those who ordained and disrobed seven times as their modelDont take their bad example as your modelThey had to wait until their seventh time before they gained awakeningMaybe if I give it my all seven times Ill gain awakening like them They keep on talking nonsenseTheres nothing in the Dhamma taught by the Buddha that lies beyond human capabilitiesDont go focusing on things you cant see heaven or nibbana up there in the skyAll the Dhammas we need to know and see the Buddha explained in fullAs for things you cant see dont pay them any mindDont pay them any attentionLook instead at the presentHow are you leading your lifeIf suffering arises why is there sufferingWhats going onHow can you settle the problem right thereWhat are you stuck onIts attachment and fixationYou grasp at the idea that youre better than other people or equal to other people or worse than other peopleAll kinds of thingsWhen you live with other people you get disgusted with themThis person is acting badlyThat person is acting badly You go off to live by yourself and dont know who to get disgusted with so you end up disgusted with yourselfJust like you saidThe clarion call of our present age is without doubt the call for freedomPerhaps at no time in the past history of mankind so much as at present has the cry for freedom sounded so widely and so urgently perhaps never before has it penetrated so deeply into the fabric of human existenceIn response to mans quest for freedom farreaching changes have been wrought in almost every sphere of his activity  political social cultural and religiousThe vast empires which once sprawled over the earth engulfing like huge mythical seamonsters the continents in their grasp have crumbled away and disintegrated as the peoples over whom they reigned have risen up to repossess their native lands  in the name of independence liberty and selfruleOld political forms such as monarchy and oligarchy have given way to democracy  government by the people  because every man demands the right to contribute his voice to the direction of his collective lifeLongstanding social institutions which kept man enthralled since before the dawn of history  slavery serfdom the castesystem  have now disappeared or are rapidly disappearing while accounts of liberation movements of one sort or another daily deck the headlines of our newspapers and crowd the pages of our popular journalsThe arts too bear testimony to this quest for greater freedom free verse in poetry abstract expression in painting and atonal composition in music are just a few of the innovations which have toppled restrictive traditional structures to give the artist open space in his drive for selfexpressionEven religion has not been able to claim immunity from this expanding frontier of liberationNo longer can systems of belief and codes of conduct justify themselves as in the past on the grounds that they are commanded by God sanctified by scripture or prescribed by the priesthoodThey must now be prepared to stand out in the open shorn of their veils of sanctity exposed to the critical thrust of the contemporary thinker who assumes himself the right to free inquiry and takes his own reason and experience for his court of final appealFreedom of speech freedom of the press and freedom of action have become the watchwords of our public life freedom of thought and freedom of conscience the watchwords of our private lifeIn any form in which it obtains freedom is guarded as our most precious possession more valuable than life itselfGive me liberty or give me death an American patriot exclaimed two hundred years agoThe succeeding centuries have echoed his demandAs though in response to mankinds call for wider frontiers of freedom the Buddha offers to the world His Teaching the Dhamma as a pathway to liberation as applicable today as it was when first proclaimed twentyfive centuries agoJust as in the great ocean there is but one taste  the taste of salt  so in this Doctrine and Discipline there is but one taste  the taste of freedom with these words the Buddha vouches for the emancipating quality of His doctrineWhether one samples water taken from the surface of the ocean or from its middling region or from its depths the taste of the water is in every case the same  the taste of saltAnd again whether one drinks but a thimblefull of ocean water or a glassfull or a bucketfull the same salty taste is present throughoutAnalogously with the Buddhas Teaching a single flavor  the flavor of freedom  pervades the entire Doctrine and Discipline from its beginning to its end from its gentle surface to its unfathomable depthsWhether one samples the Dhamma at its more elementary level  in the practice of generosity and moral discipline in acts of devotion and piety in conduct governed by reverence courtesy and lovingkindness or at its intermediate level  in the taintless supramundane knowledge and deliverance realized by the liberated saint in every case the taste is the same  the taste of freedomIf one practices the Dhamma to a limited extent leading a household life in accordance with righteous principles then one experiences in return a limited measure of freedom if one practices the Dhamma to a fuller extent going forth into the homeless state of monkhood dwelling in seclusion adorned with the virtues of a recluse contemplating the rise and fall of all conditioned things then one experiences a fuller measure of freedom and if one practices the Dhamma to its consummation realising in this present life the goal of final deliverance then one experiences a freedom that is measurelessAt every level the flavor of the Teaching is of a single nature the flavor of freedomIt is only the degree to which this flavor is enjoyed that differs and the difference in degree is precisely proportional to the extent of ones practicePractice a little Dhamma and one reaps a little freedom practice abundant Dhamma and one reaps abundant freedomThe Dhamma brings its own reward of freedom always with the exactness of scientific lawSince the Dhamma proposes to provide a freedom as complete and perfect as any the modern world might envisage a fundamental congruence appears to obtain between mans aspiration for expanding horizons of liberty and the possibilities he might realize through the practice of the Buddhas TeachingNevertheless despite this concordance of ends when our contemporaries first encounter the Dhamma they often find themselves confronted at the outset by one particular feature which clashing with their familiar modes of thought strikes them intellectually as a contradiction and emotionally as a stumbling blockThis is the fact that while the Dhamma purports to be a pathway to liberation a Teaching pervaded throughout by the taste of freedom it yet requires from its followers the practice of a regimen that seems the very antithesis of freedom  a regimen built upon discipline restraint and selfcontrolOn the one hand we seek freedom our contemporaries object and on the other we are told that to reach this freedom our deeds words and thoughts must be curbed and controlled What are we to make of this astonishing thesis the Buddhas Teaching appears to advance that to achieve freedom freedom must be curtailedCan freedom as an end really be achieved by means that involve the very denial of freedomThe solution to this seeming paradox lies in the distinction between two kinds of freedom  between freedom as license and freedom as spiritual autonomyContemporary man for the most part identifies freedom with licenseFor him freedom means the license to pursue undisturbed his impulses passions and whimsTo be free he believes he must be at liberty to do whatever he wants to say whatever he wants and to think whatever he wantsEvery restriction laid upon this license he sees as an encroachment upon his freedom hence a practical regimen calling for restraint of deed word and thought for discipline and selfcontrol strikes him as a form of bondageBut the freedom spoken of in the Buddhas Teaching is not the same as licenseThe freedom to which the Buddha points is spiritual freedom  an inward autonomy of the mind which follows upon the destruction of the defilements manifests itself in an emancipation from the mold of impulsive and compulsive patterns of behavior and culminates in final deliverance from samsara the round of repeated birth and deathIn contrast to license spiritual freedom cannot be acquired by external meansIt can only be attained inwardly through a course of training requiring the renunciation of passion and impulse in the interest of a higher endThe spiritual autonomy that emerges from this struggle is the ultimate triumph over all confinement and selflimitation but the victory can never be achieved without conforming to the requirements of the contest  requirements that include restraint control discipline and as the final price the surrender of selfassertive desireIn order to bring this notion of freedom into clearer focus let us approach it via its opposite condition the state of bondage and begin by considering a case of extreme physical confinementSuppose there is a man locked away in a prison in a cell with dense stone walls and sturdy steel barsHe is tied to a chair  his wrists bound together by rope behind his back his feet locked in shackles his eyes covered by a blindfold and his mouth by a gagSuppose that one day the rope is unfastened the shackles loosened the blindfold and gag removedNow the man is at liberty to move about the cell to stretch his limbs to speak and to seeBut though at first he might imagine that he is free it would not take him long to realize that true freedom is still as distant as the clear blue sky beyond the stoned and steel bars of his cellBut suppose next that we release the man from prison set him up as a middleclass householder and restore to him his full body of rights as a citizen of the stateNow he can enjoy the social and political freedom he lacked as a prisoner he can vote work and travel as he likes can even hold public officeBut there still remains  in the form of his responsibilities his burden of duties his limitations of power pleasure and prestige  a painful discrepancy between the freedom of mastery for which he might personally yearn and the actuality of the situation which circumstances has doled out to him as his drearisome lotSo let us as a further step lift our man up from this middleclass routine and install him to his pleasant surprise upon the throne of a world monarch a universal emperor exercising sovereignty over all the earthLet us place him in a magnificent palace surrounded by a hundred wives more beautiful than lotusflowers possessed of limitless resources of gold land and gems endowed with the most sublime pleasures of the five sensesAll power is his all enjoyment fame glory and wealthHe needs only express his will for it to be taken as command need only utter a wish for it to be translated into deedNo obstruction to his freedom of license remainsBut still the question stands is he truly freeLet us consider the issue at a deeper levelThree kinds of feelings have been pointed out by the Buddha pleasant feeling painful feeling and neutral feeling ie feeling which is neither pleasant nor painfulThese three classes exhaust the totality of feeling and one feeling of one class must be present on any given occasion of experienceAgain three mental factors have been singled out by the Buddha as the subjective counterparts of the three classes of feeling and described by him as anusaya latent tendencies which have been lying dormant in the subconscious mental continua of sentient beings since beginningless time always ready to crop up into a state of manifestation when an appropriate stimulus is encountered and to subside again into the state of dormancy when the impact of the stimulus has worn offThese three mental factors are lust repugnance and ignorance psychological equivalents of the unwholesome roots of greed hatred and delusionWhen a worldling with a mind untrained in the higher course of mental discipline taught by the Buddha experiences a pleasant feeling then the latent tendency to lust springs up in response  a desire to possess and enjoy the object serving as stimulus for the pleasant feelingWhen a worldling experiences a painful feeling then the latent tendency to repugnance comes into play an aversion toward the cause of the painAnd when a worldling experiences a neutral feeling then the latent tendency to ignorance  present but recessive on occasions of lust and aversion  rises to prominence shrouding the worldlings consciousness in a cloak of dull apathyOn whatever occasion the three latent tendencies to lust repugnance and ignorance are provoked by their corresponding feelings from their dormant condition into a state of activity if a man does not make an effort to dispel them does not strive to restrain remove and abandon them and bring them to nought then they will persist in consciousnessIf as they persist in consciousness he repeatedly yields to them endorses them and continues to cling to them they will gather momentum come to growth and like a ball of flame flung upon a haystack flare up from their initial phase as feeble impulses into powerful obsessions which usurp from a man his capacity for selfcontrolThen even if a man be like our hypothetical subject an emperor over the earth he is inwardly no longer his own master but a servant at the bidding of his own defilements of mindUnder the dominance of lust he is drawn to the pleasant under the dominance of hate he is repelled by the painful under the dominance of delusion he is confused by the neutralHe is bent up by happiness bent down by sorrow elated by gain honor and praise dejected by loss dishonor and blameEven though he perceives that a particular course of action can lead only to his harm he is powerless to avoid it even though he knows that an alternative course of action is clearly to his advantage he is unable to pursue itSwept on by the current of unabandoned defilements he is driven from existence to existence through the ocean of samsara with its waves of birth and death its whirlpools of misery and despairOutwardly he may be a ruler over all the world but in the court of consciousness he is still a prisonerIn terms of license he may be completely free but in terms of spiritual autonomy he remains a victim of bondage in its most desperate form bondage to the workings of a defiled mindSpiritual freedom as the opposite of this condition of bondage must therefore mean freedom from lust hatred and delusionWhen lust hatred and delusion are abandoned in a man cut off at the root so that they no longer remain even in latent form then a man finds for himself a seat of autonomy from which he can never be dethroned a position of mastery from which he can never be shakenEven though he be a mendicant gathering his alms from house to house he is still a king even though he be locked behind bars of steel he is inwardly freeHe is now sovereign over his own mind and as such over the whole universe for nothing in the universe can take from him that deliverance of heart which is his inalienable possessionHe dwells in the world among the things of the world yet stands in perfect poise above the worlds ebb and flowIf pleasant objects come within range of his perception he does not yearn for them if painful objects come into range he does not recoil from themHe looks upon both with equanimity and notes their rise and fallToward the pairs of opposites which keep the world in rotation he is without concern the cycle of attraction and repulsion he has broken at its baseA lump of gold and a lump of clay are to his eyes the same praise and scorn are to his ears empty soundsHe abides in the freedom he has won through long and disciplined effortHe is free from suffering for with the defilements uprooted no more can sorrow or grief fall upon his heart there remains only that perfect bliss unsullied by any trace of cravingHe is free from fear from the chill of anxiety which even kings know in their palaces protected by bodyguards inside and outAnd he is free from disease from the sickness of the passions vexing and feverish that tie the mind in knots from the sickness of samsara with its rounds of defilement action and resultHe passes his days in peace pervading the world with a mind of boundless compassion enjoying the bliss of emancipation or teaching fellow wayfarers the path he himself has followed to the goal in the calm certain knowledge that for him the beginningless trail of repeated births and deaths has been brought to a close that he has reached the pinnacle of holiness and effected the cessation of all future becomingIn its fullness the freedom to which the Buddha points as the goal of His Teaching can only be enjoyed by him who has made the realization of the goal a matter of his own living experienceBut just as salt lends its taste to whatever food it is used to season so does the taste of freedom pervade the entire range of the Doctrine and Discipline proclaimed by the Buddha its beginning its middle and its endWhatever our degree of progress may be in the practice of the Dhamma to that extent may the taste of freedom be enjoyedIt must always be borne in mind however that true freedom  the inward autonomy of the mind  does not descend as a gift of graceIt can only be won by the practice of the path to freedom the Noble Eightfold PathThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThese days people are going all over the place looking for meritAnd they always seem to stop over in Wat Ba PongIf they dont stop over on the way they stop over on the return journeyWat Ba Pong has become a stop over pointSome people are in such a hurry I dont even get a chance to see or speak to themMost of them are looking for meritI dont see many looking for a way out of wrongdoingTheyre so intent on getting merit they dont know where theyre going to put itIts like trying to dye a dirty unwashed clothMonks talk straight like this but its hard for most people to put this sort of teaching into practiceIts hard because they dont understandIf they understood it would be much easierSuppose there was a hole and there was something at the bottom of itNow anyone who put their hand into the hole and didnt reach the bottom would say the hole was too deepOut of a hundred or a thousand people putting their hands down that hole theyd all say the hole was too deepNot one would say their arm was too shortThere are so many people looking for meritSooner or later theyll have to start looking for a way out of wrongdoingBut not many people are interested in thisThe teaching of the Buddha is so brief but most people just pass it by just like they pass through Wat Ba PongFor most people thats what the Dhamma is a stopover pointOnly three lines hardly anything to it Sabba papassa akaranam refraining from all wrong doingThats the teaching of all BuddhasThis is the heart of BuddhismBut people keep jumping over it they dont want this oneThe renunciation of all wrongdoing great and small from bodily verbal and mental actions this is the teaching of the BuddhasIf we were to dye a piece of cloth wed have to wash it firstBut most people dont do thatWithout looking at the cloth they dip it into the dye straight awayIf the cloth is dirty dying it makes it come out even worse than beforeThink about itDying a dirty old rag would that look goodYou seeThis is how Buddhism teaches but most people just pass it byThey just want to perform good works but they dont want to give up wrongdoingIts just like saying the hole is too deep Everybody says the hole is too deep nobody says their arm is too shortWe have to come back to ourselvesWith this teaching you have to take a step back and look at yourselfSometimes they go looking for merit by the busloadMaybe they even argue on the bus or theyre drunkAsk them where theyre going and they say theyre looking for meritThey want merit but they dont give up viceTheyll never find merit that wayThis is how people areYou have to look closely look at yourselvesThe Buddha taught about having recollection and self awareness in all situationsWrongdoing arises in bodily verbal and mental actionsThe source of all good evil weal and harm lies with actions speech and thoughtsDid you bring your actions speech and thoughts with you todayOr have you left them at homeThis is where you must look right hereYou dont have to look very far awayLook at your actions speech and thoughtsLook to see if your conduct is faulty or notPeople dont really look at these thingsLike the housewife washing the dishes with a scowl on her faceShes so intent on cleaning the dishes she doesnt realize her own minds dirtyHave you ever seen thisShe only sees the dishesShes looking too far away isnt sheSome of you have probably experienced this Id sayThis is where you have to lookPeople concentrate on cleaning the dishes but they let their minds go dirtyThis is not good theyre forgetting themselvesBecause they dont see themselves people can commit all sorts of bad deedsThey dont look at their own mindsWhen people are going to do something bad they have to look around first to see if anyone is looking Will my mother see me Will my husband see me Will my children see me Will my wife see me If theres noone watching then they go right ahead and do itThis is insulting themselvesThey say noone is watching so they quickly finish the job before anyone will seeAnd what about themselvesArent they a somebodyYou seeBecause they overlook themselves like this people never find what is of real value they dont find the DhammaIf you look at yourselves you will see yourselvesWhenever you are about to do something bad if you see yourself in time you can stopIf you want to do something worthwhile then look at your mindIf you know how to look at yourself then youll know about right and wrong harm and benefit vice and virtueThese are the things we should know aboutIf I dont talk of these things you wont know about themYou have greed and delusion in the mind but dont know itYou wont know anything if you are always looking outsideThis is the trouble with people not looking at themselvesLooking inwards you will see good and evilSeeing goodness we can take it to heart and practice accordinglyGiving up the bad practicing the good this is the heart of BuddhismSabba papassa akaranam  Not committing any wrongdoing either through body speech or mindThats the right practice the teaching of the BuddhasNow our cloth is cleanThen we have kusalassupasampada  making the mind virtuous and skillfulIf the mind is virtuous and skillful we dont have to take a bus all over the countryside looking for meritEven sitting at home we can attain to meritBut most people just go looking for merit all over the countryside without giving up their vicesWhen they return home its emptyhanded they go back to their old sour facesThere they are washing the dishes with a sour face so intent on cleaning the dishesThis is where people dont look theyre far away from meritWe may know of these things but we dont really know if we dont know within our own mindsBuddhism doesnt enter our heartIf our mind is good and virtuous it is happyTheres a smile in our heartBut most of us can hardly find time to smile can weWe can only manage to smile when things go our wayMost peoples happiness depends on having things go to their likingThey have to have everybody in the world say only pleasant thingsIs that how you find happinessIs it possible to have everybody in the world say only pleasant thingsIf thats how it is when will you ever find happinessWe must use Dhamma to find happinessWhatever it may be whether right or wrong dont blindly cling to itJust notice it then lay it downWhen the mind is at ease then you can smileThe minute you become averse to something the mind goes badThen nothing is good at allSacittapariyodapanam Having cleared away impurities the mind is free of worries peaceful kind and virtuousWhen the mind is radiant and has given up evil there is ease at all timesThe serene and peaceful mind is the true epitome of human achievementWhen others say things to our liking we smileIf they say things that displease us we frownHow can we ever get others to say things only to our liking every single dayIs it possibleEven your own children have they ever said things that displease youHave you ever upset your parentsNot only other people but even our own minds can upset usSometimes the things we ourselves think of are not pleasantWhat can you doYou might be walking along and suddenly kick a tree stump Thud Ouch Wheres the problemWho kicked who anywayWho are you going to blameIts your own faultEven our own mind can be displeasing to usIf you think about it youll see that this is trueSometimes we do things that even we dont likeAll you can say is Damn theres noone else to blameMerit or boon in Buddhism is giving up that which is wrongWhen we abandon wrongness then we are no longer wrongWhen there is no stress there is calmThe calm mind is a clean mind one which harbors no angry thoughts which is clearHow can you make the mind clearJust by knowing itFor example you might think Today Im in a really bad mood everything I look at offends me even the plates in the cupboard You might feel like smashing them up every single one of themWhatever you look at looks bad the chickens the ducks the cats and dogs you hate them allEverything your husband says is offensiveEven looking into your own mind you arent satisfiedWhat can you do in such a situationWhere does this suffering come fromThis is called having no merit These days in Thailand they have a saying that when someone dies his merit is finishedBut thats not the caseThere are plenty of people still alive whove finished their merit already those people who dont know meritThe bad mind just collects more and more badnessGoing on these meritmaking tours is like building a beautiful house without preparing the area beforehandIn no long time the house will collapse wont itThe design was no goodNow you have to try again try a different wayYou have to look into yourself looking at the faults in your actions speech and thoughtsWhere else are you going to practice other than at your actions speech and thoughtsPeople get lostThey want to go and practice Dhamma where its really peaceful in the forest or at Wat Ba PongIs Wat Ba Pong peacefulNo its not really peacefulWhere its really peaceful is in your own homeIf you have wisdom wherever you go you will be carefreeThe whole world is already just fine as it isAll the trees in the forest are already just fine as they are there are tall ones short ones hollow ones all kindsThey are simply the way they areThrough ignorance of their true nature we go and enforce our opinions onto them Oh this tree is too shortThis tree is hollow Those trees are simply trees theyre better off than we areThats why Ive had these little poems written up in the trees hereLet the trees teach youHave you learned anything from them yetYou should try to learn at least one thing from themThere are so many trees all with something to teach youDhamma is everywhere in everything in NatureYou should understand this pointDont go blaming the hole for being too deep turn around and look at your own armIf you can see this you will be happyIf you make the merit or virtue preserve it in your mindthats the best place to keep itMaking merit as you have done today is good but its not the best wayConstructing buildings is good but its not the best thingBuilding your own mind into something good is the best wayThis way you will find goodness whether you come here or stay at homeFind this excellence within your mindOuter structures like this hall here are just like the bark of the tree theyre not the heartwoodIf you have wisdom wherever you look there will be DhammaIf you lack wisdom then even the good things turn badWhere does this badness come fromJust from our own minds thats whereLook how this mind changesEverything changesHusband and wife used to get on all right together they could talk to each other quite happilyBut there comes a day when their mood goes bad everything the spouse says seems offensiveThe mind has gone bad its changed againThis is how it isSo in order to give up evil and cultivate the good you dont have to go looking anywhere elseIf your mind has gone bad dont go looking over at this person and that personJust look at your own mind and find out where these thoughts come fromWhy does the mind think such thingsUnderstand that all things are transientLove is transient hate is transientHave you ever loved your childrenOf course you haveHave you ever hated themIll answer that for you too Sometimes you do dont youCan you throw them awayNo you cant throw them awayWhy notChildren arent like bullets are theyBullets are fired outwards but children are fired right back to the parentsIf theyre bad it comes back to the parentsYou could say children are your kammaThere are good ones and bad onesBoth good and bad are right there in your childrenBut even the bad ones are preciousOne may be born with polio crippled and deformed and be even more precious than the othersWhenever you leave home for a while you have to leave a message Look after the little one hes not so strong You love him even more than the othersYou should then set your minds well  half love half hateDont take only one or the other always have both sides in mindYour children are your kamma they are appropriate to their ownersThey are your kamma so you must take responsibility for themIf they really give you suffering just remind yourself Its my kamma If they please you just remind yourself Its my kamma Sometimes it gets so frustrating at home you must just want to run awayIt gets so bad some people even contemplate hanging themselvesIts kammaWe have to accept the factAvoid bad actions then you will be able to see yourself more clearlyThis is why contemplating things is so importantusually when they practice meditation they use a meditation object such as Buddho Dhammo or SangghoBut you can make it even shorter than thisWhenever you feel annoyed whenever your mind goes bad just say So When you feel better just say So Its not a sure thing If you love someone just say So When you feel youre getting angry just say So Do you understandYou dont have to go looking into the TipitakaJust So This means its transient Love is transient hate is transient good is transient evil is transientHow could they be permanentWhere is there any permanence in themYou could say that they are permanent insofar as they are invariably impermanentThey are certain in this respect they never become otherwiseOne minute theres love the next hateThats how things areIn this sense they are permanentThats why I say whenever love arises just tell it So It saves a lot of timeYou dont have to say Aniccam dukkham anatta If you dont want a long meditation theme just take this simple word If love arises before you get really lost in it just tell yourself So This is enoughEverything is transient and its permanent in that its invariably that wayJust to see this much is to see the heart of the Dhamma the True DhammaNow if everybody said So more often and applied themselves to training like this clinging would become less and lessPeople would not be so stuck on love and hateThey would not cling to thingsThey would put their trust in the truth not with other thingsJust to know this much is enough what else do you need to knowHaving heard the teaching you should try to remember it alsoWhat should you rememberMeditate Do you understandIf you understand the Dhamma clicks with you the mind will stopIf there is anger in the mind just So and thats enough it stops straight awayIf you dont yet understand then look deeply into the matterIf there is understanding when anger arises in the mind you can just shut it off with SoIts impermanentToday you have had a chance to record the Dhamma both inwardly and outwardlyInwardly the sound enters through the ears to be recorded in the mindIf you cant do this much its not so good your time at Wat Ba Pong will be wastedRecord it outwardly and record it inwardlyThis tape recorder here is not so importantThe really important thing is the recorder in the mindThe tape recorder is perishable but if the Dhamma really reaches the mind its imperishable its there for goodAnd you dont have to waste money on batteriesThis Rains Retreat I dont have much strength Im not well so Ive come up to this mountain here to get some fresh airPeople come to visit but I cant really receive them like I used to because my voice is just about had it my breath is just about goneYou can count it a blessing that there is still this body sitting here for you all to see nowThis is a blessing in itselfSoon you wont see itThe breath will be finished the voice will be goneThey will fare in accordance with supporting factors like all compounded thingsThe Lord Buddha called it khaya vayam the decline and dissolution of all conditioned phenomenaHow do they declineConsider a lump of iceOriginally it was simply water they freeze it and it becomes iceBut it doesnt take long before its meltedTake a big lump of ice say as big as this tape recorder here and leave it out in the sunYou can see how it declines much the same as the bodyIt will gradually disintegrateIn not many hours or minutes all thats left is a puddle of waterThis is called khaya vayam the decline and dissolution of all compounded thingsIts been this way for a long time now ever since the beginning of timeWhen we are born we bring this inherent nature into the world with us we cant avoid itAt birth we bring old age sickness and death along with usSo this is why the Buddha said khaya vayam the decline and dissolution of all compounded thingsAll of us sitting here in this hall now monks novices laymen and laywomen are without exception lumps of deterioration Right now the lump is hard just like the lump of iceIt starts out as water becomes ice for a while and then melts againCan you see this decline in yourselfLook at this bodyIts aging every day hair is aging nails are aging everything is agingYou werent like this before were youYou were probably much smaller than thisNow youve grown up and maturedFrom now on you will decline following the way of natureThe body declines just like the lump of iceSoon just like the lump of ice its all goneAll bodies are composed of the four elements of earth water wind and fireA body is the confluence of earth water wind and fire which we proceed to call a personOriginally its hard to say what you could call it but now we call it a person We get infatuated with it saying its a male a female giving it names Mr Mrs and so on so that we can identify each other more easilyBut actually there isnt anybody thereTheres earth water wind and fireWhen they come together in this known form we call the result a person Now dont get excited over itIf you really look into it there isnt anyone thereThat which is solid in the body the flesh skin bones and so on are called the earth elementThose aspects of the body which are liquid are the water elementThe faculty of warmth in the body is the fire element while the winds coursing through the body are the wind elementAt Wat Ba Pong we have a body which is neither male or femaleIts the skeleton hanging in the main hallLooking at it you dont get the feeling that its a man or a womanPeople ask each other whether its a man or a woman and all they can do is look blankly at each otherIts only a skeleton all the skin and flesh are gonePeople are ignorant of these thingsSome go to Wat Ba Pong into the main hall see the skeletons and then come running right out againThey cant bear to lookTheyre afraid afraid of the skeletonsI figure these people have never seen themselves beforeAfraid of the skeletons they dont reflect on the great value of a skeletonTo get to the monastery they had to ride in a car or walk if they didnt have bones how would they beWould they be able to walk about like thatBut they ride their cars to Wat Ba Pong go into the main hall see the skeletons and run straight back out againTheyve never seen such a thing beforeTheyre born with it and yet theyve never seen itIts very fortunate that they have a chance to see it nowEven older people see the skeletons and get scared Whats all the fuss aboutThis shows that theyre not at all in touch with themselves they dont really know themselvesMaybe they go home and still cant sleep for three or four days and yet theyre sleeping with a skeletonThey get dressed with it eat food with it do everything with it and yet theyre scared of itThis shows how out of touch people are with themselvesHow pitifulTheyre always looking outwards at trees at other people at external objects saying this one is big thats small thats short thats long Theyre so busy looking at other things they never see themselvesTo be honest people are really pitifulThey have no refugeIn the ordination ceremonies the ordinees must learn the five basic meditation themes kesa head hair loma body hair nakha nails danta teeth taco skinSome of the students and educated people snigger to themselves when they hear this part of the ordination ceremony Whats the Ajahn trying to teach us hereTeaching us about hair when weve had it for agesHe doesnt have to teach us about this we know it alreadyWhy bother teaching us something we already know Dim people are like this they think they can see the hair alreadyI tell them that when I say to see the hair I mean to see it as it really isSee body hair as it really is see nails teeth and skin as they really areThats what I call seeing  not seeing in a superficial way but seeing in accordance with the truthWe wouldnt be so sunk up to the ears in things if we could see things as they really areHair nails teeth skin what are they really likeAre they prettyAre they cleanDo they have any real substanceAre they stableNo theres nothing to themTheyre not pretty but we imagine them to be soTheyre not substantial but we imagine them to be soHair nails teeth skin people are really hooked on these thingsThe Buddha established these things as the basic themes for meditation he taught us to know these thingsThey are Transient Imperfect and Ownerless they are not me or them We are born with and deluded by these things but really they are foulSuppose we didnt bathe for a week could we bear to be close to each otherWed really smell badWhen people sweat a lot such as when a lot of people are working hard together the smell is awfulWe go back home and rub ourselves down with soap and water and the smell abates somewhat the fragrance of the soap replaces itRubbing soap on the body may make it seem fragrant but actually the bad smell of the body is still there temporarily suppressedWhen the smell of the soap is gone the smell of the body comes back againNow we tend to think these bodies are pretty delightful long lasting and strongWe tend to think that we will never age get sick or dieWe are charmed and fooled by the body and so we are ignorant of the true refuge within ourselvesThe true place of refuge is the mindThe mind is our true refugeThis hall here may be pretty big but it cant be a true refugePigeons take shelter here geckos take shelter here lizards take shelter here We may think the hall belongs to us but it doesntWe live here together with everything elseThis is only a temporary shelter soon we must leave itPeople take these shelters for refugeSo the Buddha said to find your refugeThat means to find your real heartThis heart is very importantPeople dont usually look at important things they spend most of their time looking at unimportant thingsFor example when they do the house cleaning they may be bent on cleaning up the house washing the dishes and so on but they fail to notice their own heartsTheir heart may be rotten they may be feeling angry washing the dishes with a sour expression on their faceThat their own hearts are not very clean they fail to seeThis is what I call taking a temporary shelter for a refuge They beautify house and home but they dont think of beautifying their own heartsThey dont examine sufferingThe heart is the important thingThe Buddha taught to find a refuge within your own heart Attahi attano natho  Make yourself a refuge unto yourself Who else can be your refugeThe true refuge is the heart nothing elseYou may try to depend on other things but they arent a sure thingYou can only really depend on other things if you already have a refuge within yourselfYou must have your own refuge first before you can depend on anything else be it a teacher family friends or relativesSo all of you both laypeople and homeless ones who have come to visit today please consider this teachingAsk yourselves Who am IWhy am I here Ask yourselves Why was I born Some people dont knowThey want to be happy but the suffering never stopsRich or poor young or old they suffer just the sameIts all sufferingAnd whyBecause they have no wisdomThe poor are unhappy because they dont have enough and the rich are unhappy because they have too much to look afterIn the past as a young novice I gave a Dhamma discourseI talked about the happiness of wealth and possessions having servants and so on A hundred male servants a hundred female servants a hundred elephants a hundred cows a hundred buffaloes a hundred of everythingThe laypeople really lapped it upBut can you imagine looking after a hundred buffaloesOr a hundred cows a hundred male and female servants can you imagine having to look after all of thatWould that be funPeople dont consider this side of thingsThey have the desire to possess to have the cows the buffaloes the servants hundreds of themBut I say fifty buffaloes would be too muchJust twining the rope for all those brutes would be too much alreadyBut people dont consider this they only think of the pleasure of acquiringThey dont consider the trouble involvedIf we dont have wisdom everything round us will be a source of sufferingIf we are wise these things will lead us out of sufferingEyes ears nose tongue body and mind Eyes arent necessarily good things you knowIf you are in a bad mood just seeing other people can make you angry and make you lose sleepOr you can fall in love with othersLove is suffering too if you dont get what you wantLove and hate are both suffering because of desireWanting is suffering wanting not to have is sufferingWanting to acquire things even if you get them its still suffering because youre afraid youll lose themTheres only sufferingHow are you going to live with thatYou may have a large luxurious house but if your heart isnt good it never really works out as you expectedTherefore you should all take a look at yourselvesWhy were we bornDo we ever really attain anything in this lifeIn the countryside here people start planting rice right from childhoodWhen they reach seventeen or eighteen they rush off and get married afraid they wont have enough time to make their fortunesThey start working from an early age thinking theyll get rich that wayThey plant rice until theyre seventy or eighty or even ninety years oldI ask themFrom the day you were born youve been workingNow its almost time to go what are you going to take with you They dont know what to sayAll they can say is Beats me We have a saying in these parts Dont tarry picking berries along the way before you know it night falls Just because of this Beats me Theyre neither here nor there content with just a beats me sitting among the branches of the berry tree gorging themselves with berries Beats me beats me When youre still young you think that being single is not so good you feel a bit lonelySo you find a partner to live withPut two together and theres frictionLiving alone is too quiet but living with others theres frictionWhen children are small the parents think When they get bigger well be better off They raise their children three four or five of them thinking that when the children are grown up their burden will be lighterBut when the children grow up they get even heavierLike two pieces of wood one big and one smallYou throw away the small one and take the bigger one thinking it will be lighter but of course its notWhen children are small they dont bother you very much just a ball of rice and a banana now and thenWhen they grow up they want a motorcycle or a carWell you love your children you cant refuseSo you try to give them what they wantProblems Sometimes the parents get into arguments over it Dont go and buy him a car we havent got enough money But when you love your children youve got to borrow the money from somewhereMaybe the parents even have to go without to get the things their children wantThen theres educationWhen theyve finished their studies well be right Theres no end to the studyingWhat are they going to finishOnly in the science of Buddhism is there a point of completion all the other sciences just go round in circlesIn the end its real headacheIf theres a house with four or five children in it the parents argue every dayThe suffering that is waiting in the future we fail to see we think it will never happenWhen it happens then we knowthat kind of suffering the suffering inherent in our bodies is hard to foreseeWhen I was a child minding the buffaloes Id take charcoal and rub it on my teeth to make them whiteId go back home and look in the mirror and see them so nice and white I was getting fooled by my own bones thats allWhen I reached fifty or sixty my teeth started to get looseWhen the teeth start falling out it hurts so much when you eat it feels as if youve been kicked in the mouthIt really hurtsIve been through this one alreadySo I just got the dentist to take them all outNow Ive got false teethMy real teeth were giving me so much trouble I just had them all taken out sixteen in one goThe dentist was reluctant to take out sixteen teeth at once but I said to him Just take them out Ill take the consequences So he took them all out at onceSome were still good too at least five of themTook them all outBut it was really touch and goAfter having them out I couldnt eat any food for two or three daysBefore as a young child minding the buffaloes I used to think that polishing the teeth was a great thing to doI loved my teeth I thought they were good thingsBut in the end they had to goThe pain almost killed meI suffered from toothache for months yearsSometimes both my gums were swollen at onceSome of you may get a chance to experience this for yourselves somedayIf your teeth are still good and youre brushing them everyday to keep them nice and white watch outThey may start playing tricks with you later onNow Im just letting you know about these things the suffering that arises from within that arises within our own bodiesTheres nothing within the body you can depend onIts not too bad when youre still young but as you get older things begin to break downEverything begins to fall apartConditions go their natural wayWhether we laugh or cry over them they just go on their wayIt makes no difference how we live or die makes no difference to themAnd theres no knowledge or science which can prevent this natural course of thingsYou may get a dentist to look at your teeth but even if he can fix them they still eventually go their natural wayEventually even the dentist has the same troubleEverything falls apart in the endThese are things which we should contemplate while we still have some vigor we should practice while were youngIf you want to make merit then hurry up and do so dont just leave it up to the oldiesMost people just wait until they get old before they will go to a monastery and try to practice DhammaWomen and men say the same thing Wait till I get old first I dont know why they say that does an old person have much vigorLet them try racing with a young person and see what the difference isWhy do they leave it till they get oldJust like theyre never going to dieWhen they get to fifty or sixty years old or more Hey GrandmaLets go to the monastery You go ahead my ears arent so good any more You see what I meanWhen her ears were good what was she listening toBeats me just dallying with the berriesFinally when her ears are gone she goes to the templeIts hopelessShe listens to the sermon but she hasnt got a clue what theyre sayingPeople wait till theyre all used up before theyll think of practicing the DhammaTodays talk may be useful for those of you who can understand itThese are things which you should begin to observe they are our inheritanceThey will gradually get heavier and heavier a burden for each of us to bearIn the past my legs were strong I could runNow just walking around they feel heavyBefore my legs carried meNow I have to carry themWhen I was a child Id see old people getting up from their seat Oh Getting up they groan Oh Theres always this Oh But they dont know what it is that makes them groan like thatEven when it gets to this extent people dont see the bane of the bodyYou never know when youre going to be parted from itwhats causing all the pain is simply conditions going about their natural wayPeople call it arthritis rheumatism gout and so on the doctor prescribes medicines but it never completely healsIn the end it falls apart even the doctorThis is conditions faring along their natural courseThis is their way their natureNow take a look at thisIf you see it in advance youll be better off like seeing a poisonous snake on the path ahead of youIf you see it there you can get out of its way and not get bittenIf you dont see it you may keep on walking and step on itAnd then it bitesIf suffering arises people dont know what to doWhere to go to treat itThey want to avoid suffering they want to be free of it but they dont know how to treat it when it arisesAnd they live on like this until they get old and sick and dieIn olden times it was said that if someone was mortally ill one of the next of kin should whisper Buddho Buddho in their earWhat are they going to do with Buddhowhat good is Buddho going to be for them when theyre almost on the funeral pyreWhy didnt they learn Buddho when they were young and healthyNow with the breaths coming fitfully you go up and say Mother Buddho Buddho Why waste your timeYoull only confuse her let her go peacefullyPeople dont know how to solve problems within their own hearts they dont have a refugeThey get angry easily and have a lot of desiresWhy is thisBecause they have no refugeWhen people are newly married they can get on together all right but after age fifty or so they cant understand each otherWhatever the wife says the husband finds intolerableWhatever the husband says the wife wont listenThey turn their backs on each otherNow Im just talking because Ive never had a family beforeWhy havent I had a familyJust looking at this word household I knew what it was all aboutWhat is a householdThis is a hold If somebody were to get some rope and tie us up while we were sitting here what would that be likeThats called being held Whatever thats like being held is like thatThere is a circle of confinementThe man lives within his circle of confinement and the woman lives within her circle of confinementWhen I read this word household this is a heavy oneThis word is no trifling matter its a real killerThe word hold is a symbol of sufferingYou cant go anywhere youve got to stay within your circle of confinementNow we come to the word house This means that which hassles Have you ever toasted chiliesThe whole house chokes and sneezesThis word household spells confusion its not worth the troubleBecause of this word I was able to ordain and not disrobeHousehold is frighteningYoure stuck and cant go anywhereProblems with the children with money and all the restBut where can you goYoure tied downThere are sons and daughters arguments in profusion until your dying day and theres nowhere else to go to no matter how much suffering it isThe tears pour out and they keep pouringThe tears will never be finished with his household you knowIf theres no household you might be able to finish with the tears but not otherwiseConsider this matterIf you havent come across it yet you may later onSome people have experienced it already to a certain extentSome are already at the end of their tether Will I stay or will I go At Wat Ba Pong there are about seventy or eighty hutswhen theyre almost full I tell the monk in charge to keep a few empty just in case somebody has an argument with their spouse Sure enough in no long time a lady will arrive with her bags Im fed up with the world Luang Por WhoaDont say thatThose words are really heavy Then the husband comes and says hes fed up tooAfter two or three days in the monastery their worldweariness disappearsThey say theyre fed up but theyre just fooling themselvesWhen they go off to a kuti and sit in the quiet by themselves after a while the thoughts come Whens the wife going to come and ask me to go home They dont really know whats going onWhat is this worldweariness of theirsThey get upset over something and come running to the monasteryAt home everything looked wrong the husband was wrong the wife was wrong after three days quiet thinking Hmmm the wife was right after all it was I who was wrong Hubby was right I shouldnt have got so upset They change sidesThis is how it is thats why I dont take the world too seriouslyI know its ins and outs already thats why Ive chosen to live as a monkI would like to present todays talk to all of you for homeworkWhether youre in the fields or working in the city take these words and consider them Why was I bornWhat can I take with me Ask yourselves over and overIf you ask yourself these questions often youll become wiseIf you dont reflect on these things you will remain ignorantListening to todays talk you may get some understanding if not now then maybe when you get homePerhaps this eveningWhen youre listening to the talk everything is subdued but maybe things are waiting for you in the carWhen you get in the car it may get in with youWhen you get home it may all become clear Oh thats what Luang Por meantI couldnt see it beforeI think thats enough for todayIf I talk too long this old body gets tiredNow determine in your mind to listen respectfully to the DhammaWhile I am speaking be as attentive to my words as if it was the Lord Buddha himself sitting before youClose your eyes and make yourself comfortable composing your mind and making it onepointedHumbly allow the Triple Gem of wisdom truth and purity to abide in your heart as a way of showing respect to the Fully Enlightened OneToday I have brought nothing of material substance to offer you only the Dhamma the teachings of the Lord BuddhaYou should understand that even the Buddha himself with his great store of accumulated virtue could not avoid physical deathWhen he reached old age he ceded his body and let go of the heavy burdenNow you too must learn to be satisfied with the many years youve already depended on the bodyYou should feel that its enoughLike household utensils that youve had for a long time  cups saucers plates and so on  when you first had them they were clean and shining but now after using them for so long theyre starting to wear outSome are already broken some have disappeared and those that are left are wearing out they have no stable formAnd its their nature to be that wayYour body is the same its been continually changing from the day you were born through childhood and youth until now its reached old ageYou must accept thisThe Buddha said that conditions whether internal bodily conditions or external conditions are not self their nature is to changeContemplate this truth clearlyThis very lump of flesh lying here in decline is realityThe facts of this body are reality they are the timeless teaching of the Lord BuddhaThe Buddha taught us to contemplate this and come to terms with its natureWe must be able to be at peace with the body no matter what state it is inThe Buddha taught that we should ensure that its only the body that is locked up in jail and not the mind be imprisoned along with itNow as your body begins to run down and wear out with age dont resist but also dont let your mind deteriorate along with itKeep the mind separateGive energy to the mind by realizing the truth of the way things areThe Lord Buddha taught that this is the nature of the body it cant be any other wayHaving been born it gets old and sick and then it diesThis is a great truth that you are presently witnessingLook at the body with wisdom and realize thisIf your house is flooded or burnt to the ground whatever the threat to it let it concern only the houseIf theres a flood dont let it flood your mindIf theres a fire dont let it burn your heartLet it be merely the house that which is outside of you that is flooded or burnedNow is the time to allow the mind to let go of attachmentsYouve been alive a long time nowYour eyes have seen any number of forms and colors your ears have heard so many sounds youve had any number of experiencesAnd thats all they were  experiencesYouve eaten delicious foods and all those goods tastes were just good tastes nothing moreThe bad tastes were just bad tastes thats allIf the eye sees a beautiful form thats all it is a beautiful formAn ugly form is just an ugly formThe ear hears an entrancing melodious sound and its nothing more than thatA grating discordant sound is simply thatThe Buddha said that rich or poor young or old human or animal no being in this world can maintain itself in any single state for longEverything experiences change and deprivationthis is a fact of life about which we can do nothing to remedyBut the Buddha said that what we can do is to contemplate the body and mind to see their impersonality that neither of them is me nor mine They have only a provisional realityIts like this house its only nominally yoursYou couldnt take it with you anywhereThe same applies to your wealth your possessions and your family  theyre yours only in namethey dont really belong to you they belong to natureNow this truth doesnt apply to you alone everyone is in the same boat  even the Lord Buddha and his enlightened disciplesThey differed from us only in one respect and that was their acceptance of the way things areThey saw that it could be no other waySo the Buddha taught us to probe and examine the body from the soles of the feet up to the crown of the head and then back down to the feet againJust take a look at the bodyWhat sort of things do you seeIs there anything intrinsically clean thereCan you find any abiding essenceThis whole body is steadily degeneratingThe Buddha taught us to see that it doesnt belong to usIts natural for the body to be this way because all conditioned phenomena are subject to changeHow else would you have itIn fact there is nothing wrong with the way the body isIts not the body that causes suffering its wrong thinkingWhen you see things in the wrong way theres bound to be confusionIts like the water of a riverIt naturally flows downhill it never flows uphillThats its natureIf a person was to go and stand on the river bank and want the water to flow back uphill he would be foolishWherever he went his foolish thinking would allow him no peace of mindHe would suffer because of his wrong view his thinking against the streamIf he had right view he would see that the water must inevitably flow downhill and until he realized and accepted that fact he would be bewildered and frustratedThe river that must flow down the gradient is like your bodyHaving been young your bodys become old and is meandering towards its deathDont go wishing it were otherwise its not something you have the power to remedyThe Buddha told us to see the way things are and then let go of our clinging to themTake this feeling of letting go as your refugeKeep meditating even if you feel tired and exhaustedLet your mind be with the breathTake a few deep breaths and then establish the attention on the breath using the mantra word BuddhoMake this practice continualThe more exhausted you feel the more subtle and focused your concentration must be so that you can cope with any painful sensations that ariseWhen you start to feel fatigued then bring all your thinking to a halt let the mind gather itself together and then turn to knowing the breathJust keep up the inner recitation Buddho BuddhoLet go of all externalsDont go grasping at thoughts of your children and relatives dont grasp at anything whatsoeverLet goLet the mind unite in a single point and let that composed mind dwell with the breathLet the breath be its sole object of knowledgeConcentrate until the mind becomes increasingly subtle until feelings are insignificant and there is great inner clarity and wakefulnessThen any painful sensations that arise will gradually cease of their own accordFinally youll look on the breath as if it were some relatives come to visit youWhen the relatives leave you follow them out to see them offYou watch until theyve walked up the drive and out of sight and then you go back indoorsWe watch the breath in the same wayIf the breath is coarse we know that its coarse if its subtle we know that its subtleAs it becomes increasingly fine we keep following it the same time awakening the mindEventually the breath disappears altogether and all that remains is that feeling of alertnessThis is called meeting the BuddhaWe have that clear wakeful awareness called Buddho the one who knows the awakened one the radiant oneThis is meeting and dwelling with the Buddha with knowledge and clarityIt was only the historical Buddha who passed awayThe true Buddha the Buddha that is clear radiant knowing can still be experienced and attained todayAnd if we do attain it the heart is oneSo let go put everything down everything except the knowingDont be fooled if visions or sounds arise in your mind during meditationLay them all downDont take hold of anything at all just stay with this unified awarenessDont worry about the past or the future just be still and you will reach the place where theres no advancing no retreating and no stopping where theres nothing to grasp at or cling toWhyBecause theres no self no me or mine Its all goneThe Buddha taught to empty yourself of everything in this way not to carry anything around to know and having known let goRealizing the Dhamma the path to freedom from the round of birth and death is a task that we all have to do aloneSo keep trying to let go and understand the teachingsPut effort into your contemplationDont worry about your familyAt the moment they are as they are in the future they will be like youTheres noone in the world who can escape this fateThe Buddha taught to lay down those things that lack a real abiding essenceIf you lay everything down you will see the real truth if you dont you wontThats the way it isAnd its the same for everyone in the worldSo dont grasp at anythingEven if you find yourself thinking well thats all right too as long as you think wiselyDont think foolishlyIf you think of your children think of them with wisdom not with foolishnessWhatever the mind turns to think of it with wisdom be aware of its natureTo know something with wisdom is to let it go and have no suffering over itThe mind is bright joyful and at peaceIt turns away from distractions and is undividedRight now what you can look to for help and support is your breathThis is your own work noone elsesLeave others to do their own workYou have your own duty and responsibility you dont have to take on those of your familyDont take on anything else let it all goThis letting go will make your mind calmYour sole responsibility right now is to focus your mind and bring it to peaceLeave everything else to the othersForms sounds odors tastes leave them to the others to attend toPut everything behind you and do your own work fulfill your own responsibilityWhatever arises in your mind be it fear of pain fear of death anxiety about others or whatever say to it Dont disturb meYoure no longer any concern of mine Just keep this to yourself when you see those dhammas ariseWhat does the word dhamma refer toEverything is a dhamma there is nothing that is not a dhammaAnd what about worldThe world is the very mental state that is agitating you at the present momentWhat are they going to doWhen Im gone who will look after themHow will they manage This is all just the world Even the mere arising of a thought fearing death or pain is the worldThrow the world awayThe world is the way it isIf you allow it to dominate your mind it becomes obscured and cant see itselfSo whatever appears in the mind just say This isnt my businessIts impermanent unsatisfactory and not selfThinking youd like to go on living for a long time will make you sufferBut thinking youd like to die right away or very quickly isnt right eitherIts suffering isnt itConditions dont belong to us they follow their own natural lawsYou cant do anything about the way the body isYou can beautify it a little make it attractive and clean for a while like the young girls who paint their lips and let their nails grow long but when old age arrives everybodys in the same boatThats the way the body is you cant make it any other wayWhat you can improve and beautify is the mindAnyone can build a house of wood and bricks but the Buddha taught that that sort of home is not our real home its only nominally oursIts home in the world and it follows the ways of the worldOur real home is inner peaceAn external material home may well be pretty but it is not very peacefulTheres this worry and then that this anxiety and then thatSo we say its not our real home its external to usSooner or later well have to give it upits not a place we can live in permanently because it doesnt truly belong to us it belongs to the worldOur body is the sameWe take it to be a self to be me or mine but in fact its not really so at all its another worldly homeYour body has followed its natural course from birth until now its old and sick and you cant forbid it from doing thatThats the way it isWanting it to be any different would be as foolish as wanting a duck to be like a chickenWhen you see that thats impossible  that a duck must be a duck and a chicken must be a chicken and that the bodies have to get old and die  you will find courage and energyHowever much you want the body to go on lasting it wont do thatThe Buddha saidThe word sankhara refers to this body and mindSankharas are impermanent and unstablehaving come into being they disappear having arisen they pass away and yet everyone wants them to be permanentThis is foolishnessLook at the breathOnce its gone in it goes out thats its nature thats how it has to beThe inhalations and exhalations have to alternate there must be changeConditions exist through change you cant prevent itJust think could you exhale without inhalingWould it feel goodOr could you just inhaleWe want things to be permanent but they cant be its impossibleOnce the breath has come in it must go outWhen its gone out it comes back in again and thats natural isnt itHaving been born we get old and then die and thats totally natural and normalIts because conditions have done their job because the in breaths and out breaths have alternated in this way that the human race is still here todayAs soon as we are born we are deadOur birth and our death are just one thingIts like a tree when theres a root there must be branches when there are branches there must be a rootYou cant have one without the otherIts a little funny to see how at death people are so grief stricken and distracted and at birth how happy and delightedIts delusion nobody has ever looked at this clearlyI think if you really want to cry it would be better to do so when someones bornBirth is death death is birth the branch is the root the root is the branchIf you must cry cry at the root cry at the birthLook closely if there was no birth there would be no deathCan you understand thisDont worry about things too much just think this is the way things are This is your work your dutyRight now nobody can help you theres nothing that your family and possessions can do for youall that can help you now is clear awarenessSo dont waverLet goThrow it all awayEven if you dont let go everything is starting to leave you anywayCan you see that how all the different parts of your body are trying to slip awayTake your hair when you were young it was thick and blackNow its falling outIts leavingYour eyes used to be good and strong but now theyre weak your sight is unclearWhen your organs have had enough they leave this isnt their homeWhen you were a child your teeth were healthy and firm now theyre wobbly or youve got false onesYour eyes ears nose tongue  everything is trying to leave because this isnt their homeYou cant make a permanent home in conditions you can only stay for a short time and then you have to goIts like a tenant watching over his tiny little house with failing eyesHis teeth arent so good his eyes arent so good his bodys not so healthy everything is leavingSo you neednt worry about anything because this isnt your real home its only a temporary shelterHaving come into this world you should contemplate its natureEverything there is is preparing to disappearLook at your bodyIs there anything there thats still in its original formIs your skin as it used to beIs your hairThey arent the same are theyWhere has everything goneThis is nature the way things areWhen their time is up conditions go their wayIn this world there is nothing to rely on  its an endless round of disturbance and trouble pleasure and painTheres no peaceWhen we have no real home were like aimless travelers out on the road going here and there stopping for a while and then setting off againUntil we return to our real homes we feel uneasy just like a villager whos left his villageOnly when he gets home can he really relax and be at peaceNowhere in the world is there any real peace to be foundThe poor have no peace and neither do the rich adults have no peace and neither do the highly educatedTheres no peace anywhere thats the nature of the worldThose who have few possessions suffer and so do those who have manyChildren adults old and young everyone suffersThe suffering of being old the suffering of being young the suffering of being wealthy and the suffering of being poor its all nothing but sufferingWhen youve contemplated things in this way youll see aniccam impermanence and dukkham unsatisfactorinessWhy are things impermanent and unsatisfactoryBecause they are anatta not selfBoth your body that is lying sick and in pain and the mind that is aware of its sickness and pain are called dhammaThat which is formless the thoughts feelings and perceptions is called namadhammaThat which is racked with aches and pains is called rupadhammaThe material is dhamma and the immaterial is dhammaSo we live with dhammas in dhamma and we are dhammaIn truth there is no self to be found there are only dhammas continually arising and passing away as is their natureEvery single moment were undergoing birth and deathThis is the way things areWhen we think of the Lord Buddha how truly he spoke we feel how worthy he is of reverence and respectWhenever we see the truth of something we see His teachings even if weve never actually practiced the DhammaBut even if we have a knowledge of the teachings have studied and practiced them as long as we still havent seen the truth we are still homelessSo understand this pointAll people all creatures are preparing to leaveWhen beings have lived an appropriate time they must go on their wayRich poor young and old must all experience this changeWhen you realize thats the way the world is youll feel that its a wearisome placeWhen you see that theres nothing real or substantial you can rely on youll feel wearied and disenchantedBeing disenchanted doesnt mean you are averse the mind is clearIt sees that theres nothing to be done to remedy this state of affairs its just the way the world isKnowing in this way you can let go of attachment letting go with a mind that is neither happy nor sad but at peace with conditions through seeing their changing nature with wisdomAnicca vata sankhara  all conditions are impermanentTo put it simply impermanence is the BuddhaIf we truly see an impermanent condition well see that its permanentIts permanent in the sense that its subjection to change is unchangingThis is the permanence that living beings possessThere is continual transformation from childhood through to old age and that very impermanence that propensity to change is permanent and fixedIf you look at it like this your heart will be at easeIts not just you who has to go through this its everyoneWhen you consider things in this way youll see them as wearisome and disenchantment will ariseYour delight in the world of sense pleasures will disappearYoull see that if you have many possessions you have to leave a lot behindIf you have a few you leave few behindWealth is just wealth long life is just long life theyre nothing specialWhat is important is that we should do as the Lord Buddha taught and build our own home building it by the method that Ive been explaining to youBuild your own homeLet goLet go until the mind reaches the peace that is free from advancing free from retreating and free from stopping stillPleasure is not your home pain is not your homePleasure and pain both decline and pass awayThe Great Teacher saw that all conditions are impermanent and so He taught us to let go of our attachment to themWhen we reach the end of our life well have no choice anyway we wont be able to take anything with usSo wouldnt it be better to put things down before thenTheyre just a heavy burden to carry around why not throw off that load nowWhy bother to drag these things aroundLet go relax and let your family look after youThose who nurse the sick grow in goodness and virtueThe patient who is giving others that opportunity shouldnt make things difficult for themIf theres pain or some problem or other let them know and keep the mind in a wholesome stateOne who is nursing parents should fill his or her mind with warmth and kindness and not get caught up in aversionThis is the one time you can repay your debt to themFrom your birth through your childhood as youve grown up youve been dependent on your parentsThat you are here today is because your mother and father have helped you in so many waysYou owe them an incredible debt of gratitudeSo today all of you children and relatives gathered together here observe how your mother has become your childBefore you were her children now she has become yoursShe has become older and older until she has become a child againHer memory goes her eyes dont see well and her ears arent so goodSometimes she garbles her wordsDont let it upset youYou who are nursing the sick must know how to go alsoDont hold onto things just let her have her own wayWhen a young child is disobedient sometimes the parents let it have its own way just to keep the peace just to make it happyNow your mother is just like that childHer memories and perceptions are confusedSometimes she muddles up your names or asks you to bring a cup when she wants a plateIts normal dont be upset by itLet the patient bear in mind the kindness of those who nurse and patiently endure the painful feelingsExert yourself mentally dont let the mind become scattered and confused and dont make things difficult for those looking after youLet those who are nursing fill their minds with virtue and kindnessDont be averse to the unattractive side of the job cleaning up the mucous and phlegm urine and excrementTry your bestEveryone in the family give a handShe is the only mother you haveShe gave you life she has been your teacher your doctor and your nurse  shes been everything to youThat she has brought you up shared her wealth with you and made you her heir is the great goodness of parentsThat is why the Buddha taught the virtues of kataññu and katavedi knowing our debt of gratitude and trying to repay itThese two dhamma are complimentaryIf our parents are in need unwell or in difficulty then we do our best to help themThis is kataññukatavedi the virtue that sustains the worldIt prevents families from breaking up and makes them stable and harmoniousToday I have brought you the gift of Dhamma in this time of illnessI have no material things to offer you there seem to be plenty of those in this house alreadyAnd so I give you the Dhamma something which has lasting worth something which youll never be able to exhaustHaving received it you can pass it on to as many others as you like and it will never be depletedThat is the nature of TruthI am happy to have been able to give you this gift of Dhamma and hope it will give you the strength to deal with your painToday I have been invited by the abbot to give you a teaching so I ask you all to sit quietly and compose your mindsDue to the language barrier we must make use of a translator so if you do not pay proper attention you may not understandMy stay here has been very pleasantBoth the Master and you his followers have been very kind all friendly and smiling as befits those who are practicing the true DhammaYour property too is very inspiring but so bigI admire your dedication in renovating it to establish a place for practicing the DhammaHaving been a teacher for many years now Ive been through my share of difficultiesAt present there are altogether about forty branch monasteries of my monastery Wat Nong Ba Pong but even these days I have followers who are hard to teachSome know but dont bother to practice some dont know and dont try to find outI dont know what to do with themWhy do human beings have minds like thisBeing ignorant is not so good but even when I tell them they still dont listenI dont know what more I can doPeople are so full of doubts in their practice theyre always doubtingThey all want to go to nibbana but they dont want to walk the pathIts bafflingWhen I tell them to meditate theyre afraid or if not afraid then just plain sleepyMostly they like to do the things I dont teachWhen I met the Venerable Abbot here I asked him what his followers were likeHe said theyre the sameThis is the pain of being a teacherThe teaching I will present to you today is a way to solve problems in the present moment in this present lifeSome people say that they have so much work to do they have no time to practice the DhammaWhat can we do they askI ask them Dont you breathe while youre working Yes of course we breathe So how come you have time to breathe when youre so busy They dont know what to answerIf you simply have sati while working you will have plenty of time to practicePracticing meditation is just like breathingWhile working we breathe while sleeping we breathe while sitting down we breathe Why do we have time to breatheBecause we see the importance of the breath we can always find time to breatheIn the same way if we see the importance of meditation practice we will find the time to practiceHave any of you ever suffered have you ever been happy Right here is the truth this is where you must practice the DhammaWho is it who is happyThe mind is happywho suffersThe mind suffersWherever these things arise thats where they ceaseHave you experienced happiness Have you experienced suffering this is our problemIf we know suffering the cause of suffering the end of suffering and the way leading to the end of suffering we can solve the problemThere are two kinds of suffering ordinary suffering and the extraordinary kindOrdinary suffering is the suffering which is the inherent nature of conditions standing is suffering sitting is suffering lying down is sufferingThis is the suffering that is inherent in all conditioned phenomenaEven the Buddha experienced these things he experienced comfort and pain but he recognized them as conditions in natureHe knew how to overcome these ordinary natural feelings of comfort and pain through understanding their true natureBecause he understood this natural suffering those feelings didnt upset himThe important kind of suffering is the second kind the suffering that creeps in from the outside the extraordinary suffering If we are sick we may have to get an injection from the doctorWhen the needle pierces the skin there is some pain which is only naturalWhen the needle is withdrawn that pain disappearsThis is like the ordinary kind of suffering its no problem everybody experiences itThe extraordinary suffering is the suffering that arises from what we call upadana grasping onto thingsThis is like having an injection with a syringe filled with poisonThis is no longer an ordinary kind of pain it is the pain which ends in deathThis is similar to the suffering which arises from graspingWrong view not knowing the impermanent nature of all conditioned things is another kind of problemConditioned things are the realm of samsaraNot wanting things to change  if we think like this we must sufferWhen we think that the body is ourselves or belonging to us we are afraid when we see it changeConsider the breath once it comes in it must go out having gone out it must come in againThis is its nature this is how we manage to liveThings dont function in that wayThis is how conditions are but we dont realize itSuppose we lost somethingif we thought that object was really ours we would brood over itIf we couldnt see it as a conditioned thing faring according to the laws of nature we would experience sufferingBut if you breathe in can you liveConditioned things must naturally change in this wayTo see this is to see the Dhamma to see aniccam changeWe live dependent on this changeWhen we know how things are then we can let go of themThe practice of Dhamma is to develop an understanding of the way of things so that suffering doesnt ariseIf we think wrongly we are at odds with the world at odds with the Dhamma and with the truthSuppose you were sick and had to go into hospitalMost people think Please dont let me die I want to get better This is wrong thinking it will lead to sufferingYou have to think to yourself If I recover I recover if I die I die this is right thinking because you cant ultimately control conditionsIf you think like this whether you die or recover you cant go wrong you dont have to worryWanting to get better at all costs and afraid of the thought of dying this is the mind which doesnt understand conditionsYou should think If I get better thats fine if I dont get better thats fine This way we cant go wrong we dont have to be afraid or cry because we have tuned ourselves in to the way things areThe Buddha saw clearlyHis teaching is always relevant never outdatedIt never changesIn the present day its still the way they are they havent changedBy taking this teaching to heart we can gain the reward of peace and wellbeingIn the teachings there is the reflection of notself this is to listen to this kind of teaching because they are attached to the idea of selfThis is the cause of sufferingYou should take note of thisToday a woman asked about how to deal with angerI told her that the next time she gets angry to wind up her alarm clock and put it in front of herThen to give herself two hours for the anger to go awayIf it was really her anger she could probably tell it to go away like this In two hours be gone But it isnt really ours to commandSometimes in two hours its still not gone at other times in one hour its gone alreadyHolding onto anger as a personal possession will cause sufferingIf it really belonged to us it would have to obey usIf it doesnt obey us that means its only a deceptionDont fall for itWhether the mind is happy or sad dont fall for itWhether the mind loves or hates dont fall for it its all a deceptionHave any of you ever been angryWhen you are angry does it feel good or badIf it feels bad then why dont you throw that feeling away why bother to keep itHow can you say that you are wise and intelligent when you hold on to such thingsSince the day you were born how many times has the mind tricked you into angerSome days the mind can even cause a whole family to quarrel or cause you to cry all nightAnd yet we still continue to get angry we still hold onto things and sufferIf you dont see suffering you will have to keep suffering indefinitely with no chance for respiteThe world of samsara is like thisIf we know the way it is we can solve the problemThe Buddhas teaching states that there is no better means to overcome suffering than to see that this is not my self this is not mine This is the greatest methodBut we dont usually pay attention to thisWhen suffering arises we simply cry over it without learning from itWhy is that soWe must take a good hard look at these things to develop the Buddho the one who knowsTake note some of you may not be aware that this is Dhamma teachingIm going to give you some Dhamma thats outside the scripturesMost people read the scriptures but dont see the DhammaToday I am going to give you a teaching thats outside the scripturesSome people may miss the point or not understand itSuppose two people are walking together and see a duck and a chickenOne of them says Why isnt that chicken like the duck why isnt the duck like the chicken He wants the chicken to be a duck and the duck to be a chickenIts impossibleIf its impossible then even if that person were to wish for the duck to be a chicken and the chicken to be a duck for the rest of his life it would not come to pass because the chicken is a chicken and the duck is a duckAs long as that person thought like that he would sufferThe other person might see that the chicken is a chicken and the duck is a duck and thats all there is to itThere is no problemHe sees rightlyIf you want the duck to be a chicken and the chicken to be a duck you are really going to sufferIn the same way the law of aniccam states that all things are impermanentIf you want things to be permanent youre going to sufferWhenever impermanence shows itself youre going to be disappointedOne who sees that things are naturally impermanent will be at ease there will be no conflictThe one who wants things to be permanent is going to have conflict maybe even losing sleep over itThis is to be ignorant of aniccam impermanence the teaching if the BuddhaIf you want to know the Dhamma where should you lookYou must look within the body and the mindYou wont find it in the shelves of a bookcaseTo really see the Dhamma you have to look within your own body and mindThere are only these two thingsThe mind is not visible to the physical eye it must be seen with the minds eye Before the Dhamma can be realized you must know where to lookThe Dhamma that is in the body must be seen in the bodyAnd with what do we look at the bodyWe look at the body with the mindYou wont find the Dhamma looking anywhere else because both happiness and suffering arise right hereOr have you seen happiness arising in the treesOr from the rivers or the weatherHappiness and suffering are feelings which arise in our own bodies and mindsTherefore the Buddha tells us to know the Dhamma right hereThe Dhamma is right here we must look right hereThe Master may tell you to look at the Dhamma in the books but if you think that this is where the Dhamma really is youll never see itHaving looked at the books you must reflect on those teachings inwardlyThen you can understand the DhammaWhere does the real Dhamma existIt exists right here in this body and mind of oursThis is the essence of contemplation practiceWhen we do this wisdom will arise in our mindsWhen there is wisdom in our minds then no matter where we look there is Dhamma we will see aniccam dukkham and anatta at all timesAniccam means transientDukkham  if we cling to the things that are transient we must suffer because they are not us or oursBut we dont see this we always see them as being our self and belonging to usThis means that you dont see the truth of conventionYou should understand conventionsFor example all of us sitting here have namesAre our names born with us or are they assigned to us afterwardsDo you understandThis is conventionIs convention usefulOf course its usefulFor example suppose there are four men A B C and DThey all must have their individual names for convenience in communicating and working togetherIf we wanted to speak to MrA we could call MrA and he would come not the othersThis is the convenience of conventionBut when we look deeply into the matter we will see that really there isnt anybody thereWe will see transcendenceThere is only earth water wind and fire the four elementsThis is all there is to this body of oursBut we dont see it in this way because of the clinging power of AttavadupadanaIf we were to look clearly we would see that there isnt really much to what we call a personThe solid part is the earth element the fluid part is the water element the part which provides heat is called the fire elementWhen we break things down we see that there is only earth water wind and fireWhere is the person to be foundThere isnt oneThats why the Buddha taught that there is no higher practice than to see that this is not my self and does not belong to me They are simply conventionsIf we understand everything clearly in this way we will be at peaceIf we realize in the present moment the truth of impermanence that things are not our self or belonging to us then when they disintegrate we are at peace with them because they dont belong to anybody anywayThey are merely the elements of earth water wind and fireIts difficult for people to see this but even so its not beyond our abilityIf we can see this we will find contentment we will not have so much anger greed or delusionThere will always be Dhamma in our heartsThere will be no need for jealousy and spite because everybody is simply earth water wind and fireTheres nothing more to them than thisWhen we accept this truth we will see the truth of the Buddhas teachingIf we could see the truth of the Buddhas teaching we wouldnt have to use up so many teachersIt wouldnt be necessary to listen to teachings everydayWhen we understand then we simply do whats required of usBut what makes people so difficult to teach is that they dont accept the teaching and argue with the teachers and the teachingIn front of the teacher they behave a little better but behind his back they become thievesPeople are really difficult to teachThe people in Thailand are like this thats why they have to have so many teachersBe careful if youre not careful you wont see the DhammaYou must be circumspect taking the teaching and considering it wellIs this flower pretty Do you see the ugliness within this flower For how many days will it be pretty What will it be like from now on Why does it change so In three or four days you have to take it and throw it away rightIt loses all its beautyPeople are attached to beauty attached to goodnessIf anything is good they just fall for it completelyThe Buddha tells us to look at pretty things as just pretty we shouldnt become attached to themIf there is a pleasant feeling we shouldnt fall for itGoodness is not a sure thing beauty is not a sure thingNothing is certainThere is nothing in this world that is a certaintyThis is the truthThe things that arent true are the things that change such as beautyThe only truth it has is in its constant changingIf we believe that things are beautiful when their beauty fades our mind loses its beauty tooWhen things are no longer good our mind loses its goodness tooWhen they are destroyed or damaged we suffer because we have clung to them as being our ownThe Buddha tells us to see that these things are simply constructs of natureBeauty appears and in not many days it fadesTo see this is to have wisdomTherefore we should see impermanenceIf we think something is pretty we should tell ourselves it isnt if we think something is ugly we should tell ourselves it isntTry to see things in this way constantly reflect in this wayWe will see the truth within untrue things see the certainty within the things that are uncertainToday I have been explaining the way to understand suffering what causes suffering the cessation of suffering and the way leading to the cessation of sufferingWhen you know suffering you should throw it outKnowing the cause of suffering you should throw it outPractice to see the cessation of sufferingSee aniccam dukkham and anatta and suffering will ceaseWhen suffering ceases where do we goWhat are we practicing forWe are practicing to relinquish not in order to gain anythingThere was a woman this afternoon who told me that she is sufferingI asked her what she wants to be and she said she wants to be enlightenedI said As long as you want to be enlightened you will never become enlightenedDont want anythingWhen we know the truth of suffering we throw out sufferingWhen we know the cause of suffering then we dont create those causes but instead practice to bring suffering to its cessationThe practice leading to the cessation of suffering is to see that this is not a self this is not me or them Seeing in this way enables suffering to ceaseIts like reaching our destination and stoppingThats cessationThats getting close to nibbanaTo put it another way going forward is suffering retreating is suffering and stopping is sufferingNot going forward not retreating and not stopping is anything leftBody and mind cease hereThis is the cessation of sufferingHard to understand isnt itIf we diligently and consistently study this teaching we will transcend things and reach understanding there will be cessationThis is the ultimate teaching of the Buddha its the finishing pointThe Buddhas teaching finishes at the point of total relinquishmentToday I offer this teaching to you all and to the Venerable Master alsoIf there is anything wrong in it I ask your forgivenessBut dont be in a hurry to judge whether it is right or wrong just listen to it firstIf I were to give you all a fruit and tell you its delicious you should take note of my words but dont believe me offhand because you havent tasted it yetThe teaching I give you today is the sameIf you want to know whether the fruit is sweet or sour you have to slice a piece off and taste itThen you will know its sweetness or sournessThen you could believe me because then youd have seen for yourselfSo please dont throw this fruit away keep it and taste it know its taste for yourselfThe Buddha didnt have a teacher you knowAn ascetic once asked him who his teacher was and the Buddha answered that he didnt have oneThe ascetic just walked off shaking his headThe Buddha was being too honestHe was speaking to one who couldnt know or accept the truthThats why I tell you not to believe meThe Buddha said that to simply believe others is foolish because there is no clear knowing withinThats why the Buddha said I have no teacher This is the truthBut you should look at this is the right wayIf you misunderstand it you wont respect your teacherDont go saying I have no teacher You must rely on your teacher to tell you what is right and wrong and then you must practice accordinglyToday is a fortunate day for all of usI have had a chance to meet with all of you and the venerable teacherYou wouldnt think that we could meet like this because we live so far apartI think there must be some special reason that we have been able to meet in this wayThe Buddha taught that everything that arises must have a causeDont forget thisThere must be some causePerhaps in a previous existence we were brothers and sisters in the same familyIts possibleAnother teacher didnt come but I didWhy is thatPerhaps we are creating the causes in the present moment itselfThis is also possibleI leave you all with this teachingMay you be diligent and arduous in the practiceThere is nothing better than the practice of Dhamma Dhamma is the supporter of the whole worldPeople are confused these days because they do not know the DhammaIf we have the Dhamma with us we will be contentI am happy to have had this opportunity to help you and the venerable teacher in developing the practice of DhammaI leave you with my heartfelt good wishesTomorrow I will be leaving Im not sure where forThis is only naturalWhen there is coming there must be going when there is going there must be comingThis is how the world isWe shouldnt be overjoyed or upset by the changes in the worldThere is happiness and then there is suffering there is suffering and then there is happiness there is gain and then there is loss there is loss and then there is gainThis is the way things areIn the Buddhas time there were disciples of the Buddha who didnt like him because the Buddha exhorted them to be diligent to be heedfulThose who were lazy were afraid of the Buddha and resented himWhen he died one group of disciples cried and were distressed that they would no longer have the Buddha to guide themThese ones were still not cleverAnother group of disciples were pleased and relieved that they would no longer have the Buddha on their backs telling them what to doA third group of disciples were equanimousThey reflected that what arises passes away as a natural consequenceThere were these three groupsWhich group do you identify withDo you want to be one of the pleased ones or whatThe group of disciples who cried when the Buddha passed away had not yet realized the DhammaThe second group were those who resented the BuddhaHe was always forbidding them from doing the things they wanted to doThey lived in fear of the Buddhas scorn and reprimands so when he passed away they were relievedThese days things arent much differentIts possible that the teacher here has some followers who are resentful towards himThey might not show it outwardly but its there in the mindIts normal for people who still have defilements to feel this wayEven the Buddha had people hating himI myself have followers who resent me alsoI tell them to give up evil actions but they cherish their evil actionsSo they hate meThere are plenty like thisMay all of you who are intelligent make yourselves firm in the practice of DhammaSeekers of goodness who have gathered here please listen in peaceListening to the Dhamma in peace means to listen with a onepointed mind paying attention to what you hear and then letting goListening to the Dhamma is of great benefitWhile listening to the Dhamma we are encouraged to firmly establish both body and mind in samadhi because it is one kind of dhamma practiceIn the time of the Buddha people listened to Dhamma talks intently with a mind aspiring to real understanding and some actually realized the Dhamma while listeningThis place is well suited to meditation practiceHaving stayed here a couple of nights I can see that it is an important placeOn the external level it is already peaceful all that remains is the internal level your hearts and mindsSo I ask all of you to make an effort to pay attentionWhy have you gathered here to practice meditationIts because your hearts and minds do not understand what should be understoodIn other words you dont truly know how things are or what is whatYou dont know what is wrong and what is right what it is that brings you suffering and causes you to doubtSo first you have to make yourselves calmThe reason that you have come here to develop calm and restraint is that your hearts and minds are not at easeYour minds are not calm not restrainedThey are swayed by doubting and agitationThis is why you have come here today and are now listening to the DhammaI would like you to concentrate and listen carefully to what I say and I ask permission to speak frankly because thats how I amPlease understand that even if I do speak in a forceful manner I am doing so out of good willI ask your forgiveness if there is anything I say that upsets you because the customs of Thailand and those of the West are not the sameActually speaking a little forcefully can be good because it helps to stir people up who might otherwise be sleepy or drowsy and rather than rousing themselves to hear the Dhamma allow themselves to drift instead into complacency and as a result never understand anythingAlthough there may appear to be many ways to practice really there is only oneAs with fruit trees it is possible to get fruit quickly by planting a cutting but the tree would not be resilient or long lastingAnother way is to cultivate a tree right from the seed which produces a strong and resilient treePractice is the sameWhen I first began to practice I had problems understanding thisAs long as I still didnt know whats what sitting meditation was a real chore even bringing me to tears on occasionSometimes I would be aiming too high at others not high enough never finding the point of balanceTo practice in a way thats peaceful means to place the mind neither too high or too low but at the point of balanceI can see that its very confusing for you coming from different places and having practiced in different ways with different teachersComing to practice here you must be plagued with all kinds of doubtsOne teacher says you must practice in one way another says you should practice another wayYou wonder which method to use unsure of the essence of the practiceThe result is confusionThere are so many teachers and so many teachings that nobody knows how to harmonize their practiceAs a result there is a lot of doubt and uncertaintySo you must try not to think too muchIf you do think then do so with awarenessBut so far your thinking has been done with no awarenessFirst you must make your mind calmWhere there is knowing there is no need to think awareness will arise in its place and this will in turn become wisdomBut the ordinary kind of thinking is not wisdom it is simply the aimless and unaware wandering of the mind which inevitably results in agitationThis is not wisdomAt this stage you dont need to thinkYouve already done a great deal of thinking at home havent youIt just stirs up the heartYou must establish some awarenessObsessive thinking can even bring you tears just try it outGetting lost in some train of thought wont lead you to the truth its not wisdomThe Buddha was a very wise person hed learned how to stop thinkingIn the same way you are practicing here in order to stop thinking and thereby arrive at peaceIf you are already calm it is not necessary to think wisdom will arise in its placeTo meditate you do not have to think much more than to resolve that right now is the time for training the mind and nothing elseDont let the mind shoot off to the left or to the right to the front or behind above or belowOur only duty right now is to practice mindfulness of the breathingFix your attention at the head and move it down through the body to the tips of the feet and then back up to the crown of the headPass your awareness down through the body observing with wisdomWe do this to gain an initial understanding of the way the body isThen begin the meditation noting that at this time your sole duty is to observe the inhalations and exhalationsDont force the breath to be any longer or shorter than normal just allow it to continue easilyDont put any pressure on the breath rather let it flow evenly letting go with each inbreath and outbreathYou must understand that you are letting go as you do this but there should still be awarenessYou must maintain this awareness allowing the breath to enter and leave comfortablyThere is no need to force the breath just allow it to flow easily and naturallyMaintain the resolve that at this time you have no other duties or responsibilitiesThoughts about what will happen what you will know or see during the meditation may arise from time to time but once they arise just let them cease by themselves dont be unduly concerned over themDuring the meditation there is no need to pay attention to sense impressionsWhenever the mind is affected by sense impingement wherever there is a feeling or sensation in the mind just let it goWhether those sensations are good or bad is unimportantIt is not necessary to make anything out of those sensations just let them pass away and return your attention to the breathMaintain the awareness of the breath entering and leavingDont create suffering over the breath being too long or too short simply observe it without trying to control or suppress it in any wayIn other words dont attachAllow the breath to continue as it is and the mind will become calmAs you continue the mind will gradually lay things down and come to rest the breath becoming lighter and lighter until it becomes so faint that it seems like its not there at allBoth the body and the mind will feel light and energizedAll that will remain will be a onepointed knowingYou could say that the mind has changed and reached a state of calmIf the mind is agitated set up mindfulness and inhale deeply till there is no space left to store any air then release it all completely until none remainsFollow this with another deep inhalation until you are full then release the air againDo this two or three times then reestablish concentrationThe mind should be calmerIf any more sense impressions cause agitation in the mind repeat the process on every occasionSimilarly with walking meditationIf while walking the mind becomes agitated stop still calm the mind reestablish the awareness with the meditation object and then continue walkingSitting and walking meditation are in essence the same differing only in terms of the physical posture usedSometimes there may be doubt so you must have sati to be the one who knows continually following and examining the agitated mind in whatever form it takesThis is to have satiSati watches over and takes care of the mindYou must maintain this knowing and not be careless or wander astray no matter what condition the mind takes onThe trick is to have sati taking control and supervising the mindOnce the mind is unified with sati a new kind of awareness will emergeThe mind that has developed calm is held in check by that calm just like a chicken held in a coop the chicken is unable to wander outside but it can still move around within the coopIts walking to and fro doesnt get it into trouble because it is restrained by the coopLikewise the awareness that takes place when the mind has sati and is calm does not cause troubleNone of the thinking or sensations that take place within the calm mind cause harm or disturbanceSome people dont want to experience any thoughts or feelings at all but this is going too farFeelings arise within the state of calmThe mind is both experiencing feelings and calm at the same time without being disturbedWhen there is calm like this there are no harmful consequencesProblems occur when the chicken gets out of the coop For instance you may be watching the breath entering and leaving and then forget yourself allowing the mind to wander away from the breath back home off to the shops or to any number of different placesMaybe even half an hour may pass before you suddenly realize youre supposed to be practicing meditation and reprimand yourself for your lack of satiThis is where you have to be really careful because this is where the chicken gets out of the coop  the mind leaves its base of calmYou must take care to maintain the awareness with sati and try to pull the mind backAlthough I use the words pull the mind back in fact the mind doesnt really go anywhere only the object of awareness has changedYou must make the mind stay right here and nowAs long as there is sati there will be presence of mindIt seems like you are pulling the mind back but really it hasnt gone anywhere it has simply changed a littleIt seems that the mind goes here and there but in fact the change occurs right at the one spotWhen sati is regained in a flash you are back with the mind without it having to be brought from anywhereWhen there is total knowing a continuous and unbroken awareness at each and every moment this is called presence of mindIf your attention drifts from the breath to other places then the knowing is brokenWhenever there is awareness of the breath the mind is thereWith just the breath and this even and continuous awareness you have presence of mindThere must be both sati and sampajaññaSati is recollection and sampajañña is self awarenessRight now you are clearly aware of the breathThis exercise of watching the breath helps sati and sampajañña develop togetherThey share the workHaving both sati and sampajañña is like having two workers to lift a heavy plank of woodSuppose there are two people trying to lift some heavy planks but the weight is so great they have to strain so hard that its almost unendurableThen another person imbued with goodwill sees them and rushes in to helpIn the same way when there is sati and sampajañña then pañña will arise at the same place to help outThen all three of them support each otherWith pañña there will be an understanding of sense objectsFor instance during the meditation sense objects are experienced which give rise to feelings and moodsYou may start to think of a friend but then pañña should immediately counter with It doesnt matter Stop or Forget it Or if there are thoughts about where you will go tomorrow then the response would be Im not interested I dont want to concern myself with such things Maybe you start thinking about other people then you should think No I dont want to get involved Just let go or Its all uncertain and never a sure thing This is how you should deal with things in meditation recognizing them as not sure not sure and maintaining this kind of awarenessYou must give up all the thinking the inner dialogue and the doubtingDont get caught up in these things during the meditationIn the end all that will remain in the mind in its purest form are sati sampajañña and paññawhenever these things weaken doubts will arise but try to abandon those doubts immediately leaving only sati sampajañña and paññaTry to develop sati like this until it can be maintained at all timesThen you will understand sati sampajañña and samadhi thoroughlyFocusing the attention at this point you will see sati sampajañña samadhi and pañña togetherWhether you are attracted to or repelled by external sense objects you will be able to tell yourself Its not sure Either way they are just hindrances to be swept away till the mind is cleanall that should remain is sati recollection sampajañña clear awareness samadhi the firm and unwavering mind and pañña or consummate wisdomFor the time being I will say just this much on the subject of meditationNow about the tools or aids to meditation practice  there should be metta in your heart in other words the qualities of generosity kindness and helpfulnessThese should be maintained as the foundation for mental purityFor example begin doing away with lobha or selfishness through givingWhen people are selfish they arent happySelfishness leads to a sense of discontent and yet people tend to be very selfish without realizing how it affects themYou can experience this at any time especially when you are hungrySuppose you get some apples and you have the opportunity to share them with a friend you think it over for a while and sure the intention to give is there all right but you want to give the smaller oneTo give the big one would be well such a shameIts hard to think straightYou tell them to go ahead and take one but then you say Take this one and give them the smaller appleThis is one form of selfishness that people usually dont noticeHave you ever been like thisYou really have to go against the grain to giveEven though you may really only want to give the smaller apple you must force yourself to give away the bigger oneOf course once you have given it to your friend you feel good insideTraining the mind by going against the grain in this way requires selfdiscipline  you must know how to give and how to give up not allowing selfishness to stickOnce you learn how to give if you are still hesitating over which fruit to give then while you are deliberating you will be troubled and even if you give the bigger one there will still be a sense of reluctanceBut as soon as you firmly decide to give the bigger one the matter is over and done withThis is going against the grain in the right wayDoing this you win mastery over yourselfIf you cant do it you will be a victim of yourself and continue to be selfishAll of us have been selfish in the pastThis is a defilement which needs to be cut offIn the Pali scriptures giving is called dana which means bringing happiness to othersIt is one of those conditions which help to cleanse the mind from defilementReflect on this and develop it in your practiceYou may think that practicing like this involves hounding yourself but it doesnt reallyActually its hounding craving and the defilementsIf defilements arise within you you have to do something to remedy themDefilements are like a stray catIf you give it as much food as it wants it will always be coming around looking for more food but if you stop feeding it after a couple of days itll stop coming aroundIts the same with the defilements they wont come to disturb you theyll leave your mind in peaceSo rather than being afraid of defilement make the defilements afraid of youTo make the defilements afraid of you you must see the Dhamma within your mindsWhere does the Dhamma ariseIt arises with our knowing and understanding in this wayEveryone is able to know and understand the DhammaIts not something that has to be found in books you dont have to do a lot of study to see it just reflect right now and you can see what I am talking aboutEverybody can see it because it exists right within our heartsEverybody has defilements dont theyIf you are able to see them then you can understandIn the past youve looked after and pampered your defilements but now you must know your defilements and not allow them to come and bother youThe next constituent of practice is moral restraintSila watches over and nurtures the practice in the same way as parents look after their childrenMaintaining moral restraint means not only to avoid harming others but also to help and encourage themAt the very least you should maintain the five precepts which areTo be honest refraining from infringing on the rights of others in other words not stealingKnowing moderation in sexual relations In the household life there exists the family structure based around husband and wifeKnow who your husband or wife is know moderation know the proper bounds of sexual activitySome people dont know the limitsOne husband or wife isnt enough they have to have a second or thirdThe way I see it you cant consume even one partner completely so to have two or three is just plain indulgenceYou must try to cleanse the mind and train it to know moderationKnowing moderation is true purity without it there are no limits to your behaviorWhen eating delicious food dont dwell too much on how it tastes think of your stomach and consider how much is appropriate to its needsIf you eat too much you get trouble so you must know moderationModeration is the best wayJust one partner is enough two or three is an indulgence and will only cause problemsTo be honest in speech  this is also a tool for eradicating defilementsYou must be honest and straight truthful and uprightTo refrain from taking intoxicantsYou must know restraint and preferably give these things up altogetherPeople are already intoxicated enough with their families relatives and friends material possessions wealth and all the rest of itThats quite enough already without making things worse by taking intoxicants as wellThese things just create darkness in the mindthose who take large amounts should try to gradually cut down and eventually give it up altogetherMaybe I should ask your forgiveness but my speaking in this way is out of a concern for your benefit so that you can understand that which is goodYou need to know what is whatWhat are the things that are oppressing you in your everyday livesWhat are the actions which cause this oppressionGood actions bring good results and bad actions bring bad resultsThese are the causesOnce moral restraint is pure there will be a sense of honesty and kindness towards othersThis will bring about contentment and freedom from worries and remorseRemorse resulting from aggressive and hurtful behavior will not be thereThis is form of happinessIt is almost like a heavenly stateThere is comfort you eat and sleep in comfort with the happiness arising from moral restraintThis is the result maintaining moral restraint is the causeThis is a principle of Dhamma practice  refraining from bad actions so that goodness can ariseIf moral restraint is maintained in this way evil will disappear and good will arise in its placeThis is the result of right practiceBut this isnt the end of the storyOnce people have attained some happiness they tend to be heedless and not go any further in the practiceThey get stuck on happinessThey dont want to progress any further they prefer the happiness of heaven Its comfortable but theres no real understandingYou must keep reflecting to avoid being deludedReflect again and again on the disadvantages of this happinessIts transient it doesnt last foreverSoon you are separated from itIts not a sure thing once happiness disappears then suffering arises in its place and the tears come againEven heavenly beings end up crying and sufferingSo the Lord Buddha taught us to reflect on the disadvantages that there exists an unsatisfactory side to happinessUsually when this kind of happiness is experienced there is no real understanding of itThe peace that is truly certain and lasting is covered over by this deceptive happinessThis happiness is not a certain or permanent kind of peace but rather a form of defilement a refined form of defilement to which we attachEverybody likes to be happyHappiness arises because of our liking for somethingAs soon as that liking changes to dislike suffering arisesWe must reflect on this happiness to see its uncertainty and limitationOnce things change suffering arisesThis suffering is also uncertain dont think that it is fixed or absoluteThis kind of reflection is called Adinavakathathe reflection on the inadequacy and limitation of the conditioned worldThis means to reflect on happiness rather than accepting it at face valueSeeing that it is uncertain you shouldnt cling fast to itYou should take hold of it but then let it go seeing both the benefit and the harm of happinessTo meditate skillfully you have to see the disadvantages inherent within happinessReflect in this wayWhen happiness arises contemplate it thoroughly until the disadvantages become apparentWhen you see that things are imperfect your heart will come to understand the Nekkhammakatha the reflection on renunciationThe mind will become disinterested and seek for a way outDisinterest comes from having seen the way forms really are the way tastes really are the way love and hatred really areBy disinterest we mean that there is no longer the desire to cling to or attach to thingsThere is a withdrawal from clinging to a point where you can abide comfortably observing with an equanimity that is free of attachmentThis is the peace that arises from practiceMost people still dont know the essence of meditation practiceThey think that walking meditation sitting meditation and listening to Dhamma talks are the practiceThats true too but these are only the outer forms of practiceThe real practice takes place when the mind encounters a sense objectThats the place to practice where sense contact occursWhen people say things we dont like there is resentment if they say things we like we experience pleasureNow this is the place to practiceHow are we going to practice with these thingsThis is the crucial pointIf we just run around chasing after happiness and away from suffering all the time we can practice until the day we die and never see the DhammaThis is uselessWhen pleasure and pain arise how are we going to use the Dhamma to be free of themThis is the point of practiceUsually when people encounter something disagreeable to them they dont open up to itSuch as when people are criticized Dont bother meWhy blame me This is someone whos closed himself offRight there is the place to practiceWhen people criticize us we should listenAre they speaking the truthWe should be open and consider what they sayMaybe there is a point to what they say perhaps there is something blameworthy within usThey may be right and yet we immediately take offenseIf people point out our faults we should strive to be rid of them and improve ourselvesThis is how intelligent people will practiceWhere there is confusion is where peace can ariseWhen confusion is penetrated with understanding what remains is peaceSome people cant accept criticism theyre arrogantInstead they turn around and argueThis is especially so when adults deal with childrenActually children may say some intelligent things sometimes but if you happen to be their mother for instance you cant give in to themIf you are a teacher your students may sometimes tell you something you didnt know but because you are the teacher you cant listenThis is not right thinkingIn the Buddhas time there was one disciple who was very astuteAt one time as the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma he turned to this monk and asked Sariputta do you believe this Venerable Sariputta replied No I dont yet believe it The Buddha praised his answerThats very good Sariputta you are one who us endowed with wisdomOne who is wise doesnt readily believe he listens with an open mind and then weighs up the truth of that matter before believing or disbelievingNow the Buddha here has set a fine example for a teacherWhat Venerable Sariputta said was true he simply spoke his true feelingsSome people would think that to say you didnt believe that teaching would be like questioning the teachers authority theyd be afraid to say such a thingTheyd just go ahead and agreeThis is how the worldly way goesBut the Buddha didnt take offenseHe said that you neednt be ashamed of those things which arent wrong or badIts not wrong to say that you dont believe if you dont believeThats why Venerable Sariputta said I dont yet believe it The Buddha praised himThis monk has much wisdomHe carefully considers before believing anything The Buddhas actions here are a good example for one who is a teacher of othersSometimes you can learn things even from small children dont cling blindly to positions of authorityWhether you are standing sitting or walking around in various places you can always study the things around youWe study in the natural way receptive to all things be they sights sounds smells tastes feelings or thoughtsThe wise person considers them allIn the real practice we come to the point where there are no longer any concerns weighing on the mindIf we still dont know like and dislike as they arise there is still some concern in our mindsIf we know the truth of these things we reflect Oh there is nothing to this feeling of liking hereIts just a feeling that arises and passes awayDislike is nothing more just a feeling that arises and passes awayWhy make anything out of them If we think that pleasure and pain are personal possessions then were in for trouble we never get beyond the point of having some concern or other in an endless chainThis is how things are for most peopleBut these days they dont often talk about the mind when teaching the Dhamma they dont talk about the truthIf you talk the truth people even take exceptionThey say things like He doesnt know time and place he doesnt know how to speak nicely But people should listen to the truthA true teacher doesnt just talk from memory he speaks the truthPeople in society usually speak from memory he speaks the truthPeople in the society usually speak from memory and whats more they usually speak in such a way as to exalt themselvesThe true monk doesnt talk like that he talks the truth the way things areNo matter how much he explains the truth its difficult for people to understandIts hard to understand the DhammaIf you understand the Dhamma you should practice accordinglyIt may not be necessary to become a monk although the monks life is the ideal form for practiceTo really practice you have to forsake the confusion of the world give up family and possessions and take to the forestsThese are the ideal places to practiceBut if we still have family and responsibilities how are we to practiceSome people say its impossible to practice Dhamma as a laypersonConsider which group is larger monks or laypeopleThere are far more laypeopleNow if only the monks practice and laypeople dont then that means theres going to be a lot of confusionThis is wrong understandingI cant become a monk Becoming a monk isnt the pointBeing a monk doesnt mean anything if you dont practiceIf you really understand the practice of dhamma then no matter what position or profession you hold in life be it a teacher doctor civil servant or whatever you can practice the Dhamma every minute of the dayTo think you cant practice as a layman is to lose track of the path completelyWhy is it people can find the incentive to do other thingsIf they feel they are lacking something they make an effort to obtain itIf there is sufficient desire people can do anythingsome say I havent got time to practice the Dhamma I say Then how come youve got time to breathe Breathing is vital to peoples livesIf they saw Dhamma practice as vital to their lives they would see it as important as their breathingThe practice of dhamma isnt something you have to go running around for or exhaust yourself overJust look at the feelings which arise in your mindWhen the eye sees form ear hears sounds nose smells odors and so on they all come to this one mind the one who knows Now when the mind perceives these things what happensIf we like that object we experience pleasure if we dislike it we experience displeasureThats all there is to itSo where are you going to find happiness in this worldDo you expect everybody to say only pleasant things to you all your lifeIs that possibleNo its notIf its not possible then where are you going to goThe world is simply like this we must know the world  Lokavidu  know the truth of this worldThe world is something we should clearly understandThe Buddha lived in this world he didnt live anywhere elseHe experienced family life but he saw its limitations and detached himself from themNow how are you as laypeople going to practiceIf you want to practice you must make an effort to follow the pathIf you persevere with the practice you too will see the limitations of this world and be able to let goPeople who drink alcohol sometimes say I just cant give it up Why cant they give it upBecause they dont yet see the liability in itIf they clearly saw the liability of it they wouldnt have to wait to be told to give it upIf you dont see the liability of something that means you also cant see the benefit of giving it upYour practice becomes fruitless you are just playing at practiceIf you clearly see the liability and the benefit of something you wont have to wait for others to tell you about itConsider the story of the fisherman who finds something in his fishtrapHe knows something is in there he can hear it flapping about insideThinking its a fish he reaches his hand into the trap only to find a different kind of animalHe cant yet see it so hes in two minds about itOn one hand it could be an eel but then again it could be a snakeIf he throws it away he may regret it it could be an eelOn the other hand if he keeps holding on to it and it turns out to be a snake it may bite himHes caught in a state of doubtHis desire is so strong he holds on just in case its an eel but the minute he brings it and sees the striped skin he throws it down straight awayHe doesnt have to wait for someone to call out Its a snake its a snake let go The sight of the snake tells him what to do much more clearly than words could doWhyBecause he sees the danger  snakes can biteWho has to tell him about itIn the same way if we practice till we see things as they are we wont meddle with things that are harmfulPeople dont usually practice in this way they usually practice for other thingsThey dont contemplate things they dont reflect on old age sickness and deathThey only talk about nonaging and nondeath so they never develop the right feeling for Dhamma practiceThey go and listen to Dhamma talks but they dont really listenSometimes I get invited to give talks at important functions but its a nuisance for me to goWhy soBecause when I look at the people gathered there I can see that they havent come to listen to the DhammaSome are smelling of alcohol some are smoking cigarettes some are chatting they dont look at all like people who have come out of faith in the DhammaGiving talks at such places is of little fruitPeople who are sunk in heedlessness tend to think things like When hes ever going to stop talking Cant do this cant do that and their minds just wander all over the placeSometimes they even invite me to give a talk just for the sake of formality Please give us just a small Dhamma talk Venerable Sir They dont want me to talk too much it might annoy themAs soon as I hear people say this I know what theyre aboutThese people dont like listening to DhammaIt annoys themIf I just give a small talk they wont understandIf you take only a little food is it enoughOf course notSometimes Im giving a talk just warming up to the subject and some drunkard will call out Okay make way make way for the Venerable Sir hes coming out now  trying to drive me awayIf I meet this kind of person I get a lot of food for reflection I get an insight into human natureIts like a person having a bottle full of water and then asking for moreTheres nowhere to put itIt isnt worth the time and energy to teach them because their minds are already fullPour any more in and it just overflows uselesslyIf their bottle was empty there would be somewhere to put the water and both the giver and the receiver would benefitIn this way when people are really interested in Dhamma and sit quietly listening carefully I feel more inspired to teachIf people dont pay attention its just like the man with the bottle full of water theres no room to put anymoreIts hardly worth my while talking to themIn situations like this I just dont get any energy arising to teachYou cant put much energy into giving when noones putting much energy into receivingThese days giving talks tends to be like this and its getting worse all the timePeople dont search for truth they study simply to find the necessary knowledge to make a living raise families and look after themselvesThey study for a livelihoodThere may be some study of Dhamma but not muchStudents nowadays have much more knowledge than students of previous timesThey have all the requisites at their disposal everything is more convenientBut they also have a lot more confusion and suffering than beforeWhy is thisBecause they only look for the kind of knowledge used to make a livingEven the monks are like thisSometimes I hear them say I didnt become a monk to practice the Dhamma I only ordained to study These are the words of someone who has completely cut off the path of practiceTheres no way ahead its a dead endWhen these monks teach its only from memoryThey may teach one thing but their minds are in completely different placeSuch teachings arent trueThis is how the world isIf you try to live simply practicing the Dhamma and living peacefully they say you are weird and antisocialThey say youre obstructing progress in societyThey even intimidate youEventually you might even start to believe them and revert to the worldly ways sinking deeper and deeper into the world until its impossible to get outSome people say I cant get out now Ive gone in to deeply This is how society tends to beIt doesnt appreciate the value of DhammaThe value of Dhamma isnt to be found in booksthose are just the external appearances of Dhamma theyre not the realization of Dhamma as a personal experienceIf you realize the Dhamma you realize your own mind you see the truth thereWhen the truth becomes apparent it cuts off the stream of delusionThe teaching of the Buddha is the unchanging truth whether in the present or in any other timeThe Buddha revealed this truth years ago and its been the truth ever sinceThis teaching should not be added to or taken away fromThe Buddha said What the Tathagata has laid down should not be discarded what has not been laid down by the Tathagata should not be added on to the teachings He sealed off the TeachingsWhy did the Buddha seal them offBecause these Teachings are the words of one who has no defilementsNo matter how the world may change these Teachings are unaffected they dont change with itIf something is wrong even if people say its right doesnt make it any the less wrongIf something is right it doesnt change any just because people say its notGeneration after generation may come and go but these things dont change because these Teachings are the truthNow who created this truthThe truth itself created the truthDid the Buddha create itNo he didntThe Buddha only discovered the truth the way things are and then he set out to declare itThe truth is constantly true whether a Buddha arises in the world or notThe Buddha only owns the Dhamma in this sense he didnt actually create itIts been here all the timeHowever previously noone had searched for and found the Deathless then taught it as the DhammaHe didnt invent it it was already thereAt some point in time the truth is illuminated and the practice of Dhamma flourishesAs time goes on and generations pass away the practice degenerates until the Teaching fades away completelyAfter a time the Teaching is refounded and flourishes once moreAs time goes on the adherents of the Dhamma multiply prosperity sets in and once more the Teaching begins to follow the darkness of the worldAnd so once more it degenerates until such a time as it can no longer hold groundConfusion reigns once moreThen it is time to reestablish the truthIn fact the truth doesnt go anywhereWhen Buddhas pass away the Dhamma doesnt disappear with themThe world revolves like thisIts something like a mango treeThe tree matures blossoms and fruits appear and grow to ripenessThey become rotten and the seed goes back into the ground to become a new mango treeThe cycle starts once moreEventually there are more ripe fruits which proceed to fall rot sink into the ground as seeds and grow once more into treesThis is how the world isIt doesnt go very far it just revolves around the same old thingsOur lives these days are the sameToday we are simply doing the same old things weve always donePeople think too muchThere are so many things for them to get interested in but none of them leads to completionThere are the sciences like mathematics physics psychology and so onYou can delve into any number of them but you can only finalize things with the truthSuppose there was a cart being pulled by an oxThe wheels arent long but the tracks areAs long as the ox pulls the cart the tracks will followThe wheels are round yet the tracks are long the tracks are long yet the wheels are merely circlesJust looking at a stationary cart you cant see anything long about it but once the ox starts moving you see the tracks stretching out behind youAs long as the ox pulls the wheels keep on turning but there comes a day when the ox tires and throws off its harnessThe ox walks off and leaves the empty cart sitting thereThe wheels no longer turnIn time the cart falls apart its components go back into the four elements  earth water wind and fireSearching for peace within the world you stretch the cart wheel tracks endlessly behind youAs long as you follow the world there is no stopping no restIf you simply stop following it the cart comes to rest the wheels no longer turnFollowing the world turns the wheels ceaselesslyCreating bad kamma is like thisAs long as you follow the old ways there is no stoppingIf you stop there is stoppingThis is how we practice the DhammaThere are two ways to support BuddhismOne is known as amisapuja supporting through material offeringsThese are the four requisites of food clothing shelter and medicineThis is to support Buddhism by giving material offerings to the Sangha of monks and nuns enabling them to live in reasonable comfort for the practice of DhammaThis fosters the direct realization of the Buddhas teaching in turn bringing continued prosperity to the Buddhist religionBuddhism can be likened to a treeA tree has roots a trunk branches twigs and leavesAll the leaves and branches including the trunk depend on the roots to absorb nutriment from the soil and send it out to themIn the same way as the tree depends on the roots to sustain it our actions and our speech are like branches and leaves which depend on the mind the root absorbing nutriment which it then sends it out to the trunk branches and leaves These in turn bear fruit as our speech and actionsWhatever state the mind is in skillful or unskillful it expresses that quality outwardly through our actions and speechTherefore the support of Buddhism through the practical application of the teaching is the most important kind of supportFor example in the ceremony of determining the precepts on observance days the Teacher describes those unskillful actions which should be avoidedBut if you simply go through the ceremony of determining the precepts without reflecting on their meaning progress is difficultYou will be unable to find the true practiceThe real support of Buddhism must therefore be done through patipattipuja the offering of practice cultivating true restraint concentration and wisdomThen you will know what Buddhism is all aboutIf you dont understand through practice you still wont know even if you learn the whole TipitakaIn the time of the Buddha there was a monk known as Tuccho PothilaTuccho Pothila was very learned thoroughly versed in the scriptures and textsHe was so famous that he was revered by people everywhere and had eighteen monasteries under his careWhen people heard the name Tuccho Pothila they were awestruck and nobody would dare question anything he taught so much did they revere his command of the teachingsTuccho Pothila was one of the Buddhas most learned disciplesOne day he went to pay respects to the BuddhaAs he was paying his respects the Buddha said Ah hello Venerable Empty Scripture just like thatThey conversed for a while until it was time to go and then as he was taking leave of the Buddha the Buddha said Oh leaving now Venerable Empty ScriptureThat was all the Buddha saidOn arriving Oh hello Venerable Empty Scripture When it was time to go Ah leaving now Venerable Empty Scripture The Buddha didnt expand on it that was all the teaching he gaveTuccho Pothila the eminent teacher was puzzled  Why did the Buddha say thatWhat did he mean He thought and thought turning over everything he had learned until eventually he realized Its trueVenerable Empty Scripture  a monk who studies but doesnt practice When he looked into his heart he saw that really he was no different from laypeopleWhatever they aspired to he also aspired to whatever they enjoyed he also enjoyedThere was no real samana within him no truly profound quality capable of firmly establishing him in the Noble Way and providing true peaceSo he decided to practiceBut there was nowhere for him to go toAll the teachers around were his own students noone would dare accept himUsually when people meet their teacher they become timid and deferential and so noone would dare to become his teacherFinally he went to see a certain young novice who was enlightened and asked to practice under himThe novice said Yes sure you can practice with me but only if youre sincereIf youre not sincere then I wont accept you Tuccho Pothila pledged himself as a student of the noviceThe novice then told him to put on all his robesNow there happened to be a muddy bog nearbyWhen Tuccho Pothila had neatly put on all his robes expensive ones they were too the novice said Okay now run down into this muddy bogIf I dont tell you to stop dont stopIf I dont tell you to come out dont come outOkay runTuccho Pothila neatly robed plunged into the bogThe novice didnt tell him to stop until he was completely covered in mudFinally he said You can stop now So he stoppedOkay come on up And so he came outThis clearly showed that Tuccho Pothila had given up his prideHe was ready to accept the teachingIf he wasnt ready to learn he wouldnt have run into the bog like that being such a famous teacher but he did itThe young novice seeing this knew that Tuccho Pothila was sincerely determined to practiceWhen Tuccho Pothila had come out of the bog the novice gave him the teachingHe taught him to observe the sense objects to know the mind and to know the sense objects using the simile of a man catching a lizard hiding in a termite moundIf the mound had six holes in it how would he catch itHe would have to seal off five of the holes and leave just one openThen he would have to simply watch and wait guarding that one holeWhen the lizard ran out he could catch itObserving the mind is like thisClosing off the eyes ears nose tongue and body we leave only the mindTo close off the senses means to restrain and compose them observing only the mindMeditation is like catching the lizardWe use sati to note the breathSati is the quality of recollection as in asking yourself What am I doing Sampajañña is the awareness that now I am doing such and such We observe the in and out breathing with sati and sampajaññaThis quality of recollection is something that arises from practice its not something that can be learned from booksKnow the feelings that ariseThe mind may be fairly inactive for a while and then a feeling arisesSati works in conjunction with these feelings recollecting themThere is sati the recollection that I will speak I will go I will sit and so on and then there is sampajañña the awareness that now I am walking I am lying down I am experiencing such and such a mood With these two things sati and sampajañña we can know our minds in the present momentWe will know how the mind reacts to sense impressionsThat which is aware of sense objects is called mind Sense objects wander in to the mindFor instance there is a sound like the electric planer hereIt enters through the ear and travels inwards to the mind which acknowledges that it is the sound of an electric planerThat which acknowledges the sound is called mindNow this mind which acknowledges the sound is still quite basicIts just the average mindPerhaps annoyance arises within this one who acknowledgesWe must further train the one who acknowledges to become the one who knows in accordance with the truth  known as BuddhoIf we dont clearly know in accordance with the truth then we get annoyed at sounds of people cars electric planer and so onThis is just the ordinary untrained mind acknowledging the sound with annoyanceIt knows in accordance with its preferences not in accordance with the truthWe must further train it to know with vision and insight ñanadassana the power of the refined mind so that it knows the sound as simply soundIf we dont cling to sound there is annoyanceThe sound arises and we simply note itThis is called truly knowing the arising of sense objectsIf we develop the Buddho clearly realizing the sound as sound then it doesnt annoy usIt arises according to conditions it is not a being an individual a self an us or them Its just soundThe mind lets goThis knowing is called Buddho the knowledge that is clear and penetratingWith this knowledge we can let the sound be simply soundIt doesnt disturb us unless we disturb it by thinking I dont want to hear that sound its annoying Suffering arises because of this thinkingRight here is the cause of suffering that we dont know the truth of this matter we havent developed the BuddhoWe are not yet clear not yet awake not yet awareThis is the raw untrained mindThis mind is not yet truly useful to usTherefore the Buddha taught that this mind must be trained and developedWe must develop the mind just like we develop the body but we do it in different wayTo develop the body we must exercise it jogging in the morning and evening and so onThis is exercising the bodyAs a result the body becomes more agile stronger the respiratory and nervous systems become more efficientTo exercise the mind we dont have to move it around but bring it to a halt bring it to restFor instance when practicing meditation we take an object such as the in and out breathing as our foundationThis becomes the focus of our attention and reflectionWe note the breathingTo note the breathing means to follow the breathing with awareness noting its rhythm its coming and goingWe put awareness into the breath following the natural in and out breathing and letting go of all elseAs a result of staying on one object of awareness our mind becomes refreshedIf we let the mind think of this that and the other there are many objects of awareness the mind doesnt unify it doesnt come to restTo say the mind stops means that it feels as if its stopped it doesnt go running here and thereIts like having a sharp knifeIf we use the knife to cut at things indiscriminately such as stones bricks and grass our knife will quickly become bluntWe should use it for cutting only the things it was meant forOur mind is the sameIf we let the mind wander after thoughts and feelings which have no value or use the mind becomes tired and weak If the mind has no energy wisdom will not arise because the mind without energy is the mind without samadhiIf the mind hasnt stopped you cant clearly see the sense objects for what they areThe knowledge that the mind is the mind sense objects are merely sense objects is the root from which Buddhism has grown and developedThis is the heart of BuddhismWe must cultivate this mind develop it training it in calm and insightWe train the mind to have restraint and wisdom by letting the mind stop and allowing wisdom to arise by knowing the mind as it isYou know the way we human beings are the way we do things are just like little childrenA child doesnt know anythingTo an adult observing the behavior of a child the way it plays and jumps around its actions dont seem to have much purposeIf our mind is untrained it is like a childWe speak without awareness and act without wisdomWe may fall to ruin or cause untold harm and not even know itA child is ignorant it plays as children doOur ignorant mind is the sameSo we should train this mindThe Buddha taught to train the mind to teach the mindEven if we support Buddhism with the four requisites our support is still superficial it reaches only the bark or sapwood of the treeThe real support of Buddhism must be done through the practice nowhere else training our actions speech and thoughts according to the teachingsThis is much more fruitfulIf we are straight and honest possessed of restraint and wisdom our practice will bring prosperityThere will be no cause for spite and hostilityThis is how our religion teaches usIf we determine the precepts simply out of tradition then even though the Master teaches the truth our practice will be deficientWe may be able to study the teachings and repeat them but we have to practice them if we really want to understandIf we do not develop the practice this may well be an obstacle to our penetrating to the heart of Buddhism for countless lifetimes to comeWe will not understand the essence of the Buddhist religionTherefore the practice is like a key the key of meditationIf we have the right key in our hand no matter how tightly the lock is closed when we take the key and turn it the lock falls openIf we have no key we cant open the lockWe will never know what it is in the trunkActually there are two kinds of knowledgeOne who knows the Dhamma doesnt simply speak from memory he speaks the truthWorldly people usually speak with conceitFor example suppose there were two people who hadnt seen each other for a long time maybe they had gone to live in different provinces or countries for a while and then one day they happened to meet on the train OhWhat a surpriseI was just thinking of looking you up Actually its not trueReally they hadnt thought of each other at all but they say so out of excitementAnd so it becomes a lieYes its lying out of heedlessnessThis is lying without knowing itIts a subtle form of defilement and it happens very oftenSo with regard to the mind Tuccho Pothila followed the instructions of the novice breathing in breathing out mindfully aware of each breath until he saw the liar within him the lying of his own mindHe saw the defilements as they came up just like the lizard coming out of the termite moundHe saw them and perceived their true nature as soon as they aroseHe noticed how one minute the mind would concoct one thing the next moment something elseThinking is a sankhata dhamma something which is created or concocted from supporting conditionsIts not asankhata dhamma the unconditionedThe welltrained mind one with perfect awareness does not concoct mental statesThis kind of mind penetrates to the Noble Truths and transcends any need to depend on externalsTo know the Noble Truths is to know the truthThe proliferating mind tries to avoid this truth saying thats good or this is beautiful but if there is Buddho in the mind it can no longer deceive us because we know the mind as it isThe mind can no longer create deluded mental states because there is the clear awareness that all mental states are unstable imperfect and a source of suffering to one who clings to themWherever he went the one who knows was constantly in Tuccho Pothilas mindHe observed the various creations and proliferation of the mind with understandingHe saw how the mind lied in so many waysHe grasped the essence of the practice seeing that This lying mind is the one to watch  this is the one which leads us into extremes of happiness and suffering and causes us to endlessly spin around in the cycle of Samsara with its pleasure and pain good and evil  all because of this one Tuccho Pothila realized the truth and grasped the essence of the practice just like a man grasping the tail of the lizardHe saw the workings of the deluded mindFor us its the sameOnly this mind is importantThats why they say to train the mindNow if the mind is the mind what are we going to train it withBy having continuous sati and sampajañña we will be able to know the mindThis one who knows is a step beyond the mind it is that which knows the state of the mindThe mind is the mindThat which knows the mind as simply mind is the one who knowsIt is above the mindThe one who knows is above the mind and that is how it is able to look after the mind to teach the mind to know what is right and what is wrongIn the end everything comes back to this proliferating mindIf the mind is caught up in its proliferations there is no awareness and the practice is fruitlessSo we must train this mind to hear the Dhamma to cultivate the Buddho the clear and radiant awareness that which exists above and beyond the ordinary mind and knows all that goes on within itThis is why we meditate on the word Buddho so that we can know the mind beyond the mindJust observe all the minds movements whether good or bad until the one who realizes that the mind is simply mind not a self or a personThis is called cittanupassana Contemplation of MindSeeing in this way we will understand that the mind is Transient Imperfect and OwnerlessThis mind doesnt belong to usWe can summarize thus The mind is that which acknowledges sense objects sense objects are sense objects as distinct from the mind the one who knows both the mind and the sense objects for what they areWe must use sati to constantly cleanse the mindEverybody has sati even a cat has it when its going to catch a mouseA dog has it when it barks at peopleThis is a form of sati but its not sati according to the DhammaEverybody has sati but there are different levels of it just as there are different levels of looking at thingsLike when I say to contemplate the body some people say What is there to contemplate in the bodyAnybody can see itKesa we can see already loma we can see already hair nails teeth and skin we can see alreadySo whatThis is how people areThey can see the body alright but their seeing is faulty they dont see with the Buddho the one who knows the awakened oneThey only see the body in the ordinary way they see it visuallySimply to see the body is not enoughIf we only see the body there is troubleYou must see the body within the body then things become much clearerJust seeing the body you get fooled by it charmed by its appearanceNot seeing Transience Imperfection and Ownerlessness kamachanda arisesYou become fascinated by forms sounds odors flavors and feelingsSeeing in this way is to see with the mundane eye of the flesh causing you to love and hate and discriminate into pleasing and unpleasingThe Buddha taught that this is not enoughYou must see with the minds eye See the body within the bodyIf you really look into the body UghIts so repulsiveThere are todays things and yesterdays things all mixed up in there you cant tell whats whatSeeing in this way is much clearer than to see with the carnal eyeContemplate see with the eye of the mind with the wisdom eyePeoples understandings differ like thisSome people dont know what there is to contemplate in the Five Meditations head hair body hair nails teeth and skinThey say they can see all those things already but they can only see them with the carnal eye with this crazy eye which only looks at the things it wants to look atTo see the body in the body you have to look much clearer than thatThis is the practice that can uproot clinging to the Five KhandhasTo uproot attachment is to uproot suffering because attaching to the Five Khandhas is the cause of sufferingIf suffering arises it is here at the attachment to the Five KhandhasIts not that the Five Khandhas are in themselves suffering but the clinging to them as being ones own thats sufferingIf you clearly see the truth of these things through meditation practice then suffering becomes unwound like a screw or a boltWhen the bolt is unwound it withdrawsThe mind unwinds in the same way letting go withdrawing from the obsession with good and evil possessions praise and status happiness and sufferingIf we dont know the truth of these things its like tightening the screw all the timeIt gets tighter and tighter until its crushing you and you suffer over everythingWhen you know how things are then you unwind the screwIn Dhamma language we call this the arising of nibbida disenchantmentYou become weary of things and lay down the fascination with themIf you unwind in this way you will find peaceThe cause of suffering is to cling to thingsSo we should get rid of the cause cut off its root and not allow it to cause suffering againPeople have only one problem  the problem of clingingJust because of this one thing people will kill each otherAll problems be they individual family or social arise from this one rootNobody wins they kill each other but in the end noone gets anythingI dont know why people keep on killing each other so pointlesslyPower possessions status praise happiness and suffering these are the worldly dhammasThese worldly dhammas engulf worldly beingsWorldly beings are led around by the worldly dhammas gain and loss acclaim and slander status and loss of status happiness and sufferingThese dhammas are trouble makers if you dont reflect on their true nature you will sufferPeople even commit murder for the sake of wealth status or powerWhyBecause they take them too seriouslyThey get appointed to some position and it goes to their heads like the man who became headman of the villageAfter his appointment he became powerdrunk If any of his old friends came to see hed say Dont come around so oftenThings arent the same anymoreThe Buddha taught to understand the nature of possessions status praise and happinessTake these things as they come but let them beDont let them go to your headIf you dont really understand these things you become fooled by your power your children and relatives by everythingIf you understand them clearly you know theyre all impermanent conditionsIf you cling to them they become defiledAll of these things arise afterwardsWhen people are first born there are simply nama and rupa thats allWe add on the business of MrJones Miss Smith or whatever later onThis is done according to conventionStill later there are the appendages of Colonel General and so onIf we dont really understand these things we think they are real and carry them around with usWe carry possessions status name and rank aroundIf you have power you can call all the tunes Take this one and execute himTake that one and throw him in jail Rank gives powerThis word rank here is where clinging takes holdAs soon as people get rank they start giving orders right or wrong they just act on their moodsSo they go on making the same old mistakes deviating further and further from the true pathOne who understands the Dhamma wont behave like thisGood and evil have been in the world since who knows whenIf possessions and status come your way then let them simply be the possessions and status dont let them become your identityJust use them to fulfill your obligations and leave it at thatYou remain unchangedIf we have meditated on these things no matter what comes our way we will not be fooled by itWe will be untroubled unaffected constantEverything is pretty much the same after allThis is how the Buddha wanted us to understand thingsNo matter what you receive the mind adds nothing on to itThey appoint you a city councilor Okay so Im a city councilor but Im not They appoint you head of the group Sure I am but Im not Whatever they make of you Yes I am but Im not In the end what are we anywayWe all just die in the endNo matter what they make you in the end its all the sameWhat can you sayIf you can see things in this way you will have a solid abiding and true contentmentNothing is changedThis is not to be fooled by thingsWhatever comes your way its just conditionsTheres nothing which can entice a mind like this to create or proliferate to seduce it into greed aversion or delusionNow this is to be a true supporter of BuddhismWhether you are among those who are being supported or those who are supporting please consider this thoroughlyCultivate the SilaDhamma within youThis is the surest way to support BuddhismTo support Buddhism with the offerings of food shelter and medicine is good also but such offerings only reach the sapwood of BuddhismPlease dont forget thisA tree has bark sapwood and heartwood and these three parts are interdependentThe heartwood must rely on the bark and the sapwoodThe sapwood relies on the bark and the heartwoodThey all exist interdependently just like the teachings of Moral Discipline Concentration and WisdomMoral Discipline is to establish your speech and actions in rectitudeConcentration is to firmly fix the mindWisdom is the thorough understanding of the nature of all conditionsStudy this practice this and you will understand Buddhism in the most profound wayIf you dont realize these things you will be fooled by possessions fooled by rank fooled by anything you come into contact withSimply supporting Buddhism in the external way will never put an end to the fighting and squabbling the grudges and animosity the stabbing and shootingIf these things are to cease we must reflect on the nature of possessions rank praise happiness and sufferingWe must consider our lives and bring them in line with the TeachingWe should reflect that all beings in the world are part of one wholeWe are like them they are like usThey have happiness and suffering just like we doIts all much the sameIf we reflect in this way peace and understanding will ariseThis is the foundation of BuddhismNow please pay attention not allowing your mind to wander off after other thingsCreate the feeling that right now you are sitting on a mountain or in a forest somewhere all by yourselfWhat do you have sitting here right nowThere are body and mind thats all only these two thingsAll that is contained within this frame sitting here now is called body The mind is that which is aware and is thinking at this very momentThese two things are also called nama and rupa Nama refers to that which has no rupa or formAll thoughts and feelings or the four mental khandhas of feeling perception volition and consciousness are nama they are all formlessWhen the eye sees form that form is called rupa while the awareness is called namaTogether they are called nama and rupa or simply body and mindUnderstand that sitting here in this present moment are only body and mindBut we get these two things confused with each otherIf you want peace you must know the truth of themThe mind in its present state is still untrained its dirty not clearIt is not yet the pure mindWe must further train this mind through the practice of meditationSome people think that meditation means to sit in some special way but in actual fact standing sitting walking and reclining are all vehicles for meditation practiceYou can practice at all timesSamadhi literally means the firmly established mind To develop samadhi you dont have to go bottling the mind upSome people try to get peaceful by sitting quietly and having nothing disturb them at all but thats just like being deadThe practice of samadhi is for developing wisdom and understandingSamadhi is the firm mind the onepointed mindOn which point is it fixedIts fixed onto the point of balanceThats its pointBut people practice meditation by trying to silence their mindsThey say I try to sit in meditation but my mind wont be still for a minuteOne instant it flies off one place the next instant it flies off somewhere else How can I make it stop still You dont have to make it stop thats not the pointWhere there is movement is where understanding can arisePeople complain It runs off and I pull it back again then it goes off again and I pull it back once more So they just sit there pulling back and forth like thisThey think their minds are running all over the place but actually it only seems like the mind is running aroundFor example look at this hall here Oh its so big you say actually its not big at allWhether or not it seems big depends on your perception of itIn fact this hall is just the size it is neither big nor small but people run around after their feelings all the timeMeditating to find peace You must understand what peace isIf you dont understand it you wont be able to find itFor example suppose today you brought a very expensive pen with you to the monasteryNow suppose that on your way here you put the pen in your front pocket but at a later time you took it out and put it somewhere else such as the back pocketNow when you search your front pocket Its not thereYou get a frightYou get a fright because of your misunderstanding you dont see the truth of the matterSuffering is the resultWhether standing walking coming and going you cant stop worrying about your lost penYour wrong understanding causes you to sufferUnderstanding wrongly causes suffering Such a shameId only bought that pen a few days ago and now its lostBut then you remember Oh of courseWhen I went to bathe I put the pen in my back pocket As soon as you remember this you feel better already even without seeing your penYou see thatYoure happy already you can stop worrying about your penYoure sure about it nowAs youre walking along you run your hand over your back pocket and there it isYour mind was deceiving you all alongThe worry comes from your ignoranceNow seeing the pen you are beyond doubt your worries are calmedThis sort of peace comes from seeing the cause of the problem samudaya the cause of sufferingAs soon as you remember that the pen is in your back pocket there is nirodha the cessation of sufferingSo you must contemplate in order to find peaceWhat people usually refer to as peace is simply the calming of the mind not the calming of the defilementsThe defilements are simply being temporarily subdued just like grass covered by a rockIn three or four days you take the rock off the grass and in no long time it grows up againThe grass hadnt really died it was simply being suppressedIts the same when sitting in meditation the mind is calmed but the defilements are not really calmedTherefore samadhi is not a sure thingTo find real peace you must develop wisdomSamadhi is one kind of peace like the rock covering the grass in a few days you take the rock away and the grass grows up againThis is only a temporary peaceThe peace of wisdom is like putting the rock down and not lifting it up just leaving it where it isThe grass cant possibly grow againThis is real peace the calming of the defilements the sure peace which results from wisdomWe speak of wisdom and samadhi as separate things but in essence they are one and the sameWisdom is the dynamic function of samadhi samadhi is the passive aspect of wisdomThey arise from the same place but take different directions different functions like this mango hereA small green mango eventually grows larger and larger until it is ripeIt is all the same mango the larger one and the ripe one are all the same mango but its condition changesIn Dhamma practice one condition is called samadhi the later condition is called pañña but in actuality sila samadhi and pañña are all the same thing just like the mangoIn any case in our practice no matter what aspect you refer to you must always begin from the mindDo you know what this mind isWhat is the mind likeWhat is itWhere is it Nobody knowsAll we know is that we want to go over here or over there we want this and we want that we feel good or we feel bad but the mind itself seems impossible to knowWhat is the mindThe mind hasnt any formthat which receives impressions both good and bad we call mind Its like the owner of a houseThe owner stays put at home while visitors come to see himHe is the one who receives the visitorsWho receives sense impressionsWhat is it that perceivesWho lets go of sense impressionsThat is what we call mind But people cant see it they think themselves around in circles What is the mind what is the brain Dont confuse the issue like thisWhat is it that receives impressionsSome impressions it likes and some it doesnt like Who is thatIs there one who likes and dislikesSure there is but you cant see itThat is what we call mindIn our practice it isnt necessary to talk of samatha or vipassana just call it the practice of Dhamma thats enoughAnd conduct this practice from your own mindWhat is the mindThe mind is that which receives or is aware of sense impressionsWith some sense impressions there is a reaction of like with others the reaction is dislikeThat receiver of impressions leads us into happiness and suffering right and wrongBut it doesnt have any formWe assume it to be a self but its really only namadhammaDoes goodness have any formDoes evilDo happiness and suffering have any formYou cant find themAre they round or are they square short or longCan you see themThese things are namadhamma they cant be compared to material things they are formless but we know that they do existTherefore it is said to begin the practice by calming the mindPut awareness into the mindIf the mind is aware it will be at peaceSome people dont go for awareness they just want to have peace a kind of blanking outSo they never learn anythingIf we dont have this one who knows what is there to base our practice onIf there is no long there is no short if there is no right there can be no wrongPeople these days study away looking for good and evilBut that which is beyond good and evil they know nothing ofAll they know is the right and the wrong  Im going to take only what is rightI dont want to know about the wrongWhy should I If you try to take only what is right in a short time it will go wrong againRight leads to wrongPeople keep searching among the right and wrong they dont try to find that which is neither right nor wrongThey study about good and evil they search for virtue but they know nothing of that which is beyond good and evilThey study the long and the short but that which is neither long nor short they know nothing ofThis knife has a blade a rim and a handleCan you lift only the bladeCan you lift only the rim of the blade or the handleThe handle the rim and the blade are all parts of the same knife when you pick up the knife you get all three parts togetherIn the same way if you pick up that which is good the bad must followPeople search for goodness and try to throw away evil but they dont study that which is neither good nor evilIf you dont study this there can be no completionIf you pick up goodness badness followsIf you pick up happiness suffering followsThe practice of clinging to goodness and rejecting evil is the Dhamma of children its like a toySure its alright you can take just this much but if you grab onto goodness evil will followThe end of this path is confused its not so goodTake a simple exampleYou have children  now suppose you want to only love them and never experience hatredThis is the thinking of one who doesnt know human natureIf you hold onto love hatred will followIn the same way people decide to study the Dhamma to develop wisdom studying good and evil as closely as possibleNow having known good and evil what do they doThey try to cling to the good and evil followsThey didnt study that which is beyond good and evilThis is what you should studyIm going to be like this Im going to be like that but they never say Im not going to be anything because there really isnt any I This they dont studyAll they want is goodnessIf they attain goodness they lose themselves in itIf things get too good theyll start to go bad and so people end up just swinging back and forth like thisIn order to calm the mind and become aware of the perceiver of sense impressions we must observe itFollow the one who knows Train the mind until it is pureHow pure should you make itIf its really pure the mind should be above both good and evil above even purityIts finishedThats when the practice is finishedWhat people call sitting in meditation is merely a temporary kind of peaceBut even in such a peace there are experiencesIf an experience arises there must be someone who knows it who looks into it queries it and examines itIf the mind is simply blank then thats not so usefulYou may see some people who look very restrained and think they are peaceful but the real peace is not simply the peaceful mindIts not the peace which says May I be happy and never experience any suffering With this kind of peace eventually even the attainment of happiness becomes unsatisfyingSuffering resultsOnly when you can make your mind beyond both happiness and suffering will you find true peaceThats the true peaceThis is the subject most people never study they never really see this oneThe right way to train the mind is to make it bright to develop wisdomDont think that training the mind it simply sitting quietlyThats the rock covering the grassPeople get drunk over itThey think that samadhi is sittingThats just one of the words for samadhi but really if the mind has samadhi in the sitting posture in the walking posture in the standing and reclining posturesIts all practiceSome people complain I cant meditate Im too restlessWhenever I sit down I think of this and that I cant do itIve got too much bad kammaI should use up my bad kamma first and then come back and try meditating Sure just try itTry using up your bad kammaThis is how people thinkWhy do they think like thisThese so called hindrances are the things we must studyWhenever we sit the mind immediately goes running offWe follow it and try to bring it back and observe it once more then it goes off againThis is what youre supposed to be studyingMost people refuse to learn their lessons from nature like a naughty schoolboy who refuses to do his homeworkThey dont want to see the mind changingHow are you going to develop wisdomWe have to live with change like thisWhen we know that the mind is just this way constantly changing when we know that this is its nature we will understand itWe have to know when the mind is thinking good and bad changing all the time we have to know these thingsIf we understand this point then even while we are thinking we can be at peaceFor example suppose at home you have a pet monkeyMonkeys dont stay still for long they like to jump around and grab onto thingsThats how monkeys areNow you come to the monastery and see the monkey hereThis monkey doesnt stay still either it jumps around just the sameBut it doesnt bother you does itWhy doesnt it bother youBecause youve raised a monkey before you know what theyre likeIf you know just one monkey no matter how many provinces you go to no matter how many monkeys you see you wont be bothered by them will youThis is one who understands monkeysIf we understand monkeys then we wont become a monkeyIf you dont understand monkeys you may become a monkey yourselfDo you understandWhen you see it reaching for this and that you shout Hey You get angry That damned monkey This is one who doesnt know monkeysOne who knows monkeys sees that the monkey at home and the monkey in the monastery are just the sameWhy should you get annoyed by themWhen you see what monkeys are like thats enough you can be at peacePeace is like thisWe must know sensationsSome sensations are pleasant some are unpleasant but thats not importantThats just their businessJust like the monkeyall monkeys are the sameWe understand sensations as sometimes agreeable sometimes not  thats just their natureWe should understand them and know how to let them goSensations are uncertainThey are Transient Imperfect and OwnerlessEverything that we perceive is like thisWhen eyes ears nose tongue body and mind receive sensations we know them just like knowing the monkeyThen we can be at peaceWhen sensations arise know themWhy do you run after themSensations are uncertainOne minute they are one way the next minute anotherThey exist dependent on changeAnd all of us here exist dependent on changeThe breath goes out then it must come inIt must have this changeTry only breathing in can you do thatOr try just breathing out without taking in another breath can you do itIf there was no change like this how long could you live forThere must be both the in breath and the out breathSensations are the sameThere must be these thingsIf there were sensations you could develop no wisdomIf there is no wrong there can be no rightYou must be right first before you can see what is wrong and you must understand the wrong first to be rightThis is how things areFor the really earnest student the more sensations the betterBut many meditators shrink away from sensations they dont want to deal with themThis is like the naughty schoolboy who wont go to school wont listen to the teacherThese sensations are teaching usWhen we know sensations then we are practicing DhammaThe peace within sensations is just like understanding the monkey hereWhen you understand what monkeys are like you are no longer troubled by themThe practice of Dhamma is like thisIts not that the Dhamma is very far away its right with usThe Dhamma isnt about the angels on high or anything like thatIts simply about us about what we are doing right nowObserve yourselfSometimes there is happiness sometimes suffering sometimes comfort sometimes pain sometimes love sometimes hate this is DhammaDo you see itYou should know this Dhamma you have to read your experiencesYou must know sensations before you can let them goWhen you see that sensations are impermanent you will be untroubled by themAs soon as a sensation arises just say to yourself Hmmm this is not a sure thing When your mood changes Hmmm not sure You can be at peace with these things just like seeing the monkey and not being bothered by itIf you know the truth of sensations that is knowing the DhammaYou let go of sensations seeing that they are all invariably uncertainWhat we call uncertainty here is the BuddhaThe Buddha is the DhammaThe Dhamma is the characteristic of uncertaintyWhoever sees the uncertainty of things sees the unchanging reality of themThats what the Dhamma is likeAnd that is the BuddhaIf you see the Dhamma you see the Buddha seeing the Buddha you see the DhammaIf you know aniccam uncertainty you will let go of things and not grasp onto themYou say Dont break my glass Can you prevent something thats breakable from breakingIf it doesnt break now it will break later onIf you dont break it someone else willIf someone else doesnt break it one of the chickens willThe Buddha says to accept thisHe penetrated the truth of these things seeing that this glass is already brokenWhenever you use this glass you should reflect that its already brokenDo you understand thisThe Buddhas understanding was like thisHe saw the broken glass within the unbroken oneWhenever its time is up it will breakDevelop this kind of understandingUse the glass look after it until when one day it slips out of your hand Smash no problemWhy is there no problemBecause you saw its brokenness before it brokeBut usually people say I love this glass so much may it never break Later on the dog breaks it Ill kill that damn dog You hate the dog for breaking your glassIf one of your children breaks it youll hate them tooWhy is thisBecause youve dammed yourself up the water cant flowYouve made a dam without a spillwayThe only thing the dam can do is burst rightWhen you make a dam you must make a spillway alsoWhen the water rises up too high the water can flow off safelyWhen its full to the brim you open your spillwayYou have to have a safety valve like thisImpermanence is the safety valve of the Noble OnesIf you have this safety valve you will be at peaceStanding walking sitting lying down practice constantly using sati to watch over and protect the mindThis is samadhi and wisdomThey are both the same thing but they have different aspectsIf we really see uncertainty clearly we will see that which is certainThe certainty is that things must inevitably be this way they cannot be otherwiseDo you understandKnowing just this much you can know the Buddha you can rightly do reverence to himAs long as you dont throw out the Buddha you wont sufferAs soon as you throw out the Buddha you will experience sufferingAs soon as you throw out the reflections on Transience Imperfection and Ownerlessness youll have sufferingIf you can practice just this much its enough suffering wont arise or if it does arise you can settle it easily and it will be a cause for suffering not arising in the futureThis is the end of our practice at the point where suffering doesnt ariseAnd why doesnt suffering arisebecause we have sorted out the cause of suffering samudayaFor instance if this glass were to break normally you would experience sufferingWe know that this glass will be a cause for suffering so we get rid of the causeAll dhammas arise because of a causeThey must also cease because of a causeNow if there is suffering on account of this glass here we should let go of this causeIf we reflect beforehand that this glass is already broken even when it hasnt the cause ceasesWhen there is no longer any cause that suffering is no longer able to exist it ceasesThis is cessationYou dont have to go beyond this point just this much is enoughContemplate this in your own mindBasically you should all have the Five Precepts as a foundation for behaviorIts not necessary to go and study the Tipitaka just concentrate on the Five Precepts firstAt first youll make mistakesWhen you realize it stop come back and establish your precepts againMaybe youll go astray and make another mistakeWhen you realize it reestablish yourselfPracticing like this your sati will improve and become more consistent just like the drops of water falling from a kettleIf we tilt the kettle just a little the drops fall out slowly plop plop plop If we tilt the kettle up a little bit more the drops become more rapid plop plop plop If we tilt the kettle up even further the plops go away and the water flows into a steady streamWhere do the plops go toThey dont go anywhere they change into a steady stream of waterWe have to talk about the Dhamma like this using similes because the Dhamma has no formIs it square or is it roundYou cant sayThe only way to talk about it is through similes like thisDont think that the Dhamma is far away from youIt lies right with you all aroundTake a look one minute happy the next sad the next angry its all DhammaLook at it and understandWhatever it is that causes suffering you should remedyIf suffering is still there take another look you dont yet see clearlyIf you could see clearly you wouldnt suffer because the cause would no longer be thereIf suffering is still there if youre still having to endure then youre not yet on the right trackWherever you get stuck whenever youre suffering too much right there youre wrongwhenever youre so happy youre floating in the clouds there wrong againIf you practice like this you will have sati at all times in all posturesWith sati recollection and sampajañña self awareness you will know right and wrong happiness and sufferingKnowing these things you will know how to deal with themI teach meditation like thisWhen its time to sit in meditation then sit thats not wrongYou should practice this alsoBut meditation is not only sittingYou must allow your mind to fully experience things allow them to flow and consider their natureHow should you consider themSee them as Transient Imperfect and OwnerlessIts all uncertainThis is so beautiful I really must have it Thats not a sure thingI dont like this at all tell yourself right there Not sure Is this trueAbsolutely no mistakeBut just try taking things for real Im going to get this thing for sure Youve gone off the track alreadyDont do thisNo matter how much you like something you should reflect that its uncertainSome kinds of food seem so delicious but still you should reflect that its not a sure thingIt may seem so sure its so delicious but still you must tell yourself not sure If you want to test out whether its sure or not try eating your favorite food every dayEvery single day mind youEventually youll complain This doesnt taste so good anymore Eventually youll think Actually I prefer that kind of food Thats not a sure thing eitherYou must allow things to flow just like the in and out breathsThere has to be both the in breath and the out breath the breathing depends on changeEverything depends on change like thisThese things lie with us nowhere elseIf we no longer doubt whether sitting standing walking or reclining we will be at peaceSamadhi isnt just sittingsome people sit until they fall into a stuporThey might as well be dead they cant tell north from southDont take it to such an extremeIf you feel sleepy then walk change your postureDevelop wisdomIf you are really tired then have a restAs soon as you wake up then continue the practice dont let yourself drift into a stuporYou must practice like thisHave reason wisdom circumspectionStart the practice for your own mind and body seeing them as impermanentEverything else is the sameKeep this in mind when you think the food is so delicious you must tell yourself Not a sure thing You have to slug it firstBut usually it just slugs you every time doesnt itIf you dont like anything you just suffer over itThis is how things slug usIf she likes me I like her they slug us againYou never get a punch inYou must see it like thisWhenever you like anything just say to yourself This is not a sure thing You have to go against the grain somewhat in order to really see the DhammaPractice in all posturesSitting standing walking lying you can experience anger in any posture rightYou can be angry while walking while sitting while lying downYou can experience desire in any postureSo our practice must extend to all postures standing walking sitting and lying downIt must be consistentDont just put on a show really do itWhile sitting in meditation some incident might ariseBefore that one is settled another one comes racing inWhenever these things come up just tell yourself not sure not sure Just slug it before it gets a chance to slug youNow this is the important pointIf you know that all things are impermanent all your thinking will gradually unwindWhen you reflect on the uncertainty of everything that passes youll see that all things go the same wayWhenever anything arises all you need to say is Oh another oneHave you ever seen flowing water have you ever seen still water If your mind is peaceful it will be just like still flowing waterHave you ever seen still flowing waterThereYouve only ever seen flowing water and still water havent youBut youve never seen still flowing waterRight there right where your thinking cannot take you even though its peaceful you can develop wisdomYour mind will be like flowing water and yet its stillIts almost as if it were still and yet its flowingSo I call it still flowing water Wisdom can arise hereToday is the day on which we Buddhists come together to observe the Uposatha precepts and listen to the Dhamma as is our customThe point of listening to the Dhamma is firstly to create some understanding of the things we dont yet understand to clarify them and secondly to improve our grasp of the things we understand alreadyWe must rely on Dhamma talks to improve our understanding and listening is the crucial factorFor todays talk please pay special attention first of all straightening up your posture to make it suitable for listeningDont be too tenseNow all that remains is to establish your minds making your minds firm in samadhiThe mind is the important ingredientThe mind is that which perceives good and evil right and wrongIf we are lacking in sati for even one minute we are crazy for that minute if we are lacking in sati for half an hour we will be crazy for half an hourHowever much our mind is lacking in sati thats how crazy we areThats why its especially important to pay attention when listening to the DhammaAll creatures in this world are plagued by nothing other than sufferingThere is only suffering disturbing the mindStudying the Dhamma is for the purpose of utterly destroying this sufferingIf suffering arises its because we dont really know itNo matter how much we try to control it through will power or through wealth and possessions it is impossibleIf we dont thoroughly understand suffering and its cause no matter how much we try to trade it off with our deeds thoughts or worldly riches theres no way we can do soOnly through clear knowledge and awareness through knowing the truth of it can suffering disappearAnd this applies not only to homeless ones the monks and novices but also to householders for anybody who knows the truth of things suffering automatically ceasesNow the states of good and evil are constant truthsDhamma means that which is constant which maintains itselfTurmoil maintains its turmoil serenity maintains its serenityGood and evil maintain their respective conditions  like hot water it maintains its hotness it doesnt change for anybodyWhether a young person or an old person drink it its hotIts hot for every nationality of peopleSo Dhamma is defined as that which maintains its conditionIn our practice we must know heat and coolness right and wrong good and evilKnowing evil for example we will not create the causes for evil and evil will not ariseDhamma practitioners should know the source of the various dhammasBy quelling the cause of heat heat cannot ariseThe same with evil it arises from a causeIf we practice the Dhamma till we know the Dhamma we will know the source of things their causesIf we extinguish the cause of evil evil is also extinguished we dont have to go running after evil to put it outThis is the practice of DhammaBut many are those who study the Dhamma learn it even practice it but who are not yet with the Dhamma and who have not yet quenched the cause of evil and turmoil within their own heartsAs long as the cause of heat is still present we cant possibly prevent heat from being thereIn the same way as long as the cause of confusion is within our minds we cannot possibly prevent confusion from being there because it arises from this sourceAs long as the source is not quenched confusion will arise againWhenever we create good actions goodness arises in the mindIt arises from its causeThis is called kusalaIf we understand causes in this way we can create those causes and the results will naturally followBut people dont usually create the right causesThey want goodness so much and yet they dont work to bring it aboutAll they get are bad results embroiling the mind in sufferingAll people want these days is moneyThey think that is they just get enough money everything will be alright so they spend all their time looking for money they dont look for goodnessThis is like wanting meat but not wanting salt to preserve it you just leave the meat around the house to rotThose who want money should know not only how to find it but also how to look after itIf you want meat you cant expect to buy it and then just leave it laying around in the houseItll just go rottenThis kind of thinking is wrongThe result of wrong thinking is turmoil and confusionThe Buddha taught the Dhamma so that people would put it into practice in order to know it and see it and to be one with it to make the mind DhammaWhen the mind is Dhamma it will attain happiness and contentmentThe restlessness of samsara is in this world and the cessation of suffering is also in this worldThe practice of Dhamma is therefore for leading the mind to the transcendence of sufferingThe body cant transcend suffering  having been born it must experience pain and sickness aging and deathOnly the mind can transcend clinging and graspingAll the teachings of the Buddha which we call pariyatti are a skillful means to this endFor instance the Buddha taught about upadinnakasankhara and anupadinnakasankhara  mindattended conditions and nonmind attended conditionsNonmindattended conditions are usually defined as such things as trees mountains rivers and so on  inanimate thingsMindattended conditions are defined as animate things  animals human beings and so onMost students of Dhamma take this definition for granted but if you consider the matter deeply how the human mind gets so caught up in sights sounds smells tastes feelings and mental states you might see that really there isnt anything which is not mindattendedAs long as there is craving in the mind everything becomes mindattendedStudying the Dhamma without practicing it we will be unaware of its deeper meaningsFor instance we might think that the pillars of this meeting hall the tables benches and all inanimate things are not mindattended We only look at one side of thingsBut just try getting a hammer and smashing some of these things and youll see whether theyre mindattended or notIts our own mind clinging to the tables chairs and all of our possessions which attends these thingsEven when one little cup breaks it hurts because our mind is attending that cupBe they trees mountains or whatever whatever we feel to be ours they have a mind attending them  if not their own then someone elsesThese are all mindattended conditions not nonmindattendedIts the same for our bodyNormally we would say that the body is mindattendedThe mind which attends the body is none other than upadana clinging latching onto the body and clinging to it as being me and mineJust as a blind man cannot conceive of colors  no matter where he looks no colors can be seen  just so for the mind blocked by craving and delusion all objects of consciousness become mindattendedFor the mind tainted with craving and obstructed by delusion everything becomes mindattended tables chairs animals and everything elseIf we understand that there is an intrinsic self the mind attaches to everythingAll of nature becomes mindattended there is always clinging and attachmentThe Buddha talked about sankhata dhammas and asankhata dhammas  conditioned and unconditioned thingsConditioned things are innumerable  material or immaterial big or small  if our mind is under the influence of delusion it will proliferate about these things dividing them up into good and bad short and long coarse and refinedWhy does the mind proliferate like thisBecause it doesnt know determined reality it doesnt see the DhammaNot seeing the Dhamma the mind is full of clingingAs long as the mind is held down by clinging there can be no escape there is confusion birth old age sickness and death even in the thinking processesThis kind of mind is called the sankhata dhammaAsankhata dhamma the unconditioned refers to the mind which has seen the Dhamma the truth of the Five Khandhas as they are  as Transient Imperfect and OwnerlessAll ideas of me and them mine and theirs belong to the determined realityReally they are all conditionsWhen we know the truth of conditions as neither ourselves nor belonging to us we let go of conditions and the determinedWhen we let go of conditions we attain the Dhamma we enter into and realize the DhammaWhen we attain the Dhamma we know clearlyWhat do we knowWe know that there are only conditions and determinations no being no self no us nor them This is knowledge of the way things areSeeing in this way the mind transcends thingsThe body may grow old get sick and die but the mind transcends this stateWhen the mind transcends conditions it knows the unconditionedthe mind becomes the unconditioned the state which no longer contains conditioning factorsThe mind is no longer conditioned by the concerns of the world conditions no longer contaminate the mindPleasure and pain no longer affect itNothing can affect the mind or change it the mind is assured it has escaped all constructionsSeeing the true nature of conditions and the determined the mind becomes freeThis freed mind is called the Unconditioned that which is beyond the power of constructing influencesIf the mind doesnt really know conditions and determinations it is moved by themEncountering good bad pleasure or pain it proliferates about themWhy does it proliferateBecause there is still a causeWhat is the causeThe cause is the understanding that the body is ones self or belongs to the self that feelings are self or belonging to self that perception is self or belonging to self that conceptual thought is self or belonging to self that consciousness is self or belonging to selfThe tendency to conceive things in terms of self is the source of happiness suffering birth old age sickness and deathThis is the worldly mind spinning around and changing at the directives of worldly conditionsThis is the conditioned mindIf we receive some windfall our mind is conditioned by itThat object influences our mind into a feeling of pleasure but when it disappears our mind is conditioned by it into sufferingThe mind becomes a slave of conditions a slave of desireNo matter what the world presents to it the mind is moved accordinglyThis mind has no refuge it is not yet assured of itself not yet freeIt is still lacking a firm baseThis mind doesnt yet know the truth of conditionsSuch is the conditioned mindAll of you listening to the Dhamma here reflect for a while even a child can make you get angry isnt that soEven a child can trick youHe could trick you into crying laughing  he could trick you into all sorts of thingsEven old people get duped by these thingsFor a deluded person who doesnt know the truth of conditions they are always shaping the mind into countless reactions such as love hate pleasure and painThey shape our minds like this because we are enslaved by themWe are slaves of tanha cravingCraving gives all the orders and we simply obeyI hear people complaining Oh Im so miserableNight and day I have to go to the fields I have no time at homeIn the middle of the day I have to work in the hot sun with no shadeNo matter how cold it is I cant stay at home I have to go to workIm so oppressedIf I ask them Why dont you just leave home and become a monk they say I cant leave I have responsibilities Tanha pulls them backSometimes when youre doing the plowing you might be bursting to urinate so much you just have to do it while youre plowing like the buffaloesThis is how much craving enslaves themWhen I ask How are you goingHavent you got time to come to the monastery they say Oh Im really in deep I dont know what it is theyre stuck in so deeplyThese are just conditions concoctionsThe Buddha taught to see appearances as such to see conditions as they areThis is seeing the Dhamma seeing things as they really areIf you really see these two things then you must throw them out let them goNo matter what you may receive it has no real substanceAt first it may seem good but it will eventually go badIt will make you love and make you hate make you laugh and cry make you go whichever way it pulls youWhy is thisBecause the mind is undevelopedConditions become conditioning factors of the mind making it big and small happy and sadIn the time of our forefathers when a person died they would invite the monks to go and recite the recollections on impermanence Anicca vata sankhara  Uppadavaya dhammino  Uppajjitva nirujjhanti  Tesam vupasamo sukho  All conditions are impermanentThe body and the mind are both impermanentThey are impermanent because they do not remain fixed and unchangingAll things that are born must necessarily change they are transient  especially our bodyWhat is there that doesnt change within this bodyHair nails teeth skin are they still the same as they used to beThe condition of the body is constantly changing so it is impermanentIs the body stableIs the mind stableThink about itHow many times is there arising and ceasing even in one dayBoth body and mind are constantly arising and ceasing conditions are in a state of constant turmoilThe reason you cant see these things in line with the truth is because you keep believing the untrueIts like being guided by a blind manHow can you travel in safetyA blind man will only lead you into forests and thicketsHow could he lead you to safety when he cant seeIn the same way our mind is deluded by conditions creating suffering in the search for happiness creating difficulty in the search for easeSuch a mind only makes for difficulty and sufferingReally we want to get rid of suffering and difficulty but instead we create those very thingsAll we can do is complainWe create bad causes and the reason we do is because we dont know the truth of appearances and conditionsConditions are impermanent both the mindattended ones and the nonmindattendedIn practice the nonmindattended conditions are nonexistentWhat is there that is not mind attendedEven your own toilet which you would think would be nonmindattended try letting someone smash it with a sledge hammerHe would probably have to contend with the authorities The mind attends everything even feces and urineExcept for the person who sees clearly the way things are there are no such things as nonmindattended conditionsAppearances are determined into existenceWhy must we determine themBecause they dont intrinsically existFor example suppose somebody wanted to make a markerHe would take a piece of wood or a rock and place it on the ground and then call it a markerActually its not a markerThere isnt any marker thats why you must determine it into existenceIn the same way we determine cities people cattle  everythingWhy must we determine these thingsBecause originally they do not existConcepts such as monk and layperson are also determinations We determine these things into existence because intrinsically they arent hereIts like having an empty dish  you can put anything you like into it because its emptyThis is the nature of determined realityMen and women are simply determined concepts as are all the things around usIf we know the truth of determinations clearly we will know that there are no beings because beings are determined thingsUnderstanding that these things are simply determinations you can be at peaceBut if you believe that the person being the mine the theirs and so on are intrinsic qualities then you must laugh and cry over themThese are the proliferation of conditioning factorsIf we take such things to be ours there will always be sufferingThis is micchaditthi Wrong ViewNames are not intrinsic realities they are provisional truthsOnly after we are born do we obtain names isnt that soOr did you have your name already when you were bornThe name comes afterwards rightWhy must we determine these namesBecause intrinsically they arent thereWe should clearly understand these determinationsGood evil high low black and white are all determinationsWe are all lost in determinationsThis is why at the funeral ceremonies the monks chant Anicca vata sankhara Conditions are impermanent they arise and pass wayThats the truthWhat is there that having arisen doesnt ceaseGood moods arise and then ceaseHave you ever seen anybody cry for three or four yearsAt the most you may see people crying a whole night and then the tears dry upHaving arisen they ceaseTesam vupasamo sukho If we understand sankharas proliferations and thereby subdue them this is the greatest happinessThis is true merit to be calmed of proliferations calmed of being calmed of individuality of the burden of selfTranscending these things one sees the UnconditionedThis means that no matter what happens the mind doesnt proliferate around itTheres nothing that can throw the mind off its natural balanceWhat else could you wantThis is the end the finishThe Buddha taught the way things areOur making offerings and listening to Dhamma talks and so on is in order to search for and realize thisIf we realize this we dont have to go and study vipassana it will happen of itselfBoth samatha and vipassana are determined into being just like other determinationsThe mind which knows which is beyond such things is the culmination of the practiceOur practice our inquiry is in order to transcend sufferingWhen clinging is finished with states of being are finished withWhen states of being are finished with there is no more birth or deathWhen things are going well the mind does not rejoice and when things are going badly the mind does not grieveThe mind is not dragged all over the place by the tribulations of the world and so the practice is finishedThis is the basic principle for which the Buddha gave the teachingThe Buddha taught the Dhamma for use in our livesEven when we die there is the teaching Tesam vupasamo sukho but we dont subdue these conditions we only carry them around as if the monks were telling us to do soWe carry them around and cry over themThis is getting lost in conditionsHeaven Hell and nibbana are all to be found at this pointPracticing the Dhamma is in order to transcend suffering in the mindIf we know the truth of things as Ive explained here we will automatically know the Four Noble Truths  Suffering the Cause of Suffering the Cessation of Suffering and the Way leading to the Cessation of SufferingPeople are generally ignorant when it comes to determinations they think they all exist of themselvesWhen the books tell us that trees mountains and rivers are nonmindattended conditions this is simplifying thingsThis is just the superficial teaching theres no reference to suffering as if there was no suffering in the worldThis is just the shell of DhammaIf we were to explain things in terms of ultimate truth we would see that its people who go and tie all these things down with their attachmentsHow can you say that things have no power to shape events that they are not mindattended when people will beat their children even over one tiny needleOne single plate or cup a plank of wood the mind attends all these thingsJust watch what happens if someone goes and smashes one of them up and youll find outEverything is capable of influencing us in this wayKnowing these things fully is our practice examining those things which are conditioned unconditioned mindattended and nonmindattendedThis is part of the external teaching as the Buddha once referred to themAt one time the Buddha was staying in a forestTaking a handful of leaves He asked the bhikkhus Bhikkhus which is the greater number the leaves I hold in my hand or the leaves scattered over the forest floorThe bhikkhus answered The leaves in the Blessed Ones hand are few the leaves scattered around the forest floor are by far the greater numberIn the same way bhikkhus the whole of the Buddhas teaching is vast but these are not the essence of things they are not directly related to the way out of sufferingThere are so many aspects to the Teaching but what the Tathagata really wants you to do is to transcend suffering to inquire into things and abandon clinging and attachment to form feeling perception volition and consciousness Stop clinging to these things and you will transcend sufferingThese teachings are like the leaves in the Buddhas handYou dont need so much just a little is enoughAs for the rest of the Teaching you neednt worry yourselves over itIt is just like the vast earth abundant with grasses soil mountains forestsTheres no shortage of rocks and pebbles but all those rocks are not as valuable as one single jewelThe Dhamma of the Buddha is like this you dont need a lotSo whether you are talking about the Dhamma or listening to it you should know the DhammaYou neednt wonder where the Dhamma is its right hereNo matter where you go to study the Dhamma it is really in the mindThe mind is the one who clings the mind is the one who speculates the mind is the one who transcends who lets goAll this external study is really about the mindNo matter if you study the Tipitaka the Abhidhamma or whatever dont forget where it came fromWhen it comes to the practice the only things you really need to make a start are honesty and integrity you dont need to make a lot of trouble for yourselfNone of you laypeople have studied the Tipitaka but you are still capable of greed anger and delusion arent youWhere did you learn about these things fromDid you have to read the Tipitaka or the Abhidhamma to have greed hatred and delusionThose things are already there in your mind you dont have to study books to have themBut the Teachings are for inquiring into and abandoning these thingsLet the knowing spread from within you and you will be practicing rightlyIf you want to see a train just go the central station you dont have to go traveling all the way up the Northern line the Southern Line the Eastern Line and the Western Line to see all the trainsIf you want to see trains every single one of them youd be better off waiting at Grand Central Station thats where they all terminateNow some people tell me I want to practice but I dont know howIm not up to studying the scriptures Im getting old now my memorys not good Just look right here at Central Station Greed arises here anger arises here delusion arises hereJust sit here and you can watch as all these things arisePractice right here because right here is where youre stuckRight here is where the determined arises where conventions arise and right here is where the Dhamma will ariseTherefore the practice of Dhamma doesnt distinguish between class or race all it asks is that we look into see and understandAt first we train the body and speech to be free of taints which is silaSome people think that to have sila you must memorize Pali phrases and chant all day and all night but really all you have to do is make your body and speech blameless and thats silaIts not so difficult to understand just like cooking food put in a little bit of this and a little bit of that till its just right and its deliciousYou dont have to add anything else to make it delicious its delicious already if only you add the right ingredientsIn the same way taking care that our actions and speech are proper will give us silaDhamma practice can be done anywhereIn the past I traveled all over looking for a teacher because I didnt know how to practiceI was always afraid that I was practicing wronglyId be constantly going from one mountain to another from one place to another until I stopped and reflected on itNow I understandIn the past I must have been quite stupid I went all over the place looking for places to practice meditation  I didnt realize it was already there in my heartAll the meditation you want is right there inside youThere is birth old age sickness death right here within youthats why the Buddha said Paccatam veditabbo viññuhi The wise must know for themselvesId said the words before but I still didnt know their meaningI traveled all over looking for it until I was ready to drop dead from exhaustion  only then when I stopped did I find what I was looking for inside of meSo now I can tell you about itSo in your practice of sila just practice as Ive explained hereDont doubt the practiceEven though some people may say you cant practice at home that there are too many obstacles if thats the case then even eating and drinking are going to be obstaclesIf these things are obstacles to practice then dont eatIf you stand on a thorn is that goodIsnt not standing on a thorn betterDhamma practice brings benefit to all people irrespective of classHowever much you practice thats how much you will know the truthSome people say they cant practice as a lay person the environment is too crowdedIf you live in a crowded place then look into crowdedness make it open and wideThe mind has been deluded by crowdedness train it to know the truth of crowdednessThe more you neglect the practice the more you neglect going to the monastery and listening to the teaching the more your mind will sink down into the bog like a frog going into a holeSomeone comes along with a hook and the frogs done for he doesnt have a chanceAll he can do is stretch out his neck and offer it to themSo watch out you dont work yourself into a tiny corner  someone may just come along with a hook and scoop you upAt home being pestered by your children and grandchildren you are even worse off than the frogYou dont know how to detach from these thingsWhen old age sickness and death come along what will you doThis is the hook thats going to get youWhich way will you turnThis is the predicament our minds are inEngrossed in the children the relatives the possessions and you dont know how to let them goWithout morality or understanding to free things up there is no way out for youWhen feeling perception volition and consciousness produce suffering you always get caught up in itWhy is there this sufferingIf you dont investigate you wont knowIf happiness arises you simply get caught up in happiness delighting in itYou dont ask yourself where does this happiness come fromSo change your understandingYou can practice anywhere because the mind is with you everywhereIf you think good thoughts while sitting you can be aware of them if you think bad thoughts you can be aware of them alsoThese things are with youWhile lying down if you think good thoughts or bad thoughts you can know them also because the place to practice is in the mindSome people think you have to go to the monastery every single dayThats not necessary just look at your own mindIf you know where the practice is youll be assuredThe Buddhas teaching tells us to watch ourselves not to run after fads and superstitiousThats why he said Silena sugatim yanti Silena bhogasampada Silena nibbutim yanti Tasma silam visodhaye Sila refers to our actionsGood actions bring good results bad actions bring bad resultsDont expect the gods to do things for you or the angels and guardian deities to protect you or the auspicious days to help youThese things arent true dont believe in themIf you believe in them you will sufferYoull always be waiting for the right day the right month the right year the angels and guardian deities youll suffer that wayLook into your own actions and speech into your own kammaDoing good you inherit goodness doing bad you inherit badnessIf you understand that good and bad right and wrong all lie within you then you wont have to go looking for those things somewhere elseJust look for these things where they ariseIf you lose something here you must look for it hereEven if you dont find it at first keep looking where you dropped itBut usually we lose it here then go looking over thereWhen will you ever find itGood and bad actions lie within youOne day youre bound to see it just keep looking right thereAll beings fare according to their kammaWhat is kammaPeople are too gullibleIf you do bad actions they say Yama the King of the Underworld will write it all down in a bookWhen you go there he takes out his accounts and looks you up Youre all afraid of the Yama in the afterlife but you dont know the Yama within your own mindsIf you do bad actions even if you sneak off and do it by yourself this Yama will write it all downAmong you people sitting here and there are probably many who have secretly done bad things not letting anyone else seeBut you see it dont youThis Yama sees it allCan you see it for yourselfAll of you think for a while Yama has written it all down hasnt heTheres no way you can escape itWhether you do it alone or in a group in a field or whereverIs there anybody here who has ever stolen somethingThere are probably a few of us who are exthievesEven if you dont steal other peoples things you still may steal your ownI myself have that tendency thats why I reckon some of you may be the sameMaybe you have secretly done bad things in the past not letting anyone else know about itBut even if you dont tell anyone else about it you must know about itThis is the Yama who watches over you and writes it all downWherever you go he writes it all down in his account bookWe know our own intentionWhen you do bad actions badness is there if you do good actions goodness is thereTheres nowhere you can go to hideEven if others dont see you you must see yourselfEven if you go into a deep hole youll still find yourselfEven if you go into a deep hole youll still find yourself thereTheres no way you can commit bad actions and get away with itIn the same way why shouldnt you see your own purityYou see it all  the peaceful the agitated the liberation or the bondage  we see all these for ourselvesIn this Buddhist religion you must be aware of all your actionsWe dont act like the Brahmans who go into your house and say May you be well and strong may you live long The Buddha doesnt talk like thatHow will the disease go away with just talkThe Buddhas way of treating the sick was to say Before you were sick what happenedWhat led up to your sickness Then you tell him how it came aboutOh its like that is itTake this medicine and try it out If its not the right medicine he tries another oneIf its right for the illness then thats the right oneThis way is scientifically soundAs for the Brahmans they just tie a string around your wrist and say Okay be well be strong when I leave this place you just get right on up and eat a hearty meal and be well No matter how much you pay them your illness wont go away because their way has no scientific basisBut this is what people like to believeThe Buddha didnt want us to put too much store in these things he wanted us to practice with reasonBuddhism has been around for thousands of years now and most people have continued to practice as their teachers have taught them regardless of whether its right or wrongThats stupidThey simply follow the example of their forebearsThe Buddha didnt encourage this sort of thingHe wanted us to do things with reasonFor example at one time when he was teaching the monks he asked Venerable Sariputta Sariputta do you believe this teachingVenerable Sariputta replied I dont yet believe it The Buddha praised his answer Very good SariputtaA wise person doesnt believe too readilyHe looks into things into their causes and conditions and sees their true nature before believing or disbelievingBut most teachers these days would say WhatYou dont believe meGet out of here Most people are afraid of their teachersWhatever their teachers do they just blindly followThe Buddha taught to adhere to the truthListen to the teaching and then consider it intelligently inquire into itIts the same with my dhamma talks  go and consider itIs what I say rightReally look into it look within yourselfSo it is said to guard your mindWhoever guards his mind will free himself from the shackles of MaraIts just this mind which goes and grabs onto things know things sees things experiences happiness and suffering just this very mindWhen we fully know the truth of determinations and conditions we will naturally throw off sufferingAll things are just as they areThey dont cause suffering in themselves just like a thorn a really sharp thornDoes it make you sufferNo its just a thorn it doesnt bother anybodyBut if you go and stand on it then youll sufferWhy is there this sufferingBecause you stepped on the thornThe thorn is just minding its own business it doesnt harm anybodyOnly if you step on the thorn will you suffer over itIts because of we ourselves that theres painForm feeling perception volition consciousness all things in this world are simply there as they areIts we who pick fights with themAnd if we hit them theyre going to hit us backIf theyre left on their own they wont bother anybody only the swaggering drunkard gives them troubleAll conditions fare according to their natureThats why the Buddha said Tesam vupasamo sukho If we subdue conditions seeing determinations and conditions as they really are as neither me nor mine us nor them when we see that these beliefs are simply sakkayaditthi the conditions are freed of the selfdelusionIf you think Im good Im bad Im great Im the best then you are thinking wronglyIf you see all these thoughts as merely determinations and conditions then when others say good or bad you can leave it be with themAs long as you still see it as me and you its like having three hornets nests  as soon as you say something the hornets come buzzing out to sting youThe three hornets nests are sakkayaditthi viccikiccha and silabbataparamasaOnce you look into the true nature of determinations and conditions pride cannot prevailOther peoples fathers are just like our father their mothers are just like ours their children are just like oursWe see the happiness and suffering of other beings as just like oursIf we see in this way we can come face to face with the future Buddha its not so difficultEveryone is in the same boatThen the world will be as smooth as a drumskinIf you want to wait around to meet Phra Sri Ariya Mettiya the future Buddha then just dont practice youll probably be around long enough to see himBut Hes not crazy that hed take people like that for disciplesMost people just doubtIf you no longer doubt about the self then no matter what people may say about you you arent concerned because your mind has let go it is at peaceConditions become subduedGrasping after the forms of practice that teacher is bad that place is no good this is right thats wrong NoTheres none of these thingsAll this kind of thinking is all smoothed overYou come face to face with the future BuddhaThose who only hold up their hands and pray will never get thereSo here is the practiceIf I talked any more it would just be more of the sameAnother talk would just be the same as thisIve brought you this far now you think about itIve brought you to the path whoevers going to go its there for youThose who arent going can stayThe Buddha only sees you to the beginning of the pathAkkhataro Tathagata  the Tathagata only points the wayFor my practice he only taught this muchThe rest was up to meNow I teach you I can tell you just this muchI can bring you only to the beginning of the path whoever wants to go back can go back whoever wants to travel on can travel onIts up to you nowThe Dhammapada is a work familiar to every devout Buddhist and to every serious student of BuddhismThis small collection of verses on the Buddhas doctrine is so rich in insights that it might be considered the perfect compendium of the Dhamma in its practical dimensionsIn the countries of Theravada Buddhism the Dhammapada is regarded as an inexhaustible source of guidance and spiritual inspiration as the wise counselor to which to turn for help in resolving the difficult moral and personal problems inescapable in daily lifeJust as the Buddha is looked upon as the human kalyanamitta or spiritual friend par excellence so the Dhammapada is looked upon as the scriptural kalyanamitta par excellence a small embodiment in verse of the boundless wisdom and great compassion of the MasterTo draw out the living message of any great spiritual classic it is not enough for us merely to investigate it in terms of questions that might be posed by scientific scholarshipWe have to take a step beyond scholarly examination and seek to make an application of those teachings to ourselves in our present conditionTo do this requires that we use our intelligence imagination and intuition to see through the limiting cultural contexts out of which the work was born and to see into those universal features of the human condition to which the spiritual classic being studied is specifically addressedWith these stipulations in mind we will examine the Dhammapada in order to discover what this ancient book of wisdom regards as the fundamental and perennial spiritual problems of human life and to learn what solutions it can propose for them that may be relevant to us todayIn this way we will uncover the living message of the Dhammapada the message that rings down through the centuries and speaks to us in our present condition in the fullness of our humanityWhen we set out to make such an investigation one difficulty that we meet at the outset is the great diversity of teachings contained in the DhammapadaIt is well known that during his teaching career the Buddha always adjusted his discourses to fit the needs and capacities of his disciplesThus the prose discourses found in the four main Nikayas display richly variegated presentations of the doctrine and this diversity becomes even more pronounced in the Dhammapada a collection of utterances spoken in the intuitive and highly charged medium of verseWe even find in the work apparent inconsistencies which may perplex the superficial reader and lead to the supposition that the Buddhas teaching is rife with selfcontradictionThus in many verses the Buddha commends certain practices to his disciples on the ground that they lead to heaven while in others he discourages disciples from aspiring for heaven and praises the one who takes no delight in celestial joysOften the Buddha enjoins works of merit yet elsewhere in the work he enjoins his disciples to go beyond both merit and demeritTo make sense out of such contrary statements to find a consistent message running through the Dhammapadas diversified pronouncements let us begin with a statement the Buddha makes in another small but beautiful book of the Pali canon the Udana Just as the great ocean has but one taste the taste of salt so this doctrineanddiscipline has but one taste the taste of freedom Despite their variety in meaning and formulation the Buddhas teachings all fit together into a perfectly coherent system which gains its unity from its final goalThat goal is freedom which here means spiritual freedom the liberation of the mind from all bonds and fetters the liberation of our being from the suffering inseparable from wandering in samsara the cycle of rebirthsBut while the Buddhas teachings fit together harmoniously through the unity of their final goal they are addressed to people standing at different levels of spiritual development and thus must be expressed in different ways determined by the needs of the people to be taughtHere again water provides a fitting analogyWater has one essence  chemically it is a union of two hydrogen atoms with one oxygen atom  but it takes on the different shapes of the vessels into which it is poured similarly the Dhamma has a single essence  deliverance from suffering  but it assumes varying expressions in accordance with the dispositions of those who are to be instructed and trainedIt is because the different expressions lead to a single end and because the same end can be reached via teachings that are differently expressed that the Dhamma is said to be sattha sabyañjana good in meaning and good in formulationTo make sense out of the various teachings found in the Dhammapada to grasp the vision of human spirituality expressed by the work as a whole I would like to suggest a schematism of four levels of instruction set forth in the DhammapadaThis fourfold schematism develops out of three primary and perennial spiritual needs of man first the need to achieve welfare and happiness in the present life in the immediately visible sphere of human relations second the need to attain a favorable future life in accordance with a principle that confirms our highest moral intuitions and third the need for transcendence to overcome all the limits imposed upon us by our finitude and temporality and to attain a freedom that is boundless timeless and irreversibleThese three needs give rise to four levels of instruction by distinguishing two levels pertaining to the third need the level of path when we are on the way to transcendence and the level of fruit when we have won through to transcendenceNow let us examine each of these levels in turn illustrating them with citations of relevant verses from the DhammapadaThe first level of instruction in the Dhammapada is addressed to the need to establish human welfare and happiness in the immediately visible domain of personal relationThe aim at this level is to show us the way to live at peace with ourselves and our fellow human beings to fulfill our family and social responsibilities and to remove the conflicts which infect human relationships and bring such immense suffering to the individual society and the world as a wholeThe guidelines appropriate to this level of instruction are largely identical with the basic ethical injunctions proposed by most of the great world religionsHowever in the Buddhas teaching these ethical injunctions are not regarded as fiats imposed by an allpowerful GodRather they are presented as precepts or training rules grounded upon two directly verifiable foundations concern for ones own personal integrity and considerations for the welfare of those whom ones actions may affectThe most general advice the Dhammapada gives is to avoid all evil to cultivate good and to cleanse ones own mind this is said to be the counsel of all the Enlightened OnesMore specific directives however are also givenTo abstain from evil we are advised to avoid irritation in deed word and thought and to exercise selfcontrol over body speech and mindOne should adhere scrupulously to the five moral precepts abstinence from destroying life from stealing from sexual misconduct from lying and from intoxicantsThe disciple should treat all beings with kindness and compassion live honestly control his desires speak the truth and live a sober upright lifeHe should fulfill all his duties to parents to immediate family to friends and to recluses and brahmansA large number of verses pertaining to this first level are concerned with the resolution of conflict and hostilityFrom other parts of the Sutta Pitaka we learn that the Buddha was a keen and sensitive observer of the social and political developments that were rapidly transforming the Indian states he visited on his preaching roundsThe violence hatred cruelty and sustained enmity that he witnessed have persisted right down to the present and the Buddhas answer to this problem is still the only answer that can workThe Buddha tells us that the key to solving the problem of violence and cruelty is the ancient maxim of using oneself as the standard for deciding how to treat othersI myself tremble at violence wish to live in peace and do not want to dieThus putting myself in the place of others I should recognize that all other beings tremble at violence that all wish to live and do not want to dieRecognizing this I should not intimidate others harm them or cause them to be harmed in any wayThe Buddha saw that hatred and enmity continue and spread in a selfexpanding cycle responding to hatred by hatred only breeds more hatred more enmity more violence and feed the whole vicious whirlpool of vengeance and retaliationThe Dhammapada teaches us that the true conquest of hatred is achieved by nonhatred by forbearance by loveWhen wronged by others we must be patient and forgivingWe must control our anger as a driver controls a chariot we must bear angry words as the elephant in battle bears the arrows shot into its hide when spoken to harshly we must remain silent like a broken bellAccording to the Dhammapada the qualities distinguishing the superior human being are generosity truthfulness patience and compassionBy following these ideals we can live at peace with our own conscience and in harmony with our fellowsThe scent of virtue the Buddha declares is sweeter than the scent of flowers and perfume the good man or woman shines from afar like the Himalayan mountains just as the lotus flower rises up in all its beauty above the muck and mire of the roadside refuse heap so does the disciple of the Buddha rise up in splendor of wisdom above the masses of ignorant worldlingsThe basic emphasis in the first level of teaching in the Dhammapada is ethical a concern which arises from a desire to promote human wellbeing here and nowHowever the teachings pertaining to this level give rise to a profound religious problem a dilemma that challenges the mature thinkerThe problem is as follows Our moral intuition our innate sense of moral justice tells us that there must be some principle of compensation at work in the world whereby goodness meets with happiness and evil meets with sufferingBut everyday experience shows us exactly the oppositeWe all know of highly virtuous people beset with every kind of hardship and thoroughly bad people who succeed in everything they doWe feel that there must be some correction to this imbalance some force that will tilt the scales of justice into the balance that seems right but our daily experience seems to contradict this intuition totallyHowever in his teachings the Buddha reveals that there is a force at work which can satisfy our demand for moral justiceThis force cannot be seen with the eye of the flesh nor can it be registered by any instruments of measurement but its working becomes visible to the supernormal vision of sages and saints while all its principles in their full complexity are fathomed by a Perfectly Enlightened BuddhaThis force is called kammaThe law of kamma ensures that our morally determinate actions do not disappear into nothingness but rather continue on as traces in the deep hidden layers of the mind where they function in such a way that our good deeds eventually issue in happiness and success our evil deeds in suffering and miseryThe word kamma in the Buddhas teaching means volitional actionSuch action may be bodily or verbal when volition is expressed in deed or speech or it may be purely mental when volition remains unexpressed as thoughts emotions wishes and desiresThe actions may be either wholesome or unwholesome wholesome when they are rooted in generosity amity and understanding unwholesome when they spring from greed hatred and delusionAccording to the principle of kamma the willed actions we perform in the course of a life have longterm consequences that correspond to the moral quality of the original actionThe deeds may utterly fade from our memory but once performed they leave subtle impressions upon the mind potencies capable of ripening in the future to our weal or our woeAccording to Buddhism conscious life is not a chance byproduct of molecular configurations or a gift from a divine Creator but a beginningless process which repeatedly springs up at birth and passes away at death to be followed by a new birthThere are many spheres besides the human into which rebirth can occur heavenly realms of great bliss beauty and power infernal realms where suffering and misery prevailThe Dhammapada does not give us any systematic teaching on kamma and rebirthAs a book of spiritual counsel it presupposes the theoretical principles explained elsewhere in the Buddhist scriptures and concerns itself with their practical bearings on the conduct of lifeThe essentials of the law of kamma however are made perfectly clear our willed actions determine the sphere of existence into which we will be reborn after death the circumstances and endowments of our lives within any given form of rebirth and our potentials for spiritual progress or declineAt the second level of instruction found in the Dhammapada the content of the message is basically the same as that of the first level it is the same set of moral injunctions for abstaining from evil and doing goodThe difference lies in the viewpoint from which these precepts are issued and the purpose for which they are taken upAt this level the precepts are prescribed to show us the way to achieve longrange happiness and freedom from sorrow not only in the visible sphere of the present life but far beyond into the distant future in our subsequent transmigration in samsaraDespite the apparent discrepancy between action and result an allembracing law ensures that ultimately moral justice triumphsIn the short run the good may suffer and the evil may prosperBut all willed actions bring their appropriate results if one acts or speaks with an evil mind suffering follows just as the wheel follows the foot of the draftox if one acts or speaks with a pure mind happiness follows like a shadow that never departsThe evildoer grieves here and hereafter he is tormented by his conscience and destined to planes of miseryThe doer of good rejoices here and hereafter he enjoys a good conscience and is destined to realms of blissTo follow the law of virtue leads upward to happiness and joy and to higher rebirths to violate the law leads downward to suffering and to lower rebirthsThe law is inflexibleNowhere in the world can the evildoer escape the result of his evil kamma neither in the sky nor in midocean nor by entering into mountain cleftsThe good person will reap the rewards of his or her good kamma in future lives with the same certainty with which a traveler returning home after a long journey can expect to be greeted by his family and friendsThe teaching on kamma and rebirth with its practical corollary that we should perform deeds of merit with the aim of obtaining a higher mode of rebirth is not by any means the final message of the Buddha or the decisive counsel of the DhammapadaIn its own sphere of application this teaching is perfectly valid as a preparatory measure for those who still require further maturation in their journey through samsaraHowever a more searching examination reveals that all states of existence in samsara even the highest heavens are lacking in genuine worth for they are all impermanent without any lasting substance incapable of giving complete and final satisfactionThus the disciple of mature faculties who has been prepared sufficiently by previous experience in the world does not long even for rebirth among the godsHaving understood that all conditioned things are intrinsically unsatisfactory and fraught with danger the mature disciple aspires instead for deliverance from the everrepeating round of rebirthsThis is the ultimate goal to which the Buddha points as the immediate aim for those of developed spiritual faculties and also as the longterm ideal for those who still need further maturation Nibbana the Deathless the unconditioned state where there is no more birth aging and death and thus no more sufferingThe third level of instruction found in the Dhammapada sketches the theoretical framework for the aspiration for final liberation and lays down guidelines pertaining to the practical discipline that can bring this aspiration to fulfillmentThe theoretical framework is supplied by the teaching of the Four Noble Truths which the Dhammapada calls the best of all truths suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the cessation of sufferingThe four truths all center around the problem of dukkha or suffering and the Dhammapada teaches us that dukkha is not to be understood only as experienced pain and sorrow but more widely as the pervasive inadequacy and wretchedness of everything conditioned There is no ill like the aggregates of existence all conditioned things are suffering conditioned things are the worst sufferingThe second truth points out that the cause of suffering is craving the yearning for pleasure possessions and being which drives us through the round of rebirths bringing along sorrow anxiety and despairThe Dhammapada devotes an entire chapter to the theme of craving and the message of this chapter is clear so long as even the subtlest thread of craving remains in the mind we are not beyond danger of being swept away by the terrible flood of existenceThe third noble truth spells out the goal of the Buddhas teaching to gain release from suffering to escape the flood of existence craving must be destroyed down to its subtlest depthsAnd the fourth noble truth prescribes the means to gain release the Noble Eightfold Path which again is the focus of an entire chapterAt the third level of instruction a shift in the practical teaching of the Dhammapada takes place corresponding to the shift in doctrine from the principles of kamma and rebirth to the Four Noble TruthsThe stress now no longer falls on basic morality and purified states of mind as a highway to more favorable planes of rebirthInstead it falls on the cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path as the means to destroy craving and thus break free from the entire process of rebirth itselfThe Dhammapada declares that the eightfold path is the only way to deliverance from sufferingIts says this not as a fixed dogma but because full release from suffering comes from the purification of wisdom and this path alone with its stress on right view and the cultivation of insight leads to fully purified wisdom to complete understanding of liberating truthThe Dhammapada states that those who tread the path will come to know the Four Noble Truths and having gained this wisdom they will end all sufferingThe Buddha assures us that by walking the path we will bewilder Mara pull out the thorn of lust and escape from sufferingBut he also cautions us about our own responsibility we ourselves must make the effort for the Buddhas only point out the wayIn principle the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path is open to people in any walk of life householders as well as monks and nunsHowever application to the development of the path is most feasible for those who have relinquished all worldly concerns in order to devote themselves fully to living the holy lifeFor conduct to be completely purified for the mind to be trained in concentration and insight the adoption of a different lifestyle becomes advisable one which minimizes distractions and stimulants to craving and orders all activities around the aim of liberationThus the Buddha established the Sangha the Order of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis as the field of training for those ready to devote themselves fully to the practice of the pathIn the Dhammapada we find the call to the monastic life resounding throughoutThe entry way to the monastic life is an act of radical renunciation spurred on by our confrontation with suffering particularly by our recognition of our inevitable mortalityThe Dhammapada teaches that just as a cowherd drives the cattle to pasture so old age and death drive living beings from life to lifeThere is no place in the world where one can escape death for death is stamped into the very substance of our beingThe body is a painted mirage in which there is nothing lasting or stable it is a mass of sores a nest of disease which breaks up and ends in death it is a city built of bones containing within itself decay and death the foolish are attached to it but the wise having seen that the body ends as a corpse lose all delight in mundane joysHaving recognized the transience and hidden misery of mundane life the thoughtful break the ties of family and social relationships abandon their homes and sensual pleasures and enter upon the state of homelessness Like swans that abandon the lake they leave home after home behind Having gone from home to homelessness they delight in detachment so difficult to enjoyWithdrawn to silent and secluded places the renunciants seek out the company of wise instructors who point out their faults who admonish and instruct them and shield them from wrong who show them the right pathUnder their guidance they live by the rules of the monastic order content with the simplest material requisites moderate in eating practicing patience and forbearance devoted to meditationHaving learned to still the restless waves of thought and to gain onepointed concentration they go on to contemplate the arising and falling away of all formations The monk who has retired to a solitary abode and calmed the mind comprehends the Dhamma with insight and there arises in him a delight that transcends all human delightsWhenever he sees with insight the rise and fall of the aggregates he is full of joy and happinessThe life of meditation reaches its peak in the development of insight and the Dhammapada succinctly enunciates the principles to be seen with the wisdom of insight All conditioned things are impermanent All conditioned things are suffering All things are not selfWhen one sees this with wisdom then one turns away from sufferingThis is the path of purificationWhen these truths are penetrated by direct vision the fetters of attachment break asunder and the disciple rises through successive stages of realization to the attainment of full liberationThe fourth level of teaching in the Dhammapada does not reveal any new principles of doctrine or approach to practiceThis level shows us rather the fruit of the third levelThe third level exposes the path to the highest goal the way to break free from all bondage and suffering and to win the supreme peace of NibbanaThe fourth level is a celebration and acclamation of those who have gained the fruits of the path and won the final goalThe stages of definite attainment along the way to Nibbana are enumerated in the Pali canon as four streamentry when one enters irreversibly upon the path to liberation oncereturning when one is assured that one will return to the sense sphere of existence only one more time nonreturning when one will never return to the sense sphere at all but will take a spontaneous birth in a celestial plane and there reach the end of suffering and arahantship the stage of full liberation here and nowAlthough the Dhammapada contains several verses referring to those on the lower stages of attainment its primary emphasis is on the individual who has reached the fourth and final fruit of liberation the arahant and the picture it gives us of the arahant is stirring and inspiringThe arahant is depicted in two full chapters in chapter under his own name and in chapter the last chapter under the name Brahmana the holy manWe are told that the arahant is no longer troubled by the fever of the passions he is sorrowless and wholly set free he has broken all tiesHis taints are destroyed he is not attached to food his field is the void and unconditioned freedomFor ordinary worldlings the arahant is incomprehensible his path cannot be traced like that of birds in the skyHe has transcended all obstacles passed beyond sorrow and lamentation become peaceful and fearlessHe is free from anger devout virtuous without craving selfsubduedHe has profound knowledge and wisdom he is skilled in discriminating the right path and the wrong path he has reached the highest goalHe is friendly amidst the hostile peaceful amidst the violent and unattached amidst the attachedIn this very life the arahant has realized the end of suffering laying down the burden of the five aggregatesHe has transcended the ties of both merit and demerit he is sorrowless stainless and pure he is free from attachment and has plunged into the DeathlessLike the moon he is spotless and pure serene and clearHe has cast off all human bonds and transcended all celestial bonds he has gotten rid of the substrata of existence and conquered all worldsHe knows the death and rebirth of beings he is totally detached blessed and enlightenedNo gods angels or human beings can find his tracks for he clings to nothing has no attachment holds to nothingHe has reached the end of births attained the perfection of insight and reached the summit of spiritual excellenceBearing his last body perfectly at peace the arahant is the living demonstration of the truth of the DhammaBy his own example he shows that it is possible to free oneself from the stains of greed hatred and delusion to rise above suffering and to win Nibbana in this very lifeThe arahant ideal reaches its optimal exemplification in the first and highest of the arahants the Buddha and the Dhammapada makes a number of important pronouncements about the MasterThe Buddha is the supreme teacher who depends on no one else for guidance who has reached perfect enlightenment through his own selfevolved wisdomHe is the giver of refuge and is himself the first of the three refuges those who take refuge in the Buddha his Doctrine and his Order are released from all suffering after seeing with proper wisdom the Four Noble TruthsThe Buddhas attainment of perfect enlightenment elevates him to a level far above that of common humanity the Enlightened One is trackless of limitless range free from worldliness the conqueror of all the knower of all in all things untaintedThe sun shines by day the moon shines by night the warrior shines in his armor the brahman shines in meditation but the Buddha we are told shines resplendent all day and all nightThis will complete our discussion of the four basic levels of instruction found in the DhammapadaInterwoven with the verses pertaining to these four main levels there runs throughout the Dhammapada a large number of verses that cannot be tied down exclusively to any single level but have a wider applicationThese verses sketch for us the world view of early Buddhism and its distinctive insights into human existenceFundamental to this world view as it emerges from the text is the inescapable duality of human lifeMan walks a delicate balance between good and evil purity and defilement progress and decline he seeks happiness he fears suffering loss and deathWe are free to choose between good and evil and must bear full responsibility for our decisionsAgain and again the Dhammapada sounds this challenge to human freedom we are the makers and masters of ourselves the protectors or destroyers of ourselves we are our own saviors and there is no one else who can save usEven the Buddha can only indicate the path to deliverance the work of treading it lies with the discipleIn the end we must choose between the way that leads back into the world to the round of becoming and the way that leads out of the world to NibbanaAnd though this last course is extremely difficult the voice of the Buddha speaks words of assurance confirming that it can be done that it lies within our power to overcome all barriers and to triumph even over death itselfThe chief role in achieving progress in all spheres the Dhammapada states is played by the mindThe Dhammapada opens with a clear assertion that the mind is the forerunner of all that we are the maker of our character the creator of our destinyThe entire Buddhist discipline from basic morality to the attainment of arahantship hinges upon training the mindA wrongly directed mind brings greater harm than any enemy a rightly directed mind brings greater good than any relative or friendThe mind is unruly fickle difficult to subdue but by effort mindfulness and selfdiscipline one can master the mind escape the flood of passions and find an island which no flood can overwhelmThe person who conquers himself the victor over his own mind achieves a conquest that can never be undone a victory greater than that of the mightiest warriorsWhat is needed most to train and subdue the mind according to the Dhammapada is a quality called heedfulnessHeedfulness combines critical selfawareness and unremitting energy in a process of constant selfobservation in order to detect and expel the defilements whenever they seek an opportunity to come to the surfaceIn a world where we have no savior except ourselves and where the means to deliverance lies in mental purification heedfulness becomes the crucial factor for ensuring that we keep straight to the path of training without deviating due to the seductive lure of sense pleasures or the stagnating influences of laziness and complacencyThe Buddha declares that heedfulness is the path to the Deathless and heedlessness the path to deathThe wise who understand this distinction abide in heedfulness and attain Nibbana the incomparable freedom from bondageThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOne of the most notable features of Venerable Ajahn Chahs teaching was the emphasis he gave to the Sangha the monastic order and its use as a vehicle for Dhamma practiceThis is not to deny his unique gift for teaching lay people which enabled him to communicate brilliantly with people from all walks of life be they simple farmers or University professorsBut the results he obtained with teaching and creating solid Sangha communities are plainly visible in the many monasteries which grew up around him both within Thailand and later in England Australia Europe and elsewhereAjahn Chah foresaw the necessity of establishing the Sangha in the West if longterm results were to be realizedThis book is a collection of talks he gave to the monastic communities in ThailandThey are exhortations given to the communities of bhikkhus or Buddhist monks at his own monastery Wat Ba Pong and some of its branchesThis fact should be born in mind by the lay readerThese talks are not intended to and indeed cannot serve as an introduction to Buddhism and meditation practiceThey are monastic teachings addressed primarily to the lifestyle and problems particular to that situationA knowledge of the basics of Buddhism on the part of the listener was assumedMany of the talks will thus seem strange and even daunting to the lay reader with their emphasis on conformity and renunciationFor the lay reader then it is essential to bear in mind the environment within which these talks were given  the rugged austere povertystricken NorthEast corner of Thailand birth place of most of Thailands great meditation teachers and almost its entire forest monastic traditionThe people of the NorthEast are honed by this environment to a rugged simplicity and gentle patience which make them ideal candidates for the forest monks lifestyleWithin this environment in small halls dimly lit by paraffin lamps surrounded by the assembly of monks Ajahn Chah gave his teachingsExhortations by the master occurred typically at the end of the fortnightly recitation of the Patimokkha the monks code of disciplineTheir content would be decided by the current situation  slackness in the practice confusion about the rules or just plain unenlightenment In a lifestyle characterized by simplicity and contentment with little complacency is an ongoing tendency so that talks for arousing diligent effort were a regular occurrenceThe talks themselves are spontaneous reflections and exhortations rather than systematic teachings as most Westerners would know themThe listener was required to give full attention in the present moment and to reflect back on his own practice accordingly rather than to memorize the teachings by rote or analyze them in terms of logicIn this way he could become aware of his own shortcomings and learn how to best put into effect the skillful means offered by the teacherAlthough meant primarily for a monastic resident  be one a monk nun or novice  the interested lay reader will no doubt obtain many insights into Buddhist practice from this bookAt the very least there are the numerous anecdotes of the Venerable Ajahns own practice which abound throughout the book these can be read simply as biographical material or as instruction for mind trainingFrom the contents of this book it will be seen that the training of the mind is not as many believe simply a matter of sitting with the eyes closed or perfecting a meditation technique but is as Ajahn Chah would say a great renunciationThe translatorFight greed fight aversion fight delusion these are the enemyIn the practice of Buddhism the path of the Buddha we fight with Dhamma using patient enduranceWe fight by resisting our countless moodsDhamma and the world are interrelatedWhere there is Dhamma there is the world where there is the world there is DhammaWhere there are defilements there are those who conquer defilements who do battle with themThis is called fighting inwardlyTo fight outwardly people take hold of bombs and guns to throw and to shoot they conquer and are conqueredConquering others is the way of the worldIn the practice of Dhamma we dont have to fight others but instead conquer our own minds patiently enduring and resisting all our moodsWhen it comes to Dhamma practice we dont harbor resentment and enmity amongst ourselves but instead let go of all forms of illwill in our own actions and thoughts freeing ourselves from jealousy aversion and resentmentHatred can only be overcome by not harboring resentment and bearing grudgesHurtful actions and reprisals are different but closely relatedActions once done are finished with theres no need to answer with revenge and hostilityThis is called actionReprisal means to continue that action further with thoughts of you did it to me so Im going to get you back Theres no end to thisIt brings about the continual seeking of revenge and so hatred is never abandonedAs long as we behave like this the chain remains unbroken theres no end to itNo matter where we go the feuding continuesThe Supreme Teacher taught the world he had compassion for all worldly beingsBut the world nevertheless goes on like thisThe wise should look into this and select those things which are of true valueThe Buddha had trained in the various arts of warfare as a prince but he saw that they werent really useful they are limited to the world with its fighting and aggressionTherefore in training ourselves as those who have left the world we must learn to give up all forms of evil giving up all those things which are the cause for enmityWe conquer ourselves we dont try to conquer othersWe fight but we fight only the defilements if there is greed we fight that if there is aversion we fight that if there is delusion we strive to give it upThis is called Dhamma fighting This warfare of the heart is really difficult in fact its the most difficult thing of allWe become monks in order to contemplate this to learn the art of fighting greed aversion and delusionThis is our prime responsibilityThis is the inner battle fighting with defilementsBut there are very few people who fight like thisMost people fight with other things they rarely fight defilementsThey rarely even see themThe Buddha taught us to give up all forms of evil and cultivate virtueThis is the right pathTeaching in this way is like the Buddha picking us up and placing us at the beginning of the pathHaving reached the path whether we walk along it or not is up to usThe Buddhas job is finished right thereHe shows the way that which is right and that which is not rightThis much is enough the rest is up to usNow having reached the path we still dont know anything we still havent seen anything so we must learnTo learn we must be prepared to endure some hardship just like students in the worldIts difficult enough to obtain the knowledge and learning necessary for them to pursue their careersThey have to endureWhen they think wrongly or feel averse or lazy they must force themselves before they can graduate and get a jobThe practice for a monk is similarIf we determine to practice and contemplate then we will surely see the wayDitthimana is a harmful thingDitthi means view or opinion All forms of view are called ditthi seeing good as evil seeing evil as good any way whatsoever that we see thingsThis is not the problemThe problem lies with the clinging to those views called mana holding on to those views as if they were the truthThis leads us to spin around from birth to death never reaching completion just because of that clingingSo the Buddha urged us to let go of viewsIf many people live together as we do here they can still practice comfortably if their views are in harmonyBut even two or three monks would have difficulty if their views were not good or harmoniousWhen we humble ourselves and let go of our views even if there are many of us we come together at the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaIts not true to say that there will be disharmony just because there are many of usJust look at a millipedeA millipede has many legs doesnt itJust looking at it youd think it would have difficulty walking but actually it doesntIt has its own order and rhythmIn our practice its the sameIf we practice as the Noble Sangha of the Buddha practiced then its easyThat is supatipanno  those who practice well ujupatipanno  those who practice straightly ñanapatipanno  those who practice to transcend suffering and samicipatipanno  those who practice properlyThese four qualities established within us will make us true members of SanghaEven if we number in the hundreds or thousands no matter how many we are we all travel the same pathWe come from different backgrounds but we are the sameEven though our views may differ if we practice correctly there will be no frictionJust like all the rivers and streams which flow to the sea once they enter the sea they all have the same taste and colorIts the same with peopleWhen they enter the stream of Dhamma its the one DhammaEven though they come from different places they harmonize they mergeBut the thinking which causes all the disputes and conflict is ditthimanaTherefore the Buddha taught us to let go of viewsDont allow mana to cling to those views beyond their relevanceThe Buddha taught the value of constant sati recollectionWhether we are standing walking sitting or reclining wherever we are we should have this power of recollectionWhen we have sati we see ourselves we see our own mindsWe see the body within the body the mind within the mind If we dont have sati we dont know anything we arent aware of what is happeningSo sati is very importantWith constant sati we will listen to the Dhamma of the Buddha at all timesThis is because eye seeing forms is Dhamma ear hearing sounds is Dhamma nose smelling odors is Dhamma tongue tasting flavors is Dhamma body feeling sensations is Dhamma when impressions arise in the mind that is Dhamma alsoTherefore one who has constant sati always hears the Buddhas teachingThe Dhamma is always thereWhyBecause of sati because we are awareSati is recollection sampajañña is selfawarenessThis awareness is the actual Buddho the BuddhaWhen there is satisampajañña understanding will followWe know what is going onWhen the eye sees forms is this proper or improperWhen the ear hears sound is this the appropriate or inappropriateIs it harmfulIs it wrong is it rightAnd so on like this with everythingIf we understand we hear the Dhamma all the timeSo let us all understand that right now we are learning in the midst of DhammaWhether we go forward or step back we meet the Dhamma  its all Dhamma if we have satiEven seeing the animals running around in the forest we can reflect seeing that all animals are the same as usThey run away from suffering and chase after happiness just as people doWhatever they dont like they avoid they are afraid of dying just like peopleIf we reflect on this we see that all beings in the world people as well are the same in their various instinctsThinking like this is called bhavana seeing according to the truth that all beings are companions in birth old age sickness and deathAnimals are the same as human beings and human beings are the same as animalsIf we really see things the way they are our mind will give up attachment to themTherefore it is said we must have satiIf we have sati we will see the state of our own mindWhatever we are thinking or feeling we must know itThis knowing is called Buddho the Buddha the one who knows who knows thoroughly who knows clearly and completelyWhen the mind knows completely we find the right practiceSo the straight way to practice is to have mindfulness satiIf you are without sati for five minutes you are crazy for five minutes heedless for five minuteswhenever you are lacking in sati you are crazySati is essentialTo have sati is to know yourself to know the condition of your mind and your lifeThis is to have understanding and discernment to listen to the Dhamma at all timesAfter leaving the teachers discourse you still hear the Dhamma because the Dhamma is everywhereSo therefore all of you be sure to practice every dayWhether lazy or diligent practice just the samePractice of the Dhamma is not done by following your moodsIf you practice following your moods then its not DhammaDont discriminate between day and night whether the mind is peaceful or not just practiceIts like a child who is learning to writeAt first he doesnt write nicely  big long loops and squiggles  he writes like a childAfter a while the writing improves through practicePracticing the Dhamma is like thisAt first you are awkward sometimes calm sometimes not you dont really know whats whatSome people get discouragedDont slacken offYou must persevere with the practiceLive with effort just like the schoolboy as he gets older he writes better and betterFrom writing badly he grows to write beautifully all because of the practice from childhoodOur practice is like thisTry to have recollection at all times standing walking sitting or recliningWhen we perform our various duties smoothly and well we feel peace of mindWhen there is peace of mind in our work its easy to have peaceful meditation they go hand in handSo make an effortYou should all make an effort to follow the practiceThis is trainingThis practice of ours is not easyWe may know some things but there is still much that we dont knowFor example when we hear teachings such as know the body then know the mind within the body or know the mind then know the mind within the mind If we havent yet practiced these things then we hear them we may feel baffledThe Vinaya is like thisIn the past I used to be a teacher but I was only a small teacher not a big oneWhy do I say a small teacherBecause I didnt practiceI taught the Vinaya but I didnt practice itThis I call a small teacher an inferior teacherI say an inferior teacher because when it came to the practice I was deficientFor the most part my practice was a long way off the theory just as if I hadnt learned the Vinaya at allHowever I would like to state that in practical terms its impossible to know the Vinaya completely because some things whether we know them or not are still offensesThis is trickyAnd yet it is stressed that if we do not yet understand any particular training rule or teaching we must study that rule with enthusiasm and respectIf we dont know then we should make an effort to learnIf we dont make an effort that is in itself an offenseFor example if you doubt suppose there is a woman and not knowing whether she is a woman or a man you touch herYoure not sure but still go ahead and touch thats still wrongI used to wonder why that should be wrong but when I considered the practice I realized that a meditator must have sati he must be circumspectWhether talking touching or holding things he must first thoroughly considerThe error in this case is that there is no sati or insufficient sati or a lack of concern at that timeTake another example its only eleven oclock in the morning but at the time the sky is cloudy we cant see the sun and we have no clockNow suppose we estimate that its probably afternoon we really feel that its afternoon and yet we proceed to eat somethingWe start eating and then the clouds part and we see from the position of the sun that its only just past elevenThis is still an offenseI used to wonder EhIts not yet past midday why is this an offenseAn offense is incurred here because of negligence carelessness we dont thoroughly considerThere is a lack of restraintIf there is doubt and we act on the doubt there is a dukkata offense just for acting in the face of the doubtWe think that it is afternoon when in fact it isntThe act of eating is not wrong in itself but there is an offense here because we are careless and negligentIf it really is afternoon but we think it isnt then its the heavier pacittiya offenseIf we act with doubt whether the action is wrong or not we still incur an offenseIf the action is not wrong in itself it is the lesser offense if it is wrong then the heavier offense is incurredTherefore the Vinaya can get quite bewilderingAt one time I went to see Venerable Ajahn MunAt that time I had just begun to practiceI had read the Pubbasikkha and could understand that fairly wellThen I went on to read the Visuddhimagga where the author writes of the Silanidesa Samadhinidesa and Paññanidesa I felt my head was going to burstAfter reading that I felt that it was beyond the ability of a human being to practiceBut then I reflected that the Buddha would not teach something that is impossible to practiceHe wouldnt teach it and he wouldnt declare it because those things would be useful neither to himself nor to othersThe Silanidesa is extremely meticulous the Samadhinidesa more so and the Paññanidesa even more soI sat and thought Well I cant go any furtherTheres no way ahead It was as if Id reached a deadendAt this stage I was struggling with my practice I was stuckIt so happened that I had a chance to go and see Venerable Ajahn Mun so I asked him Venerable Ajahn what am I to doIve just begun to practice but I still dont know the right wayI have so many doubts I cant find any foundation at all in the practiceHe asked Whats the problemIn the course of my practice I picked up the Visuddhimagga and read it but it seems impossible to put into practiceThe contents of the Silanidesa Samadhinidesa and Paññanidesa seem to be completely impracticalI dont think there is anybody in the world who could do it its so detailed and meticulousTo memorize every single rule would be impossible its beyond meHe said to me Venerable theres a lot its true but its really only a littleIf we were to take account of every training rule in the Silanidesa that would be difficult true But actually what we call the Silanidesa has evolved from the human mindIf we train this mind to have a sense of shame and a fear of wrongdoing we will then be restrained we will be cautiousThis will condition us to be content with little with few wishes because we cant possibly look after a lotWhen this happens our sati becomes strongerWe will be able to maintain sati at all timesWherever we are we will make the effort to maintain thorough satiCaution will be developedWhatever you doubt dont say it dont act on itIf theres anything you dont understand ask the teacherTrying to practice every single training rule would indeed be burdensome but we should examine whether we are prepared to admit our faults or notDo we accept themThis teaching is very importantIts not so much that we must know every single training rule if we know how to train our own mindsAll that stuff that youve been reading arises from the mindIf you still havent trained your mind to have sensitivity and clarity you will be doubting all the timeYou should try to bring the teachings of the Buddha into your mindBe composed in mindWhatever arises that you doubt just give it upIf you dont really know for sure then dont say it or do itFor instance if you wonder Is this wrong or not  that is youre not really sure  then dont say it dont act on it dont discard your restraintAs I sat and listened I reflected that this teaching conformed with the eight ways for measuring the true teaching of the Buddha Any teaching that speaks of the diminishing of defilements which leads out of suffering which speaks of renunciation of contentment with little of humility and disinterest in rank and status of aloofness and seclusion of diligent effort of being easy to maintain these eight qualities are characteristics of the true Dhammavinaya the teaching of the Buddhaanything in contradiction to these is notIf we are genuinely sincere we will have a sense of shame and a fear of wrongdoingWe will know that if there is doubt in our mind we will not act on it nor speak on itThe Silanidesa is only wordsFor example hiriottappa in the books is one thing but in our minds it is anotherStudying the Vinaya with Venerable Ajahn Mun I learned many thingsAs I sat and listened understanding aroseSo when it comes to the Vinaya Ive studied considerablySome days during the Rains Retreat I would study from six oclock in the evening through till dawnI understand it sufficientlyAll the factors of apatti which are covered in the Pubbasikkha I wrote down in a notebook and kept in my bagI really put effort into it but in later times I gradually let goIt was too muchI didnt know which was the essence and which was the trimming I had just taken all of itWhen I understood more fully I let it drop off because it was too heavyI just put my attention into my own mind and gradually did away with the textsHowever when I teach the monks here I still take the Pubbasikkha as my standardFor many years here at Wat Ba Pong it was I myself who read it to the assemblyIn those days I would ascend the Dhammaseat and go on until at least eleven oclock or midnight some days even one or two oclock in the morningWe were interestedAnd we trainedAfter listening to the Vinaya reading we would go and consider what wed heardYou cant really understand the Vinaya just by listening to itHaving listened to it you must examine it and delve into it furtherEven though I studied these things for many years my knowledge was still not complete because there were so many ambiguities in the textsNow that its been such a long time since I looked at the books my memory of the various training rules has faded somewhat but within my mind there is no deficiencyThere is a standard thereThere is no doubt there is understandingI put away the books and concentrated on developing my own mindI dont have doubts about any of the training rulesThe mind has an appreciation of virtue it wont dare do anything wrong whether in public or in privateI do not kill animals even small onesIf someone were to ask me to intentionally kill an ant or a termite to squash one with my hand for instance I couldnt do it even if they were to offer me thousands of baht to do soEven one ant or termiteThe ants life would have greater value to meHowever it may be that I may cause one to die such as when something crawls up my leg and I brush it offMaybe it dies but when I look into my mind there is no feeling of guiltThere is no wavering or doubtWhyBecause there was no intentionSilam vadami bhikkhave cetanaham Intention is the essence of moral training Looking at it in this way I see that there was no intentional killingSometimes while walking I may step on an insect and kill itIn the past before I really understood I would really suffer over things like thatI would think I had committed an offenseWhatThere was no intention There was no intention but I wasnt being careful enough I would go on like this fretting and worryingSo this Vinaya is something which can disturb practitioners of Dhamma but it also has its value in keeping with what the teachers say  Whatever training rules you dont yet know you should learnIf you dont know you should question those who do They really stress thisNow if we dont know the training rules we wont be aware of our transgressions against themTake for example a Venerable Thera of the past Ajahn Pow of Wat Kow Wong Got in Lopburi ProvinceOne day a certain Maha a disciple of his was sitting with him when some women came up and askedLuang PorWe want to invite you to go with us on an excursion will you goLuang Por Pow didnt answerThe Maha sitting near him thought that Venerable Ajahn Pow hadnt heard so he saidLuang Por Luang PorDid you hearThese women invited you to go for a tripHe said I heardThe women asked again Luang Por are you going or notHe just sat there without answering and so nothing came of the invitationWhen they had gone the Maha saidLuang Por why didnt you answer those womenHe said Oh Maha dont you know this ruleThose people who were here just now were all womenIf women invite you to travel with them you should not consentIf they make the arrangements themselves thats fineIf I want to go I can because I didnt take part in making the arrangementsThe Maha sat and thought Oh Ive really made a fool of myselfThe Vinaya states that to make an arrangement and then travel together with women even though it isnt as a couple is a pacittiya offenseTake another caseLay people would bring money to offer Venerable Ajahn Pow on a trayHe would extend his receiving cloth holding it at one endBut when they brought the tray forward to lay it on the cloth he would retract his hand from the clothThen he would simply abandon the money where it layHe knew it was there but he would take no interest in it just get up and walk away because in the Vinaya it is said that if one doesnt consent to the money it isnt necessary to forbid laypeople from offering itIf he had desire for it he would have to say Householder this is not allowable for a monk He would have to tell themIf you have desire for it you must forbid them from offering that which is unallowableHowever if you really have no desire for it it isnt necessaryYou just leave it there and goAlthough the Ajahn and his disciples lived together for many years still some of his disciples didnt understand Ajahn Pows practiceThis is a poor state of affairsAs for myself I looked into and contemplated many of Venerable Ajahn Pows subtler points of practiceThe Vinaya can even cause some people to disrobeWhen they study it all the doubts come upIt goes right back into the past my ordination was it properWas my preceptor pureNone of the monks who sat in on my ordination knew anything about the Vinaya were they sitting at the proper distanceWas the chanting correct The doubts come rolling on The hall I ordained in was it properIt was so small They doubt everything and fall into hellSo until you know how to ground your mind its really difficultYou have to be very cool you cant just jump into thingsBut to be so cool that you dont bother to look into things is wrong alsoI was so confused I almost disrobed because I saw so many faults within my own practice and that of some of my teachersI was on fire and couldnt sleep because of those doubtsThe more I doubted the more I meditated the more I practicedWherever doubt arose I practiced right at that pointWisdom aroseThings began to changeIts hard to describe the change that took placeThe mind changed until there was no more doubtI dont know how it changed if I were to tell someone they probably wouldnt understandSo I reflected on the teaching Paccattam veditabbo viññuhi  the wise must know for themselvesIt must be a knowing that arises through direct experienceStudying the Dhammavinaya is certainly correct but if its just the study its still lackingIf you really get down to the practice you begin to doubt everythingBefore I started to practice I wasnt interested in the minor offenses but when I started practicing even the dukkata offenses became as important as the parajika offensesBefore the dukkata offenses seemed like nothing just a trifleThats how I saw themIn the evening you could confess them and they would be done withThen you could transgress them againThis sort of confession is impure because you dont stop you dont decide to changeThere is no restraint you simply do it again and againThere is no perception of the truth no letting goActually in terms of ultimate truth its not necessary to go through the routine of confessing offensesIf we see that our mind is pure and there is no trace of doubt then those offenses drop off right thereThat we are not yet pure is because we still doubt we still waverWe are not really pure so we cant let goWe dont see ourselves this is the pointThis Vinaya of ours is like a fence to guard us from making mistakes so its something we need to be scrupulous withIf you dont see the true value of the Vinaya for yourself its difficultMany years before I came to Wat Ba Pong I decided I would give up moneyFor the greater part of a Rains Retreat I had thought about itIn the end I grabbed my wallet and walked over to a certain Maha who was living with me at the time setting the wallet down in front of himHere Maha take this moneyFrom today onwards as long as Im a monk I will not receive or hold moneyYou can be my witnessYou keep it Venerable you may need it for your studies The Venerable Maha wasnt keen to take the money he was embarrassedWhy do you want to throw away all this moneyYou dont have to worry about meIve made my decisionI decided last nightFrom the day he took that money it was as if a gap had opened between usWe could no longer understand each otherHes still my witness to this very dayEver since that day I havent used money or engaged in any buying or sellingIve been restrained in every way with moneyI was constantly wary of wrongdoing even though I hadnt done anything wrongInwardly I maintained the meditation practiceI no longer needed wealth I saw it as a poisonWhether you give poison to a human being a dog or anything else it invariably causes death or sufferingIf we see clearly like this we will be constantly on our guard not to take that poison When we clearly see the harm in it its not difficult to give upRegarding food and meals brought as offerings if I doubted them I wouldnt accept themNo matter how delicious or refined the food might be I wouldnt eat itTake a simple example like raw pickled fishSuppose you are living in a forest and you go on almsround and receive only rice and some pickled fish wrapped in leavesWhen you return to your dwelling and open the packet you find that its raw pickled fish just throw it awayEating plain rice is better than transgressing the preceptsIt has to be like this before you can say you really understand then the Vinaya becomes simplerIf other monks wanted to give me requisites such as bowl razor or whatever I wouldnt accept unless I knew them as fellow practitioners with a similar standard of VinayaWhy notHow can you trust someone who is unrestrainedThey can do all sorts of thingsUnrestrained monks dont see the value of the Vinaya so its possible that they could have obtained those things in improper waysI was as scrupulous as thisAs a result some of my fellow monks would look askance at me He doesnt socialize he wont mix I was unmoved Sure we can mix when we dieWhen it comes to death we are all in the same boat I thoughtI lived with enduranceI was one who spoke littleIf others criticized my practice I was unmovedWhyBecause even if I explained to them they wouldnt understandThey knew nothing about practiceLike those times when I would be invited to a funeral ceremony and somebody would say Dont listen to himJust put the money in his bag and dont say anything about it dont let him know I would say Hey do you think Im dead or somethingJust because one calls alcohol perfume doesnt make it become perfume you knowBut you people when you want to drink alcohol you call it perfume then go ahead and drinkYou must be crazyThe Vinaya then can be difficultYou have to be content with little aloofYou must see and see rightOnce when I was traveling through Saraburi my group went to stay in a village temple for a whileThe Abbot there had about the same seniority as myselfIn the morning we would all go on almsround together then come back to the monastery and put down our bowlsPresently the laypeople would bring dishes of food into the hall and set them downThen the monks would go and pick them up open them and lay them in a line to be formally offeredOne monk would put his hand on the dish at the other endAnd that was itWith that the monks would bring them over and distribute them to be eatenAbout five monks were traveling with me at the time but not one of us would touch that foodOn almsround all we received was plain rice so we sat with them and ate plain rice none of us would dare eat the food from those dishesThis went on for quite a few days until I began to sense that the Abbot was disturbed by our behaviorOne of his monks had probably gone to him and said Those visiting monks wont eat any of the foodI dont know what theyre up toI had to stay there for a few days more so I went to the Abbot to explainI said Venerable Sir may I have a moment pleaseAt this time I have some business which means I must call on your hospitality for some days but in doing so Im afraid there may be one or two things which you and your fellow monks find puzzling namely concerning our not eating the food which has been offered by the laypeopleId like to clarify this with you sirIts really nothing its just that Ive learned to practice like this that is the receiving of the offerings sirWhen the lay people lay the food down and then the monks go and open the dishes sort them out and then have them formally offered this is wrongIts a dukkata offenseSpecifically to handle or touch food which hasnt yet been formally offered into a monks hands ruins that foodAccording to the Vinaya any monk who eats that food incurs an offenseIts simply this one point sirIts not that Im criticizing anybody or that Im trying to force you or your monks to stop practicing like this not at allI just wanted to let you know of my good intentions because it will be necessary for me to stay here for a few more daysHe lifted his hands in añjali SadhuExcellentIve never yet seen a monk who keeps the minor rules in Saraburithere arent any to be found these daysIf there still are such monks they must live outside of SaraburiMay I commend youI have no objections at all thats very goodThe next morning when we came back from almsround not one of the monks would go near those dishesThe laypeople themselves sorted them out and offered them because they were afraid the monks wouldnt eatFrom that day onwards the monks and novices there seemed really on edge so I tried to explain things to them to put their minds at restI think they were afraid of us they just went into their rooms and closed themselves in in silenceFor two or three days I tried to make them feel at ease because they were so ashamed I really had nothing against themI didnt say things like Theres not enough food or bring this or that food Why notBecause I had fasted before sometimes for seven or eight daysHere I had plain rice I knew I wouldnt dieWhere I got my strength from was the practice from having studied and practiced accordinglyI took the Buddha as my exampleWherever I went whatever others did I wouldnt involve myselfI devoted myself solely to the practice because I cared for myself I cared for the practiceThose who dont keep the Vinaya or practice meditation and those who do practice cant live together they must go separate waysI didnt understand this myself in the pastAs a teacher I taught others but I didnt practiceThis is really badWhen I looked deeply into it my practice and my knowledge were as far apart as earth and skyTherefore those who want to go and set up meditation centers in the forest dont do itIf you dont yet really know dont bother trying youll only make a mess of itSome monks think that going to live in the forest they will find peace but they still dont understand the essentials of practiceThey cut grass for themselves do everything themselves Those who really know the practice arent interested in places like this they wont prosperDoing it like that wont lead to progressNo matter how peaceful the forest may be you cant progress if you do it wrongThey see the forest monks living in the forest and go to live in the forest like them but its not the sameThe robes are not the same eating habits are not the same everything is differentNamely they dont train themselves they dont practiceThe place is wasted it doesnt really workIf it does work it does so only as a venue for showing off or publicizing just like a medicine showIt goes no further than thatThose who have only practiced a little and then go to teach others are not yet ripe they dont really understandIn a short time they give up and it falls apartIt just brings troubleSo we must study somewhat look at the Navakovada what does it sayStudy it memorize it until you understandFrom time to time ask your teacher concerning the finer points he will explain themStudy like this until you really understand the VinayaToday we are meeting together as we do every year after the annual Dhamma examinationsAt this time all of you should reflect on the importance of carrying out the various duties of the monastery those toward the preceptor and those toward the teachersThese are what hold us together as a single group enabling us to live in harmony and concordThey are also what lead us to have respect for each other which in turn benefits the communityIn all communities from the time of the Buddha till the present no matter what form they may take if the residents have no mutual respect they cannot succeedWhether they be secular communities or monastic ones if they lack mutual respect they have no solidarityIf there is no mutual respect negligence sets in and the practice eventually degeneratesOur community of Dhamma practitioners has lived here for about twenty five years now steadily growing but it could deteriorateWe must understand this pointBut if we are all heedful have mutual respect and continue to maintain the standards of practice I feel that our harmony will be firmOur practice as a group will be a source of growth for Buddhism for a long time to comeNow in regard to the study and the practice they are a pairBuddhism has grown and flourished until the present time because of the study going hand in hand with practiceIf we simply learn the scriptures in a heedless way negligence sets in For example in the first year here we had seven monks for the Rains RetreatAt that time I thought to myself Whenever monks start studying for Dhamma Examinations the practice seems to degenerate Considering this I tried to determine the cause so I began to teach the monks who were there for the Rains Retreat  all seven of themI taught for about forty days from after the meal till six in the evening every dayThe monks went for the exams and it turned out there was a good result in that respect all seven of them passedThat much was good but there was a certain complication regarding those who were lacking in circumspectionTo study it is necessary to do a lot of reciting and repeatingThose who are unrestrained and unreserved tend to grow lax with the meditation practice and spend all their time studying repeating and memorizingThis causes them to throw out their old abiding their standards of practiceAnd this happens very oftenSo it was when they had finished their studies and taken their exams I could see a change in the behavior of the monksThere was no walking meditation only a little sitting and an increase in socializingThere was less restraint and composureActually in our practice when you do walking meditation you should really determine to walk when sitting in meditation you should concentrate on doing just thatWhether you are standing walking sitting or lying down you should strive to be composedBut when people do a lot of study their minds are full of words they get high on the books and forget themselvesThey get lost in externalsNow this is so only for those who dont have wisdom who are unrestrained and dont have steady satiFor these people studying can be a cause for declineWhen such people are engaged in study they dont do any sitting or walking meditation and become less and less restrainedTheir minds become more and more distractedAimless chatter lack of restraint and socializing become the order of the dayThis is the cause for the decline of the practiceIts not because of the study in itself but because certain people dont make the effort they forget themselvesActually the scriptures are pointers along the path of practiceIf we really understand the practice then reading or studying are both further aspects of meditationBut if we study and then forget ourselves it gives rise to a lot of talking and fruitless activityPeople throw out the meditation practice and soon want to disrobeMost of those who study and fail soon disrobeIts not that the study is not good or that the practice is not rightIts that people fail to examine themselvesSeeing this in the second rains retreat I stopped teaching the scripturesMany years later more and more young men came to become monksSome of them knew nothing about the DhammaVinaya and were ignorant of the texts so I decided to rectify the situation asking those senior monks who had already studied to teach and they have taught up until the present timeThis is how we came to have studying hereHowever every year when the exams are finished I ask all the monks to reestablish their practiceAll those scriptures which arent directly concerned with the practice put them away in the cupboardsReestablish yourselves go back to the regular standardsReestablish the communal practices such as coming together for the daily chantingThis is our standardDo it even if only to resist your own laziness and aversionThis encourages diligenceDont discard your basic practices eating little speaking little sleeping little restraint and composure aloofness regular walking and sitting meditation meeting together regularly at the appropriate timesPlease make an effort with these every one of youDont let this excellent opportunity go to wasteDo the practiceYou have this chance to practice here because you live under the guidance of the teacherHe protects you on one level so you should all devote yourselves to the practiceYouve done walking meditation before now also you should sitIn the past youve chanted together in the mornings and evenings and now also you should make the effortThese are your specific duties please apply yourselves to themThose who simply kill time in the robes dont have any strength you knowThe ones who are floundering homesick confused do you see themThese are the ones who dont put their minds into the practiceThey dont have any work to doWe cant just lie around hereBeing a Buddhist monk or novice you live and eat well you shouldnt take it for grantedKamasukhallikanuyogo is a dangerMake an effort to find your own practiceWhatever is faulty work to rectify dont get lost in externalsOne who has zeal never misses walking and sitting meditation never lets up in the maintenance of restraint and composureJust observe the monks hereWhoever having finished the meal and any business there may be having hung out his robes walks meditation  and when we walk past his kuti we see the walking path a wellworn trail and we see it often  this monk is not bored with the practiceThis is one who has effort who has zealIf all of you devote yourselves like this to the practice then not many problems will ariseIf you dont abide with the practice the walking and sitting meditation theres nothing more than just traveling aroundNot liking it here you go traveling over there not liking it there you come touring back hereThats all there is to it following your noses everywhereThese people dont persevere its good enoughYou dont have to do a lot of traveling around just stay here and develop the practice learn it in detailTraveling round can wait till later its not difficultMake an effort all of youProsperity and decline hinge on thisIf you really want to do things properly then study and practice in proportion use both of them togetherIts like the body and the mindIf the mind is at ease and the body free of disease and healthy then the mind becomes composedIf the mind is confused even if the body is strong there will be difficulty let alone when the body experiences discomfortThe study of meditation is the study of cultivation and relinquishmentWhat I mean by study here is whenever the mind experiences a sensation do we still cling to itDo we still create problems around itDo we still experience enjoyment or aversion over itTo put it simply Do we still get lost in our thoughtsYes we doIf we dont like something we react with aversion if we do like it we react with pleasure the mind becomes defiled and stainedIf this is the case then we must see that we still have faults we are still imperfect we still have work to doThere must be more relinquishing and more persistent cultivationThis is what I mean by studyingIf we get stuck on anything we recognize that we are stuckWe know what state were in and we work to correct ourselvesLiving with the teacher or apart from the teacher should be the sameSome people are afraidTheyre afraid that if they dont walk meditation the teacher will upbraid or scold themThis is good in a way but in the true practice you dont need to be afraid of others just be wary of faults arising within your own actions speech or thoughtsWhen you see faults in your actions speech or thoughts you must guard yourselvesAttano jodayattanam  you must exhort yourself dont leave it to others to doWe must quickly improve ourselves know ourselvesThis is called studying cultivating and relinquishingLook into this till you see it clearlyLiving in this way we rely on endurance persevering in face of all defilementsAlthough this is good it is still on the level of practicing the Dhamma without having seen it If we have practiced the Dhamma and seen it then whatever is wrong we will have already given up whatever is useful we will have cultivatedSeeing this within ourselves we experience a sense of wellbeingNo matter what others say we know our own mind we are not movedWe can be at peace anywhereNow the younger monks and novices who have just begun to practice may think that the senior Ajahn doesnt seem to do much walking or sitting meditationDont imitate him in thisYou should emulate but not imitateTo emulate is one thing to imitate anotherThe fact is that the senior Ajahn dwells within his own particular contented abidingEven though he doesnt seem to practice externally he practices inwardlyWhatever is in his mind cannot be seen by the eyeThe practice of Buddhism is the practice of the mindEven though the practice may not be apparent in his actions or speech the mind is a different matterThus a teacher who has practiced for a long time who is proficient in the practice may seem to let go of his actions and speech but he guards his mindHe is composedSeeing only his outer actions you may try to imitate him letting go and saying whatever you want to say but its not the same thingYoure not in the same leagueThink about thisTheres a real difference you are acting from different placesAlthough the Ajahn seems to simply sit around he is not being carelessHe lives with things but it is not confused by themWe cant see this whatever is in his mind is invisible to usDont judge simply by external appearances the mind is the important thingWhen we speak our minds follow that speechWhatever actions we do our minds follow but one who has practiced already may do or say things which his mind doesnt follow because it adheres to Dhamma and VinayaFor example sometimes the Ajahn may be severe with his disciples his speech may appear to be rough and careless his actions may seem coarseSeeing this all we can see are his bodily and verbal actions but the mind which adheres to Dhamma and Vinaya cant be seenAdhere to the Buddhas instruction Dont be heedless Heedfulness is the way to the DeathlessHeedfulness is death Consider thisWhatever others do is not important just dont be heedless this is the important thingAll I have been saying here is simply to warn you that now having completed the exams you have a chance to travel around and do many thingsMay you all constantly remember yourselves as practitioners of the Dhamma a practitioner must be collected restrained and circumspectConsider the teaching which says Bhikkhu one who seeks alms If we define it this way our practice takes on one form very coarseIf we understand this word the way the Buddha defined it as one who sees the danger of samsara this is much more profoundOne who sees the danger of samsara is one who sees the faults the liability of this worldIn this world there is so much danger but most people dont see it they see the pleasure and happiness of the worldNow the Buddha says that a bhikkhu is one who sees the danger of samsaraWhat is samsaraThe suffering of samsara is overwhelming its intolerableHappiness is also samsaraThe Buddha taught us not to cling to themIf we dont see the danger of samsara then when there is happiness we cling to the happiness and forget sufferingWe are ignorant of it like a child who doesnt know fireIf we understand Dhamma practice in this way Bhikkhu one who sees the danger of samsara if we have this understanding walking sitting or lying down wherever we may be we will feel dispassionWe reflect on ourselves heedfulness is thereEven sitting at ease we feel this wayWhatever we do we see this danger so we are in a very different stateThis practice is called being one who sees the danger of samsaraOne who sees the danger of samsara lives within samsara and yet doesntThat is he understands concepts and he understands their transcendenceWhatever such a person says is not like ordinary peopleWhatever he does is not the same whatever he thinks is not the sameHis behavior is much wiserTherefore it is said Emulate but dont imitate There are two ways  emulation and imitationOne who is foolish will grab on to everythingYou mustnt do thatDont forget yourselvesAs for me this year my body is not so wellSome things I will leave to the other monks and novices to help take care ofPerhaps I will take a restFrom time immemorial its been this way and in the world its the same as long as the father and mother are still alive the children are well and prosperousWhen the parents die the children separateHaving been rich they become poorThis is usually how it is even in the lay life and one can see it here as wellFor example while the Ajahn is still alive everybody is well and prosperousAs soon as he passes away decline begins to set in immediatelyWhy is thisBecause while the teacher is still alive people become complacent and forget themselvesThey dont really make an effort with the study and the practiceAs in lay life while the mother and father are still alive the children just leave everything up to themThey lean on their parents and dont know how to look after themselvesWhen the parents die they become paupersIn the monkhood its the sameIf the Ajahn goes away or dies the monks tend to socialize break up into groups and drift into decline almost every timeWhy is thisIts because they forget themselvesLiving off the merits of the teacher everything runs smoothlyWhen the teacher passes away the disciples tend to split upTheir views clashThose who think wrongly live in one place those who think rightly live in anotherThose who feel uncomfortable leave their old associates and set up new places and start new lineages with their own groups of disciplesThis is how it goesIn the present its the sameThis is because we are at faultWhile the teacher is still alive we are at fault we live heedlesslyWe dont take up the standards of practice taught by the Ajahn and establish them within our own heartsWe dont really follow in his footstepsEven in the Buddhas time it was the same remember the scripturesThat old monk what was his nameSubhadda BhikkhuWhen Venerable Maha Kassapa was returning from Pava he asked an ascetic on the way Is the Lord Buddha faring well The ascetic answered The Lord Buddha entered Parinibbana seven days agoThose monks who were still unenlightened were griefstricken crying and wailingThose who had attained the Dhamma reflected to themselves Ah the Buddha has passed awayHe has journeyed on But those who were still thick with defilements such as Venerable Subhadda saidWhat are you all crying forThe Buddha has passed awayThats goodNow we can live at easeWhen the Buddha was still alive he was always bothering us with some rule or other we couldnt do this or say thatNow the Buddha has passed away thats fineWe can do whatever we want say what we want Why should you cryIts been so from way back then till the present dayHowever that may be even though its impossible to preserve entirely Suppose we had a glass and we took care to preserve itEach time we used it we cleaned it and put it away in a safe placeBeing very careful with that glass we can use it for a long time and then when weve finished with it others can also use itNow using glasses carelessly and breaking them every day and using one glass for ten years before it breaks  which is betterOur practice is like thisFor instance if out of all of us living here practicing steadily only ten of you practice well then Wat Ba Pong will prosperJust as in the villages in the village of one hundred houses even if there are only fifty good people that village will prosperActually to find even ten would be difficultOr take a monastery like this one here it is hard to find even five or six monks who have real commitment who really do the practiceIn any case we dont have any responsibilities now other than to practice wellThink about it what do we own hereWe dont have wealth possessions and families any moreEven food we take only once a dayWeve given up many things already even better things than theseAs monks and novices we give up everythingWe own nothingAll those things people really enjoy have been discarded by usGoing forth as a Buddhist monk is in order to practiceWhy then should we hanker for other things indulging in greed aversion or delusionTo occupy our hearts with other things is no longer appropriateConsider why have we gone forthWhy are we practicingWe have gone forth to practiceIf we dont practice then we just lie aroundIf we dont practice then we are worse off than lay people we dont have any functionIf we dont perform any function or accept our responsibilities its a waste of the samanas lifeIt contradicts the aims of a samanaIf this is the case then we are heedlessBeing heedless is like being deadAsk yourself will you have time to practice when you dieConstantly ask yourself When will I die If we contemplate in this way our mind will be alert every second heedfulness will always be presentWhen there is no heedlessness sati  recollection of what is what  will automatically followWisdom will be clear seeing all the things clearly as they areRecollection guards the mind knowing the arising of sensations at all times day and nightthat is to have satiTo have sati is to be composedTo be composed is to be heedfulIf one is heedful then one is practicing rightlyThis is our specific responsibilitySo today I would like to present this to you allIf in the future you leave here for one of the branch monasteries or anywhere else dont forget yourselvesThe fact is you are still not perfect still not completedYou still have a lot of work to do many responsibilities to shoulderNamely the practices of cultivation and relinquishmentBe concerned about this every one of youWhether you live at this monastery or a branch monastery preserve the standards of practiceNowadays there are many of us many branch templesAll the branch monasteries owe their origination to Wat Ba PongWe could say that Wat Ba Pong was the parent the teacher the example for all branch monasteriesSo especially the teachers monks and novices of Wat Ba Pong should try to set the example to be the guide for all the other branch monasteries continuing to be diligent in the practices and responsibilities of a samanaWat Wana Potiyahn here is certainly very peaceful but this is meaningless if our minds are not calmAll places are peacefulThat some may seem distracting is because of our mindsHowever a quiet place can help to become calm by giving one the opportunity to train and thus harmonize with its calmYou should all bear in mind that this practice is difficultTo train other things is not so difficult its easy but the human mind is hard to trainThe Lord Buddha trained his mindThe mind is the important thingEverything within this bodymind system comes together at the mindThe eyes ears nose tongue and body all receive sensations and send them into the mind which is the supervisor of all the other sense organsTherefore it is important to train the mindIf the mind is well trained all problems come to an endIf there are still problems its because the mind still doubts it doesnt know in accordance with the truthThat is why there are problemsSo recognize that all of you have come fully prepared for practicing DhammaWhether standing walking sitting or reclining the tools you need with which to practice are wellprovided wherever you areThey are there just like the DhammaThe Dhamma is something which abounds everywhereRight here on land or in water wherever the Dhamma is always thereThe Dhamma is perfect and complete but its our practice thats not yet completeThe Lord Fully Enlightened Buddha taught a means by which all of us may practice and come to know this DhammaIt isnt a big thing only a small thing but its rightFor example look at hairIf we know even one strand of hair then we know every strand both our own and also that of othersWe know that they are all simply hair By knowing one strand of hair we know it allOr consider peopleIf we see the true nature of conditions within ourselves then we know all the other people in the world also because all people are the sameDhamma is like thisIts a small thing and yet its bigThat is to see the truth of one condition is to see the truth of them allWhen we know the truth as it is all problems come to an endNevertheless the training is difficultWhy is it difficultIts difficult because of wanting tanhaIf you dont want then you dont practiceBut if you practice out of desire you wont see the DhammaThink about it all of youIf you dont want to practice you cant practiceYou must first want to practice in order to actually do the practiceWhether stepping forward or stepping back you meet desireThis is why the cultivators of the past have said that this practice is something thats extremely difficult to doYou dont see Dhamma because of desireSometimes desire is very strong you want to see the Dhamma immediately but the Dhamma is not your mind  your mind is not yet DhammaThe Dhamma is one thing and the mind is anotherIts not that whatever you like is Dhamma and whatever you dont like isntThats not the way it goesActually this mind of ours is simply a condition of Nature like a tree in the forestIf you want a plank or a beam it must come from the tree but the tree is still only a treeIts not yet a beam or a plankBefore it can really be of use to us we must take that tree and saw it into beams or planksIts the same tree but it becomes transformed into something elseIntrinsically its just a tree a condition of NatureBut in its raw state it isnt yet of much use to those who need timberOur mind is like thisIt is a condition of NatureAs such it perceives thoughts it discriminates into beautiful and ugly and so onThis mind of ours must be further trainedWe cant just let it beIts a condition of Nature train it to realize that its a condition of NatureImprove on Nature so that its appropriate to our needs which is DhammaDhamma is something which must be practiced and brought withinIf you dont practice you wont knowFrankly speaking you wont know the Dhamma by just reading it or studying itOr if you do know it your knowledge is still defectiveFor example this spittoon hereEverybody knows its a spittoon but they dont fully know the spittoonWhy dont they fully know itIf I called this spittoon a saucepan what would you saySuppose that every time I asked for it I said Please bring that saucepan over here that would confuse youWhy soBecause you dont fully know the spittoonIf you did there would be no problemYou would simply pick up that object and hand it to me because actually there isnt any spittoonDo you understandIts a spittoon due to conventionThis convention is accepted all over the country so its spittoonBut there isnt any real spittoon If somebody wants to call it a saucepan it can be a saucepanIt can be whatever you call itThis is called concept If we fully know the spittoon even if somebody calls it a saucepan theres no problemWhatever others may call it we are unperturbed because we are not blind to its true natureThis is one who knows DhammaNow lets come back to ourselvesSuppose somebody said Youre crazy or Youre stupid for exampleEven though it may not be true you wouldnt feel so goodEverything becomes difficult because of our ambitions to have and to achieveBecause of these desires to get and to be because we dont know according to the truth we have no contentmentIf we know the Dhamma are enlightened to the Dhamma greed aversion and delusion will disappearWhen we understand the way things are there is nothing for them to rest onWhy is the practice so difficult and arduousBecause of desiresAs soon as we sit down to meditate we want to become peacefulIf we didnt want to find peace we wouldnt sit we wouldnt practiceAs soon as we sit down we want peace to be right there but wanting the mind to be calm makes for confusion and we feel restlessThis is how it goesSo the Buddha says Dont speak out of desire dont sit out of desire dont walk out of desire Whatever you do dont do it with desire Desire means wantingIf you dont want to do something you wont do itIf our practice reaches this point we can get quite discouragedHow can we practiceAs soon as we sit down there is desire in the mindIts because of this that the body and mind are difficult to observeIf they are not the self nor belonging to self then who do they belong toIts difficult to resolve these things we must rely on wisdomThe Buddha says we must practice by letting goIts hard to understand this practice of letting go isnt itIf we let go then we just dont practice rightBecause weve let goSuppose we went to buy some coconuts in the market and while we were carrying them back someone askedWhat did you buy those coconuts forI bought them to eatAre you going to eat the shells as wellNoI dont believe youIf youre not going to eat the shells then why did you buy them alsoWell what do you sayHow are you going to answer their questionWe practice with desireIf we didnt have desire we wouldnt practicePracticing with desire is tanhaContemplating in this way can give rise to wisdom you knowFor example those coconuts Are you going to eat the shells as wellOf course notThen why do you take themBecause the time hasnt yet come for you to throw them awayTheyre useful for wrapping up the coconut inIf after eating the coconut you throw the shells away there is no problemOur practice is like thisThe Buddha said Dont act on desire dont speak from desire dont eat with desire Standing walking sitting or reclining whatever dont do it with desireThis means to do it with detachmentIts just like buying the coconuts from the marketWere not going to eat the shells but its not yet time to throw them awayWe keep them firstThis is how the practice isConcept and Transcendence are coexistent just like a coconutThe flesh the husk and the shell are all togetherWhen we buy it we buy the whole lotIf somebody wants to accuse us of eating coconut shells thats their business we know what were doingWisdom is something each of us find for oneselfTo see it we must go neither fast nor slowWhat should we doGo to where there is neither fast nor slowGoing fast or going slow are not the wayBut were all impatient were in a hurryAs soon as we begin we want to rush to the end we dont want to be left behindWe want to succeedWhen it comes to fixing their minds for meditation some people go too far They light the incense prostrate and make a vow As long as this incense is not yet completely burnt I will not rise from my sitting even if I collapse or die no matter what Ill die sitting Having made their vow they start their sittingAs soon as they start to sit Maras hordes come rushing at them from all sidesTheyve only sat for an instant and already they think the incense must be finishedThey open their eyes for a peek Oh Theres still ages leftThey grit their teeth and sit some more feeling hot flustered agitated and confused Reaching the breaking point they think it must be finished by now Have another peek Oh noIts not even halfway yetTwo or three times and its still not finished so they just give up pack it in and sit there hating themselvesIm so stupid Im so hopeless They sit and hate themselves feeling like a hopeless caseThis just gives rise to frustration and hindrancesThis is called the hindrance of illwillThey cant blame others so they blame themselvesAnd why is thisIts all because of wantingActually it isnt necessary to go through all thatTo concentrate means to concentrate with detachment not to concentrate yourself into knotsBut maybe we read the scriptures about the life of the Buddha how he sat under the Bodhi tree and determined to himselfAs long as I have still not attained Supreme Enlightenment I will not rise from this place even if my blood dries upReading this in the books you may think of trying it yourselfYoull do it like the BuddhaBut you havent considered that your car is only a small oneThe Buddhas car was a really big one he could take it all in one goWith only your tiny little car how can you possibly take it all at onceIts a different story altogetherWhy do we think like thatBecause were too extremeSometimes we go too low sometimes we go too highThe point of balance is so hard to findNow Im only speaking from experienceIn the past my practice was like thisPracticing in order to get beyond wanting if we dont want can we practiceI was stuck hereBut to practice with wanting is sufferingI didnt know what to do I was baffledThen I realized that the practice which is steady is the important thingOne must practice consistentlyThey call this the practice that is consistent in all postures Keep refining the practice dont let it become a disasterPractice is one thing disaster is anotherMost people usually create disasterWhen they feel lazy they dont bother to practice they only practice when they feel energeticThis is how I tended to beAll of you ask yourselves now is this rightTo practice when you feel like it not when you dont is that in accordance with the DhammaIs it straightIs it in line with the TeachingThis is what makes practice inconsistentWhether you feel like it or not you should practice just the same this is how the Buddha taughtMost people wait till theyre in the mood before practicing when they dont feel like it they dont botherThis is as far as they goThis is called disaster its not practiceIn the true practice whether you are happy or depressed you practice whether its easy or difficult you practice whether its hot or cold you practiceIts straight like thisIn the real practice whether standing walking sitting or reclining you must have the intention to continue the practice steadily making your sati consistent in all posturesAt first thought it seems as if you should stand for as long as you walk walk for as long as you sit sit for as long as you lie down Ive tried it but I couldnt do itIf a meditator were to make his standing walking sitting and lying down all equal how many days could he keep it up forStand for five minutes sit for five minutes lie down for five minutes I couldnt do it for very longSo I sat down and thought about it some moreWhat does it all meanPeople in this world cant practice like thisThen I realized Oh thats not right it cant be right because its impossible to doStanding walking sitting reclining make them all consistentTo make the postures consistent the way they explain it in the books is impossibleBut it is possible to do this The mind just consider the mindTo have sati recollection sampajañña self awareness and pañña allround wisdom this you can doThis is something thats really worth practicingThis means that while standing we have sati while walking we have sati while sitting we have sati and while reclining we have sati  consistentlyThis is possibleWe put awareness into our standing walking sitting lying down  into all posturesWhen the mind has been trained like this it will constantly recollect Buddho Buddho Buddho which is knowingKnowing whatKnowing what is right and what is wrong at all timesYes this is possibleThis is getting down to the real practiceThat is whether standing walking sitting or lying down there is continuous satiThen you should understand those conditions which should be given up and those which should be cultivatedYou know happiness you know unhappinessWhen you know happiness and unhappiness your mind will settle at the point which is free of happiness and unhappinessHappiness is the loose path kamasukhallikanuyogoUnhappiness is the tight path attakilamathanuyogoIf we know these two extremes we pull it backWe know when the mind is inclining towards happiness or unhappiness and we pull it back we dont allow it to lean overWe have this sort of awareness we adhere to the One Path the single DhammaWe adhere to the awareness not allowing the mind to follow its inclinationsBut in your practice it doesnt tend to be like that does itYou follow your inclinationsIf you follow your inclinations its easy isnt itBut this is the ease which causes suffering like someone who cant be bothered workingHe takes it easy but when the time comes to eat he hasnt got anythingThis is how it goesSo Ive contended with many aspects of the Buddhas teaching in the past but I couldnt really beat himNowadays I accept itI accept that the many teachings of the Buddha are straight down the line so Ive taken those teachings and used them to train both myself and othersThe practice which is important is patipadaWhat is patipadaIt is simply all our various activities standing walking sitting reclining and everything elseThis is the patipada of the bodyNow the patipada of the mind how many times in the course of today have you felt lowHow many times have you felt highHave there been any noticeable feelingsWe must know ourselves like thisHaving seen those feelings can we let goWhatever we cant yet let go of we must work withWhen we see that we cant yet let go of some particular feeling we must take it and examine it with wisdomReason it outWork with itThis is practiceFor example when you are feeling zealous practice and then when you feel lazy try to continue the practiceIf you cant continue at full speed then at least do half as muchDont just waste the day away by being lazy and not practicingDoing that will lead to disaster its not the way of a cultivatorNow Ive heard some people say Oh this year I was really in a bad wayHow comeI was sick all yearI couldnt practice at allOhIf they dont practice when death is near when will they ever practiceIf theyre feeling well do you think theyll practiceNo they only get lost in happinessIf theyre suffering they still dont practice they get lost in thatI dont know when people think theyre going to practiceThey can only see that theyre sick in pain almost dead from fever thats right bring it on heavy thats where the practice isWhen people are feeling happy it just goes to their heads and they get vain and conceitedWe must cultivate our practiceWhat this means is that whether you are happy or unhappy you must practice just the sameIf you are feeling well you should practice and if you are feeling sick you should also practiceThose who think This year I couldnt practice at all I was sick the whole time if these people are feeling well they just walk around singing songsThis is wrong thinking not right thinkingThis is why the cultivators of the past have all maintained the steady training of the heartIf things are to go wrong just let them be with the body not in mindThere was a time in my practice after I had been practicing about five years when I felt that living with others was a hindranceI would sit in my kuti and try to meditate and people would keep coming by for a chat and disturbing meI ran off to live by myselfI thought I couldnt practice with those people bothering meI was fed up so I went to live in a small deserted monastery in the forest near a small villageI stayed there alone speaking to noone  because there was nobody else to speak toAfter Id been there about fifteen days the thought arose HmmIt would be good to have a novice or pakow here with meHe could help me out with some small jobs I knew it would come up and sure enough there it wasHeyYoure a real characterYou say youre fed up with your friends fed up with your fellow monks and novices and now you want a noviceWhats thisNo it says I want a good noviceThereWhere are all the good people can you find anyWhere are you going to find a good personIn the whole monastery there were only nogood peopleYou must have been the only good person to have run away like thisYou have to follow it up like this follow up the tracks of your thoughts until you seeHmmThis is the important oneWhere is there a good person to be foundThere arent any good people you must find goodness anywhere else you must look within yourselfIf you are good in yourself then wherever you go will be goodWhether others criticize or praise you you are still goodIf you arent good then when others criticize you you get angry and when they praise you you get pleasedAt that time I reflected on this and have found it to be true from that day up until the presentGoodness must be found withinAs soon as I saw this that feeling of wanting to run away disappearedIn later times whenever I had that desire arise I let it goWhenever it arose I was aware of it and kept my awareness on thatThus I had a solid foundationWherever I lived whether people condemned me or whatever they would say I would reflect that the point is not whether they were good or badGood or evil must be seen within ourselvesHowever other people are thats their concernDont go thinking Oh today is too hot or Today is too cold or Today isWhatever the day is like thats just the way it isReally you are simply blaming the weather for your own lazinessWe must see the Dhamma within ourselves then there is a surer kind of peaceSo for all of you who have come to practice here even though its only for a few days still many things will ariseMany things may be arising which youre not even aware ofThere is some right thinking some wrong thinking many many thingsSo I say this practice is difficultEven though some of you may experience some peace when you sit in meditation dont be in a hurry to congratulate yourselvesLikewise if there is some confusion dont blame yourselvesIf things seem to be good dont delight in them and if theyre not good dont be averse to themJust look at it all look at what you haveJust look dont bother judgingIf its good dont hold fast to it if its bad dont cling to itGood and bad can both bite so dont hold fast to themThe practice is simply to sit sit and watch it allGood moods and bad moods come and go as is their natureDont only praise your mind or only condemn it know the right time for these thingsWhen its time for congratulations then congratulate it but just a little dont overdo itJust like teaching a child sometimes you may have to spank it a littleIn our practice sometimes we may have to punish ourselves but dont punish yourself all the timeIf you punish yourself all the time in a while youll just give up the practiceBut then you cant give yourself a good time and take it easy eitherThats not the way to practiceWe practice according to the Middle WayWhat is the Middle WayThis Middle Way is difficult to follow you cant rely on your moods and desiresDont think that only sitting with the eyes closed is practiceIf you do think this way then quickly change your thinkingSteady practice is having the attitude of practice while standing walking sitting and lying downWhen coming out of sitting meditation reflect that youre simply changing posturesIf you reflect in this way you will have peaceWherever you are you will have this attitude of practice with you constantly you will have a steady awareness within yourselfThose of you who having finished their evening sitting simply indulge in their moods spending the whole day letting the mind wander where it wants will find that the next evening when sitting meditation all they get is the backwash from the days aimless thinkingThere is no foundation of calm because they have let it go cold all dayIf you practice like this your mind gets gradually further and further from the practiceWhen I ask some of my disciples How is your meditation goingThey say Oh its all gone now You seeThey can keep it up for a month or two but in a year or two its all finishedWhy is thisIts because they dont take this essential point into their practiceWhen theyve finished sitting they let go of their samadhiThey start to sit for shorter and shorter periods till they reach the point where as soon as they start to sit they want to finishEventually they dont even sitIts the same with bowing to the BuddhaimageAt first they make the effort to prostrate every night before going to sleep but after a while their minds begin to straySoon they dont bother to prostrate at all they just nod till eventually its all goneThey throw out the practice completelyTherefore understand the importance of sati practice constantlyRight practice is steady practiceWhether standing walking sitting or reclining the practice must continueThis means that practice meditation is done in the mind not in the bodyIf our mind has zeal is conscientious and ardent then there will be awarenessThe mind is the important thingThe mind is that which supervises everything we doWhen we understand properly then we practice properlyWhen we practice properly we dont go astrayEven if we only do a little that is still all rightFor example when you finish sitting in meditation remind yourselves that you are not actually finishing meditation you are simply changing posturesYour mind is still composedWhether standing walking sitting or reclining you have sati with youIf you have this kind of awareness you can maintain your internal practiceIn the evening when you sit again the practice continues uninterruptedYour effort is unbroken allowing the mind to attain calmThis is called steady practiceWhether we are talking or doing other things we should try to make the practice continuousIf our mind has recollection and selfawareness continuously our practice will naturally develop it will gradually come togetherThe mind will find peace because it will know what is right and what is wrongIt will see what is happening within us and realize peaceIf we are to develop sila or samadhi we must first have paññaSome people think that theyll develop moral restraint one year samadhi the next year and the year after that theyll develop wisdomThey think these three things are separateThey think that this year they will develop sila but if the mind is not firm how can they do itIf there is no understanding how can they do itWithout samadhi or pañña sila will be sloppyIn fact these three come together at the same pointWhen we have sila we have samadhi when we have samadhi we have paññaThey are all one like a mangoWhether its small or fully grown its still a mangoWhen its ripe its still the same mangoIf we think in simple terms like this we can see it more easilyWe dont have to learn a lot of things just to know these things to know our practiceWhen it comes to meditation some people dont get what they want so they just give up saying they dont yet have the merit to practice meditationThey can do bad things they have that sort of talent but they dont have the talent to do goodThey throw it in saying they dont have a good enough foundationThis is the way people are they side with their defilementsNow that you have this chance to practice please understand that whether you find it difficult or easy to develop samadhi is entirely up to you not the samadhiIf it is difficult it is because you are practicing wronglyIn our practice we must have Right ViewIf our view is right then everything else is right Right View Right Intention Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Recollection Right Concentration  the Eightfold PathWhen there is Right View all the other factors will follow onWhatever happens dont let your mind stray off the trackLook within yourself and you will see clearlyFor the best practice as I see it it isnt necessary to read many booksTake all the books and lock them awayJust read your own mindYou have all been burying yourselves in books from the time you entered schoolI think that now you have this opportunity and have the time take the books put them in a cupboard and lock the doorJust read your mindWhenever something arises within the mind whether you like it or not whether it seems right or wrong just cut it off with this is not a sure thing Whatever arises just cut it down not sure not sure With just this single ax you can cut it all downIts all not sureFor the duration of this next month that you will be staying in this forest monastery you should make a lot of headwayYou will see the truthThis not sure is really an important oneThis one develops wisdomThe more you look the more you will see not surenessAfter youve cut something off with not sure it may come circling round and pop up againYes its truly not sure Whatever pops up just stick this one label on it allnot sure You stick the sign onnot sure and in a while when its turn comes it crops up again Ah not sure Dig hereNot sureYou will see this same old one whos been fooling you month in month out year in year out from the day you were bornTheres only this one whos been fooling you all alongSee this and realize the way things areWhen your practice reaches this point you wont cling to sensations because they are all uncertainHave you ever noticedMaybe you see a clock and think Oh this is nice Buy it and see in not many days youre bored with it alreadyThis pen is really beautiful so you take the trouble to buy oneIn not many months you tire of it againThis is how it isWhere is there any certaintyIf we see all these things as uncertain then their value fades awayAll things become insignificantWhy should we hold on to things that have no valueWe keep them only as we might keep an old rag to wipe our feet withWe see all sensations as equal in value because they all have the same natureWhen we understand sensations we understand the worldThe world is sensations and sensations are the worldIf we arent fooled by sensations we arent fooled by the worldIf we arent fooled by the world we arent fooled by sensationsThe mind which sees this will have a firm foundation of wisdomSuch a mind will not have many problemsAny problems it does have it can solveWhen there are no more problems there are no more doubtsPeace arises in their steadThis is called Practice If we really practice it must be like thisTake a look at the example of the BuddhaBoth in his own practice and in his methods for teaching the disciples he was exemplaryThe Buddha taught the standards of practice as skillful means for getting rid of conceit he couldnt do the practice for usHaving heard that teaching we must further teach ourselves practice for ourselvesThe results will arise here not at the teachingThe Buddhas teaching can only enable us to get an initial understanding of the Dhamma but the Dhamma is not yet within our heartsWhy notBecause we havent yet practiced we havent yet taught ourselvesThe Dhamma arises at the practiceIf you know it you know it through the practiceIf you doubt it you doubt it at the practiceTeachings from the Masters may be true but simply listening to Dhamma is not yet enough to enable us to realize itThe teaching simply points out the way to realizeTo realize the Dhamma we must take that teaching and bring it into our heartsThat part which is for the body we apply to the body that part which is for the speech we apply to the speech and that part which is for the mind we apply to the mindThis means that after hearing the teaching we must further teach ourselves to know that Dhamma to be that DhammaThe Buddha said that those who simply believe others are not truly wiseA wise person practices until he is one with the Dhamma until he can have confidence in himself independent of othersOn one occasion while Venerable Sariputta was sitting listening respectfully at his feet as the Buddha expounded the Dhamma the Buddha turned to him and askedSariputta do you believe this teachingVenerable Sariputta replied No I dont yet believe itNow this is a good illustrationVenerable Sariputta listened and he took noteWhen he said he didnt yet believe he wasnt being careless he was speaking the truthHe simply took note of that teaching because he had not yet developed his own understanding of it so he told the Buddha that he didnt yet believe  because he really didnt believeThese words almost sound as if Venerable Sariputta was being rude but actually he wasntHe spoke the truth and the Buddha praised him for itGood good SariputtaA wise person doesnt readily believe he should consider first before believingConviction in a belief can take various formsOne form reasons according to Dhamma while another form is contrary to the DhammaThis second way is heedless it is a foolhardy understanding micchaditthi wrong viewOne doesnt listen to anybody elseTake the example of Dighanakha the BrahmanThis Brahman only believed himself he wouldnt believe othersAt one time when the Buddha was resting at Rajagaha Dighanakha went to listen to his teachingOr you might say that Dighanakha went to teach the Buddha because he was intent on expounding his own viewsI am of the view that nothing suits meThis was his viewThe Buddha listened to Dighanakhas view and then answeredBrahman this view of yours doesnt suit you eitherWhen the Buddha had answered in this way Dighanakha was stumpedHe didnt know what to sayThe Buddha explained in many ways till the Brahman understoodHe stopped to reflect and sawHmm this view of mine isnt rightOn hearing the Buddhas answer the Brahman abandoned his conceited views and immediately saw the truthHe changed right then and there turning right around just as one would invert ones handHe praised the teaching of the Buddha thusListening to the Blessed Ones teaching my mind was illumined just as one living in darkness might perceive lightMy mind is like an overturned basin which has been uprighted like a man who has been lost and finds the wayNow at that time a certain knowledge arose within his mind within that mind which had been uprightedWrong view vanished and right view took its placeDarkness disappeared and light aroseThe Buddha declared that the Brahman Dighanakha was one who had opened the Dhamma EyePreviously Dighanakha clung to his own views and had no intention of changing themBut when he heard the Buddhas teaching his mind saw the truth he saw that his clinging to those views was wrongWhen the right understanding arose he was able to perceive his previous understanding as mistaken so he compared his experience with a person living in darkness who had found lightThis is how it isAt that time the Brahman Dighanakha transcended his wrong viewNow we must change in this wayBefore we can give up defilements we must change our perspectiveWe must begin to practice rightly and practice wellPreviously we didnt practice rightly or well and yet we thought we were right and good just the sameWhen we really look into the matter we upright ourselves just like turning over ones handThis means that the One Who Knows or wisdom arises in the mind so that it is able to see things anewA new kind of awareness arisesTherefore cultivators must practice to develop this knowing which we call Buddho the One Who Knows in their mindsOriginally the one who knows is not there our knowledge is not clear true or completeThis knowledge is therefore too weak to train the mindBut then the mind changes or inverts as a result of this awareness called wisdom or insight which exceeds our previous awarenessThat previous one who knows did not yet know fully and so was unable to bring us to our objectiveThe Buddha therefore taught to look within opanayikoLook within dont look outwardsOr if you look outwards then look within to see the cause and effect thereinLook for the truth in all things because external objects and internal objects are always affecting each otherOur practice is to develop a certain type of awareness until it becomes stronger than our previous awarenessThis causes wisdom and insight to arise within the mind enabling us to clearly know the workings of the mind the language of the mind and the ways and means of all the defilementsThe Buddha when he first left his home in search of liberation was probably not really sure what to do much like usHe tried many ways to develop his wisdomHe looked for teachers such as Udaka Ramaputta going there to practice meditation right leg on left leg right hand on left hand body erect eyes closed letting go of everything until he was able to attain a high level of absorption samadhiBut when he came out of that samadhi his old thinking came up and he would attach to it just as beforeSeeing this he knew that wisdom had not yet arisenHis understanding had not yet penetrated to the truth it was still incomplete still lackingSeeing this he nonetheless gained some understanding  that this was not yet the summation of practice  but he left that place to look for a new teacherWhen the Buddha left his old teacher he didnt condemn him he did as does the bee which takes nectar from the flower without damaging the petalsThe Buddha then proceeded on to study with Alara Kalama and attained an even higher state of samadhi but when he came out of that state Bimba and Rahula came back into his thoughts again the old memories and feelings came up againHe still had lust and desireReflecting inward he saw that he still hadnt reached his goal so he left that teacher alsoHe listened to his teachers and did his best to follow their teachingsHe continually surveyed the results of his practice he didnt simply do things and then discard them for something elseEven when it came to ascetic practices after he had tried them he realized that starving until one is almost skeleton is simply a matter for the bodyThe body doesnt know anythingpracticing in that way was like executing an innocent person while ignoring the real thiefWhen the Buddha really looked into the matter he saw that practice is not a concern of the body it is a concern of the mindAttakilamathanuyogo  the Buddha had tried it and found that it was limited to the bodyIn fact all Buddhas are enlightened in mindWhether in regard to the body or to the mind just throw them all together as Transient Imperfect and Ownerless  aniccam dukkham and anattaThey are simply conditions of NatureThey arise depending on supporting factors exist for a while and then ceaseWhen there are appropriate conditions they arise again having arisen they exist for a while then cease once moreThese things are not a self a being an us or a them Theres nobody there simply feelingsHappiness has no intrinsic self suffering has no intrinsic selfNo self can be found there are simply elements of Nature which arise exist and ceaseThey go through this constant cycle of changeAll beings including humans tend to see the arising as themselves the existence as themselves and the cessation as themselvesThus they cling to everythingThey dont want things to be the way they are they dont want them to be otherwiseFor instance having arisen they dont want things to cease having experienced happiness they dont want sufferingIf suffering does arise they want it to go away as quickly as possible but even better if it doesnt arise at allThis is because they see this body and mind as themselves or belonging to themselves and so they demand those things to follow their wishesThis sort of thinking is like building a dam or a dike without making an outlet to let the water throughThe result is that the dam burstsAnd so it is with this kind of thinkingThe Buddha saw that thinking in this way is the cause of sufferingSeeing this cause the Buddha gave it upThis is the Noble Truth of the Cause of SufferingThe Truths of Suffering its Cause its Cessation and the Way leading to that Cessation people are stuck right hereIf people are to overcome their doubts its right at this pointSeeing that these things are simply rupa and nama or corporeality and mentality it becomes obvious that they are not a being a person an us or a them They simply follow the laws of NatureOur practice is to know things in this wayWe dont have the power to really control these things we arent really their ownersTrying to control them causes suffering because they arent really ours to controlNeither body nor mind are self or othersIf we know this as it really is then we see clearlyWe see the truth we are at one with itIts like seeing a lump of red hot iron which has been heated in a furnaceIts hot all overWhether we touch it on top the bottom or the sides its hotNo matter where we touch it its hotThis is how you should see thingsMostly when we start to practice we want to attain to achieve to know and to see but we dont yet know what it is were going to achieve or knowThere was once a disciple of mine whose practice was plagued with confusion and doubtsBut he kept practicing and I kept instructing him till he began to find some peaceBut when he eventually became a bit calm he got caught up in his doubts again saying What do I do next Therethe confusion arises againHe says he wants peace but when he gets it he doesnt want it he asks what he should do nextSo in this practice we must do everything with detachmentHow are we to detachWe detach by seeing things clearlyKnow the characteristics of the body and mind as they areWe meditate in order to find peace but in doing so we see that which is not peacefulThis is because movement is the nature of the mindWhen practicing samadhi we fix our attention on the in and outbreaths at the nose tip or the upper lipThis lifting the mind to fix it is called vitakka or lifting up When we have thus lifted the mind and are fixed on an object this is called vicara the contemplation of the breath at the nose tipThis quality of vicara will naturally mingle with other mental sensations and we may think that our mind is not still that it wont calm down but actually this is simply the workings of vicara as it mingles with those sensationsNow if this goes too far in the wrong direction our mind will lose its collectedness so then we must set up the mind afresh lifting it up to the object of concentration with vitakkaAs soon as we have thus established our attention vicara takes over mingling with the various mental sensationsNow when we see this happening our lack of understanding may lead us to wonder Why has my mind wanderedI wanted it to be still why isnt it still This is practicing with attachmentActually the mind is simply following its nature but we go and add on to that activity by wanting the mind to be still and thinking Why isnt it still Aversion arises and so we add that on to everything else increasing our doubts increasing our suffering and increasing our confusionSo if there is vicara reflecting on the various happenings within the mind in this way we should wisely consider Ah the mind is simply like this There thats the One Who Knows talking telling you to see things as they areThe mind is simply like thisWe let it go at that and the mind becomes peacefulWhen its no longer centered we bring up vitakka once more and shortly there is calm againVitakka and vicara work together like thisWe use vicara to contemplate the various sensations which ariseWhen vicara becomes gradually more scattered we once again lift our attention with vitakkaThe important thing here is that our practice at this point must be done with detachmentSeeing the process of vicara interacting with the mental sensations we may think that the mind is confused and become averse to this processThis is the cause right hereWe arent happy simply because we want the mind to be stillThis is the cause  wrong viewIf we correct our view just a little seeing this activity as simply the nature of mind just this is enough to subdue the confusionThis is called letting goNow if we dont attach if we practice with letting go detachment within activity and activity within detachment if we learn to practice like this then vicara will naturally tend to have less to work withIf our mind ceases to be disturbed then vicara will incline to contemplating Dhamma because if we dont contemplate Dhamma the mind returns to distractionSo there is vitakka then vicara vitakka then vicara vitakka then vicara and so on until vicara becomes gradually more subtleAt first vicara goes all over the placeWhen we understand this as simply the natural activity of the mind it wont bother us unless we attach to itIts like flowing waterIf we get obsessed with it asking Why does it flow then naturally we sufferIf we understand that the water simply flows because thats its nature then theres no sufferingVicara is like thisThere is vitakka then vicara interacting with mental sensationsWe can take these sensations as our object of meditation calming the mind by noting those sensationsIf we know the nature of the mind like this then we let go just like letting the water flow byVicara becomes more and more subtlePerhaps the mind inclines to contemplating the body or death for instance or some other theme of DhammaWhen the theme of contemplation is right there will arise a feeling of wellbeingWhat is that wellbeingIt is pitiPiti wellbeing arisesIt may manifest as goosepimples coolness or lightnessThe mind is enraptThis is called pitiThere are also pleasures sukha the coming and going of various sensations and the state of ekaggatarammana or onepointednessNow if we talk in terms of the first stage of concentration it must be like this vitakka vicara piti sukha ekaggataSo what is the second stage likeAs the mind becomes progressively more subtle vitakka and vicara become comparatively coarser so that they are discarded leaving only piti sukha and ekaggataThis is something that the mind does of itself we dont have to conjecture about it just to know things as they areAs the mind becomes more refined piti is eventually thrown off leaving only sukha and ekaggata and so we take note of thatWhere does piti go toIt doesnt go anywhere its just that the mind becomes increasingly more subtle so that it throws off those qualities that are too coarse for itWhatevers too coarse it throws out and it keeps throwing off like this until it reaches the peak of subtlety known in the books as the Fourth Jhana the highest level of absorptionHere the mind has progressively discarded whatever becomes too coarse for it until there remain only ekaggata and upekkha equanimityTheres nothing further this is the limitWhen the mind is developing the stages of samadhi it must proceed in this way but please let us understand the basics of practiceWe want to make the mind still but it wont be stillThis is practicing out of desire but we dont realize itWe have the desire for calmThe mind is already disturbed and then we further disturb things by wanting to make it calmThis very wanting is the causeWe dont see that this wanting to calm the mind is tanhaIts just like increasing the burdenThe more we desire calm the more disturbed the mind becomes until we just give upWe end up fighting all the time sitting and struggling with ourselvesWhy is thisBecause we dont reflect back on how we have set up the mindKnow that the conditions of mind are simply the way they areWhatever arises just observe itIt is simply the nature of the mind it isnt harmful unless we dont understand its natureIts not dangerous if we see its activity for what it isSo we practice with vitakka and vicara until the mind begins to settle down and become less forcefulWhen sensations arise we contemplate them we mingle with them and come to know themHowever usually we tend to start fighting with them because right from the beginning were determined to calm the mindAs soon as we sit the thoughts come to bother usAs soon as we set up our meditation object our attention wanders the mind wanders off after all the thoughts thinking that those thoughts have come to disturb us but actually the problem arises right here from the very wantingIf we see that the mind is simply behaving according to its nature that it naturally comes and goes like this and if we dont get overinterested in it we can understand its ways as much the same as a childChildren dont know any better they may say all kinds of thingsIf we understand them we just let them talk children naturally talk like thatWhen we let go like this there is no obsession with the childWe can talk to our guests undisturbed while the child chatters and plays aroundThe mind is like thisIts not harmful unless we grab on to it and get obsessed over itThats the real cause of troubleWhen piti arises one feels an indescribable pleasure which only those who experience can appreciateSukha arises and there is also the quality of onepointednessThere are vitakka vicara piti sukha and ekaggataThese five qualities all converge at the one placeEven though they are different qualities they are all collected in the one place and we can see them all there just like seeing many different kinds of fruit in the one bowlVitakka vicara piti sukha and ekaggata  we can see them all in the one mind all five qualitiesIf one were to ask How is there vitakka how is there vicara how are there piti and sukha it would be difficult to answer but when they converge in the mind we will see how it is for ourselvesAt this point our practice becomes somewhat specialWe must have recollection and selfawareness and not lose ourselvesKnow things for what they areThese are stages of meditation the potential of the mindDont doubt anything with regard to the practiceEven if you sink into the earth or fly into the air or even die while sitting dont doubt itWhatever the qualities of the mind are just stay with the knowingThis is our foundation to have sati recollection and sampajañña selfawareness whether standing walking sitting or recliningWhatever arises just leave it be dont cling to itBe it like or dislike happiness or suffering doubt or certainty contemplate with vicara and gauge the results of those qualitiesDont try to label everything just know itSee that all the things that arise in the mind are simply sensationsThey are transientThey arise exist and ceaseThats all there is to them they have no self or being they are neither us nor them They are not worthy of clinging to any of themWhen we see all rupa and nama in this way with wisdom then we will see the old tracksWe will see the transience of the mind the transience of the body the transience of happiness suffering love and hateThey are all impermanentSeeing this the mind becomes weary weary of the body and mind weary of the things that arise and cease and are transientWhen the mind becomes disenchanted it will look for a way out of all those thingsIt no longer wants to be stuck in things it sees the inadequacy of this world and the inadequacy of birthWhen the mind sees like this wherever we go we see aniccam dukkham and anattaTheres nothing left to hold on toWhether we go to sit at the foot of a tree on a mountain top or into a valley we can hear the Buddhas teachingAll trees will seem as one all beings will be as one theres nothing special about any of themThey arise exist for a while age and then die all of themWe thus see the world more clearly seeing this body and mind more clearlyThey are clearer in the light of Transience clearer in the light of Imperfection and clearer in the light of OwnerlessnessIf people hold fast to things they sufferThis is how suffering arisesIf we see that body and mind are simply the way they are no suffering arises because we dont hold fast to themWherever we go we will have wisdomEven seeing a tree we can consider it with wisdomSeeing grass and the various insects will be food for reflectionWhen it all comes down to it they all fall into the same boatThey are all Dhamma they are invariably transientThis is the truth this is the true Dhamma this is certainHow is it certainIt is certain in that the world is that way and can never be otherwiseTheres nothing more to it than thisIf we can see in this way then we have finished our journeyIn Buddhism with regard to view it is said that to feel that we are more foolish than others is not right to feel that we are equal to others is not right and to feel that we better than others is not right because there isnt any we This is how it is we must uproot conceitThis is called lokavidu  knowing the world clearly as it isIf we thus see the truth the mind will know itself completely and will sever the cause of sufferingWhen there is no longer any cause the results cannot ariseThis is the way our practice should proceedThe basics which we need to develop are firstly to be upright and honest secondly to be wary of wrongdoing thirdly to have the attribute of humility within ones heart to be aloof and content with littleIf we are content with little in regards to speech and in all other things we will see ourselves we wont be drawn into distractionsThe mind will have a foundation of sila samadhi and paññaTherefore cultivators of the path should not be carelessEven if you are right dont be carelessAnd if you are wrong dont be carelessIf things are going well or youre feeling happy dont be carelessWhy do I say dont be carelessBecause all of these things are uncertainNote them as suchIf you get peaceful just leave the peace beYou may really want to indulge in it but you should simply know the truth of it the same as for unpleasant qualitiesThis practice of the mind is up to each individualThe teacher only explains the way to train the mind because that mind is within each individualWe know whats in there nobody else can know our mind as well as we canThe practice requires this kind of honestyDo it properly dont do it halfheartedlyWhen I say do it properly does that mean you have to exhaust yourselvesNo you dont have to exhaust yourselves because the practice is done in the mindIf you know this then you will know the practiceYou dont need a whole lotJust use the standards of practice to reflect on yourself inwardlyNow the Rains Retreat is half way overFor most people its normal to let the practice slacken off after a whileThey arent consistent from beginning to endThis shows that their practice is not yet matureFor instance having determined a particular practice at the beginning of the retreat whatever it may be then we must fulfill that resolutionFor these three months make the practice consistentYou must all tryWhatever you have determined to practice consider that and reflect whether the practice has slackened offIf so make an effort to reestablish itKeep shaping up the practice just the same as when we practice meditation on the breathAs the breath goes in and out the mind gets distractedThen reestablish your attention on the breathWhen your attention wanders off again bring it back once moreThis is the sameIn regard to both the body and the mind the practice proceeds like thisPlease make an effort with itKamogha the flood of sensuality sunk in sights in sounds in smells in tastes in bodily sensationsSunk because we only look at externals we dont look inwardlyPeople dont look at themselves they only look at othersThey can see everybody else but they cant see themselvesIts not such a difficult thing to do but its just that people dont really tryFor example look at a beautiful womanWhat does that do to youAs soon as you see the face you see everything elseDo you see itJust look within your mindWhat is it like to see a womanAs soon as the eyes see just a little bit the mind sees all the restWhy is it so fastIts because you are sunk in the water You are sunk you think about it fantasize about it are stuck in itIts just like being a slave somebody else has control over youWhen they tell you to sit youve got to sit when they tell you to walk youve got to walk you cant disobey them because youre their slaveBeing enslaved by the senses is the sameNo matter how hard you try you cant seem to shake it offAnd if you expect others to do it for you you really get into troubleYou must shake it off for yourselfTherefore the Buddha left the practice of Dhamma the transcendence of suffering up to usTake nibbana for exampleThe Buddha was thoroughly enlightened so why didnt he describe nibbana in detailWhy did he only say that we should practice and find out for ourselvesWhy is thatShouldnt he have explained what nibbana is likeThe Buddha practiced developing the perfections over countless world ages for the sake of all sentient beings so why didnt he point out nibbana so that they all could see it and go there too Some people think like thisIf the Buddha really knew he would tell usWhy should he keep anything hiddenActually this sort of thinking is wrongWe cant see the truth in that wayWe must practice we must cultivate in order to seeThe Buddha only pointed out the way to develop wisdom thats allHe said that we ourselves must practiceWhoever practices will reach the goalBut that path which the Buddha taught goes against our habitsTo be frugal to be restrained we dont really like these things so we say Show us the way show us the way to nibbana so that those who like it easy like us can go there too Its the same with wisdomThe Buddha cant show you wisdom its not something that can be simply handed aroundThe Buddha can show the way to develop wisdom but whether you develop much or only a little depends on the individualMerit and accumulated virtues of people naturally differJust look at a material object such as the wooden lions in front of the hall herePeople come and look at them and cant seem to agree one person says Oh how beautiful while another says How revolting Its the one lion both beautiful and uglyJust this is enough to know how things areTherefore the realization of Dhamma is sometimes slow sometimes fastThe Buddha and his disciples were all alike in that they had to practice for themselves but even so they still relied on teachers to advise them and give them techniques in the practiceNow when we listen to Dhamma we may want to listen until all our doubts are cleared up but theyll never be cleared up simply by listeningDoubt is not overcome simply by listening or thinking we must first clean out the mindTo clean out the mind means to revise our practiceNo matter how long we were to listen to the teacher talk about the truth we couldnt know or see that truth just from listeningIf we did it would be only through guesswork or conjectureHowever even though simply listening to the Dhamma may not lead to realization it is beneficialThere were in the Buddhas time those who realized the Dhamma even realizing the highest realization  arahantship while listening to a discourseBut those people were already highly developed their minds already understood to some extentIts like a footballWhen a football is pumped up with air it expandsNow the air in that football is all pushing to get out but theres no hole for it to do soAs soon as a needle punctures the football the air comes bursting outThis is the sameThe minds of those disciples who were enlightened while listening to the Dhamma were like thisAs long as there was no catalyst to cause the reaction this pressure was within them like the footballThe mind was not yet free because of this very small thing concealing the truthAs soon as they heard the Dhamma and it hit the right spot wisdom aroseThey immediately understood immediately let go and realized the true DhammaThats how it wasIt was easyThe mind uprighted itselfIt changed or turned from one view to anotherYou could say it was far or you could say it was very nearThis is something we must do for ourselvesThe Buddha was only able to give techniques on how to develop wisdom and so with the teachers these daysThey give Dhamma talks they talk about the truth but still we cant make that truth our ownWhy notTheres a film obscuring itYou could say that we are sunk sunk in the waterKamogha  the flood of sensualityBhavogha  the flood of becomingBecoming means the sphere of birth Sensual desire is born at sights sounds tastes smells feelings and thoughts identifying with these thingsThe mind holds fast and is stuck to sensualitySome cultivators get bored fed up tired of the practice and lazyYou dont have to look very far just look at how people cant seem to keep the Dhamma in mind and yet if they get scolded theyll hold on to it for agesThey may get scolded at the beginning of the Rains and even after the Rains Retreat has ended they still havent forgotten itTheir whole lives they still wont forget it if it goes down deep enoughBut when it comes to the Buddhas teaching telling us to be moderate to be restrained to practice conscientiously why dont people take these things to their heartsWhy do they keep forgetting these thingsYou dont have to look very far just look at our practice hereFor example establishing standards such as after the meal while washing your bowls dont chatterEven this much seems to be beyond peopleEven though we know that chattering is not particularly useful and binds us to sensuality people still like talkingPretty soon they start to disagree and eventually get into arguments and squabblesTheres nothing more to it than thisNow this isnt anything subtle or refined its pretty basic and yet people dont seem to really make much effort with itThey say they want to see the Dhamma but they want to see it on their own terms they dont want to follow the path of practiceThats as far as they goAll these standards of practice are skillful means for penetrating to and seeing the Dhamma but people dont practice accordinglyTo say real practice or ardent practice doesnt necessarily mean you have to expend a whole lot of energy  just put some effort into the mind making some effort with all the feelings that arise especially those which are steeped in sensualityThese are our enemiesBut people cant seem to do itEvery year as the end of the Rains Retreat approaches it gets worse and worseSome of the monks have reached the limit of their endurance the end of their tether The closer we get to the end of the Rains the worse they get they have no consistency in their practiceI speak about this every year and yet people cant seem to remember itWe establish a certain standard and in not even a year its fallen apartAlmost finished the Retreat and it starts  the chatter the socializing and everything elseIt all goes to piecesThis is how it tends to beThose who are really interested in the practice should consider why this is soIts because people dont see the adverse results of these thingsWhen we are accepted into the Buddhist monkhood we live simplyAnd yet some of them disrobe to go to the front where the bullets fly past them every day  they prefer it like thatThey really want to goDanger surrounds them on all sides and yet theyre prepared to goWhy dont they see the dangerTheyre prepared to die by the gun but nobody wants to die developing virtueJust seeing this is enough its because theyre slaves nothing elseSee this much and you know what its all aboutPeople dont see the dangerThis is really amazing isnt itYoud think they could see it but they cantIf they cant see it even then then theres no way they can get outTheyre determined to whirl around in samsaraThis is how things areJust talking about simple things like this we can begin to understandIf you were to ask them Why were you born Theyd probably have a lot of trouble answering because they cant see itTheyre sunk in the world of the senses and sunk in becomingBhava is the sphere of birth our birthplaceTo put it simply where are beings born fromBhava is the preliminary condition for birthWherever birth takes place thats bhavaFor example suppose we had an orchard of apple trees that we were particularly fond ofThats a bhava for us if we dont reflect with wisdomHow soSuppose our orchard contained a hundred or a thousand apple trees it doesnt really matter what kind of trees they are just so long as we consider them to be our own trees then we are going to be born as a worm in every single one of those treesWe bore into every one even though our human body is still back there in the house we send out tentacles into every one of those treesNow how do we know that its a bhavaIts a bhava because of our clinging to the idea that those trees are our own that that orchard is our ownIf someone were to take an ax and cut one of the trees down the owner over there in the house dies along with the treeHe gets furious and has to go and set things right to fight and maybe even kill over itThat quarreling is the birth The sphere of birth is the orchard of trees that we cling to as our ownWe are born right at the point where we consider them to be our own born from that bhavaEven if we had a thousand apple trees if someone were to cut down just one itd be like cutting the owner downWhatever we cling to we are born right there we exist right thereWe are born as soon as we know This is knowing through notknowing we know that someone has cut down one of our treesBut we dont know that those trees are not really oursThis is called knowing through notknowing We are bound to be born into that bhavaVatta the wheel of conditioned existence operates like thisPeople cling to bhava they depend on bhavaIf they cherish bhava this is birthAnd if they fall into suffering over that same thing this is also a birthAs long as we cant let go we are stuck in the rut of samsara spinning around like a wheelLook into this contemplate itWhatever we cling to as being us or ours that is a place for birthThere must be a bhava a sphere of birth before birth can take placeTherefore the Buddha said whatever you have dont have itLet it be there but dont make it yoursYou must understand this having and not having know the truth of them dont flounder in sufferingThe place that we were born from you want to go back there and be born again dont youAll of you monks and novices do you know where you were born fromYou want to go back there dont youRight there look into thisAll of you getting readyThe nearer we get to the end of the retreat the more you start preparing to go back and be born thereReally youd think that people could appreciate what it would be like living in a persons bellyHow uncomfortable would that beJust look merely staying in your kuti for one day is enoughShut all the doors and windows and youre suffocating alreadyHow would it be to lie in a persons belly for nine or ten monthsThink about itPeople dont see the liability of thingsAsk them why they are living or why they are born and they have no ideaDo you still want to get back in thereWhyIt should be obvious but you dont see itWhy cant you see itWhat are you stuck on what are you holding ontoThink it out for yourselfIts because there is a cause for becoming and birthJust take a look at the preserved baby in the main hall have you seen itIsnt anybody alarmed by itNo noones alarmed by itA baby lying in its mothers belly is just like that preserved babyAnd yet you want to make more of those things and even want to get back and soak in there yourselfWhy dont you see the danger of it and the benefit of the practiceYou seeThats bhavaThe root is right there it revolves around thatThe Buddha taught to contemplate this pointPeople think about it but still dont seeTheyre all getting ready to go back there againthey know that it wouldnt be very comfortable in there to put their necks in the noose is really uncomfortable they still want to lay their heads in thereWhy dont they understand thisThis is where wisdom comes in where we must contemplateWhen I talk like this people say If thats the case then everybody would have to become monks and then how would the world be able to function Youll never get everybody to become monks so dont worryThe world is here because of deluded beings so this is no trifling matterI first became a novice at the age of nineI started practicing from way back thenBut in those days I didnt really know what it was all aboutI found out when I became a monkOnce I became a monk I became so waryThe sensual pleasures people indulged in didnt seem like so much fun to meI saw the suffering in themIt was like seeing a delicious banana which I knew was very sweet but which I also knew to be poisonedNo matter how sweet or tempting it was if I ate it I would dieI considered in this way every time every time I wanted to eat a banana I would see the poison steeped inside and so eventually I could withdraw my interest from those thingsNow at this age such things are not at all temptingSome people dont see the poison some see it but still want to try their luckIf your hand is wounded dont touch poison it may seep into the woundI used to consider trying it out as wellWhen I had lived as a monk for five or six years I thought of the BuddhaHe practiced for five or six years and was finished but I was still interested in the worldly life so I thought of going back to it Maybe I should go and build the world for a while I would gain some experience and learningEven the Buddha had his son RahulaMaybe Im being too strict I sat and considered this for some time until I realized Yes well thats all very fine but Im just afraid that this Buddha wont be like the last one a voice in me said Im afraid this Buddha will just sink into the mud not like the last one And so I resisted those worldly thoughtsFrom my sixth or seventh rains retreat up until the twentieth I really had to put up a fightThese days I seem to have run out of bullets Ive been shooting for a long timeIm just afraid that you younger monks and novices have still got so much ammunition you may just want to go and try out your gunsBefore you do consider carefully firstSpeaking of sensual desire its hard to give upIts really difficult to see it as it isWe must use skillful meansConsider sensual pleasures as like eating meat which gets stuck in your teethBefore you finish the meal you have to find a toothpick to pry it outWhen the meat comes out you feel some relief for a while maybe you even think that you wont eat any more meatBut when you see it again you cant resist itYou eat some more and then it gets stuck againWhen it gets stuck you have to pick it out again which gives some relief once more until you eat some more meat Thats all there is to itSensual pleasures are just like this no better than thisWhen the meat gets stuck in your teeth theres discomfortYou take a toothpick and pick it out and experience some reliefTheres nothing more to it than this sensual desire The pressure builds up and up until you let a little bit out OhThats all there is to itI dont know what all the fuss is aboutI didnt learn these things from anybody else they occurred to me in the course of my practiceI would sit in meditation and reflect on sensual pleasure as being like a red ants nestSomeone takes a piece of wood and pokes the nest until the ants come running out crawling down the wood and into their faces biting their eyes and earsAnd yet they still dont see the difficulty they are inHowever its not beyond our abilityIn the teaching of the Buddha it is said that if weve seen the harm of something no matter how good it may seem to be we know that its harmfulWhatever we havent yet seen the harm of we just think its goodIf we havent yet seen the harm of anything we cant get out of itHave you noticedNo matter how dirty it may be people like itThis kind of work isnt clean but you dont even have to pay people to do it theyll gladly volunteerWith other kinds of dirty work even if you pay a good wage people wont do it but this kind of work they submit themselves to gladly you dont even have to pay themIts not that its clean work either its dirty workYet why do people like itHow can you say that people are intelligent when they behave like thisThink about itHave you ever noticed the dogs in the monastery ground hereThere are packs of themThey run around biting each other some of them even getting maimedIn another month or so theyll be at itAs soon as one of the smaller ones gets into the pack the bigger ones are at him out he comes yelping dragging his leg behind himBut when the pack runs on he hobbles on after itHes only a little one but he thinks hell get his chance one dayThey bite his leg for him and thats all he gets for his troubleFor the whole of the mating season he may not even get one chanceYou can see this for yourself in the monastery hereThese dogs when they run around howling in packs I figure if they were humans theyd be singing songsThey think its such great fun theyre singing songs but they dont have a clue what it is that makes them do it they just blindly follow their instinctsThink about this carefullyIf you really want to practice you should understand your feelingsFor example among the monks novices or laypeople who should you socialize withIf you associate with people who talk a lot they induce you to talk a lot alsoYour own share is already enough theirs is even more put them together and they explodePeople like to socialize with those who chatter a lot and talk of frivolous thingsThey can sit and listen to that for hoursWhen it comes to listening to Dhamma talking about practice there isnt much of it to be heardLike when giving a Dhamma talk As soon as I start off Namo Tassa Bhagavato theyre all sleepy alreadyThey dont take in the talk at allWhen I reach the Evam they all open their eyes and wake upEvery time theres a Dhamma talk people fall asleepHow are they going to get any benefit from itReal Dhamma cultivators will come away from a talk feeling inspired and uplifted they learn somethingEvery six or seven days the teacher gives another talk constantly boosting the practiceThis is your chance now that you are ordainedTheres only this one chance so take a close lookLook at things and consider which path you will chooseYou are independent nowWhere are you going to go from hereYou are standing at the crossroads between the worldly way and the Dhamma wayWhich way will you chooseYou can take either way this is the time to decideThe choice is yours to makeIf you are to be liberated it is at this pointTake a look at your fear One day as it was nearing nightfall there was nothing else for it If I tried to reason with myself Id never go so I grabbed a pakow and just wentIf its time for it to die then let it dieIf my mind is going to be so stubborn and stupid then let it die thats how I thought to myselfActually in my heart I didnt really want to go but I forced myself toWhen it comes to things like this if you wait till everythings just right youll end up never goingWhen would you ever train yourselfSo I just wentId never stayed in a charnel ground beforeWhen I got there words cant describe the way I feltThe pakow wanted to camp right next to me but I wouldnt have itI made him stay far awayReally I wanted him to stay close to keep me company but I wouldnt have itI made him move away otherwise Id have counted on him for supportIf its going to be so afraid then let it die tonightI was afraid but I daredIts not that I wasnt afraid but I had courageIn the end you have to die anywayWell just as it was getting dark I had my chance in they came carrying a corpseJust my luckI couldnt even feel my feet touch the ground I wanted to get out of there so badlyThey wanted me to do some funeral chants but I wouldnt get involved I just walked awayIn a few minutes after theyd gone I just walked back and found that they had buried the corpse right next to my spot making the bamboo used for carrying it into a bed for me to stay onSo now what was I doIts not that the village was nearby either a good two or three kilometers awayWell if Im going to die Im going to die If youve never dared to do it youll never know what its likeIts really an experienceAs it got darker and darker I wondered where there was to run to in the middle of that charnel groundOh let it dieOne is born to this life only to die anywayAs soon as the sun sank the night told me to get inside my glotI didnt want to do any walking meditation I only wanted to get into my netWhenever I tried to walk towards the grave it was as if something was pulling me back from behind to stop me from walkingIt was as if my feelings of fear and courage were having a tugofwar with meBut I did itThis is the way you must train yourselfWhen it was dark I got into my mosquito netIt felt as if I had a seventiered wall all around meSeeing my trusty alms bowl there beside me was like seeing an old friendEven a bowl can be a friend sometimesIts presence beside me was comfortingI had a bowl for a friend at leastI sat in my net watching over the body all nightI didnt lie down or even doze off I just sat quietlyI couldnt be sleepy even if I wanted to I was so scaredYes I was scared and yet I did itI sat through the nightNow who would have the guts to practice like thisTry it and seeWhen it comes to experiences like this who would dare to go and stay in a charnel groundIf you dont actually do it you dont get the results you dont really practiceThis time I really practicedWhen day broke I felt OhIve survived I was so glad I just wanted to have daytime no night time at allI wanted to kill off the night and leave only daylightI felt so good I had survivedI thought Oh theres nothing to it its just my own fear thats allAfter almsround and eating the meal I felt good the sunshine came out making me feel warm and cozyI had a rest and walked a whileI thought This evening I should have some good quiet meditation because Ive already been through it all last nightTheres probably nothing more to itThen later in the afternoon wouldnt you know itIn comes another one a big one this timeThey brought the corpse in and cremated it right beside my spot right in front of my glotThis was even worse than last nightWell thats good I thought bringing in this corpse to burn here is going to help my practiceBut still I wouldnt go and do any rites for them I waited for them to leave first before taking a lookBurning that body for me to sit and watch over all night I cant tell you how it wasWords cant describe itNothing I could say could convey the fear I feltIn the dead of night rememberThe fire from the burning corpse flickered red and green and the flames pattered softlyI wanted to do walking meditation in front of the body but could hardly bring myself to do itEventually I got into my netThe stench from the burning flesh lingered all through the nightAnd this was before things really started to happen As the flames flickered softly I turned my back on the fireI forgot about sleep I couldnt even think of it my eyes were fixed rigid with fearAnd there was nobody to turn to there was only meI had to rely on myselfI could think of nowhere to go there was nowhere to run to in that pitch black nightWell Ill sit and die hereIm not moving from this spotHere talking of the ordinary mind would it want to do thisWould it take you to such a situationIf you tried to reason it out youd never goWho would want to do such a thingIf you didnt have strong faith in the teaching of the Buddha youd never do itNow about pm I was sitting with my back to the fireI dont know what it was but there came a sound of shuffling from the fire behind meHad the coffin just collapsedOr maybe a dog was getting the corpseBut no it sounded more like a buffalo walking steadily aroundOh never min But then it started walking towards me just like a personIt walked up behind me the footsteps heavy like a buffalos and yet not The leaves crunched under the footsteps as it made its way round to the frontWell I could only prepare for the worst where else was there to goBut it didnt really come up to me it just circled around in front and then went off in the direction of the pakowThen all was quietI dont know what it was but my fear made me think of many possibilitiesIt must have been about halfanhour later I think when the footsteps started coming back from the direction of the pakowJust like a personIt came right up to me this time heading for me as if to run me overI closed my eyes and refused to open themIll die with my eyes closedIt got closer and closer until it stopped dead in front of me and just stood stock stillI felt as if it were waving burnt hands back and forth in front of my closed eyesOhThis was really itI threw out everything forgot all about Buddho Dhammo and SanghoI forgot everything else there was only the fear in me stacked in full to the brimMy thoughts couldnt go anywhere else there was only fearFrom the day I was born I had never experienced such fearBuddho and Dhammo had disappeared I dont know whereThere was only fear welling up inside my chest until it felt like a tightlystretched drumskinWell Ill just leave it as it is theres nothing else to doI sat as if I wasnt even touching the ground and simply noted what was going onThe fear was so great that it filled me like a jar completely filled with waterIf you pour water until the jar is completely full and then pour some more the jar will overflowLikewise the fear built up so much within me that it reached its peak and began to overflowWhat am I so afraid of anyway a voice inside me askedIm afraid of death another voice answeredWell then where is this thing deathWhy all the panicLook where death abidesWhere is deathWhy death is within meIf death is within you then where are you going to run to escape itIf you run away you die if you stay here you dieWherever you go it goes with you because death lies within you theres nowhere you can run toWhether you are afraid or not you die just the same theres nowhere to escape deathAs soon as I had thought this my perception seemed to change right aroundAll the fear completely disappeared as easily as turning over ones own handIt was truly amazingSo much fear and yet it could disappear just like thatNonfear arose in its placeNow my mind rose higher and higher until I felt as if I was in the cloudsAs soon as I had conquered the fear rain began to fallI dont know what sort of rain it was the wind was so strongBut I wasnt afraid of dying nowI wasnt afraid that the branches of the trees might come crashing down on meI paid it no mindThe rain thundered down like a hotseason torrent really heavyBy the time the rain had stopped everything was soaking wetI sat unmovingSo what did I do next soaking wet as I wasI criedThe tears flowed down my cheeksI cried as I thought to myselfWhy am I sitting here like some sort of orphan or abandoned child sitting soaking in the rain like a man who owns nothing like an exileAnd then I thought further All those people sitting comfortably in their homes right now probably dont even suspect that there is a monk sitting soaking in the rain all night like thisWhats the point of it all Thinking like this I began to feel so thoroughly sorry for myself that the tears came gushing outTheyre not good things anyway these tears let them flow right on out until theyre all goneThis was how I practicedNow I dont know how I can describe the things that followedI sat sat and listenedAfter conquering my feelings I just sat and watched as all manner of things arose in me so many things that were possible to know but impossible to describeAnd I thought of the Buddhas wordsPaccattam veditabbo viññuhi  the wise will know for themselvesThat I had endured such suffering and sat through the rain like this who was there to experience it with meOnly I could know what it was likeThere was so much fear and yet the fear disappearedWho else could witness thisThe people in their homes in the town couldnt know what it was like only I could see itIt was a personal experienceEven if I were to tell others they wouldnt really know it was something for each individual to experience for himselfThe more I contemplated this the clearer it becameI became stronger and stronger my conviction become firmer and firmer until daybreakWhen I opened my eyes at dawn everything was yellowI had been wanting to urinate during the night but the feeling had eventually stoppedWhen I got up from my sitting in the morning everywhere I looked was yellow just like the early morning sunlight on some daysWhen I went to urinate there was blood in the urineEhIs my gut torn or something I got a bit of fright Maybe its really torn inside thereWell so whatIf its torn its torn who is there to blame a voice told me straight awayIf its torn its torn if I die I dieI was only sitting here I wasnt doing any harmIf its going to burst let it burst the voice saidMy mind was as if arguing or fighting with itselfOne voice would come from one side saying Hey this is dangerous Another voice would counter it challenge it and overrule itMy urine was stained with bloodHmmWhere am I going to find medicineIm not going to bother with that stuffA monk cant cut plants for medicine anywayIf I die I die so whatWhat else is there to doIf I die while practicing like this then Im readyif I were to die doing something bad thats no good but to die practicing like this Im preparedDont follow your moodsTrain yourselfThe practice involves putting your very life at stakeYou must have cried at least two or three timesThats right thats the practiceIf youre sleepy and want to lie down then dont let it sleepMake the sleepiness go away before you lie downBut look at you all you dont know how to practiceSometimes when you come back from almsround and youre contemplating the food before eating you cant settle down your mind is like a mad dogThe saliva flows youre so hungrySometimes you may not even bother to contemplate you just dig inThats a disasterIf the mind wont calm down and be patient then just push your bowl away and dont eatTrain yourself drill yourself thats practiceDont just keep on following your mindPush your bowl away get up and leave dont allow yourself to eatIf it really wants to eat so much and acts so stubborn then dont let it eatThe saliva will stop flowingIf the defilements know that they wont get anything to eat theyll get scaredThey wont dare bother you next day theyll be afraid they wont get anything to eatTry it out if you dont believe mePeople dont trust the practice they dont dare to really do itTheyre afraid theyll go hungry afraid theyll dieIf you dont try it out you wont know what its aboutMost of us dont dare to do it dont dare to try it out were afraidWhen it comes to eating and the like Ive suffered over them for a long time now so I know what theyre aboutAnd thats only a minor thing as wellSo this practice is not something one can study easilyConsider What is the most important thing of allTheres nothing else just deathDeath is the most important thing in the worldConsider practice inquire If you dont have clothing you wont dieIf you dont have betel nut to chew or cigarettes to smoke you still wont dieBut if you dont have rice or water then you will dieI see only these two things as being essential in this worldYou need rice and water to nourish the bodySo I wasnt interested in anything else I just contented myself with whatever was offeredAs long as I had rice and water it was enough to practice with I was contentIs that enough for youAll those other things are extras whether you get them or not doesnt matter the only really important things are rice and waterIf I live like this can I survive I asked myself Theres enough to get by on all rightI can probably get at least rice on almsround in just about any village a mouthful from each houseWater is usually availableJust these two are enough I didnt aim to be particularly richIn regards to the practice right and wrong are usually coexistentYou must dare to do it dare to practiceIf youve never been to a charnel ground you should train yourself to goIf you cant go at night then go during the dayThen train yourself to go later and later until you can go at dusk and stay thereThen you will see the effects of the practice then you will understandThis mind has been deluded now for who knows how many lifetimesWhatever we dont like or love we want to avoid we just indulge in our fearsAnd then we say were practicingThis cant be called practice If its real practice youll even risk your lifeIf youve really made up your mind to practice why would you take an interest in petty concerns I only got a little you got a lot You quarreled with me so Im quarreling with you I had none of these thoughts because I wasnt looking for such thingsWhatever others did was their businessGoing to other monasteries I didnt get involved in such thingsHowever high or low others practiced I wouldnt take any interest I just looked after my own businessAnd so I dared to practice and the practice gave rise to wisdom and insightIf your practice has really hit the spot then you really practiceDay or night you practiceAt night when its quiet Id sit in meditation then come down to walk alternating back and forth like this at least two or three times a nightWalk then sit then walk some more I wasnt bored I enjoyed itSometimes itd be raining softly and Id think of the times I used to work the rice paddiesMy pants would still be wet from the day before but Id have to get up before dawn and put them on againThen Id have to go down to below the house to get the buffalo out of its penAll I could see of the buffalo would be covered in buffalo shitThen the buffalos tail would be sore with athletes foot and Id walk along thinking Why is life so miserable And now here I was walking meditation what was a little bit of rain to meThinking like this I encouraged myself in the practiceIf the practice has entered the stream then theres nothing to compare with itTheres no suffering like the suffering of a Dhamma cultivator and theres no happiness like the happiness of one eitherTheres no zeal to compare with the zeal of the cultivator and theres no laziness to compare with them eitherPractitioners of the Dhamma are topsThats why I say if you really practice its a sight to seeBut most of us just talk about practice without having done it or reached itOur practice is like the man whose roof is leaking on one side so he sleeps on the other side of the houseWhen the sunshine comes in on that side he rolls over to the other side all the time thinking When will I ever get a decent house like everyone else If the whole roof leaks then he just gets up and leavesThis is not the way to do things but thats how most people areThis mind of ours these defilements if you follow them theyll cause troubleThe more you follow them the more the practice degeneratesWith the real practice sometimes you even amaze yourself with your zealWhether other people practice or not dont take any interest simply do your own practice consistentlyWhoever comes or goes it doesnt matter just do the practiceYou must look at yourself before it can be called practice When you really practice there are no conflicts in your mind there is only DhammaWherever you are still inept wherever you are still lacking thats where you must apply yourselfIf you havent yet cracked it dont give upHaving finished with one thing you get stuck on another so persist with it until you crack it dont let upDont be content until its finishedPut all your attention on that pointWhile sitting lying down or walking watch right thereIts just like a farmer who hasnt yet finished his fieldsEvery year he plants rice but this year he still hasnt gotten it finished so his mind is stuck on that he cant rest contentHis work is still unfinishedEven when hes with friends he cant relax hes all the time nagged by his unfinished businessOr like a mother who leaves her baby upstairs in the house while she goes to feed the animals below shes always got her baby in mind lest it should fall from the houseEven though she may do other things her baby is never far from her thoughtsIts just the same for us and our practice  we never forget itEven though we may do other things our practice is never far from our thoughts its constantly with us day and nightIt has to be like this if you are really going to make progressIn the beginning you must rely on a teacher to instruct and advise youWhen you understand then practiceWhen the teacher has instructed you follow the instructionsIf you understand the practice its no longer necessary for the teacher to teach you just do the work yourselvesWhenever heedlessness or unwholesome qualities arise know for yourself teach yourselfDo the practice yourselfThe mind is the one who knows the witnessThe mind knows for itself if you are still very deluded or only a little deludedWherever you are still faulty try to practice right at that point apply yourself to itPractice is like thatIts almost like being crazy or you could even say you are crazyWhen you really practice you are crazy you flip You have distorted perception and then you adjust your perceptionIf you dont adjust it its going to be just as troublesome and just as wretched as beforeSo theres a lot of suffering in the practice but if you dont know your own suffering you wont understand the Noble Truth of SufferingTo understand suffering to kill it off you first have to encounter itIf you want to shoot a bird but dont go out and find it how will you ever to shoot itSuffering suffering the Buddha taught about suffering The suffering of birth the suffering you wont see sufferingIf you dont understand suffering you wont be able to get rid of sufferingNow people dont want to see suffering they dont want to experience itIf they suffer here they run over thereYou seeTheyre simply dragging their suffering around with them they never kill itThey dont contemplate or investigate itIf they feel suffering here they run over there if it arises there they run back hereThey try to run away from suffering physicallyAs long as you are still ignorant wherever you go youll find sufferingEven if you boarded an airplane to get away from it it would board the plane with youIf you dived under the water it would dive in with you because suffering lies within usBut we dont know thatIf it lies within us where can we run to escape itPeople have suffering in one place so they go somewhere elseWhen suffering arises there they run off againThey think theyre running away from suffering but theyre not suffering goes with themThey carry suffering around without knowing itIf we dont know the cause of suffering then we cant know the cessation of suffering theres no way we can escape itYou must look into this intently until youre beyond doubtYou must dare to practiceDont shirk it either in a group or aloneIf others are lazy it doesnt matterWhoever does a lot of walking meditation a lot of practice I guarantee resultsIf you really practice consistently whether others come or go or whatever one rains retreat is enoughDo it like Ive been telling you hereListen to the teachers words dont quibble dont be stubbornWhatever he tells you to do go right ahead and do itYou neednt be timid of the practice knowledge will surely arise from itPractice is also patipadaWhat is patipadaPractice evenly consistentlyDont practice like Old Reverend PehOne Rains Retreat he determined to stop talkingHe stopped talking all right but then he started writing notes Tomorrow please toast me some rice He wanted to eat toasted riceHe stopped talking but ended up writing so many notes that he was even more scattered than beforeOne minute hed write one thing the next another what a farceI dont know why he bothered determining not to talkHe didnt know what practice isActually our practice is to be content with little to just be naturalDont worry whether you feel lazy or diligentDont even say Im diligent or Im lazy Most people practice only when they feel diligent if they feel lazy they dont botherThis is how people usually areBut monks shouldnt think like thatIf you are diligent you practice when you are lazy you still practiceDont bother with other things cut them off throw them out train yourselfPractice consistently whether day or night this year next year whatever the time dont pay attention to thoughts of diligence or laziness dont worry whether its hot or cold just do itThis is called sammapatipada  Right PracticeSome people really apply themselves to the practice for six or seven days then when they dont get the results they wanted give it up and revert completely indulging in chatter socializing and whateverThen they remember the practice and go at it for another six or seven days then give it up again Its like the way some people workAt first they throw themselves into it then when they stop they dont even bother picking up their tools they just walk off and leave them thereLater on when the soil has all caked up they remember their work and do a bit more only to leave it againDoing things this way youll never get a decent garden or paddyOur practice is the sameIf you think this patipada is unimportant you wont get anywhere with the practiceSammapatipada is unquestionably importantDo it constantlyDont listen to your moodsSo what if your mood is good or notThe Buddha didnt bother with those thingsHe had experienced all the good things and bad things the right things and wrong thingsThat was his practiceTaking only what you like and discarding whatever you dont like isnt practice its disasterWherever you go you will never be satisfied wherever you stay there will be sufferingPracticing like this is like the Brahmans making their sacrificesWhy do they do itBecause they want something in exchangeSome of us practice like thisWhy do we practiceBecause we seek rebirth another state of being we want to attain somethingIf we dont get what we want then we dont want to practice just like the Brahmans making their sacrificesThey do so because of desireThe Buddha didnt teach like thatThe cultivation of the practice is for giving up for letting go for stopping for uprootingYou dont do it for rebirth into any particular stateThere was once a Thera who had initially gone forth into the Mahanikai sectBut he found it not strict enough so he took Dhammayuttika ordinationThen he started practicingSometimes he would fast for fifteen days then when he ate hed eat only leaves and grassHe thought that eating animals was bad kamma that it would be better to eat leaves and grassAfter a while HmmBeing a monk is not so good its inconvenientIts hard to maintain my vegetarian practice as a monkMaybe Ill disrobe and become a pakow So he disrobed and became a pakow so that he could gather the leaves and grass for himself and dig for roots and yamsHe carried on like that for a while till in the end he didnt know what he should be doingHe gave it all upHe gave up being a monk gave up being a pakow gave up everythingThese days I dont know what hes doingMaybe hes dead I dont knowThis is because he couldnt find anything to suit his mindHe didnt realize that he was simply following defilementsThe defilements were leading him on but he didnt know itDid the Buddha disrobe and become a pakowHow did the Buddha practiceWhat did he do He didnt consider thisDid the Buddha go and eat leaves and grass like a cowSure if you want to eat like that go ahead if thats all you can manage but dont go round criticizing othersWhatever standard of practice you find suitable then persevere with thatDont gouge or carve too much or you wont have a decent handle Youll be left with nothing and in the end just give upSome people are like thisWhen it comes to walking meditation they really go at it for fifteen days or soThey dont even bother eating just walkThen when they finish that they just lie around and sleepThey dont bother considering carefully before they start to practiceIn the end nothing suits themBeing a monk doesnt suit them being a pakow doesnt suit them so they end up with nothingPeople like this dont know practice they dont look into the reasons for practicingThink about what youre practicing forThey teach this practice for throwing offThe mind wants to love this person and hate that person these things may arise but dont take them for realSo what are we practicing forSimply so that we can give up these very thingsEven if you attain peace throw out the peaceIf knowledge arises throw out the knowledgeIf you know then you know but if you take that knowing to be your own then you think you know somethingThen you think you are better than othersAfter a while you cant live anywhere wherever you live problems ariseIf you practice wrongly its just as if you didnt practice at allPractice according to your capacityDo you sleep a lotThen try going against the grainDo you eat a lotThen try eating lessTake as much practice as you need using sila samadhi and pañña as your basisThen throw in the dhutanga practices alsoThese dhutanga practices are for digging into the defilementsYou may find the basic practices still not enough to really uproot the defilements so you have to incorporate the dhutanga practices as wellThese dhutanga practices are really usefulSome people cant kill off the defilements with basic sila and samadhi they have to bring in the dhutanga practices to help outThe dhutanga practices cut off many thingsLiving at the foot of a tree Living at the foot of a tree isnt against the preceptsBut if you determine the dhutanga practice of living in a charnel ground and then dont do it thats wrongTry it outWhats like to live in a charnel groundIs it the same as living in a groupDHUTANGA This translates as the practices which are hard to do These are the practices of the Noble OnesWhoever wants to be a Noble One must use the dhutanga practices to cut the defilementsIts difficult to observe them and its hard to find people with the commitment to practice them because they go against the grainSuch as with robes they say to limit your robes to the basic three robes to maintain yourself on almsfood to eat only in the bowl to eat only what you get on almsround if anyone brings food to offer afterwards you dont accept itKeeping this last practice in central Thailand is easy the food is quite adequate because there they put a lot of food in your bowlBut when you come to the Northeast here this dhutanga takes on subtle nuances  here you get plain riceIn these parts the tradition is to put only plain rice in the almsbowlIn central Thailand they give rice and other foods also but around these parts you get only plain riceThis dhutanga practice becomes really asceticYou eat only plain rice whatever is brought to offer afterwards you dont acceptThen there is eating once a day at one sitting from only one bowl  when youve finished eating you get up from your seat and dont eat again that dayThese are called dhutanga practicesNow who will practice themIts hard these days to find people with enough commitment to practice them because they are demanding but that is why they are so beneficialWhat people call practice these days is not really practiceIf you really practice its no easy matterMost people dont dare to really practice dont dare to really go against the grainThey dont want to do anything which runs contrary to their feelingsPeople dont want to resist the defilements they dont want to dig at them or get rid of themIn our practice they say not to follow your own moodsConsider we have been fooled for countless lifetimes already into believing that the mind is our ownActually it isnt its just an impostorIt drags us into greed drags us into aversion drags us into delusion drags us into theft plunder desire and hatredThese things arent oursJust ask yourself right now do you want to be goodEverybody wants to be goodNow doing all these things is that goodTherePeople commit malicious acts and yet they want to be goodThats why I say these things are tricksters thats all they areThe Buddha didnt want us to follow this mind he wanted us to train itIf it goes one way then take cover another wayWhen it goes over there then take cover back hereTo put it simply whatever the mind wants dont let it have itIts as if weve been friends for years but we finally reach a point where our ideas are no longer the sameWe split up and go our separate waysWe no longer understand each other in fact we even argue so we break upThats right dont follow your own mindWhoever follows his own mind follows its likes and desires and everything else that person hasnt yet practiced at allThis is why I say that what people call practice is not really practice its disasterif you dont stop and take a look dont try the practice you wont see you wont attain the DhammaTo put it straight in our practice you have to commit your very lifeIts not that it isnt difficult this practice it has to entail some sufferingEspecially in the first year or two theres a lot of sufferingThe young monks and novices really have a hard timeIve had a lot of difficulties in the past especially with foodWhat can you expectBecoming a monk at twenty when you are just getting into your food and sleep some days I would sit alone and just dream of foodId want to eat bananas in syrup or papaya salad and my saliva would start to runThis is part of the trainingAll these things are not easyThis business of food and eating can lead one into a lot of bad kammaTake someone whos just growing up just getting into his food and sleep and constrain him in these robes and his feelings run amokIts like damming a flowing torrent sometimes the dam just breaksIf it survives thats fine but if not it just collapsesMy meditation in the first year was nothing else just foodI was so restless Sometimes I would sit there and it was almost as if I was actually popping bananas into my mouthI could almost feel myself breaking the bananas into pieces and putting them in my mouthAnd this is all part of the practiceSo dont be afraid of itWeve all been deluded for countless lifetimes now so coming to train ourselves to correct ourselves is no easy matterBut if its difficult its worth doingWhy should we bother with easy thingsSo those things that are difficult anybody can do the easy thingsWe should train ourselves to do that which is difficultIt must have been the same for BuddhaIf he had just worried about his family and relatives his wealth and his past sensual pleasures hed never have become the BuddhaThese arent trifling matters either theyre just what most people are looking forSo going forth at an early age and giving up these things is just like dyingAnd yet some people come up and say Oh its easy for you Luang PorYou never had a wife and children to worry about so its easier for you I say Dont get too close to me when you say that or youll get a clout over the head as if I didnt have a heart or somethingWhen it comes to people its no trifling matterIts what life is all aboutSo we Dhamma practitioners should earnestly get into the practice really dare to do itDont believe others just listen to the Buddhas teachingEstablish peace in your heartsIn time you will understandPractice reflect contemplate and the fruits of the practice will be thereThe cause and the result are proportionalDont give in to your moodsIn the beginning even finding the right amount of sleep is difficultYou may determine to sleep a certain time but cant manage itYou must train yourselfWhatever time you decide to get up then get up as soon as it comes roundSometimes you can do it but sometimes as soon as you awake you say to yourself get up and it wont budgeYou may have to say to yourself One Two if I reach the count three and still dont get up may I fall into hell You have to teach yourself like thisWhen you get to three youll get up immediately youll be afraid of falling into hellYou must train yourself you cant dispense with the trainingYou must train yourself from all anglesDont just lean on your teacher your friends or the group all the time or youll never become wiseIts not necessary to hear so much instruction just hear the teaching once or twice and then do itThe well trained mind wont dare cause trouble even in privateIn the mind of the adept there is no such thing as private or in public All Noble Ones have confidence in their own heartsWe should be like thisSome people become monks simply to find an easy lifeWhere does ease come fromWhat is its causeAll ease has to be preceded by sufferingIn all things its the same you must work before you get riceIn all things you must first experience difficultySome people become monks in order to rest and take it easy they say they just want to sit around and rest awhileIf you dont study the books do you expect to be able to read and writeIt cant be doneThis is why most people who have studied a lot and become monks never get anywhereTheir knowledge is of a different kind on a different pathThey dont train themselves they dont look at their mindsThey only stir up their minds with confusion seeking things which are not conducive to calm and restraintThe knowledge of the Buddha is not worldly knowledge it is supramundane knowledge a different way altogetherThis is why whoever goes forth into the Buddhist monkhood must give up whatever level or status or position they have held previouslyEven when a king goes forth he must relinquish his previous status he doesnt bring that worldly stuff into the monkhood with him to throw his weight around withHe doesnt bring his wealth status knowledge or power into the monkhood with himThe practice concerns giving up letting go uprooting stoppingYou must understand this in order to make the practice workIf you are sick and dont treat the illness with medicine do you think the illness will cure itselfWherever you are afraid you should goWherever there is a cemetery or charnel ground which is particularly fearsome go therePut on your robes go there and contemplate Anicca vata sankhara Stand and walk meditation there look inward and see where your fear liesIt will be all too obviousUnderstand the truth of all conditioned thingsStay there and watch until dusk falls and it gets darker and darker until you are even able to stay there all nightThe Buddha said Whoever sees the Dhamma sees the TathagataWhoever sees the Tathagata sees Nibbana If we dont follow his example how will we see the DhammaIf we dont see the Dhamma how will we know the BuddhaIf we dont see the Buddha how will we know the qualities of the BuddhaOnly if we practice in the footsteps of the Buddha will we know that what the Buddha taught is utterly certain that the Buddhas teaching is the supreme truthAll of us have made up our minds to become bhikkhus and samaneras in the Buddhist Dispensation in order to find peaceNow what is true peaceTrue peace the Buddha said is not very far away it lies right here within us but we tend to continually overlook itPeople have their ideas about finding peace but still tend to experience confusion and agitation they still tend to be unsure and havent yet found fulfillment in their practiceThey havent yet reached the goalIts as if we have left our home to travel to many different placesWhether we get into a car or board a boat no matter where we go we still havent reached our homeAs long as we still havent reached home we dont feel content we still have some unfinished business to take care ofThis is because our journey is not yet finished we havent reached our destinationWe travel all over the place in search of liberationAll of you bhikkhus and samaneras here want peace every one of youEven myself when I was younger searched all over for peaceWherever I went I couldnt be satisfiedGoing into forests or visiting various teachers listening to Dhamma talks I could find no satisfactionWhy is thisWe look for peace in peaceful places where there wont be sights or sounds or odors or flavors thinking that living quietly like this is the way to find contentment that herein lies peaceBut actually if we live very quietly in places where nothing arises can wisdom ariseWould we be aware of anythingThink about itIf our eye didnt see sights what would that be likeIf the nose didnt experience smells what would that be likeIf the tongue didnt experience flavors what would that be likeIf the body didnt experience feelings at all what would that be likeTo be like that would be like being a blind and deaf man one whose nose and tongue had fallen off and who was completely numb with paralysisWould there be anything thereAnd yet people tend to think that if they went somewhere where nothing happened they would find peaceWell Ive thought like that myself I once thought that wayWhen I was a young monk just starting to practice Id sit in meditation and sounds would disturb me Id think to myself What can I do to make my mind peaceful So I took some beeswax and stuffed my ears with it so that I couldnt hear anythingAll that remained was a humming soundI thought that would be peaceful but no all that thinking and confusion didnt arise at the ears after allIt arose at the mindThat is the place to search for peaceTo put it another way no matter where you go to stay you dont want to do anything because it interferes with your practiceYou dont want to sweep the grounds or do any work you just want to be still and find peace that wayThe teacher asks you to help out with the chores or any of the daily duties but you dont put your heart into it because you feel it is only an external concernIve often brought up the example of one of my disciples who was really eager to let go and find peaceI taught about letting go and he accordingly understood that to let go of everything would indeed be peacefulActually right from the day he had come to stay here he didnt want to do anythingEven when the wind blew half the roof off his kuti he wasnt interestedHe said that that was just an external thingSo he didnt bother fixing it upWhen the sunlight and rain streamed in from one side hed move over to the other sideThat wasnt any business of hisHis business was to make his mind peacefulThat other stuff was a distraction he wouldnt get involvedThat was how he saw itOne day I was walking past and saw the collapsed roofEhWhose kuti is thisSomeone told me whose it was and I thought HmmStrange So I had a talk with him explaining many things such as the duties in regard to our dwellings the senasanavattaWe must have a dwelling place and we must look after itLetting go isnt like this it doesnt mean shirking our responsibilitiesThats the action of a foolThe rain comes in on one side so you move over to the other side then the sunshine comes out and you move back to that sideWhy is thatWhy dont you bother to let go there I gave him a long discourse on this then when Id finished he saidOh Luang Por sometimes you teach me to cling and sometimes you teach me to let goI dont know what you want me to doEven when my roof collapses and I let go to this extent still you say its not rightAnd yet you teach me to let goI dont know what more you can expect of me You seePeople are like thisThey can be as stupid as thisAre there visual objects within the eyeIf there are no external visual objects would our eyes see anythingAre there sounds within our ears if external sounds dont make contactIf there are no smells outside would we experience themWhere are the causesThink about what the Buddha said All dhammas arise because of causesIf we didnt have ears would we experience soundsIf we had no eyes would we be able to see sightsEyes ears nose tongue body and mind  these are the causesIt is said that all dhammas arise because of conditions when they cease its because the causal conditions have ceasedFor resulting conditions to arise the causal conditions must first ariseIf we think that peace lies where there are no sensations would wisdom ariseWould there be causal and resultant conditionsWould we have anything to practice withIf we blame the sounds then where there are sounds we cant be peacefulWe think that place is no goodWherever there are sights we say thats not peacefulIf thats the case then to find peace wed have to be one whose senses have all died blind and deafI thought about thisHmmThis is strangeSuffering arises because of eyes ears nose tongue body and mindSo should we be blindIf we didnt see anything at all maybe that would be betterOne would have no defilements arising if one were blind or deafIs this the way it isBut thinking about it it was all wrongIf that was the case then blind and deaf people would be enlightenedThey would all be accomplished if defilements arose at the eyes and earsThere are the causal conditionsWhere things arise at the cause thats where we must stop themWhere the cause arises thats where we must contemplateActually the sense bases of the eye ear nose tongue body and mind are all things which can facilitate the arising of wisdom if we know them as they areIf we dont really know them we must deny them saying we dont want to see sights hear sounds and so on because they disturb usIf we cut off the causal conditions what are we going to contemplateThink about itWhere would there be any cause and effectThis is wrong thinking on our partThis is why we are taught to be restrainedRestraint is silaThere is the sila of sense restraint eyes ears nose tongue body and mind these are our sila and they are our samadhiReflect on the story SariputtaAt the time before he became a bhikkhu he saw Assaji Thera going on almsroundSeeing him Sariputta thoughtThis monk is most unusualHe walks neither too fast nor too slow his robes are neatly worn his bearing is restrained Sariputta was inspired by him and so approached Venerable Assaji paid his respects and asked himExcuse me sir who are youI am a samanaWho is your teacherVenerable Gotama is my teacherWhat does Venerable Gotama teachHe teaches that all things arise because of conditionsWhen they cease its because the causal conditions have ceasedWhen asked about the Dhamma by Sariputta Assaji explained only in brief he talked about cause and effectDhammas arise because of causesThe cause arises first and then the resultWhen the result is to cease the cause must first ceaseThats all he said but it was enough for SariputtaNow this was a cause for the arising of DhammaAt that time Sariputta had eyes he had ears he had a nose a tongue a body and a mindAll his faculties were intactIf he didnt have his faculties would there have been sufficient causes for wisdom to arise for himWould he have been aware of anythingBut most of us are afraid of contactEither that or we like to have contact but we develop no wisdom from it instead we repeatedly indulge through eyes ears nose tongue body and mind delighting in and getting lost in sense objectsThis is how it isThese sense bases can entice us into delight and indulgence or they can lead to knowledge and wisdomThey have both harm and benefit depending on our wisdomSo now let us understand that having gone forth and come to practice we should take everything as practiceEven the bad thingsWe should know them allWhySo that we may know the truthWhen we talk of practice we dont simply mean those things that are good and pleasing to usThats not how it isIn this world some things are to our liking some are notThese things all exist in this world nowhere elseUsually whatever we like we want even with fellow monks and novicesWhatever monk or novice we dont like we dont want to associate with we only want to be with those we likeYou seeThis is choosing according to our likesWhatever we dont like we dont want to see or know aboutActually the Buddha wanted us to experience these thingsLokavidu  look at this world and know it clearlyIf we dont know the truth of the world clearly then we cant go anywhereLiving in the world we must understand the worldThe Noble Ones of the past including the Buddha all lived with these things they lived in this world among deluded peopleThey attained the truth right in this very world nowhere elseThey didnt run off to some other world to find the truthBut they had wisdomThey restrained their senses but the practice is to look into all these things and know them as they areTherefore the Buddha taught us to know the sense bases our points of contactThe eye contacts forms and sends them in to become sightsThe ears make contact with sounds the nose makes contact with odors the tongue makes contact with tastes the body makes contact with tactile sensations and so awareness arisesWhere awareness arises is where we should look and see things as they areIf we dont know these things as they really are we will either fall in love with them or hate themWhere these sensations arise is where we can become enlightened where wisdom can ariseBut sometimes we dont want things to be like thatThe Buddha taught restraint but restraint doesnt mean we dont see anything hear anything smell taste feel or think anythingThats not what it meansIf practitioners dont understand this then as soon as they see or hear anything they cower and run awayThey dont deal with thingsThey run away thinking that by so doing those things will eventually lose their power over them that they will eventually transcend themBut they wontThey wont transcend anything like thatIf they run away not knowing the truth of them later on the same stuff will pop up to be dealt with againFor example those practitioners who are never content be they in monasteries forests or mountainsThey wander on dhutanga pilgrimage looking at this that and the other thinking theyll find contentment that wayThey go and then they come back didnt see anythingThey try going to a mountain top AhThis is the spot now Im right They feel at peace for a few days and then get tired of itOh well off to the seaside Ah here its nice and coolThisll do me fine After a while they get tired of the seaside as well Tired of the forests tired of the mountains tired of the seaside tired of everythingThis is not being tired of things in the right sense as Right View its simply boredom a kind of Wrong ViewTheir view is not in accordance with the way things areWhen they get back to the monastery Now what will I doIve been all over and come back with nothing So they throw away their bowls and disrobeWhy do they disrobeBecause they havent got any grip on the practice they dont see anything go to the north and dont see anything go to the seaside to the mountains into the forests and still dont see anythingSo its all finished they die This is how it goesIts because theyre continually running away from thingsWisdom doesnt ariseNow take another exampleSuppose there is one monk who determines to stay with things not to run awayHe looks after himselfHe knows himself and also knows those who come to stay with himHes continually dealing with problemsFor example the AbbotIf one is an Abbot of a monastery there are constant problems to deal with theres a constant stream of things that demand attentionWhy soBecause people are always asking questionsThe questions never end so you must be constantly on the alertYou are constantly solving problems your own as well as other peoplesThat is you must be constantly awakeBefore you can doze off they wake you up again with another problemSo this causes you to contemplate and understand thingsYou become skillful skillful in regard to yourself and skillful in regard to othersSkillful in many many waysThis skill arises from contact from confronting and dealing with things from not running awayWe dont run away physically but we run away in mind using our wisdomWe understand with wisdom right here we dont run away from anythingThis is a source of wisdomOne must work must associate with other thingsFor instance living in a big monastery like this we must all help out to look after the things hereLooking at it in one way you could say that its all defilementLiving with lots of monks and novices with many laypeople coming and going many defilements may ariseYes I admit but we must live like this for the development of wisdom and the abandonment of foolishnessWhich way are we to goAre we going to live in order to get rid of foolishness or to increase our foolishnessWe must contemplateWhenever eyes ears nose tongue body or mind make contact we should be collected and circumspectWhen suffering arises who is sufferingWhy did this suffering ariseThe Abbot of a monastery has to supervise many disciplesNow that may be sufferingWe must know suffering when it arisesKnow sufferingIf we are afraid of suffering and dont want to face it where are we going to do battle with itIf suffering arises and we dont know it how are we going to deal with itThis is of utmost importance  we must know sufferingEscaping from suffering means knowing the way out of suffering it doesnt mean running away from wherever suffering arisesBy doing that you just carry your suffering with youWhen suffering arises again somewhere else youll have to run away againThis is not transcending suffering its not knowing sufferingIf you want to understand suffering you must look into the situation at handThe teachings say that wherever a problem arises it must be settled right thereWhere suffering lies is right where nonsuffering will arise it ceases at the place where it arisesIf suffering arises you must contemplate right there you dont have to run awayYou should settle the issue right thereOne who runs away from suffering out of fear is the most foolish person of allHe will simply increases his stupidity endlesslyWe must understand suffering is none other than the First Noble Truth isnt that soAre you going to look on it as something badDukkha sacca samudaya sacca nirodha sacca magga sacca Running away from these things isnt practicing according to the true DhammaWhen will you ever see the Truth of SufferingIf we keep running away from suffering we will never know itSuffering is something we should recognize  if you dont observe it when will you ever recognize itNot being content here you run over there when discontent arises there you run off againYou are always runningIf thats the way you practice youll be racing with the Devil all over the countryThe Buddha taught us to run away using wisdomFor instance suppose you had stepped on a thorn or splinter and it got embedded in your footAs you walk it occasionally hurts occasionally notSometimes you may step on a stone or a stump and it really hurts so you feel around your footBut not finding anything you shrug it off and walk on a bit moreEventually you step on something else and the pain arises againNow this happens many timesWhat is the cause of that painThe cause is that splinter or thorn embedded in your footThe pain is constantly nearWhenever the pain arises you may take a look and feel around a bit but not seeing the splinter you let it goAfter a while it hurts again so you take another lookWhen suffering arises you must note it dont just shrug it offWhenever the pain arises Hmm that splinter is still there Whenever the pain arises there arises also the thought that that splinter has got to goIf you dont take it out there will only be more pain later onThe pain keeps recurring again and again until the desire to take out that thorn is constantly with youIn the end it reaches a point where you make up your mind once and for all to get out that thorn  because it hurtsNow our effort in the practice must be like thisWherever it hurts wherever theres friction we must investigateConfront the problem head onTake that thorn out of your foot just pull it outWherever your mind gets stuck you must take noteAs you look into it you will know it see it and experience it as it isBut our practice must be unwavering and persistentThey call it viriyarambha  putting forth constant effortWhenever an unpleasant feeling arises in your foot for example you must remind yourself to get out that thorn dont give up your resolveLikewise when suffering arises in our hearts we must have the unwavering resolve to try to uproot the defilements to give them upThis resolve is constantly there unremittingEventually the defilements will fall into our hands where we can finish them offSo in regard to happiness and suffering what are we to doIf we didnt have these things what could we use as a cause to precipitate wisdomIf there is no cause how will the effect ariseAll dhammas arise because of causesWhen the result ceases its because the cause has ceasedThis is how it is but most of us dont really understandPeople only want to run away from sufferingThis sort of knowledge is short of the markActually we need to know this very world that we are living in we dont have to run away anywhereYou should have the attitude that to stay is fine and to go is fineThink about this carefullyWhere do happiness and suffering lieWhatever we dont hold fast to cling to or fix on to as if it werent thereSuffering doesnt ariseSuffering arises from existenceIf there is existence then there is birthUpadana  clinging or attachment  this is the prerequisite which creates sufferingWherever suffering arises look into itDont look too far away look right into the present momentLook at your own mind and bodyWhen suffering arises Why is there suffering Look right nowWhen happiness arises what is the cause of that happinessLook right thereWherever these things arise be awareBoth happiness and suffering arise from clingingThe cultivators of old saw their minds in this wayThere is only arising and ceasingThere is no abiding entityThey contemplated from all angles and saw that there was nothing much to this mind nothing is stableThere is only arising and ceasing ceasing and arising nothing is of any lasting substanceWhile walking or sitting they saw things in this wayWherever they looked there was only suffering thats allIts just like a big iron ball which has just been blasted in a furnaceIts hot all overIf you touch the top its hot touch the sides and theyre hot  its hot all overThere isnt any place on it which is coolNow if we dont consider these things we know nothing about themWe must see clearlyDont get born into things dont fall into birthKnow the workings of birthSuch thoughts as Oh I cant stand that person he does everything wrongly will no longer ariseOr I really like so and so these things dont ariseThere remain merely the conventional worldly standards of like and dislike but ones speech is one way ones mind anotherThey are separate thingsWe must use the conventions of the world to communicate with each other but inwardly we must be emptyThe mind is above those thingsWe must bring the mind to transcendence like thisThis is the abiding of the Noble OnesWe must all aim for this and practice accordinglyDont get caught up in doubtsBefore I started to practice I thought to myself The Buddhist religion is here available for all and yet why do only some people practice while others dontOr if they do practice they do so only for a short while then give upOr again those who dont give it up still dont knuckle down and do the practiceWhy is this So I resolved to myself Okay Ill give up this body and mind for this lifetime and try to follow the teaching of the Buddha down to the last detailIll reach understanding in this very lifetime because if I dont Ill still be sunk in sufferingIll let go of everything else and make a determined effort no matter how much difficulty or suffering I have to endure Ill persevereIf I dont do it Ill just keep on doubtingThinking like this I got down to practiceNo matter how much happiness suffering or difficulty I had to endure I would do itI looked on my whole life as if it was only one day and a nightI gave it upIll follow the teaching of the Buddha Ill follow the Dhamma to understanding  Why is this world of delusion so wretched I wanted to know I wanted to master the Teaching so I turned to the practice of DhammaHow much of the worldly life do we monastics renounceIf we have gone forth for good then it means we renounce it all theres nothing we dont renounceAll the things of the world that people enjoy are cast off sights sounds smells tastes and feelings we throw them all awayAnd yet we experience themSo Dhamma practitioners must be content with little and remain detachedWhether in regard to speech in eating or whatever we must be easily satisfied eat simply sleep simply live simplyJust like they say an ordinary person one who lives simplyThe more you practice the more you will be able to take satisfaction in your practiceYou will see into your own heartThe Dhamma is paccattam you must know it for yourselfTo know for yourself means to practice for yourselfYou can depend on a teacher only fifty percent of the wayEven the teaching I have given you today is completely useless in itself even if it is worth hearingBut if you were to believe it all just because I said so you wouldnt be using the teaching properlyIf you believed me completely then youd be foolishTo hear the teaching see its benefit put it into practice for yourself see it within yourself do it yourself this is much more usefulYou will then know the taste of Dhamma for yourselfThis is why the Buddha didnt talk about the fruits of the practice in much detail because its something one cant convey in wordsIt would be like trying to describe different colors to a person blind from birth Oh its so white or its bright yellow for instanceYou couldnt convey those colors to themYou could try but it wouldnt serve much purposeThe Buddha brings it back down to the individual  see clearly for yourselfIf you see clearly for yourself you will have clear proof within yourselfWhether standing walking sitting or reclining you will be free of doubtEven if someone were to say Your practice isnt right its all wrong still you would be unmoved because you have your own proofA practitioner of the Dhamma must be like this wherever he goesOthers cant tell you you must know for yourselfSammaditthi Right View must be thereThe practice must be like this for every one of usTo do the real practice like this for even one month out of five or ten rains retreats would be rareOur sense organs must be constantly workingKnow content and discontent be aware of like and dislikeKnow appearance and know transcendenceThe Apparent and the Transcendent must be realized simultaneouslyGood and evil must be seen as coexistent arising togetherThis is the fruit of the Dhamma practiceSo whatever is useful to yourself and to others whatever practice benefits both yourself and others is called following the Buddha Ive talked about this oftenThe things which should be done people seem to neglectFor example the work in the monastery the standards of practice and so onIve talked about them often and yet people dont seem to put their hearts into itSome dont know some are lazy and cant be bothered some are simply scattered and confusedBut thats a cause for wisdom to ariseIf we go to places where none of these things arise what would we seeTake food for instanceIf food doesnt have any taste is it deliciousIf a person is deaf will he hear anythingIf you dont perceive anything will you have anything to contemplateIf there are no problems will there be anything to solveThink of the practice in this wayOnce I went to live up northAt that time I was living with many monks all of them elderly but newly ordained with only two or three rains retreatAt the time I had ten rainsLiving with those old monks I decided to perform the various duties  receiving their bowls washing their robes emptying their spittoons and so onI didnt think in terms of doing it for any particular individual I simply maintained my practiceIf others didnt do the duties Id do them myselfI saw it as a good opportunity for me to gain meritIt made me feel good and gave me a sense of satisfactionOn the uposatha days I knew the required dutiesId go and clean out the uposatha hall and set out water for washing and drinkingThe others didnt know anything about the duties they just watchedI didnt criticize them because they didnt knowI did the duties myself and having done them I felt pleased with myself I had inspiration and a lot of energy in my practiceWhenever I could do something in the monastery whether in my own kuti or others if it was dirty Id clean upI didnt do it for anyone in particular I didnt do it to impress anyone I simply did it to maintain a good practiceCleaning a kuti or dwelling place is just like cleaning rubbish out of your own mindNow this is something all of you should bear in mindYou dont have to worry about harmony it will automatically be thereLive together with Dhamma with peace and restraint train your mind to be like this and no problems will ariseIf there is heavy work to be done everybody helps out and in no long time the work is done it gets taken care of quite easilyThats the best wayI have come across some other types though although I used it as an opportunity to growFor instance living in a big monastery the monks and novices may agree among themselves to wash robes on a certain dayId go and boil up the jackfruit woodNow thered be some monks whod wait for someone else to boil up the jackfruit wood and then come along and wash their robes take them back to their kutis hang them out and then take a napThey didnt have to set up the fire didnt have to clean up afterwards they thought they were on a good thing that they were being cleverThis is the height of stupidityThese people are just increasing their own stupidity because they dont do anything they leave all the work up to othersThey wait till everything is ready then come along and make use of it its easy for themThis is just adding to ones foolishnessThose actions serve no useful purpose whatsoever to themSome people think foolishly like thisThey shirk the required duties and think that this is being clever but it is actually very foolishIf we have that sort of attitude we wont lastTherefore whether speaking eating or doing anything whatsoever reflect on yourselfYou may want to live comfortably eat comfortably sleep comfortably and so on but you cantWhat have we come here forIf we regularly reflect on this we will be heedful we wont forget we will be constantly alertBeing alert like this you will put forth effort in all posturesIf you dont put forth effort things go quite differently Sitting you sit like youre in the town walking you walk like youre in the town you just want to go and play around in the town with the laypeopleIf there is no effort in the practice the mind will tend in that directionYou dont oppose and resist your mind you just allow it to waft along the wind of your moodsThis is called following ones moodsLike a child if we indulge all its wants will it be a good childIf the parents indulge all their childs wishes is that goodEven if they do indulge it somewhat at first by the time it can speak they may start to occasionally spank it because theyre afraid itll end up stupidThe training of our mind must be like thisYou have to know yourself and how to train yourselfIf you dont know how to train your own mind waiting around expecting someone else to train it for you youll end up in troubleSo dont think that you cant practice in this placePractice has no limitsWhether standing walking sitting or lying down you can always practiceEven while sweeping the monastery grounds or seeing a beam of sunlight you can realize the DhammaBut you must have sati at handWhy soBecause you can realize the Dhamma at any time at all in any place if you ardently meditateDont be heedlessBe watchful be alertWhile walking on almsround there are all sorts of feelings arising and its all good DhammaWhen you get back to the monastery and are eating your food theres plenty of good Dhamma for you to look intoIf you have constant effort all these things will be objects for contemplation there will be wisdom you will see the dhammaThis is called dhammavicaya reflecting on DhammaIts one of the enlightenment factorsIf there is sati recollection there will be dhammavicaya as a resultThese are factors of enlightenmentIf we have recollection then we wont simply take it easy there will also be inquiry into DhammaThese things become factors for realizing the DhammaIf we have reached this stage then our practice will know neither day or night it will continue on regardless of the time of dayThere will be nothing to taint the practice or if there is we will immediately know itLet there be dhammavicaya within our minds constantly looking into DhammaIf our practice has entered the flow the mind will tend to be like thisIt wont go off after other things I think Ill go for a trip over there or perhaps this other place over in that province should be interesting Thats the way of the worldNot long and the practice will dieSo resolve yourselvesIts not just by sitting with your eyes closed that you develop wisdomEyes ears nose tongue body and mind are constantly with us so be constantly alertStudy constantlySeeing trees or animals can all be occasions for studyBring it all inwardsSee clearly within your own heartIf some sensation makes impact on the heart witness it clearly for yourself dont simply disregard itTake a simple comparison baking bricksHave you ever seen a brickbaking ovenThey build the fire up about two or three feet in front of the oven then the smoke all gets drawn into itLooking at this illustration you can more clearly understand the practiceMaking a brick kiln in the right way you have to make the fire so that all the smoke gets drawn inside none is left overAll the heat goes into the oven and the job gets done quicklyWe Dhamma practitioners should experience things in this wayAll our feelings will be drawn inwards to be turned into Right ViewSeeing sights hearing sounds smelling odors tasting flavors and so on the mind draws them all inward to be converted into Right ViewThose feelings thus become experiences which give rise to wisdomThere was once a western monk a student of mineWhenever he saw Thai monks and novices disrobing he would say Oh what a shameWhy do they do thatWhy do so many of the Thai monks and novices disrobe He was shockedHe would get saddened at the disrobing of the Thai monks and novices because he had only just come into contact with BuddhismHe was inspired he was resoluteGoing forth as a monk was the only thing to do he thought hed never disrobeWhoever disrobed was a foolHed see the Thais taking on the robes at the beginning of the Rains Retreat as monks and novices and then disrobing at the end of it Oh how sadI feel so sorry for those Thai monks and novicesHow could they do such a thingWell as time went by some of the western monks began to disrobe so he came to see it as something not so important after allAt first when he had just begun to practice he was excited about itHe thought that it was really important thing to become a monkHe thought it would be easyWhen people are inspired it all seems to be so right and goodTheres nothing there to gauge their feelings by so they go ahead and decide for themselvesBut they dont really know what practice isThose who do know will have a thoroughly firm foundation within their hearts  but even so they dont need to advertise itAs for myself when I was first ordained I didnt actually do much practice but I had a lot of faithI dont know why maybe it was there from birthThe monks and novices who went forth together with me come the end of the Rains all disrobedI thought to myself EhWhat is it with these people However I didnt dare say anything to them because I wasnt yet sure of my own feelings I was too stirred upBut within me I felt that they were all foolishIts difficult to go forth easy to disrobeThese guys dont have much merit they think that the way of the world is more useful than the way of Dhamma I thought like this but I didnt say anything I just watched my own mindId see the monks whod gone forth with me disrobing one after the otherSometimes theyd dress up and come back to the monastery to show offId see them and think they were crazy but they thought they looked snappyWhen you disrobe you have to do this and that Id think to myself that that way of thinking was wrongI wouldnt say it though because I myself was still an uncertain quantityI still wasnt sure how long my faith would lastWhen my friends had all disrobed I dropped all concern there was nobody left to concern myself withI picked up the Patimokkha and got stuck into learning thatThere was nobody left to distract me and waste my time so I put my heart into the practiceStill I didnt say anything because I felt that to practice all ones life maybe seventy eighty or even ninety years and to keep up a persistent effort without slackening up or losing ones resolve seemed like an extremely difficult thing to doThose who went forth would go forth those who disrobed would disrobeId just watch it allI didnt concern myself whether they stayed or wentId watch my friends leave but the feeling I had within me was that these people didnt see clearlyThat western monk probably thought like thathed see people become monks for only one Rains Retreat and get upsetLater on he reached a stage we call bored bored with the Holy LifeHe let go of the practice and eventually disrobedWhy are you disrobingBefore when you saw the Thai monks disrobing youd say Oh what a shameHow sad how pitiful Now when you yourself want to disrobe why dont you feel sorry nowHe didnt answerHe just grinned sheepishlyWhen it comes to the training of the mind it isnt easy to find a good standard if you havent yet developed a witness within yourselfIn most external matters we can rely on others for feedback there are standards and precedentsBut when it comes to using the Dhamma as a standard do we have the Dhamma yetAre we thinking rightly or notAnd even if its right do we know how to let go of rightness or are we still clinging to itYou must contemplate until you reach the point where you let go this is the important thing until you reach the point where there isnt anything left where there is neither good nor badYou throw it offThis means you throw out everythingIf its all gone then theres no remainder if theres some remainder then its not all goneSo in regard to this training of the mind sometimes we may say its easyits easy to say but its hard to do very hardIts hard in that it doesnt conform to our desiresSometimes it seems almost as if the angels were helping us outEverything goes right whatever we think or say seems to be just rightThen we go and attach to that rightness and before long we go wrong and it all turns badThis is where its difficultWe dont have a standard to gauge things byPeople who have a lot of faith who are endowed with confidence and belief but are lacking in wisdom may be very good at samadhi but they may not have much insightThey see only one side of everything and simply follow thatThey dont reflectThis is blind faithIn Buddhism we call this Saddha adhimokkha blind faithThey have faith all right but its not born of wisdomBut they dont see this at the time they believe they have wisdom so they dont see where they are wrongTherefore they teach about the Five Powers Saddha viriya sati samadhi paññaSaddha is conviction viriya is diligent effort sati is recollection samadhi is fixedness of mind pañña is allembracing knowledgeDont say that pañña is simply knowledge  pañña is allembracing consummate knowledgeThe wise have given these five steps to us so that we can link them firstly as an object of study then as a gauge to compare to the state of our practice as it isFor example saddha convictionDo we have conviction have we developed it yetViriya do we have diligent effort or notIs our effort right or is it wrongWe must consider thisEverybody has some sort of effort but does our effort contain wisdom or notSati is the sameEven a cat has satiWhen it sees a mouse sati is thereThe cats eyes stare fixedly at the mouseThis is the sati of a catEverybody has sati animals have it delinquents have it sages have itSamadhi fixedness of mind  everybody has this as wellA cat has it when its mind is fixed on grabbing the mouse and eating itIt has fixed intentThat sati of the cats is sati of a sort samadhi fixed intent on what it is doing is also therePañña knowledge like that of human beingsIt knows as an animal knows it has enough knowledge to catch mice for foodThese five things are called powersHave these Five Powers arisen from Right View sammaditthi or notSaddha viriya sati samadhi pañña  have these arisen from Right ViewWhat is Right ViewWhat is our standard for gauging Right ViewWe must clearly understand thisRight View is the understanding that all these things are uncertainTherefore the Buddha and all the Noble Ones dont hold fast to themThey hold but not fastThey dont let that holding become an identityThe holding which doesnt lead to becoming is that which isnt tainted with desireWithout seeking to become this or that there is simply the practice itselfWhen you hold on to a particular thing is there enjoyment or is there displeasureIf there is pleasure do you hold on to that pleasureIf there is dislike do you hold on to that dislikeSome views can be used as principles for gauging our practice more accuratelySuch as knowing such views as that one is better than others or equal to others or more foolish than others as all wrong viewsWe may feel these things but we also know them with wisdom that they simply arise and ceaseSeeing that we are better than others is not right seeing that we are equal to others is not right seeing that we are inferior to others is not rightThe right view is the one that cuts through all of thisSo where do we go toIf we think we are better than others pride arisesIts there but we dont see itIf we think we are equal to others we fail to show respect and humility at the proper timesIf we think we are inferior to others we get depressed thinking we are inferior born under a bad sign and so onWe are still clinging to the Five Khandhas its all simply becoming and birthThis is one standard for gauging ourselves byAnother one is if we encounter a pleasant experience we feel happy if we encounter a bad experience we are unhappyAre we able to look at both the things we like and the things we dislike as having equal valueMeasure yourself against this standardIn our everyday lives in the various experiences we encounter if we hear something which we like does our mood changeIf we encounter an experience which isnt to our liking does our mood changeOr is the mind unmovedLooking right here we have a gaugeJust know yourself this is your witnessDont make decisions on the strength of your desiresDesires can puff us up into thinking we are something which were notWe must be very circumspectThere are so many angles and aspects to consider but the right way is not to follow your desires but the TruthWe should know both the good and the bad and when we know them to let go of themIf we dont let go we are still there we still exist we still have If we still are then there is a remainder there are becoming and birth in storeTherefore the Buddha said to judge only yourself dont judge others no matter how good or evil they may beThe Buddha merely points out the way saying The truth is like this Now is our mind like that or notFor instance suppose a monk took some things belonging to another monk then that other monk accused him You stole my things I didnt steal them I only took them So we ask a third monk to adjudicateHow should he decideHe would have to ask the offending monk to appear before the convened SanghaYes I took it but I didnt steal it Or in regard to other rules such as parajika or sanghadisesa offenses Yes I did it but I didnt have intention How can you believe thatIts trickyIf you cant believe it all you can do is leave the onus with the doer it rests on himBut you should know that we cant hide the things that arise in our mindsYou cant cover them up either the wrongs or the good actionsWhether actions are good or evil you cant dismiss them simply by ignoring them because these things tend to reveal themselvesThey conceal themselves they reveal themselves they exist in and of themselvesThey are all automaticThis is how things workDont try to guess at or speculate about these thingsAs long as there is still avijja they are not finished withThe Chief Privy Councilor once asked me Luang Por is the mind of an anagami pure yetIts partly pureEhAn anagami has given up sensual desire how is his mind not yet pureHe may have let go of sensual desire but there is still something remaining isnt thereThere is still avijjaIf there is still something left then there is still something leftIts like the bhikkhus alms bowlsThere are a largesize large bowl a mediumsized large bowl a smallsized large bowl then a largesized medium bowl a mediumsized medium bowl a smallsized medium bowl then there are a largesized small bowl a mediumsized small bowl and a smallsized small bowl No matter how small it is there is still a bowl there rightThats how it is with thissotapanna sakadagami anagami they have all given up certain defilements but only to their respective levelsWhatever still remains those Noble Ones dont seeIf they could they would all be arahantsThey still cant see allAvijja is that which doesnt seeIf the mind of the anagami was completely straightened out he wouldnt be an anagami he would be fully accomplishedBut there is still something remainingIs his mind purifiedWell it is somewhat but not How else could I answerHe said that later on he would come and question me about it furtherHe can look into it the standard is thereDont be carelessBe alertThe Lord Buddha exhorted us to be alertIn regards to this training of the heart Ive had my moments of temptation too you knowIve often been tempted to try many things but theyve always seemed like theyre going astray of the pathIts really just a sort of swaggering in ones mind a sort of conceitDitthi views and mana pride are thereIts hard enough just to be aware of these two thingsThere was once a man who wanted to become a monk hereHe carried in his robes determined to become a monk in memory of his late motherHe came into the monastery laid down his robes and without so much as paying respects to the monks started walking meditation right in front of the main hall back and forth back and forth like he was really going to show his stuffI thought Oh so there are people around like this too This is called saddha adhimokkha  blind faithHe must have determined to get enlightened before sundown or something he thought it would be so easyHe didnt look at anybody else just put his head down and walked as if his life depended on itI just let him carry on but I thought Oh man you think its that easy or something In the end I dont know how long he stayed I dont even think he ordainedAs soon as the mind thinks of something we send it out send it out every timeWe dont realize that its simply the habitual proliferation of the mindIt disguises itself as wisdom and waffles off into minute detailThis mental proliferation seems very clever if we didnt know we would mistake it for wisdomBut when it comes to the crunch its not the real thingWhen suffering arises where is that socalled wisdom thenIs it of any useIts only proliferation after allSo stay with the BuddhaAs Ive said before many times in our practice we must turn inwards and find the BuddhaWhere is the BuddhaThe Buddha is still alive to this very day go in and find himWhere is heAt aniccam go in and find him there go and bow to him aniccam uncertaintyYou can stop right there for startersIf the mind tries to tell you Im a sotapanna now go and bow to the sotapannaHell tell you himself Its all uncertain If you meet a sakadagami go and pay respects to himWhen he sees you hell simply say Not a sure thing If there is an anagami go and bow to himHell tell you only one thing Uncertain If you meet even an arahant go and bow to him hell tell you even more firmly Its all even more uncertain Youll hear the words of the Noble Ones Everything is uncertain dont cling to anythingDont just look at the Buddha like a simpletonDont cling to things holding fast to them without letting goLook at things as functions of the Apparent and then send them on to TranscendenceThats how you must beThere must be Appearance and there must be TranscendenceSo I say Go to the Buddha Where is the BuddhaThe Buddha is the DhammaAll the teachings in this world can be contained in this one teaching aniccamThink about itIve searched for over forty years as a monk and this is all I could findThat and patient enduranceThis is how to approach the Buddhas teaching aniccam its all uncertainNo matter how sure the mind wants to be just tell it Not sure Whenever the mind wants to grab on to something as a sure thing just say Its not sure its transient Just ram it down with thisUsing the Dhamma of the Buddha it all comes down to thisIts not that its merely a momentary phenomenonWhether standing walking sitting or lying down you see everything in that wayWhether liking arises or dislike arises you see it all in the same wayThis is getting close to the Buddha close to the DhammaNow I feel that this is more valuable way to practiceAll my practice from the early days up to the present time has been like thisI didnt actually rely on the scriptures but then I didnt disregard them eitherI didnt rely on a teacher but then I didnt exactly go it alone My practice was all neither this nor thatFrankly its a matter of finishing off that is practicing to the finish by taking up the practice and then seeing it to completion seeing the Apparent and also the TranscendentIve already spoken of this but some of you may be interested to hear it again if you practice consistently and consider things thoroughly you will eventually reach this point At first you hurry to go forward hurry to come back and hurry to stopYou continue to practice like this until you reach the point where it seems that going forward is not it coming back is not it and stopping is not it eitherIts finishedThis is the finishDont expect anything more than this it finishes right hereKhinasavo  one who is completedHe doesnt go forward doesnt retreat and doesnt stopTheres no stopping no going forward and no coming backIts finishedConsider this realize it clearly in your own mindRight there you will find that there is really nothing at allWhether this is old or new to you depends on you on your wisdom and discernmentOne who has no wisdom or discernment wont be able to figure it outJust take a look at trees like mango or jackfruit treesIf they grow up in a clump one tree may get bigger first and then the others will bend away growing outwards from that bigger oneWhy does this happenWho tells them to do thatThis is NatureNature contains both the good and the bad the right and the wrongIt can either incline to the right or incline to the wrongIf we plant any kind of trees at all close together the trees which mature later will branch away from the bigger treeHow does this happenWho determines it thusThis is Nature or DhammaLikewise tanha desire leads us to sufferingNow if we contemplate it it will lead us out of desire we will outgrow tanhaBy investigating tanha we will shake it up making it gradually lighter and lighter until its all goneThe same as the trees does anybody order them to grow the way they doThey cant talk or move around and yet they know how to grow away from obstaclesWherever its cramped and crowded and growing will be difficult they bend outwardsRight here is Dhamma we dont have to look at a whole lotOne who is astute will see the Dhamma in thisTrees by nature dont know anything they act on natural laws yet they do know enough to grow away from danger to incline towards a suitable placeReflective people are like thisWe go forth into the homeless life because we want to transcend sufferingWhat is it that make us sufferIf we follow the trail inwards we will find outThat which we like and that which we dont like are sufferingIf they are suffering then dont go so close to themDo you want to fall in love with conditions or hate them theyre all uncertainWhen we incline towards the Buddha all this comes to an endDont forget thisAnd patient enduranceJust these two are enoughIf you have this sort of understanding this is very goodActually in my own practice I didnt have a teacher to give as much teachings as all of you get from meI didnt have many teachersI ordained in an ordinary village temple and lived in village temples for quite a few yearsIn my mind I conceived the desire to practice I wanted to be proficient I wanted to trainThere wasnt anybody giving any teaching in those monasteries but the inspiration to practice aroseI traveled and I looked aroundI had ears so I listened I had eyes so I lookedWhatever I heard people say Id tell myself Not sure Whatever I saw I told myself Not sure or when the tongue contacted sweet sour salty pleasant or unpleasant flavors or feelings of comfort or pain arose in the body Id tell myself This is not a sure thingAnd so I lived with DhammaIn truth its all uncertain but our desires want things to be certainwhat can we doWe must be patientThe most important thing is khanti patient enduranceDont throw out the Buddha what I call uncertainty  dont throw that awaySometimes Id go to see old religious sites with ancient monastic buildings designed by architects built by craftsmenIn some places they would be crackedMaybe one of my friends would remark Such a shame isnt itIts cracked Id answer If that werent the case then thered be no such thing as the Buddha thered be no DhammaIts cracked like this because its perfectly in line with the Buddhas teaching Really down inside I was also sad to see those buildings cracked but Id throw off my sentimentality and try to say something which would be of use to my friends and to myselfEven though I also felt that it was a pity still I tended towards the DhammaIf it wasnt cracked like that there wouldnt be any BuddhaId say it really heavy for the benefit of my friends or perhaps they werent listening but still I was listeningThis is a way of considering things which is very very usefulFor instance say someone were to rush in and say Luang PorDo you know what so and so just said about you or He said such and such about you Maybe you even start to rageAs soon as you hear words of criticism you start getting these moods every step of the wayAs soon as we hear words like this we may start getting ready to retaliate but on looking into the truth of the matter we may find that no they had said something else after allAnd so its another case of uncertainty So why should we rush in and believe thingsWhy should we put our trust so much in what others sayWhatever we hear we should take note be patient look into the matter carefully stay straightIts not that whatever pops into our heads we write it all down as some sort of truthAny speech which ignores uncertainty is not the speech of a sageRemember thisAs for being wise we are no longer practicingWhatever we see or hear be it pleasant or sorrowful just say This is not sure Say it heavy to yourself hold it all down with thisDont build those things up into major issues just keep them all down to this oneThis point is the important oneThis is the point where defilements diePractitioners shouldnt dismiss itIf you disregard this point you can expect only suffering expect only mistakesIf you dont make this a foundation for your practice you are going to go wrong but then you will come right again later on because this principle is a really good oneActually the real Dhamma the gist of what I have been saying today isnt so mysteriousWhatever you experience is simply form simply feeling simply perception simply volition and simply consciousnessThere are only these basic qualities where is there any certainty within themIf we come to understand the true nature of things like this lust infatuation and attachment fade awaywhy do they fade awayBecause we understand we knowWe shift from ignorance to understandingUnderstanding is born from ignorance knowing is born from unknowing purity is born from defilementIt works like thisNot discarding aniccam the Buddha  This is what it means to say that the Buddha is still aliveTo stay that the Buddha has passed into Nibbana is not necessarily trueIn a more profound sense the Buddha is still aliveIts much like how we define the word bhikkhu If we define it as one who asks the meaning is very broadWe can define it this way but to use this definition too much is not so good  we dont know when to stop askingIf we were to define this word in a more profound way we would say Bhikkhu  one who sees the danger of SamsaraIsnt this more profoundIt doesnt go in the same direction as the previous definition it runs much deeperThe practice of Dhamma is like thisIf you dont fully understand it it becomes something else againIt becomes priceless it becomes a source of peaceWhen we have sati we are close to the DhammaIf we have sati we will see aniccam the transience of all thingsWe will see the Buddha and transcend the suffering of samsara if not now then sometime in the futureIf we throw away the attribute of the Noble Ones the Buddha or the Dhamma our practice will become barren and fruitlessWe must maintain our practice constantly whether we are working or sitting or simply lying downWhen the eye sees form the ear hears sound the nose smells an odor the tongue tastes a flavor or the body experiences sensation in all things dont throw away the Buddha dont stray from the BuddhaThis is to be one who has come close to the Buddha who reveres the Buddha constantlyWe have ceremonies for revering the Buddha such as chanting in the morning Araham Samma Sambuddho Bhagava This is one way of revering the Buddha but its not revering the Buddha in such a profound way as Ive described hereIts the same as with that word bhikkhu If we define it as one who asks then they keep on asking because its defined like thatTo define it in the best way we should say Bhikkhu  one who sees the danger of samsaraNow revering the Buddha is the sameRevering the Buddha by merely reciting Pali phrases as a ceremony in the mornings and evenings is comparable to defining the word bhikkhu as one who asks If we incline towards aniccam dukkham and anatta whenever the eye sees form the ear hears sound the nose smells an odor the tongue tastes a flavor the body experiences sensation or the mind cognizes mental impressions at all times this is comparable to defining the word bhikkhu as one who sees the danger of samsara Its so much more profound cuts through so many thingsIf we understand this teaching we will grow in wisdom and understandingThis is called patipadaDevelop this attitude in the practice and you will be on the right pathIf you think and reflect in this way even though you may be far from your teacher you will still be close to himIf you live close to the teacher physically but your mind has not yet met him you will spend your time either looking for his faults or adulating himIf he does something which suits you you say hes no good  and thats as far as your practice goesYou wont achieve anything by wasting your time looking at someone elseBut if you understand this teaching you can become a Noble One in the present momentThats why this year Ive distanced myself from my disciples both old and new and not given much teaching so that you can all look into things for yourselves as much as possibleFor the newer monks Ive already laid down the schedule and rules of the monastery such as dont talk too much Dont transgress the existing standards the path to realization fruition and nibbanaAnyone who transgresses these standards is not a real practitioner not one who has with a pure intention to practiceWhat can such a person ever hope to seeEven if he slept near me every day he wouldnt see meEven if he slept near the Buddha he wouldnt see the Buddha if he didnt practiceSo knowing the Dhamma or seeing the Dhamma depends on practiceHave confidence purify your own heartIf all the monks in this monastery put awareness into their respective minds we wouldnt have to reprimand or praise anybodyWe wouldnt have to be suspicious of or favor anybodyIf anger or dislike arise just leave them at the mind but see them clearlyKeep on looking at those thingsAs long as there is still something there it means we still have to dig and grind away right thereSome say I cant cut it I cant do it  if we start saying things like this there will only be a bunch of punks here because nobody cuts at their own defilementsYou must tryIf you cant yet cut it dig in deeperDig at the defilements uproot themDig them out even if they seem hard and fastThe Dhamma is not something to be reached by following your desiresYour mind may be one way the truth anotherYou must watch up front and keep a lookout behind as wellThats why I say Its all uncertain all transientThis truth of uncertainty this short and simple truth at the same time so profound and faultless people tend to ignoreThey tend to see things differentlyDont cling to goodness dont cling to badnessThese are attributes of the worldWe are practicing to be free of the world so bring these things to an endThe Buddha taught to lay them down to give them up because they only cause sufferingWhen the group of five ascetics abandoned the Buddha he saw it as a stroke of luck because he would be able to continue his practice unhinderedWith the five ascetics living with him things werent so peaceful he had responsibilitiesAnd now the five ascetics had abandoned him because they felt that he had slackened his practice and reverted to indulgencePreviously he had been intent on his ascetic practices and selfmortificationIn regards to eating sleeping and so on he had tormented himself severely but it came to a point where looking into it honestly he saw that such practices just werent workingIt was simply a matter of views practicing out of pride and clingingHe had mistaken worldly values and mistaken himself for the truthFor example if one decides to throw oneself into ascetic practices with the intention of gaining praise  this kind of practice is all worldinspired practicing for adulation and famePracticing with this kind of intention is called mistaking worldly ways for truthAnother way to practice is to mistake ones own views for truth You only believe yourself in your own practiceNo matter what others say you stick to your own preferencesYou dont carefully consider the practicethis is called mistaking oneself for truthWhether you take the world or take yourself to be truth its all simply blind attachmentThe Buddha saw this and saw that there was no adhering to the Dhamma practicing for the truthSo his practice had been fruitless he still hadnt given up defilementsThen he turned around and reconsidered all the work he had put into practice right from the beginning in terms of resultsWhat were the results of all that practiceLooking deeply into it he saw that it just wasnt rightIt was full of conceit and full of the worldThere was no dhamma no insight into anatta no emptiness or letting goThere may have been letting go of a kind but it was the kind that still hadnt let goLooking carefully at the situation the Buddha saw that even if he were to explain these things to the five ascetics they wouldnt be able to understandIt wasnt something he could easily convey to them because those ascetics were still firmly entrenched in the old way of practice and seeing thingsThe Buddha saw that you could practice like that until your dying day maybe even starve to death and achieve nothing because such practice is inspired by worldly values and by prideConsidering deeply he saw the right practice samma patipada the mind is the mind the body is the bodyThe body isnt desire or defilementEven if you were to destroy the body you wouldnt destroy defilementsThats not their sourceEven fasting and going without sleep until the body was a shrivelledup wraith wouldnt exhaust the defilementsBut the belief that defilements could be dispelled in that way the teaching of selfmortification was deeply ingrained into the five asceticsThe Buddha then began to take more food eating as normal practicing in a more natural wayWhen the five ascetics saw the change in the Buddhas practice they figured that he had given up and reverted to sensual indulgenceOne persons understanding was shifting to a higher level transcending appearances while the other saw that that persons view was sliding downwards reverting to comfortSelfmortification was deeply ingrained into the minds of the five ascetics because the Buddha had previously taught and practiced like thatNow he saw the fault in itBy seeing the fault in it clearly he was able to let it goWhen the five ascetics saw the Buddha doing this they left him feeling that he was practicing wrongly and that they would no longer follow himJust as birds abandon a tree which no longer offers sufficient shade or fish leave a pool of water that is too small too dirty or not cool just so did the five ascetics abandon the BuddhaSo now the Buddha concentrated on contemplating the DhammaHe ate more comfortably and lived more naturallyHe let the mind be simply the mind the body simply the bodyHe didnt force his practice in excess just enough to loosen the grip of greed aversion and delusionPreviously he had walked the two extremes kamasukhallikanuyogo  if happiness or love arose he would be aroused and attach to themHe would identify with them and wouldnt let goIf he encountered pleasantness he would stick to that if he encountered suffering he would stick to thatThese two extremes he called kamasukhallikanuyogo and attakilamathanuyogoThe Buddha had been stuck on conditionsHe saw clearly that these two ways are not the way for a samanaClinging to happiness clinging to suffering a samana is not like thisTo cling to those things is not the wayClinging to those things he was stuck in the views of self and the worldIf he were to flounder in these two ways he would never become one who clearly knew the worldHe would be constantly running from one extreme to the otherNow the Buddha fixed his attention on the mind itself and concerned himself with training thatAll facets of nature proceed according to their supporting conditions they arent any problem in themselvesFor instance illnesses in the bodyThe body experiences pain sickness fever and colds and so onThese all naturally occurActually people worry about their bodies too muchThat they worry about and cling to their bodies so much is because of wrong view they cant let goLook at this hall hereWe build the hall and say its ours but lizards come and live here rats and geckoes come and live here and we are always driving them away because we see that the hall belongs to us not the rats and lizardsIts the same with illnesses in the bodyWe take this body to be our home something that really belongs to usIf we happen to get a headache or stomachache we get upset we dont want the pain and sufferingThese legs are our legs we dont want them to hurt these arms are our arms we dont want anything to go wrong with itWeve got to cure all pains and illnesses at all costsThis is where we are fooled and stray from the truthWe are simply visitors to this bodyJust like this hall here its not really oursWe are simply temporary tenants like the rats lizards and geckoes but we dont know thisThis body is the sameActually the Buddha taught that there is no abiding self within this body but we go and grasp on to it as being our self as really being us and them When the body changes we dont want it to do soNo matter how much we are told we dont understandIf I say it straight you get even more fooledThis isnt yourself I say and you go even more astray you get even more confused and your practice just reinforces the selfSo most people dont really see the selfOne who sees the self is one who sees that this is neither the self nor belonging to self He sees the self as it is in NatureSeeing the self through the power of clinging is not real seeingClinging interferes with the whole businessIts not easy to realize this body as it is because upadana clings fast to it allTherefore it is said that we must investigate to clearly know with wisdomThis means to investigate the sankhara according to their true natureUse wisdomTo know the true nature of sankhara is wisdomIf you dont know the true nature of sankhara you are at odds with them always resisting themNow it is better to let go of the sankhara or to try to oppose or resist themAnd yet we plead with them to comply with our wishesWe look for all sorts of means to organize them or make a deal with themIf the body gets sick and is in pain we dont want it to be so we look for various Suttas to chant such as Bojjhango the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta the Anattalakkhanasutta and so onWe dont want the body to be in pain we want to protect it control itThese Suttas become some form of mystical ceremony getting us even more entangled in clingingThis is because they chant them in order to ward off illness to prolong life and so onActually the Buddha gave us these teachings in order to see clearly but we end up chanting them to increase our delusionRupam aniccam vedana anicca sañña anicca sankhara anicca viññanam aniccam We dont chant these words for increasing our delusionThey are recollections to help us know the truth of the body so that we can let it go and give up our longingThis is called chanting to cut things down but we tend to chant in order to extend them all or if we feel theyre too long we try chanting to shorten them to force nature to conform to our wishesIts all delusionAll the people sitting there in the hall are deluded every one of themThe ones chanting are deluded the ones listening are deluded theyre all deludedAll they can think is How can we avoid suffering Where are they ever going to practiceWhenever illnesses arise those who know see nothing strange about itGetting born into this world entails experiencing illnessHowever even the Buddha and the Noble Ones contracting illness in the course of things would also in the course of things treat it with medicineFor them it was simply a matter of correcting the elementsThey didnt blindly cling to the body or grasp at mystic ceremonies and suchThey treated illnesses with Right View they didnt treat them with delusionIf it heals it heals if it doesnt then it doesnt  thats how they saw thingsThey say that nowadays Buddhism in Thailand is thriving but it looks to me like its sunk almost as far as it can goThe Dhamma Halls are full of attentive ears but theyre attending wronglyEven the senior members of the community are like this so everybody just leads each other into more delusionOne who sees this will know that the true practice is almost opposite from where most people are going the two sides can barely understand each otherHow are those people going to transcend sufferingThey have chants for realizing the truth but they turn around and use them to increase their delusionThey turn their backs on the right pathOne goes eastward the other goes west  how are they ever going to meetTheyre not even close to each otherIf you have looked into this you will see that this is the caseMost people are lostBut how can you tell themEverything has become rites and rituals and mystic ceremoniesthey chant but they chant with foolishness they dont chant with wisdomThey study but they study with foolishness not with wisdomThey know but they know foolishly not with wisdomSo they end up going with foolishness living with foolishness knowing with foolishnessThats how it isAnd teaching all they do these days is teach people to be stupidThey say theyre teaching people to be clever giving them knowledge but when you look at it in terms of truth you see that theyre really teaching people to go astray and grasp at deceptionsThe real foundation of the teaching is in order to see atta the self as being empty having no fixed identityIts void of intrinsic beingBut people come to the study of Dhamma to increase their selfview so they dont want to experience suffering or difficultyThey want everything to be cozyThey may want to transcend suffering but if there is still a self how can they ever do soJust consider Suppose we came to possess a very expensive objectThe minute that thing comes into our possession our mind changes Now where can I keep itIf I leave it there somebody might steal it We worry ourselves into a state trying to find a place to keep itAnd when did the mind changeIt changed the minute we obtained that object  suffering arose right thenNo matter where we leave that object we cant relax so were left with troubleWhether sitting walking or lying down we are lost in worryThis is sufferingAnd when did it ariseIt arose as soon as we understood that we had obtained something thats where the suffering liesBefore we had that object there was no sufferingIt hadnt yet arisen because there wasnt yet an object for it to cling toAtta the self is the sameif we think in terms of my self then everything around us becomes mine Confusion followsWhy soThe cause of it all is that there is a self we dont peel off the apparent in order to see the TranscendentYou see the self is only an appearanceYou have to peel away the appearances in order to see the heart of the matter which is TranscendenceUpturn the apparent to find the TranscendentYou could compare it to unthreshed riceCan unthreshed rice be eatenSure it can but you must thresh it firstGet rid of the husks and you will find the grain insideNow if we dont thresh the husks we wont find the grainLike a dog sleeping on the pile of unthreshed grainIts stomach is rumbling jorkjorkjork but all it can do is lie there thinking Where can I get something to eat When its hungry it bounds off the pile of rice grain and runs off looking for scraps of foodEven though its sleeping right in top of a pile of food it knows nothing of itWhyIt cant see the riceDogs cant eat unthreshed riceThe food is there but the dog cant eat itWe may have learning but if we dont practice accordingly we still dont really know just as oblivious as the dog sleeping on the pile of rice grainIts sleeping on a pile of food but it knows nothing of itWhen it gets hungry its got to jump off and go trotting around elsewhere for foodIts a shame isnt itNow this is the same there is rice grain but what is hiding itThe husk hides the grain so the dog cant eat itAnd there is the TranscendentWhat hides itThe Apparent conceals the Transcendent making people simply sit on top of the pile of rice unable to eat it unable to practice unable to see the TranscendentAnd so they simply get stuck in appearances time and againIf you are stuck in appearances suffering is in store you will be beset by becoming birth old age sickness and deathSo there isnt anything else blocking people off they are blocked right herePeople who study the Dhamma without penetrating to its true meaning are just like the dog on the pile of unthreshed rice who doesnt know the riceHe might even starve and still find nothing to eatA dog cant eat unthreshed rice it doesnt even know there is food thereAfter a long time without food it may even die on top of that pile of ricePeople are like thisNo matter how much we study the Dhamma of the Buddha we wont see it if we dont practiceIf we dont see it then we dont know itDont go thinking that by learning a lot and knowing a lot youll know the Buddha DhammaThats like saying youve seen everything there is to see just because youve got eyes or that youve got earsYou may see but you dont see fullyYou see only with the outer eye not with the inner eye you hear with the outer ear not with the inner earIf you upturn the apparent and reveal the Transcendent you will reach the truth and see clearlyYou will uproot the Apparent and uproot clingingBut this is like some sort of sweet fruit even though the fruit is sweet we must rely on contact with and experience of that fruit before we will know what the taste is likeNow that fruit even though noone tastes it is sweet all the sameBut nobody knows of itThe Dhamma of the Buddha is like thisEven though its the truth it isnt true for those who dont really know itNo matter how excellent or fine it may be it is worthless to themSo why do people grab after sufferingWho in this world wants to inflict suffering on themselvesNoone of courseNobody wants suffering and yet people keep creating the causes of suffering just as if they were wandering around looking for sufferingWithin their hearts people are looking for happiness they dont want sufferingThen why is it that this mind of ours creates so much sufferingJust seeing this much is enoughWe dont like suffering and yet why do we create suffering for ourselvesIts easy to see it can only be because we dont know suffering dont know the end of sufferingThats why people behave the way they doHow could they not suffer when they continue to behave in this wayThese people have micchaditthi but they dont see that its micchaditthiWhatever we say believe in or do which results in suffering is all wrong viewIf it wasnt wrong view it wouldnt result in sufferingWe couldnt cling to suffering nor to happiness or to any condition at allWe would leave things be their natural way like a flowing stream of waterWe dont have to dam it up just let it flow along its natural courseThe flow of Dhamma is like this but the flow of the ignorant mind tries to resist the Dhamma in the form of wrong viewAnd yet it flies off everywhere else seeing wrong view that is suffering is there because of wrong view  this people dont seeThis is worth looking intoWhenever we have wrong view we will experience sufferingIf we dont experience it in the present it will manifest later onPeople go astray right hereWhat is blocking them offThe Apparent blocks off the Transcendent preventing people from seeing things clearlyPeople study they learn they practice but they practice with ignorance just like a person whos lost his bearingsHe walks to the west but thinks hes walking east or walks to the north thinking hes walking southThis is how far people have gone astrayThis kind of practice is really only the dregs of practice in fact its a disasterIts disaster because they turn around and go in the opposite direction they fall from the objective of true Dhamma practiceThis state of affairs causes suffering and yet people think that doing this memorizing that studying suchandsuch will be a cause for the cessation of sufferingJust like a person who wants a lot of thingsHe tries to amass as much as possible thinking if he gets enough his suffering will abateThis is how people think but their thinking is astray of the true path just like one person going northward another going southward and yet believing theyre going the same wayMost people are still stuck in the mass of suffering still wandering in samsara just because they think like thisIf illness or pain arise all they can do is wonder how they can get rid of itThey want it to stop as fast as possible theyve got to cure it all costsThey dont consider that this is the normal way of sankharaNobody thinks like thisThe body changes and people cant endure it they cant accept it theyve got to get rid of it at all costsHowever in the end they cant win they cant beat the truthIt all collapsesThis is something people dont want to look at they continually reinforce their wrong viewPracticing to realize the Dhamma is the most excellent of thingsWhy did the Buddha develop all the PerfectionsSo that he could realize this and enable others to see the Dhamma know the Dhamma practice the Dhamma and be the Dhamma  so that they could let go and not be burdenedDont cling to things Or to put it another way Hold but dont hold fast This is also rightIf we see something we pick it up Oh its this then we lay it downWe see something else pick it up one holds but not fastHold it just long enough to consider it to know it then to let it goIf you hold without letting go carry without laying down the burden then you are going to be heavyIf you pick something up and carry it for a while then when it gets heavy you should lay it down throw it offDont make suffering for yourselfThis we should know as the cause of sufferingIf we know the cause of suffering suffering cannot ariseFor either happiness or suffering to arise there must be the atta the selfThere must be the I and mine there must be this appearanceIf when all these things arise the mind goes straight to the Transcendent it removes the appearancesIt removes the delight the aversion and the clinging from those thingsJust as when something that we value gets lost when we find it again our worries disappearEven before we see that object our worries may be relievedAt first we think its lost and suffer over it but there comes a day when we suddenly remember Oh thats rightI put it over there now I remember As soon as we remember this as soon as we see the truth even if we havent laid eyes on that object we feel happyThis is called seeing within seeing with the minds eye not seeing with the outer eyeIf we see with the minds eye then even though we havent laid eyes on that object we are already relievedThis is the same When we cultivate Dhamma practice and attain the Dhamma see the Dhamma then whenever we encounter a problem we solve the problem instantly right then and thereIt disappears completely laid down releasedNow the Buddha wanted us to contact the Dhamma but people only contact the words the books and the scripturesThis is contacting that which is about Dhamma not contacting the actual Dhamma as taught by our Great TeacherHow can people say they are practicing well and properlyThey are a long way offThe Buddha was known as lokavidu having clearly realized the worldRight now we see the world all right but not clearlyThe more we know the darker the world becomes because our knowledge is murky its not clear knowledgeIts faultyThis is called knowing through darkness lacking in light and radiancePeople are only stuck here but its no trifling matterIts importantMost people want goodness and happiness but they just dont know what the causes for that goodness and happiness areWhatever it may be if we havent yet seen the harm of it we cant give it upNo matter how bad it may be we still cant give it up if we havent truly seen the harm of itHowever if we really see the harm of something beyond a doubt then we can let it goAs soon as we see the harm of something and the benefit of giving it up theres an immediate changeWhy is it we are still unattained still cannot let goIts because we still dont see the harm clearly our knowledge is faulty its darkthats why we cant let goIf we knew clearly like the Lord Buddha or the arahant disciples we would surely let go our problems would dissolve completely with no difficulty at allWhen your ears hear sound then let them do their jobWhen your eyes perform their function with forms then let them do soWhen your nose works with smells let it do its jobWhen your body experiences sensations then let it perform its natural functions where will problems ariseThere are no problemsIn the same way all those things which belong to the Apparent leave them with the ApparentAnd acknowledge that which is the TranscendentSimply be the One Who Knows knowing without fixation knowing and letting things be their natural wayAll things are just as they areAll our belongings does anybody really own themDoes our father own them or our mother or our relativesNobody really gets anythingThats why the Buddha said to let all those things be let them goKnow them clearlyKnow then by holding but not fastUse things in a way that is beneficial not in a harmful way by holding fast to them until suffering arisesTo know Dhamma you must know in this wayThat is to know in such a way as to transcend sufferingThis sort of knowledge is importantKnowing about how to make things to use tools knowing all the various sciences of the world and so on all have their place but they are not the supreme knowledgeThe Dhamma must be known as Ive explained it hereYou dont have to know a whole lot just this much is enough for the Dhamma practitioner  to know and then let goIts not that you have to die before you can transcend suffering you knowYou transcend suffering in this very life because you know how to solve problemsYou know the apparent you know the TranscendentDo it in this lifetime while you are here practicingYou wont find it anywhere elseDont cling to thingsHold but dont clingYou may wonder Why does the Ajahn keep saying this How could I teach otherwise how could I say otherwise when the truth is just as Ive said itEven though its the truth dont hold fast to even thatIf you cling to it blindly it becomes a falsehoodLike a dog try grabbing its legIf you dont let go the dog will spin around and bite youJust try it outAll animals behave like thisIf you dont let go its got no choice but to biteThe Apparent is the sameWe live in accordance with conventions they are here for our convenience in this life but they are not things to be clung to so hard that they cause sufferingJust let things passWhenever we feel that we are definitely right so much so that we refuse to open up to anything or anybody else right there we are wrongIt becomes wrong viewWhen suffering arises where does it arise fromThe cause is wrong view the fruit of that being sufferingIf it was right view it wouldnt cause sufferingSo I say Allow space dont cling to things Right is just another supposition just let it passWrong is another apparent condition just let it be thatIf you feel you are right and yet others contend the issue dont argue just let it goAs soon as you know let goThis is the straight wayUsually its not like thisPeople dont often give in to each otherThats why some people even Dhamma practitioners who still dont know themselves may say things that are utter foolishness and yet think theyre being wiseThey may say something thats so stupid that others cant even bear to listen and yet they think they are being cleverer than othersOther people cant even listen to it and yet they think they are smart that they are rightThey are simply advertising their own stupidityThats why the wise say Whatever speech disregards aniccam is not the speech of a wise person its the speech of a foolIts deluded speechits the speech of one who doesnt know that suffering is going to arise right there For example suppose you had decided to go to Bangkok tomorrow and someone were to ask Are you going to Bangkok tomorrowI hope to go to BangkokIf there are no obstacles Ill probably go This is called speaking with the Dhamma in mind speaking with aniccam in mind taking into account the truth the transient uncertain nature of the worldYou dont say Yes Im definitely going tomorrow If it turns out you dont go what are you going to do send news to all the people who told you were going toYoud be just talking nonsenseTheres still much more to it the practice of Dhamma becomes more and more refinedBut if you dont see it you may think you are speaking right even when you are speaking wrongly and straying from the true nature of things with every wordAnd yet you may think you are speaking the truthTo put it simply anything that we say or do that causes suffering to arise should be known as micchaditthiIts delusion and foolishnessMost practitioners dont reflect in this wayWhatever they like they think is right and they just go on believing themselvesFor instance they may receive some gift or title be it an object rank or even words of praise and they think its goodThey take it as some sort of permanent conditionSo they get puffed up with pride and conceit they dont consider Who am IWhere is this socalled goodnessWhere did it come fromDo others have the same thingsThe Buddha taught that we should conduct ourselves normallyIf we dont dig in chew over and look into this point it means its still sunk within usIt means these conditions are still buried within our hearts  we are still sunk in wealth rank and praiseSo we become someone else because of themWe think we are better than before that we are something special and so all sorts of confusion arisesActually in truth there isnt anything to human beingsWhatever we may be its only in the realm of appearancesIf we take away the apparent and see the Transcendent we see that there isnt anything thereThere are simply the universal characteristics  birth in the beginning change in the middle and cessation in the endThis is all there isIf we see that all things are like this then no problems ariseIf we understand this we will have contentment and peaceWhere trouble arises is when we think like the five ascetic disciples of the BuddhaThey followed the instruction of their teacher but when he changed his practice they couldnt understand what he thought or knewThey decided that the Buddha had given up his practice and reverted to indulgenceIf we were in that position wed probably think the same thing and thered be no way to correct itHolding on to the old ways thinking in the lower way yet believing its higherWed see the Buddha and think hed given up the practice and reverted to indulgence just like hed given up the practice and reverted to indulgence just like those Five Ascetics consider how many years they had been practicing at that time and yet they still went astray they still werent proficientSo I say to practice and also to look at the results of your practiceEspecially where you refuse to follow where there is frictionWhere there is no friction there is no problem things flowIf there is friction they dont flow you set up a self and things become solid like a mass of clingingThere is no give and takeMost monks and cultivators tend to be like thisHowever theyve thought in the past they continue to thinkThey refuse to change they dont reflectThey think they are right so they cant be wrong but actually wrongness is buried within rightness even though most people dont know thatHow is it soThis is right but if someone else says its not right you wont give in youve got to argueWhat is thisDitthi mana Ditthi means views mana is the attachment to those viewsIf we attach even to what is right refusing to concede to anybody then it becomes wrongTo cling fast to rightness is simply the arising of self there is no letting goThis is a point which gives people a lot of trouble except for those Dhamma practitioners who know that this matter this point is a very important onethey will take not of itIf it arises while theyre speaking clinging comes racing on to the sceneMaybe it will linger for some time perhaps one or two days three or four months a year or twoThis is for the slow

present momentTucked away in the Samyutta Nikaya among the connected sayings on causality is a short formalized text entitled the Upanisa Sutta the Discourse on Supporting Conditions Though at first glance hardly conspicuous among the many interesting suttas in this collection this little discourse turns out upon repeated examination to be of tremendous doctrinal importanceIts great significance derives from the striking juxtaposition it makes of two applications of dependent arising the principle of conditionality which lies at the heart of the Buddhas doctrineThe first application is the usual one setting forth the causal sequence responsible for the origination of samsaric sufferingApart from a slight change it is identical with the twelvefactored formulation recurring throughout the Pali canonThe change  the substitution of suffering for aginganddeath as the last member of the series  becomes the lead for the second application of dependent arisingThis application occurring only sporadically in the Pali canon allows the same principle of conditionality to structure the path leading to deliverance from sufferingIt begins with faith emerging out of the suffering with which the first series ended and continues through to the retrospective knowledge of liberation which confirms the destruction of the binding defilementsBy linking the two series into a single sequence the sutta reveals the entire course of mans faring in the world as well as his treading of the path to its transcendenceIt shows moreover that these two dimensions of human experience the mundane and the transcendental the dimensions of world involvement and world disengagement are both governed by a single structural principle that of dependent arisingRecognizing this broader range of the principle the Nettipakarana a Pali exegetical treatise has called the second application transcendental dependent arisingDespite the great importance of the Upanisa Sutta traditional commentators have hardly given the text the special attention it would seem to deservePerhaps the reason for this is that its line of approach being peculiar to itself and a few related texts scattered through the Canon it has been overshadowed by the many other suttas giving the more usual presentation of doctrineBut whatever the explanation be the need has remained for a fuller exploration of the suttas meaning and implicationsWe have sought to remedy this deficiency with the following work offering an English translation of the Upanisa Sutta and an exposition of its messageThe exposition sets out to explore the second transcendental application of dependent arising drawing freely from other parts of the Canon and the commentaries to fill out the meaningSince full accounts of the mundane or samsaric side of dependent arising can be readily found elsewhere we thought it best to limit our exposition to the principles less familiar applicationA similar project has been undertaken by Bhikshu Sangharakshita in his book The Three JewelsHowever since this work draws largely from Mahayanist sources to explain the stages in the series the need has remained for a treatment which elucidates the series entirely

for the knowledge of the destructionDependent arising is the central principle of the Buddhas teaching constituting both the objective content of its liberating insight and the germinative source for its vast network of doctrines and disciplinesAs the frame behind the four noble truths the key to the perspective of the middle way and the conduit to the realization of selflessness it is the unifying theme running through the teachings multifarious expressions binding them together as diversified formulations of a single coherent visionThe earliest suttas equate dependent arising with the unique discovery of the Buddhas enlightenment so profound and difficult to grasp that he at first hesitated to announce it to the worldA simple exposition of the principle sparks off the liberating wisdom in the minds of his foremost disciples while skill in explaining its workings is made a qualification of an adroit expounder of the DhammaSo crucial is this principle to the body of the Buddhas doctrine that an insight into dependent arising is held to be sufficient to yield an understanding of the entire teachingIn the words of the Buddha He who sees dependent arising sees the Dhamma he who sees the Dhamma sees dependent arising The Pali texts present dependent arising in a double formIt appears both as an abstract statement of universal law and as the particular application of that law to the specific problem which is the doctrines focal concern namely the problem of sufferingIn its abstract form the principle of dependent arising is equivalent to the law of the conditioned genesis of phenomenaIt expresses the invariable concomitance between the arising and ceasing of any given phenomenon and the functional efficacy of its originative conditionsIts phrasing as terse as any formulation of modern logic recurs in the ancient texts thus This being that exists through the arising of this that arisesThis not being that does not exist through the ceasing of this that ceasesWhen applied to the problem of suffering the abstract principle becomes encapsulated in a twelveterm formula disclosing the causal nexus responsible for the origination of sufferingIt begins with ignorance the primary root of the series though not a first cause conditioning the arising of ethically determinate volitions which in turn condition the arising of consciousness and so on through the salient occasions of sentient becoming down to their conclusion in old age and death SN passimThe corollary of this formula which constantly accompanies it describes the conditioned cessation of sufferingIt shows how when ignorance ceases all the following conditions successively cease down to the cessation of the entire mass of sufferingThough the principle of dependent arising is applicable to any situation where an origination of phenomena takes place the Pali Buddhist tradition has focused upon the doctrine almost exclusively in terms of its twelvefold formulationSo much has this been the case that the two have tended to be blankly identified with each other dependent arising being equated simply with the twelvefold series and the twelvefold series being regarded as an exhaustive treatment of dependent arisingThis exclusiveness of emphasis doubtlessly poses a certain danger of rigidity but even despite this danger it is not without its justificationFor the aim of the Buddhas teaching is not abstract and theoretical but concrete and soteriologicalIts goal is liberation from suffering understood in its deepest sense as the unsatisfactoriness of sentient existence indefinitely repeated in the wheel of becoming the cycle of births and deaths called samsaraThe twelveterm nexus contributes to this liberative thrust by bringing the principle of dependent arising to bear directly on the condition which it is the doctrines overriding concern to ameliorateIf suffering is produced by causes these causes and the way they can be stopped must be uncovered and exposedThe twelvefold application accomplishes precisely thisIn its positive or direct aspect it makes known the causal chain behind suffering demonstrating how the round of existence arises and turns through the impulsions of craving clinging and karma working freely behind the shielding screen of ignoranceIn its negative or reverse side it reveals the way to the cessation of suffering showing that when ignorance is eliminated by the rise of true knowledge all the factors dependent on ignorance likewise draw to a closeHowever as a consequence of this constriction of attention sight has tended to be lost of the broader range of exemplifications the principle of dependent arising might have even within the limits of the soteriological direction of the teachingDependent arising cannot be reduced to any single one of its applicationsAny application is only a pedagogical device framed from the standpoint of the teachings practical orientationAbove and beyond its specific instances dependent arising remains an expression of the invariable structural relatedness of phenomenaIt is a principle to which all phenomena conform by the very nature of their being the principle that whatever comes into existence does so in dependence on conditionsFrom the perspective this teaching affords things are seen to arise not from some intrinsic nature of their own from necessity chance or accident but from their causal correlations with other things to which they are connected as part of the fixed order obtaining between phenomenaEach transient entity emerging into the present out of the stream of events bearing down from the past absorbs into itself the causal influx of the past to which it must be responsiveDuring its phase of presence it exercises its own distinctive function with the support of its conditions expressing thereby its own immediacy of beingAnd then with the completion of its actuality it is swept away by the universal impermanence to become itself a condition determinant of the futureWhen this law of interconnected becoming of conditionality and relatedness is extracted from its usual exemplifications and explored for further doctrinal bearings it can be found to have other ramifications equally relevant to the realization of the teachings fundamental aimOne particular exemplification of dependent arising found with minor variations in a number of suttas shows the basic principle to serve as the scaffolding for the course of spiritual development issuing in final emancipationIt figures in these suttas as the architectonic underlying the gradual training governing the process by which one phase of practice conditions the arising of the following phase all the way from the commencement of the path to the realization of the ultimate goalTo be sure the application of dependent arising to the achievement of deliverance is already covered from one angle by the reverse or cessation side of the twelvefold formula according to which the cessation of ignorance sets off a series of cessations culminating in the cessation of sufferingThence in itself such an application is not a unique feature of these suttasWhat gives these suttas their distinctive quality and value is the positive form in which they cast the sequential pattern of the liberative ventureWhereas the series of cessations presents the achievement of liberation logically in strict doctrinal terms as the consequence following upon the annulment of samsaric bondage the present sequence views the same chain of events dynamically from the inner perspective of living experienceAs living experience the advance to emancipation cannot be tied down to a series of mere negations for such a mode of treatment omits precisely what is most essential to the spiritual quest  the immediacy of inner striving growth and transformationParallel to the demolition of old barriers there occurs in the quest for deliverance a widening of vistas characterized by an evolving sense of maturation enrichment and fulfillment the departure from bondage anxiety and suffering at the same time means the move towards freedom and peaceThis expansion and enrichment is made possible by the structure of the gradual training which is not so much a succession of discrete steps one following the other as a locking together of overlapping components in a union at once augmentative consummative and projectiveEach pair of stages intertwines in a mutually vitalizing bond wherein the lower antecedent member nurtures its successor by serving as its generative base and the higher consequent member completes its predecessor by absorbing its energies and directing them on to the next phase in the seriesEach link thus performs a double function while rewarding the efforts expended in the accomplishment of the antecedent stage it provides the incentive for the commencement of the consequent stageIn this way the graduated training unfolds organically in a fluid progression in which as the Buddha says stage flows over into stage stage fulfills stage for crossing over from the hither shore to the beyondAll the factors comprised in this sequence come into being in strict subjection to the law of conditioned genesisThe accidental the compulsory and the mysterious are equally excluded by the lawful regularity governing the seriesThe stages of the path do not emerge fortuitously or through the operation of some inscrutable power but originate conditionally appearing spontaneously in the course of training when their requisite conditions are completeThus the course of spiritual development these suttas reveal is a dependent arising  a coming into being in dependence on conditionsBut this dependent arising differs significantly from its mundane counterpartThe mundane version with its twelve links describes the movement of samsara which revolves in a perpetually selfregenerating circle leading from beginning to end only to find the end lead back to the beginningThe mechanism of this process by which defilements and renewed existence mutually kindle one another is fueled by the hope that somehow some solution will yet emerge within the framework of laws set for the turning of the wheel a hope repeatedly disappointedThe present version of dependent arising delineates a type of development that only becomes possible when this hope has been dispensed withIt hinges on the prior recognition that any attempt to eliminate suffering through the gratification of craving is doomed to failure and that the only way to stop it is to cut through the vicious nexus at its baseThough the movement it describes is still cyclic it is not the circular revolution of samsara it is concerned with but a different kind of rotation that only comes into play when the essentially defective nature of the ordinary human condition has been clearly perceived and the urge towards liberation from it made the dominant motive of the inner lifeThe present sequence depicts the movement towards releaseIt sets forth a drive which in contrast to the pointless repetition of samsara evolves up and outwards in an unbroken spiral ascent  a pattern in which each turn supports and strengthens its successors capacity for liberation enabling the series as a whole to pick up the momentum needed to break the gravitational pull of the mundane sphereSince all the phases in this progression arise in dependence on their antecedents the series represents a dependent arisingBut unlike the familiar version of dependent arising the present version leads not back to the round of becoming but to the overcoming of samsara and all its attendant sufferingsHence the Nettippakarana calls this sequence transcendental dependent arising  a dependent arising that leads to the transcendence of the worldThe sutta we will investigate here for an account of transcendental dependent arising is the Upanisa Sutta of the NidanasamyuttaIn addition to giving a clear explicit account of the conditional structure of the liberative progression this sutta has the further advantage of bringing the supramundane form of dependent arising into immediate connection with its familiar samsaric counterpartBy making this connection it brings into prominence the comprehensive character of the principle of conditionality  its ability to support and explain both the process of compulsive involvement which is the origin of suffering and the process of disengagement which leads to deliverance from sufferingThereby it reveals dependent arising to be the key to the unity and coherence of the Buddhas teachingWhen the Buddha declares I teach only suffering and the cessation of suffering the bond which unites these two terminals of the doctrine as complementary sides of a single internally consistent system is simply the law of dependent arisingThe Upanisa Sutta gives three expositions of transcendental dependent arising The first expounds the sequence in reverse order beginning with the last link in the series the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers and tracing the chain backwards to the first link in the liberative sequence namely faithAt this point it crosses over to the mundane order explaining faith as arising through suffering suffering as conditioned by birth birth as conditioned by existence and so on back through the familiar links to ignorance as the first member of the chainAfter completing the reverse exposition the Buddha then expounds the same series in forward order beginning with ignorance and following through to the knowledge of destructionThis he does twice in exactly the same way once before and once after the striking simile comparing the sequential origination of the factors to the gradual descent of rainfall from a mountain through the graded ponds lakes streams and rivers to the great ocean at the mountains baseThus the series of conditions presented in the sutta can be mapped out in the abstract as followsTranscendental OrderFor ease of explanation we will examine the links of transcendental dependent arising in direct orderHowever before doing so it is instructive to note that there is special significance in the initial presentation of the series in reverseSuch a presentation serves to throw an important spotlight on the nature of the causal relation obtaining between the path to liberation and its goalIt shows that the type of causal development displayed by this progression is quite different from the pattern of blind efficient causality which involves the incidental emergence of an effect out of its causal matrix as for example when a series of geological changes triggers off an earthquake or a number of atoms combine to form some new moleculeThe relationship between the path and the goal belongs to a more complex order of causality one which can perhaps be pictured as a set of prior causes giving rise to an effect but can never be adequately and correctly comprehended in terms of this modelWhat we have here is not an instance of simple onedirectional causality proceeding forward unmodified in a straight line we have rather a species of teleological causality involving purpose intelligence and planned striving simultaneously projected towards and refracted from the aimed at effect in a process of reciprocal determinationIn the workings of this relationship not only does the path facilitate the achievement of the goal but the goal as well already present from the outset as the envisaged aim of striving itself bends back to participate in the shaping of the pathStarting from mans awareness of the painful inadequacies of his existence and his intuitive groping towards a condition where these are allayed the formula proceeds to trace back in terms derivative from and constantly checked against the goal the series of alterations he must induce in his cognitive and emotive makeup to bring the goal into his reachWe see this pattern illustrated in the traditional account of prince Siddharthas great renunciationWhen the future Buddha leaves his palace he goes forth in the confidence that beyond the perishable defective and substanceless things of the world there is accessible to man an unperishable and selfsufficient state which makes possible deliverance from sufferingWhat he needs to discover as the objective of his holy quest is the path bridging the two domainsThis he does by pursuing backwards from the goal of striving the obstructions to its attainment and the steps to be taken to remove those obstructionsOne line of exploration begins with aging and death as the fundamental manifestation of the suffering which weighs upon the world and follows its chain of conditions back to ignorance as the underlying rootAnother complementary line starts with the defilements as the principal obstruction to emancipationIt then finds the defilements to be sustained by ignorance ignorance by the distracted mind and the distracted mind by a causal nexus going back to lack of faith in the true DhammaFrom this the conclusion follows as shown in the Upanisa Sutta that to achieve deliverance the defilements must be removed through dispassion to reach dispassion ignorance must be overcome by correct understanding to arouse understanding the mind must be concentrated and so on through the counterconditions down to the gain of faith in the true DhammaIn both cases the reverse direction of the sequential logic reveals the peculiar nature of the pathgoal relationshipThe two stand together in a bond of reciprocal determination the path leading to the achievement of the goal and the goal giving form and content to the pathIn addition to the forward thrust of the path there is thus a basic feedback emanating from the goal so that the goal can in a sense generate out of itself through the circuit system of mans constitutional capacities the series of measures needed to bring about its actualizationThis relationship is analogous to the relation between a guided missile and its mobile targetThe missile does not reach its target merely through its own initial thrust and directionIt finds it precisely because it is being controlled by signals the target is itself emittingSuffering is the supporting condition for faith After asserting as the last step in the mundane sequence that birth is the supporting condition for suffering the sutta switches over to the transcendental series with the pronouncement that suffering is the supporting condition for faithWith respect to both assertions the present formulation diverges from the usual version of twelvefactored dependent arisingIn the usual version the forward sequence ends with the statement that birth is the condition for aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairWith this it concludes leaving unstated the implied aftermath  that this mass of suffering will generate anew the fundamental ignorance at the head of the whole series thus beginning another run through the cycleThe fact that suffering here replaces aginganddeath as the last member of the samsaric part of the series therefore has a special importanceIt cautions us to the impending change signaling that we are about to witness in the progression of links to follow not just one more turn of the wheel but an interruption of its forward spin and a struggle to reverse its natural direction of movementThe Buddhas declaration that suffering is the supporting condition for faith points to the essential backdrop to the awakening of the religious consciousnessIt reveals that spiritual awareness and the quest for enlightenment do not arise spontaneously in harmony with our natural modes of worldengagement but require a turn against the current a break away from our instinctual urges for expansion and enjoyment and the embarkation in a different directionThis break is precipitated by the encounter with sufferingSuffering spurs the awakening of the religious consciousness in that it is the experience of suffering which first tears us out of our blind absorption in the immediacy of temporal being and sets us in search of a way to its transcendenceWhether in the form of pain frustration or distress suffering reveals the basic insecurity of the human condition shattering our naive optimism and unquestioned trust in the goodness of the given order of thingsIt throws before our awareness in a way we cannot evade the vast gulf stretching between our ingrained expectations and the possibilities for their fulfillment in a world never fully susceptible to domination by our willsIt makes us call into question our schemes of values built upon the bedrock of personal expedienceIt leads to a revaluation of all values and a new scale of worth indifferent to the claims of selfconcernAnd it opens us to confidence in an unseen order of relations and interconnections an order in which the values that emerge so often in forceful opposition to the old will find their proper justification and rewardYet for suffering to become an effective spur to spiritual awakening it is not enough merely to encounter itFor the religious consciousness to be aroused suffering must be not only met as a constant liability of our existence but confronted and grappled with in the arena of thematic reflectionAs long as we engage suffering simply in its superficial modes as felt pain and sorrow we will react to it in one of two ways both of which operate at a purely psychological levelIn the first case we will react to suffering in an unhealthy manner as when we arouse resentment against the source of our displeasure and seek relief by annihilating it ignoring it or running away in pursuit of some easy escapeIn the second case we will react to suffering in a mentally healthy way as when we fortify our minds with patience and courage strengthen our capacities for endurance and seek to resolve the problem in a realistic mannerBut though the second approach is definitely to be preferred to the first in neither case does that inward revolution take place which awakens us to our extreme need for deliverance and compels us to set off in a new direction previously unknown and unexploredThe urge for liberation can only set in when pain and sorrow have been confronted with reflective awareness and recognized as symptoms of a deeper ailment demanding a radical therapyThe quest for a conclusive solution to the problem of suffering begins with an act of understanding not with mere tribulationIt starts from the realization that suffering is more than a chance encroachment upon a state of affairs otherwise felicitous that it is a malady which infects our being upwards from its very rootWe must come to see that the breeding ground of suffering lies not so much in the outside world as at the base of our own being and that any cure that is to be permanently effective must uproot it at this inward sourceThe arising of such a realization depends upon the adoption of a new perspective from which the fact of suffering can be faced in its full range and universalityThough single in its essence suffering or dukkha yet divides into three stages or tiers in accordance with the level of understanding from which it is viewedAt the most elementary level suffering appears as physical pain and oppression manifest most clearly in the events of birth sickness aging and death as well as in hunger thirst privation and bodily discomfortAt a higher level it comes to be seen as a psychological fact  as the sorrow and frustration springing from our separation from what is desired our meeting with what is disliked and the disappointment of our expectationsAnd at the third and highest level suffering becomes manifest in its essential form as the inherent unsatisfactoriness of the samsaric round in which we turn without purpose on account of our ignorance and attachmentsThese three tiers are not mutually exclusiveIn each case the lower level serves as basis for the higher by which it is absorbed and comprehendedThus though the penetration of the highest stage the essential suffering comprised in the five clinging aggregates represents the climax of understanding this realization comes as the fruit of a long period of preparation grounded upon the first flash of insight into the basic inadequacy of the human conditionSuch an insight usually dawns through particular experiences typical of the first two stages of suffering  through sudden pain loss or disappointment or through chronic anxiety confusion and distressBut in order to become the stimulus to a higher course of development our vision must be capable of rising from the particular to the universalIt is only when we see clearly for ourselves that we are sunk in birth aging and death in sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair sunk in suffering overcome by suffering that we are really ready for the means to bring this unsatisfactory condition to an endSince it is suffering that impels us to seek the way to liberation suffering is called the supporting condition for faithBy itself however the confrontation with suffering even at the level of mature reflection is not sufficient to generate faithFor faith to arise two conditions are required the first is the awareness of suffering which makes us recognize the need for a liberative path the second is the encounter with a teaching that proclaims a liberative pathThence the Buddha says that faith has for its nutriment hearing the exposition of the true DhammaSaddha the faith that comes into being as a result of hearing the exposition of the true Dhamma is essentially an attitude of trust and commitment directed to ultimate emancipationIn order for such faith to arise and become a driving force of spiritual development it must meet with an objective ground capable of eliciting its forward leap into the unknown and of prompting its inner urge towards liberationFrom the Buddhist perspective this objective ground is provided by the three objects of refuge  the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha that is the enlightened Teacher his teaching and his community of noble disciplesThe faith to be placed in them must not be blind and uncriticalThough initially requiring consent born out of trust it also must be based on critical scrutiny  the Teacher tested to determine his trustworthiness his doctrine examined to decide on its cogency and his disciples interrogated to ascertain their reliabilityAs a result of such examination conducted either through personal confrontation whenever possible or through scrutiny of the scriptural records faith becomes settled in the Buddha as the Perfectly Enlightened One the unerring guide on the path to deliverance in the Dhamma as his teaching and the path leading to deliverance and in the Sangha as the community of the Buddhas disciples who have verified his teaching through their own direct experience and hence may be relied upon for guidance in our own pursuit of the goalAs the first requisite of spiritual development faith is compared to a hand in that it is needed to take hold of beneficial practices and to a seed in that it is the vitalizing germ for the growth of the higher virtuesBeneath its seeming simplicity it is a complex phenomenon combining intellectual emotional and conative elementsIntellectually faith implies a willingness to accept on trust propositions beyond our present capacity for verification propositions relating to the basic tenets of the doctrineThrough practice this assent will be translated from belief into knowledge but at the outset there is required an acceptance which cannot be fully corroborated by objective evidenceEmotionally faith issues in feelings of confidence and serene joy coupled with an attitude of devotion directed to the objects of refugeAnd at the level of volition faith reinforces the readiness to implement certain lines of conduct in the conviction they will lead to the desired goalIt is the mobilizing force of action stirring up the energy to actualize the idealFaith is the supporting condition for joy Faith functions as a support for the next link in the series joy or gladness by permitting an outlet from the pentup tensions of an existential impasse brought on by the reflective encounter with the problem of sufferingPrior to the discovery of the true Dhamma two alternatives present themselves to the thoughtful individual as he struggles to work out a viable solution to the problem of suffering once it has emerged into the open in its full depth and universalityOne alternative is compliant submission to a justification of suffering developed along traditional theological lines  that is a theodicy which sees evil and suffering as detracting from the goodness of the created order only superficially while ultimately contributing to the total perfection of the wholeThis solution though generally aligned with the higher ethical values still appears to the sensitive thinker to be a facile answer constantly provocative of a gnawing sense of doubt and disbeliefThe other alternative is resignation to suffering as a brute fact unintelligible to mans moral sense an incidental offshoot of a universe totally indifferent to any structure of spiritual or ethical valuesThis solution though not internally inconsistent clashes with our basic moral intuitions so sharply that the result for the sensitive thinker is often a turn to nihilism in one of its two forms  as reckless license or ineffectual despairNeither the theological nor the materialistic answers can show the way to an actual escape from sufferingBoth in the last analysis can only hold out a choice between resignation and rebellionThe gain of faith in the true Dhamma spells the end to this quandary by pointing to a solution which can admit the pervasive reality of suffering without needing to justify it yet can give this suffering a cogent explanation and indicate an escapeSuffering from this perspective is traceable to distinct causes endowed with ethical significance it is the inevitable result of our own immoral actions returning to ourselvesOur actions when viewed from the standpoint of the Dhamma are neither threads in some invisible handiwork of divine perfection nor meaningless pulsations of nerves and brain but expressions of ethically significant decisions having an integral place in a morally intelligible worldThey are seen as choices for which we bear full responsibility before an impersonal universal law that ensures the preservation of an equilibrium between deeds and their results so that virtuous deeds bring forth happiness and evil deeds sufferingThe round of becoming in which we are immersed  where we are born grow old suffer and die  this round is created by ourselves fashioned out of our own blindness and cravingWe build the round ourselves and we can bring it to an end by ourselves by eradicating this worldsustaining ignorance and desireThe path to liberation is revealed in all its practical details with full precision and clarityIt is a path of conduct and insight each man must tread for himself success being dependent entirely on his own diligence sincerity and energy and on his capacities for renunciation and understandingThe gain of faith in the true Dhamma thus points to an outlet from the contention of opposed alternatives neither of which can be happily embracedIt exhausts the pressures of an apparent deadend and as the stress and tension fall away there springs up a surge of joy conditioned by the acquisition of faithThis incipient swell of joy grows by degrees as the aspirants contemplation focuses more sharply upon the objects in which confidence has been reposedSustained reflection on the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha gradually dispels the darkness of doubt and indecisionIt issues in an effusion of light of peace and inner clarity when as a result of such reflection the defilements are attenuated and the minds impulsion towards the elevating qualities the refuges represent gains in forward momentumFor this reason faith is compared to a miraculous waterclearing gemAccording to Indian legend there is a special gem possessed by the mythic universal monarch which when thrown into a stream of turbid water immediately causes it to become clearThe strands of vegetation float away the mud settles and the water becomes pure serene and sweettasting fit to be drunk by the monarchSimilarly it is said when the gem of faith is set up in the heart it causes the hindrances to disappear the defilements to settle and the mind to become clear lucid and sereneThe strengthening of confidence in the objects of refuge becomes the incentive for a firmer dedication to the practice of the teachingThence the texts ascribe to faith the characteristic of leaping forward Faith leaps forward in that when the yogin sees that the hearts of others have been set free he leaps forward by way of aspiration to the various fruits of a holy life and he makes efforts to attain the yet unattained to find the unfound to realize the unrealized This aspect of faith is illustrated by a courageous hero who lunges across a turbulent river to escape from danger saving himself thereby and inspiring others by his exampleAt this stage in particular the aspirants faith creates a readiness to undertake the basic rules of moral trainingThrough his settled faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha he is prepared to enter the path of practice which requires at the start that he train in the foundation of the path the observance of moral disciplineFor this reason the acceptance of moral restraint is said to be undertaken out of faithMoral restraint is taken up by accepting rules of discipline designed to inculcate an inner disposition of virtue by controlling bodily and verbal actionsThe codes of rules vary in scope from the five basic precepts of the Buddhist layman to the more than training rules undertaken by the bhikkhu or fully ordained monk but all share the common characteristic of disciplining behaviorEach of the basic precepts involves an explicit principle of abstinence requiring to be observed and an implicit mental attitude to be cultivated through such abstinenceThe former consists in abstention from the unwholesome actions of taking life stealing sexual abuse false speech and partaking of intoxicants the latter calls for a persistent effort to develop a mind of compassion honesty purity truthfulness and sobrietyThe immediate result of living in conformity with these guidelines to right action is the arising of a sense of freedom from remorseRemorse a feeling of regret over moral transgression and neglect tends to provoke guilt agitation and selfrecriminationWhen through close adherence to the precepts the mind is freed from remorse an ease of conscience and bliss of blamelessness set in born of the knowledge that ones actions are beyond reproachThence the Buddha declares wholesome rules of conduct to have freedom from remorse as their benefit and rewardThe joy that comes through realizing ones purity confirms the confidence originally placed in the teachingThereby it arouses still stronger faith and a desire for further application to the practiceJoy is the supporting condition for rapture Though for certain individuals serene faith in the objects of refuge and a clear conscience are sufficient to transform joy into rapture such cases are the exception rather than the ruleGenerally in order for the emotional tone of the spiritual life to be lifted to that pitch of intensity suggested by the term rapture a further commitment to the training is necessaryThis commitment takes the form of deliberate application to the practice of meditationMethods of meditation contributing to the attainment of liberation are classified into two systems  serenity meditation and insight meditationSerenity meditation aims at the creation of a state of calm concentration by unifying the mind in focus on a single objectInsight meditation aims at insight into the nature of phenomena by directly contemplating the bodily and mental processes as they occur on the successive moments of experienceThough there is a system which employs mindfulness as a direct means to the awakening of insight in the usual pattern serenity is cultivated first as a preliminary measure since the unification and purification of consciousness effected by concentration facilitate correct penetration of the nature of things through contemplative insightThis is the sequence utilized by the present sutta the stages from rapture through concentration covering the systematic development of serenity the two following stages the development of insightSerenity meditation is cultivated on the basis of a single object selected from a standard set of objects reserved exclusively for the development of concentrationThese objects traditionally numbered at forty include the colored and elemental circles called kasinas the cemetery contemplations the recollections of the three refuge objects meditation on the sublime abodes of love and compassion mindfulness of breathing etcAfter taking up one of these objects as his field of work the yogin strives to unify his mind by fixing his attention on his object to the exclusion of all sense data concepts thoughts memories projections fantasies and associative thinkingHis aim is to make his mind onepointed and this forbids at once its dispersal among a multiplicity of concernsSuccess in the practice depends on the harmonization of the mental faculties in the work of concentrationThrough mindfulness the yogin bears the object in his field of awareness and prevents it from slipping away through discernment he maintains a cautious watch upon the mind noting its tendencies to stray and swiftly correcting them and through energy he strives to dispel the impediments to mental unification and to maintain his awareness at a pitch which is simultaneously taut but relaxedThe impediments to meditation are classified into a group of five factors called the five hindrancesThese are sensual desire illwill stiffness and torpor restlessness and regret and doubtThe Buddha calls these five hindrances corruptions of the mind and weakeners of wisdom He says they are conducive to pain blindness and ignorance and compares them respectively to a debt a disease imprisonment slavery and the dangers of a desert journeyTheir removal by unremitting exertion is the first task facing the meditatorAs he proceeds in his practice striving with patience and diligence there come suddenly momentary breaks in the course of his efforts when the hindrances fall away the flow of inner verbalization stops and the mind abides onepointedly on the objectThe achievement of this momentary concentration brief as it is gives immense satisfactionIt is a powerful experience unleashing spurts of mental energy which flood up to the surface of consciousness and inundate the mind with waves of joyous refreshmentIt brings an elating thrill bordering on ecstasy crowning the yogins previous endeavors and inspiring further effortThis experience marks the arising of raptureThe distinguishing feature of rapture is a strong interest and delight directed to the object of attentionIts function is to give refreshment to the body and mindIt can assume both wholesome and unwholesome forms depending on whether it is motivated by attachment or detachment with respect to its object but on occasions of meditative consciousness it is always wholesomeThe commentaries distinguish five degrees of rapture which make their appearance in the successive stages of mental unificationMinor rapture the lowest on the scale is said to be able to raise the hairs of the bodyMomentary rapture the next degree of development rushes through the body with an intensity likened to streaks of lightning flashing forth in the sky at different momentsShowering rapture the third degree breaks over the body again and again with considerable force like the waves on the seashore breaking upon the beachUplifting rapture is socalled because it is credited with the ability to cause the body to levitate and the Visuddhimagga cites several cases where this literally occursAnd pervading rapture the highest on the scale is said to completely fill the whole body as a huge inundation fills a rock cavernSince the commentary to our sutta defines joy the prior link in our sequence as weak rapture we may assume this to signify the delightful interest preceding the deliberate development of meditation that is in the stages when faith in the Dhamma was just acquired and the purification of moral discipline commencedThe five degrees of rapture presented here would then pertain exclusively to the rapture found in meditative consciousnessAnd since the last degree of rapture only gains ascendancy with the attainment of full absorption which does not come until later it seems that the degrees of rapture which are distinctive of the present stage of progress are the four beginning with minor rapture and reaching their peak with uplifting raptureRapture is the supporting condition for tranquillity While the appearance of rapture indicates a definite advance in the work of concentration its coarser modes still contain an element of exuberance which is in constant danger of slipping out of control and spilling over into unwholesome states of mind dominated by restlessness and agitationFor rapture involves an intense delight in the object coupled with an anticipation of even greater delight to comeThe experience of present delight can often be accompanied by an underlying worry that this pleasure will disappear while the expectation of further delight can stimulate a subtle grasping at the futureBoth states the anxiety and the grasping bring along an excitation inimical to the centering of the mind in onepointed calmFor this reason as the yogin progresses in his practice a point is reached where the ecstatic exultation sparked off by rapture becomes felt as an obstruction to the development of mental unification a corruption of the training which must be pacified and stilledRapture itself will remain as a factor of meditative development up to the third absorption but to permit further progress its detrimental tendencies have to be sublimatedThrough continued application to the practice rapture becomes more refined shedding the heated zest of its initial formsWith its refinement it increasingly evokes along with itself another quality called tranquillityTranquillity is characterized by the quieting down of mental disturbancesIt removes agitation and restlessness imparting to the mind a soothing calm comparable to the cool shade offered by a tree to travelers oppressed by the suns heatTranquillity operates in two cooccurrent forms tranquillity of body and tranquillity of mind where mind signifies the aggregate of consciousness and body not the physical organism but the group of consciousnessadjuncts included in the aggregates of feeling perception and mental formationsThence the arising of tranquillity results in the subsiding of disturbances throughout the full extent of the psychodynamic systemIt allays the propensity towards excitement soothes the innervations brought on by rapture and casts over the meditative endeavor a profound stillness paving the way for deeper states of concentration to followTranquillity further induces in both consciousness and its adjuncts the qualitative factors of lightness malleability wieldiness proficiency and rectitudeThese factors present to some extent in every wholesome state of consciousness perform the respective tasks of eliminating sluggishness rigidity unwieldiness disability and insincerityBy holding at bay these mental corruptions destructive to moral and spiritual progress they enhance the functional efficiency of the mind rendering it a more tractable instrument for application to the higher stages of the pathTranquillity is the supporting condition for happiness As the yogins psychosomatic system is brought to a state of tranquil composure a feeling of inner happiness or bliss unobtrusively present from the start gains in prominence until it emerges in its own right as a salient feature of the trainingThough closely associated with rapture happiness is not identical with the latter and can arise in its absenceRapture denotes a mental factor belonging to the fourth of the five aggregates into which Buddhism classifies the psychophysical organism namely the aggregate of mental formationsIt is a conative rather than affective phenomenon which fuses zestful interest with a sense of joyous delightHappiness on the other hand is a purely hedonic factor belonging to the second aggregate the aggregate of feelingsIt is pleasurable feeling here as the happiness conditioned by tranquillity the pleasure which springs up in meditation as disturbances subsideRapture is relatively coarse in quality and happiness subtleThence though rapture is always accompanied by happiness in the higher meditative attainment of the third jhana happiness can remain even after rapture has faded awayThe Atthasalini a commentary to the Abhidhammapitaka illustrates the difference between them with a vivid simile Maung Tin transThe Expositor VolI pp Despite the similes suggestion rapture and happiness are not necessarily asynchronous and are in fact only sundered with the attainment of the third jhanaThe presentation of happiness as arising subsequent to rapture only means that happiness becomes the salient feature of the path after rapture has already made its own distinctive contribution and settled back to a subsidiary placeIn the present stage rapture still persists only its exuberance has now been toned down by the prevailing quiescence developed in the stage of tranquillityThe subcommentary to the Upanisa Sutta explains sukha as the happiness of the access to absorptionThe term access denotes the stage in the cultivation of serenity immediately preceding full absorption the intended goal of serenity meditationAccess is characterized by the abandonment of the five hindrances and the arising of the counterpart sign the selfluminous object of interior perception which is the focal point for the higher stages of concentrationThe abandoning of the hindrances began already with the gain of faith which conferred a serene lucency suspending their turbulence and each ascending rung along the path marked their attenuation to a further degreeSince the hindrances are the principal obstructions to both serenity and insight the early stages of the path are primarily concerned with their debilitation and eliminationThe elimination of the hindrances prior to attaining access is brought about by means of two methods one specifically directed to each hindrance separately the other applicable to all at onceThe former is to be employed when a particular hindrance obtrudes itself with persistent force the latter on other occasions when no one hindrance seems especially conspicuousThe specific method involves the reversing of the causal situation out of which the hindrance developsSince each defiling factor is a conditioned phenomenon coming into existence through distinct causes the key to its elimination lies in applying the appropriate antidote to its causal baseThus sensual desire arises on account of unskillful attention to the attractive features of things to alluring objects and physical bodiesIt is attenuated by considering the impermanence of the objects of attachment and by reflecting on the repulsive nature underlying the attractive appearance of the bodies which arouse desireIllwill or anger also springs up from unskillful attention in this case to the unpleasant aspects of persons and things it is reversed by developing loving kindness towards disagreeable people and patience in the face of unfavorable circumstancesStiffness and torpor become prominent by submitting to moods of sloth and drowsiness they are dispelled by the arousal of energyRestlessness and regret arise from attending to disturbing thoughts and are eliminated by directing the mind to an object conducive to inner peaceAnd doubt grounded upon unclarity with regard to fundamental points of doctrine is dispelled by clear thinking and precise analysis of the issues shrouded in obscurityIn contrast to these techniques which counter the hindrances separately the practice of concentration on one of the prescribed objects of serenity meditation inhibits them all simultaneouslyThough only affective so long as no particular hindrance impedes the meditative progress this method drawing upon the power of mental unification is capable of bringing tremendous force to bear upon the struggle against their supremacySince the latent defilements can crop up into the open only so long as the mind is driven by discursive thinking the unification of the mind upon a single object closes off the portal through which they emergeAs the mind descends to increasingly deeper levels of concentration the hindrances are gradually made to subside until with the attainment of access their suppression becomes completeHeld at bay in the base of the mental continuum the latent defilements are no longer capable of rising to the surface of consciousnessFor as long as the suppressive force of concentration prevails their activity is suspended and the mind remains secure in its onepointed stabilization safe from their disruptive influenceThis abandonment of the hindrances through the power of suppression brings a feeling of profound relief accompanied by a blissful effusion born from the newly accomplished purificationThe Buddha compares the happiness of abandoning the hindrances to the happiness a man would experience if he were unexpectedly freed from debt cured of a serious illness released from prison set free from slavery or led to safety at the end of a desert journeyHappiness is the supporting condition for concentration The attainment of access signals a major breakthrough which spurs on further exertionAs a result of such exertion the bliss generated in the access stage is made to expand and to suffuse the mind so completely that the subtlest barriers to inner unification disappearAlong with their disappearance the mind passes beyond the stage of access and enters into absorption or full concentrationConcentration itself denotes a mental factor present in both the attainments of access and absorptionIts salient feature is the wholesome unification of the mind on a single object and it brings about a harmonization between consciousness and its concomitants to a degree sufficient to free them from the distraction vacillation and unsteadiness characterizing their normal operationsThe mind in concentration fixed firmly on its object is like the flame of a candle shielded from the wind or the surface of a lake on which all the waves and ripples have been stilledHowever although both access and absorption partake of the nature of concentration an important difference still separates them justifying the restriction of the term full concentration to absorption aloneThis difference consists in the relative strength in the two attainments of certain mental concomitants called the factors of absorption or jhana factors  namely applied thought sustained thought rapture happiness and mental onepointednessThese factors aroused at the very beginning of serenity meditation and gradually cultivated through the course of its progress have the dual function of inhibiting the hindrances and unifying the mind on its objectAccording to the commentaries the factors are aligned with the hindrances in a direct onetoone relation of opposition such that each jhana factor has the specific task of countering and occluding one hindranceThus applied thought counteracts stiffness and torpor sustained thought doubt rapture illwill happiness restlessness and regret and onepointedness sensual desireAt the same time the factors exercise a consolidating function with respect to the object applied thought directing the mind to the object sustained thought anchoring it there rapture creating an interest in it happiness experiencing its affective quality and onepointedness focusing the mind on the objectIn the access attainment the jhana factors are strong enough to keep the hindrances suppressed but not yet strong enough to place the mind in absorptionThey still stand in need of maturationMaturation comes as a result of continued practice which gives them the power to lift the mind beyond the threshold plane of access and plunge it into the object with the unshakable force of full absorptionIn the state of absorption the mind fixes upon its object with such a high intensity of concentration that subjective discriminations between the two no longer occurThe waves of discursive thinking have at last subsided and the mind abides without straying even the least from its base of stabilizationNevertheless even full concentration admits of degreesAt the plane of absorption concentration is divided into four levels called the four jhanasThese are distinguished by the aggregation of factors present in each attainment the order of the four being determined by the successive elimination of the comparatively coarser factorsIn the first jhana all five jhana factors are present in the second applied and sustained thought are eliminated in the third rapture is made to fade away and in the fourth the feeling of happiness is replaced by equanimity the peaceful feelingtone which veers neither toward pleasure nor toward painOnepointedness remains present in all four jhanas the one constant in the seriesTo rise from the first jhana to the second the yogin after emerging from the first jhana must reflect upon the coarseness of applied and sustained thought and the first jhanas inadequacy due to the proximity of the hindrancesThen he must consider the second jhana as more peaceful and sublime arouse the aspiration to attain it and exert his energy to achieve a stronger degree of mental unificationSimilarly to rise from the second to the third jhana he must repeat the same procedure taking rapture as the coarse factor needing to be eliminated and to rise from the third to the fourth jhana he must reflect on the coarseness of happiness and the superiority of neutral equanimous feelingBeyond the fourth jhana lie four even subtler stages of concentration called the four formless attainmentsIn these attainments the luminous counterpart sign serving as the object of the jhanas is replaced by four successively more refined formless objects which give their names to their respective attainments  the base of infinite space the base of infinite consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neither perception nor nonperceptionAt the peak of this scale of meditative equipoise consciousness arrives at a point of unification so fine that like the geometric point it eludes detection and its presence can be neither affirmed nor deniedConcentration is the supporting condition for the knowledge and vision of things as they really are Despite the loftiness and sublimity of these exalted attainments immersion in deep concentration is not the end of the Buddhist pathThe unification of consciousness effected by serenity meditation is only a means to a further stage of practiceThis stage ushered in by the next link in the series the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is the development of insightThrough his deep concentration the yogin is able to suppress the defilements to bring them to a state of quiescence where they no longer invade the active processes of thoughtBut beneath the surface stillness the defilements lie latent ready to spring up again if provokedAs long as the defilements remain present even if only in dormant form release from suffering has yet to be achieved for the latencies of the defilements lying quietly in the mental continuum can still regenerate the samsaric round of continued birth and deathThe latent tendencies are the seeds of renewed existence which bring about a rearising of the stream of consciousness and thence of all the remaining links in the samsaric chainTo end the round and attain deliverance the defilements must be completely destroyed it is not enough merely to suppress themThe destruction of the defilements cannot be brought about by concentration alone for concentration even at its deepest levels can only effect the suspension of their activity not their eradicationTo destroy the defilements down to their bottommost stratum of latency something more is needed  pañña the wisdom which penetrates the true mark of phenomenaConcentration gains its place in the Buddhist discipline in so far as it induces the mental onepointedness of at least the access level required as the support for wisdomThus the Buddha enjoins his disciples to develop concentration not as an end in itself but because one who is concentrated understands things as they really are Only a mind which has been rendered pure and calm can comprehend things in accordance with actuality and the discipline of concentration by suppressing the hindrances engenders the required purity and calmThe actual work however of extricating the defilements is performed exclusively by wisdomWisdom is the one thing needed to cut off the defilements because the most fundamental of all the mental depravities is ignoranceIgnorance is the kingpost upon which all the other defilements converge and the lynchpin which holds them all in placeWhile it remains the others remain and for the others to be destroyed it must be destroyedDoctrinally defined as nescience with regard to the four noble truths ignorance signifies not so much the lack of specific pieces of information as a basic noncomprehension regarding the true nature of things as expressed in the four truthsSince the eradication of the defilements depends upon the eradication of ignorance the one factor capable of abolishing the defilements is the factor capable of abolishing their fundamental root and that is the direct antithesis of ignorance  wisdom or the knowledge and vision of things as they really are For this reason at the beginning of our sutta the Buddha proclaims The destruction of the cankers is for one who knows and sees I say not for one who does not know and does not see The defilements epitomized in the cankers are only destroyed for one who overcomes ignorance by the wisdom which knows and sees things as they areThe compound expression knowledge and vision indicates that the kind of knowledge to be developed is not mere conceptual understanding but knowledge which in its directness and immediacy is akin to visual perceptionConceptual understanding is often needed to clear away the intellectual obstructions to a correct perspective but it must eventually yield to the light of direct experienceTo achieve this experiential understanding it is necessary to enter upon the practice of the second system of Buddhist meditation the development of insightThe practice of insight meditation aims at dislodging the defilements by eradicating the ignorance at their baseIgnorance is overcome by generating through mindful observation a direct insight into things as they really areThe material upon which insight works is precisely the sphere where ignorance is concealed our own psychophysical experienceIts method is the application of mindfulness or discerning awareness to this sphere without interruption and in all activitiesIn the discourse the Buddha states that what must be known and seen as they are is the five aggregates  their nature their arising and their passing awayThe five aggregates  material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  are the basic categories structuring the Buddhas analysis of experienceEach experiential occasion from the Buddhist perspective is a complex process involving a number of factors functioning in unisonTo normal nonanalytical consciousness this unified complex appears as a uniform mass a false appearance which when accepted at face value leads to the assumption of a simple solid self as the permanent subject of cognitionThe assumption of permanent selfhood Buddhism holds to be the basic conceptual error dominating our mental horizonIt is the outermost shell of egoistic projection shielding the preconceptual ignorance and thus the first of the ten fetters to be broken along the path to liberationTo dispel the illusion of independent selfhood the experiential process must be submitted to searching scrutiny which rectifies the false perceptions contributing to its formationThe first phase in this examination is the dissection of the cognitive fabric into the distinct threads entering into its makeupThese threads or components are the five aggregatesThe aggregate of material form covers the physical side of experience comprising both external material objects and the body together with its sense facultiesThe other four aggregates constitute the mental side of experienceFeeling is the affective quality of pleasure or pain or the neutral tone of neither pleasure nor pain present on any occasion of mental activityPerception is the selective faculty which singles out the objects distinctive marks as a basis for recognitionThe formations aggregate is a comprehensive category incorporating all mental factors other than feeling and perception its most conspicuous member is volitionAnd consciousness is the faculty of cognition itself which sustains and coordinates all the other factors in the task of apprehending the objectThese five aggregates function in complete autonomy entirely through their reciprocal support without need for a selfsubsistent unifying principle to be identified as a self or subjectIn order to develop the knowledge and vision of things as they really are with respect to the aggregates the yogin must first emerge from his state of deep concentration for the analytical faculty  silenced in the folds of serenity  has to be brought into play to effect the required dissectionWith his mind made clear and pliant as a result of concentration the yogin attends to the diverse phenomena coming into range of his awarenessThe phenomena are attended to as they become manifest to determine their salient characteristics then on this basis they are assigned to their appropriate place among the aggregatesWhatever is physical belongs to the aggregate of material form whatever registers affective tone is feeling whatever notices the objects marks is perception whatever wills is a mental formation and whatever cognizes is consciousnessThe aggregates may further be grouped into a simpler scheme by placing material form on one side and the four mental aggregates on the other the two being coupled as mentalitymaterialityThey are then correlated with their causes and conditions to expose their dependently arisen natureThe analytic procedure generates the realization that experience is just a double stream of material and mental events without a subsisting selfThe synthetic procedure makes it clear that all these events are conditioned phenomena which arise when their conditions are present and cease when their conditions disappearThis last realization becomes the portal to the next major stage in the development of understanding the contemplation of rise and fallAs the yogin attends to the states that appear he sees how each undergoes the same process of coming into being altering and passing away Such is the arising of material form feeling perception formations and consciousnessSuch is the passing away of material form feeling perception formations and consciousness The contemplation of rise and fall brings into focus three marks common to all conditioned phenomena  their impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessnessImpermanence is generally the first characteristic to be discerned as it becomes clear through the immediate attention given to rise and fallThe perception of impermanence leads directly to insight into the other marks which follow naturally from the firstThe notion of happiness or pleasure at the level of philosophical understanding rather than mere feeling hinges upon an implicit notion of permanenceIf something is to be truly a source of happiness it must be permanentWhat is impermanent is incapable of yielding lasting happiness and security and therefore turns out under examination to be really unsatisfactory a potential source of sufferingThe notion of selfhood in turn rests upon the two pillars of permanence and pleasureWhat is impermanent and unsatisfactory cannot be identified as a self for it lacks any solid unchanging core upon which the notion of selfhood can be groundedThus the impermanent unsatisfactory phenomena comprised in the five aggregates turn out to have a third characteristic the aspect of selflessnessThe realization of these three characteristics  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessness  through unmediated insight is the knowledge and vision of things as they really areThe knowledge and vision of things as they really are is the supporting condition for disenchantment As the yogin contemplates the rise and fall of the five aggregates his attention becomes riveted to the final phase of the process their dissolution and passing awayThis insight into the instability of the aggregates at the same time reveals their basic unreliabilityFar from being the ground of satisfaction we unreflectively take them to be conditioned things are seen to be fraught with peril when adhered to with craving and wrong viewsThe growing realization of this fundamental insecurity brings a marked transformation in the minds orientation towards conditioned existenceWhereas previously the mind was drawn to the world by the lure of promised gratification now with the exposure of the underlying danger it draws away in the direction of a disengagementThis inward turning away from the procession of formations is called nibbidaThough some times translated disgust or aversion the term suggests not emotional repugnance but a conscious act of detachment resulting from a profound noetic discoveryNibbida signifies in short the serene dignified withdrawal from phenomena which supervenes when the illusion of their permanence pleasure and selfhood has been shattered by the light of correct knowledge and vision of things as they areThe commentaries explain nibbida as powerful insight an explanation consonant with the words literal meaning of finding out It indicates the sequel to the discoveries unveiled by that contemplative process the minds appropriate response to the realizations thrust upon it by the growing experiences of insightBuddhaghosa compares it to the revulsion a man would feel who having grabbed bold of a snake in the belief it was a fish would look at it closely and suddenly realize he was holding a snakeAs our rendering implies disenchantment marks the dissipation of an enchantment or fascination with the kaleidoscopic pleasures of conditioned existence whether in the form of sense enjoyments emotions or ideasThis fascination resting upon the distorted apprehension of things as permanent pleasurable and self is maintained at a deep unverbalized level by the hope of finding self identity in the conditionedAs the enchanted mind presses forward seeking explicit confirmation of the innate sense of selfhood everything encountered is evaluated in terms of the notions mine I and my self the principal appropriative and identificatory devices with which the inherent sense of personal selfhood worksThese three notions imputed to phenomena on account of ignorance are in actuality conceptual fabrications woven by craving conceit and speculation respectivelyThe insight into impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessness cuts the ground out from underneath this threefold fabrication reversing the mode in which phenomena can be viewedWhereas before the development of insight the aggregates were regarded as being mine I and self now when illuminated with the light of insight knowledge they are seen in the opposite way as notmine not I and not self Since the fascination with phenomenal existence is sustained by the assumption of underlying selfhood the dispelling of this illusion through the penetration of the three marks brings about a deidentification with the aggregates and an end to their spell of enchantmentIn place of the fascination and attraction a profound experience of estrangement sets in engendered by the perception of selfessness in all conditioned beingThe suttas present this sequence thusMaterial form monks is impermanent suffering and nonselfFeeling perception mental formations and consciousness are impermanent suffering and notselfWhat is impermanent suffering and nonself that should be seen with correct wisdom as it really is This is not mine this am I not this is not my self So seeing the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with material form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with mental formations and disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchantment is the supporting condition for dispassion In the trail of disenchantment there arises a deep yearning for deliverance from the round of samsaric becomingPreviously prior to the arrival at correct knowledge and vision the mind moved freely under the control of the impulses of delight and attachmentBut now with the growth of insight and the consequent disenchantment with conditioned existence these impulses yield to a strong detachment and evolving capacity for renunciationWhatever tends to provoke grasping and adherence is immediately abandoned whatever tends to create new involvement is left behindThe old urges towards outer extension and accumulation give way to a new urge towards relinquishment as the one clearly perceived way to releaseEvery motion of the will becomes subordinated to the newly ascendant desire for liberation Just as a fish in a net a frog in a snakes jaws a jungle fowl shut into a cage  just as these are desirous of being delivered of finding an escape from these things so too this meditators mind is desirous of being delivered from the whole field of formations and escaping from itThe desire for deliverance leads to a quickening of insightThe capacity for comprehension picks up new speed depth and precisionLike a sword the mind of insightwisdom cuts through the net of illusions fabricated on account of ignorance like a light it illuminates phenomena exactly as they areAs the power of insight mounts driven by the longing for liberation a point is eventually reached where a fundamental turnabout takes place in the seat of consciousness effecting a radical restructuring of the mental lifeThe beamlike radiance of insight expands into the full luminosity of enlightenment and the mind descends upon the supramundane path leading directly and irreversibly to final deliveranceThis transformation signified by viraga or dispassion is the first strictly supramundane stage in the progression of transcendental dependent arisingThe earlier links in the sequence leading up to dispassion are all technically classified as mundaneThough loosely called transcendental in the sense that they are directed to the unconditioned they are still mundane in terms of their scope since they operate entirely within range of the conditioned worldTheir objects of concern are still the five aggregates or things derivative upon themBut with the attainment of dispassion consciousness passes clear beyond the mundane level and for a fleeting moment realizes as its object the unconditioned state nibbanaThe shift in standpoint comes about as the immediate consequence of the preceding stages of developmentThrough insight into the three marks the basic distortions covering over the true nature of phenomena were exposed with the uncovering of their true nature there set in a disengagement from phenomenaThis disengagement led to an attitude of relinquishment and a fading out of desireNow having released its grip on the conditioned the mind turns to the unconditioned the deathless element focusing upon it as the only state fully adequate to itselfWhatever is there of material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  he beholds these phenomena as impermanent suffering as a disease a boil a dart a misfortune an affliction as alien as decomposing as empty as selflessHe turns his mind away from these phenomena and when he has turned his mind away from them he focuses his mind on the deathless element thinking This is the peaceful this is the sublime that is the stilling of all formations the relinquishing of the foundations the destruction of craving dispassion cessation nibbanaThough the realization of the unconditioned requires a turning away from the conditioned it must be emphasized that this realization is achieved precisely through the understanding of the conditionedNibbana cannot be reached by backing off from a direct confrontation with samsara to lose oneself in a blissful oblivion to the worldThe path to liberation is a path of understanding of comprehension and transcendence not of escapism or emotional selfindulgenceNibbana can only be attained by turning ones gaze towards samsara and scrutinizing it in all its starknessThis principle  that the understanding of the conditioned is the way to the unconditioned  holds true not only in the general sense that an understanding of suffering is the spur to the quest for enlightenment but in a deeper more philosophical sense as wellThe path to nibbana lies through the understanding of samsara for the reason that the experiential realization of the unconditioned emerges from a prior penetration of the fundamental nature of the conditioned without which it is impossibleThe states of mind which realize nibbana are called liberations and these liberations are threefold according to the particular aspect of nibbana they fix upon  the signless the wishless and emptinessThe signless liberation focuses upon nibbana as devoid of the signs determinative of a conditioned formation the wishless liberation as free from the hankering of desire and the emptiness liberation as devoid of a self or of any kind of substantial identityNow these three liberations are each entered by a distinct gateway or door called the three doors to liberationThese three doors signify precisely the contemplations of the three universal marks of the conditioned  impermanence suffering and selflessnessInsight into each mark is a different door leading into the realization of the unconditionedThe profound contemplation of impermanence is called the door to the signless liberation since comprehension of impermanence strips away the sign of formations exposing the markless reality of the imperishable to the view of the contemplative visionThe contemplation of suffering is called the door to the wishless liberation since understanding of the suffering inherent in all formations dries up the desire that reaches out for themAnd deep contemplation of selflessness is called the door to the emptiness liberation since it exposes the voidness of substantial identity in all phenomena and hence the unviability of the selfnotion in relation to the unconditionedIn each close the understanding of the conditioned and the realization of the unconditioned are found to lock together in direct connection so that by penetrating the conditioned to its very bottom and most universal features the yogin passes through the door leading out of the conditioned to the supreme security of the unconditionedThe supramundane consciousness that realizes nibbana directly penetrates the four noble truths illuminating them all at once with startling clarity Just O monks as a man in the gloom and darkness of the night at the sudden flashing up of lightning should with his eyes recognize the objects just so the monk sees according to reality This is suffering this is the origin of suffering this is the cessation of suffering this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering The penetration of the truths simultaneously performs four functions one with respect to each truthIt fully understands the first noble truth the truth of suffering since by taking nibbana as its object it acquires a perspective from which it can directly see that in contrast to the unconditioned every thing impermanent defiled and conditioned is marked with sufferingIt abandons the second noble truth the truth of the origin since it eradicates the craving and defilements which originate suffering so that they can never arise againIt realizes the third noble truth the truth of cessation by apprehending nibbana in which all the suffering of samsara is permanently cut offAnd it develops the path the fourth noble truth since at the moment of penetration the eight mental factors comprised in the noble eightfold path concurrently arise performing the task of realizationRight view sees the unconditioned right thought directs the mind upon it right speech right action and right livelihood eradicate their opposites right effort invigorates the mind right mindfulness fixes attention on the unconditioned and right concentration unifies the mind in absorption on the unconditionedThe ancients compare the minds ability to perform this fourfold function to the burning of a lampJust as a lamp simultaneously burns the wick dispels the darkness creates light and uses up the oil so the supramundane knowledge simultaneously understands suffering abandons craving realizes nibbana and develops the pathThe breakthrough to the unconditioned comes in four distinct stages called the four supramundane pathsEach momentary pathexperience eradicates a determinate group of defilements ranked in degrees of coarseness and subtlety so that the first path eliminates the coarsest defilements and the fourth path the most subtleThe defilements cut off by the paths are generally classified as ten fetters receiving this designation because they fetter sentient beings to samsaraWith the first path the yogin eradicates the first three fetters  personality view doubt and misapprehension of rules and observancesThereby he becomes a streamenterer one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma and is bound for final deliverance in a maximum of seven more lives passed in the human or heavenly worldsThe second path weakens all the remaining fetters to the point where they no longer arise frequently or obsessively but cuts off none completely with its attainment the yogin advances to the stage of a oncereturner one who is due to return to the sense sphere world only one more timeBy eliminating sensual desire and aversion by means of the third path he attains the state of a nonreturner no longer bound to the sense sphere but heading for rebirth in a pure divine abode where he will reach the final goalThe fourth path cuts off the remaining five fetters  desire for existence in the fine material and immaterial planes conceit restlessness and ignoranceWith its attainment the yogin becomes an arahant who has destroyed all the defilements and reached the state of perfect purificationDispassion is the supporting condition for emancipation Each of the supramundane pathmoments is immediately followed by several moments of a different kind of supramundane experience called fruitionFruition marks the enjoyment of the realized degree of release effected by the paths work of eradicating defilementsWhereas the attainment of the path is an extremely intense exhilarating experience requiring the expenditure of a tremendous quantum of energy the attainment of fruition is characterized by its peacefulness relaxedness and blissful quiescenceIf the pathattainment be illustrated by a captives sudden bursting of the chains that hold him in captivity fruition may be compared to his savoring the taste of freedom that lies beyond the captive stateThe completion of the fourth path and fruition results in full emancipation With the destruction of the cankers he directly realizes for himself enters and abides in that emancipation of mind emancipation of wisdom which is cankerless The subtlest and most tenacious fetters have been broken and there is nothing now that makes for further bondageHaving destroyed the mental corruptions at their basic level of latency the yogin has completed his taskThere is nothing more to do and nothing to add to what has been doneHe abides in the living experience of deliveranceThe emancipation realized by the arahant has a twofold aspectOne aspect is the emancipation from ignorance and defilements experienced during the course of his lifetime the other the emancipation from repeated existence attained with his passing awayThrough his complete penetration of the four noble truths the arahant has eradicated ignorance and released his mind from the grip of the passionsThe fading away of the passions issues in a stainless purity called emancipation of mind the fading away of ignorance issues in a radiant awareness called emancipation of wisdomThe mind of the arahant is at once impeccably pure through the absence of attachment and radiantly bright through the luminosity of wisdomEndowed with this emancipation of mind and of wisdom he can move and act in the world without being soiled by the mire of the worldHe chooses thinks decides and wills free from the compulsion of egoistic habitsThe grasping of I and mine has ceased the inclination to conceit can no more obsess himHaving seen the egoless nature of all phenomena he has cut through the tangle of egoistic constructs and become a sage who is at peaceSince he has destroyed the defilements whatever disturbances might assail a person on their account no longer assail himEven though sublime and striking sense objects come into range of his perception they cannot overwhelm his mind His mind remains untouched steadfast unshakable beholding the impermanency of everything In the arahant greed hatred and delusion the unwholesome roots which underlie all evil have been totally abandonedThey are not merely suppressed but withered up down to the level of their latencies so that they are no longer able to spring up again in the futureThis destruction of greed hatred and delusion is called the nibbana realizable during lifetime it is nibbana visible here and nowIn so far as the monk has realized the complete extinction of greed hatred and delusion in so far is nibbana realizable immediate inviting attractive and comprehensible to the wise Because in this attainment the five aggregates continue to function sustained by bodily vitality it is also called the nibbana element with a residue remainingBut though for the arahant disturbances due to the defilements do not arise he is still subject to a measure of disturbance conditioned by the body with its six sense facultiesThough he cannot be overcome by greed and aversion he still experiences pleasure and pain though he cannot generate kamma binding to samsara he must still choose and act within the limits set by his circumstancesSuch experience however is for the arahant purely residualIt is merely the playing out of his stored up kamma from the past which can still fructify and call forth responses so long as the body acquired through prior craving standsBut because craving has now been inwardly exhausted there lies ahead for him no renewal of the round of birth and deathAll feelings being experienced with detachment not being delighted in will become coolThey arouse no new craving provoke no new expectations lead to no new accumulations of kamma they merely continue on devoid of fecundity until the end of the life spanWith the breakup of the body at his passing away the arahant makes an end to the beginningless process of becomingThis is the second stage of his emancipation  emancipation from renewed existence from future birth aging and death The sage who is at peace is not born does not age does not die does not tremble does not yearnFor him there does not exist that on account of which he might be bornNot being born how can he ageNot aging how can he die Because with the emancipation from continued existence no residue of the aggregates persists this attainment is called the nibbana element without residue remainingEmancipation is the supporting condition for the knowledge of destruction Following each of the four paths and fruits there arises a retrospective cognition or reviewing knowledge which reviews the defilements that have been abandoned by the particular path and the defilements remaining to be eliminatedIn the case of the last path and fruition the path and fruition of arahatship the reviewing knowledge ascertains that all defilements have been eradicated and that there are none left to be destroyedThis knowledge certifying the abandonment of the defilements arises immediately after the mind has been liberated from their grip by the full penetration of the four noble truthsAs the text indicates this cognizance of the minds liberation is direct and personal without dependence on othersJust as a keen sighted man can look into a pool of clear limpid water and see for himself the shells pebbles gravel and shoals of fishThe liberated person can look into himself and see that his mind has been set free from the cankersThe retrospective cognition of release involves two acts of ascertainmentThe first called the knowledge of destruction ascertains that all defilements have been abandoned at the root the second the knowledge of nonarising ascertains that no defilement can ever arise againThe two together are also called the knowledge and vision of emancipation the use of the word vision again underscoring the perceptual immediacy of the cognition by which the mind verifies its own release from the defilementsBy possessing this knowledge one who has destroyed the defilements not only experiences the freedom that results from their destruction but acquires as well an inner certitude with respect to their destructionIf a liberated individual only enjoyed liberation from the defilements without also enjoying indubitable knowledge that he is liberated his attainment would always be haunted by an inner suspicion that perhaps after all some area of vulnerability remainsEven though no defilement ever came to manifestation the shadow of uncertainty would itself mar the attainments claim to completenessHowever because the attainment of arahatship automatically generates a retrospective cognition ascertaining the final abandonment of all defilements there is no room for such a suspicion to ariseLike a deer in a remote forest far from the reach of hunters the one who has crossed over attachment to the world walks in confidence stands in confidence sits down in confidence and sleeps in confidenceHe is out of reach of the defilements and knows he is out of their reachThough the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers is not always set up in the arahants awareness it is permanently available to him and awaits only his advertence to make itself presentSince the cankers have been eradicated whenever the arahant looks into his mind he can see at once that they have been cut offThe suttas illustrate this with a bold simileThe arahant understands that the defilements he has eradicated brought bondage to the round of existenceHe sees them as defiling conducive to renewed existence afflictive resulting in suffering leading to future birth aging and death Thence by witnessing their utter eradication in himself he gains certainty of his emancipation from the round Unshakable is my emancipationThis is my last birthThere is now no renewal of existence Such knowledge remains an inalienable part of the arahants spiritual inheritanceIt is the basis for his assurance of immunity from future becomingBy reason of this knowledge he sounds the lions roar with which he seals his triumph over the cycle of repeated births Destroyed is birth lived is the holy life the task has been completed there is no returning to this stateThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe course of spiritual training taught by the Buddha is a double process of selftransformation and selftranscendence issuing in complete emancipation from sufferingThe process of selftransformation involves the elimination of unwholesome mental dispositions and their replacement by pure dispositions conducing to the benefit of oneself and others the process of selftranscendence focuses on the abandoning of egocentric notions by seeing with direct insight the essenceless nature of the bodily and mental processes we normally take to be I and mine When this double process is brought to its culmination suffering is extinguished for with the awakening of wisdom the basic root of suffering  craving backed by blinding ignorance  falls away never to rise againBecause the unwholesome tendencies and selfish clinging spring from seeds buried deep in the bottommost strata of the mind to eradicate these sources of affliction and nurture the growth of the liberating vision of reality the Buddha presents his teaching in the form of a gradual trainingBuddhist discipline involves gradual practice and gradual attainmentIt does not burst into completeness at a stroke but like a tree or any other living organism it unfolds organically as a sequence of stages in which each stage rests upon its predecessor as its indispensable foundation and gives rise to its successor as its natural consequentThe principal stages of this gradual training are three the training in sila or virtue the training in samadhi or concentration and the training in pañña or wisdomIf we follow through the comparison of the Buddhist discipline to a tree faith would be the seed for it is faith that provides the initial impulse through which the training is taken up and faith again that nourishes the training through every phase of its developmentVirtue would be the roots for it is virtue that gives grounding to our spiritual endeavors just as the roots give grounding to a treeConcentration would be the trunk the symbol of strength nonvacillation and stabilityAnd wisdom would be the branches which yield the flowers of enlightenment and the fruits of deliveranceThe vigour of the spiritual life like the vigour of a tree depends upon healthy rootsJust as a tree with weak and shallow roots cannot flourish but will grow up stunted withered and barren so a spiritual life devoid of strong roots will also have a stunted growth incapable of bearing fruitTo attempt to scale the higher stages of the path it is essential at the outset to nourish the proper roots of the path otherwise the result will be frustration disillusionment and perhaps even dangerThe roots of the path are the constituents of sila the factors of moral virtueThese are the basis for meditation the ground for all wisdom and higher achievementTo say that sila is the precondition for success however does not mean as is too often believed in conservative Buddhist circles that one cannot begin to meditate until ones sila is perfectSuch a stipulation would make it almost impossible to start meditation since it is the mindfulness concentration and wisdom of the meditative process that bring about the gradual purification of virtueBut to say that virtue is the basis of practice does mean that the capacity for achievement in meditation hinges upon the purity of our silaIf our roots of virtue are weak our meditation will likewise be weakIf our actions repeatedly clash with the basic principles of right conduct our attempts to control the mind in the discipline of meditation will turn into a selfdefeating enterprise since the springs of our conduct will be the same defiled states of mind the meditation is intended to eliminateOnly when we secure our cultivation upon the foundation of blameless principles of right action can the inward endeavor of meditation prosper and issue in successWith true principles of conduct as the base the roots of virtue will give birth to the trunk of concentration the concentrated mind shoot forth the branches of wisdom and the branches of wisdom yield the flowers and fruits of enlightenment culminating in total freedom from bondageTherefore just as a skillful gardener brings a sapling to growth by first tending to the roots so the earnest seeker of enlightenment should begin his cultivation by tending to the roots of his practice  that is to his sila or moral virtueThe Pali word sila originally meant simply conductBut in the context of the Buddhist spiritual training the term is used to signify only a specific kind of conduct ie good conduct and by an extension of meaning the type of character for which such conduct stands ie good characterHence sila means both moral conduct a body of habits governed by moral principles and moral virtue the interior quality the regular observance of these principles is intended to produceBoth shades of meaning are essential to understand the place of sila in the spectrum of Buddhist disciplineSila in the former sense consists in the nontransgression through body or speech of the basic precepts regulating the moral lifeIt is moral discipline in deed and word beginning as the inhibition of immoral impulses seeking an outlet through body and speech and developing into the habitual conformation to the principles of righteous conductBut the full range of sila is not exhausted by mere outward behavioral control for the term has in addition a deeper more psychological significanceIn this second sense sila is moral purity the inner purification of character which results from a life consistently moulded upon moral principlesThis aspect of sila places the stress on the subjective motivational side of actionIt looks not towards the outward act itself but towards the rectitude of mind from which good conduct springsUpon inspection sila thus reveals itself to be a two dimensional quality it contains an external dimension consisting in purification of conduct and an internal dimension consisting in purification of characterHowever in the Teaching of the Buddha these two dimensions of experience the internal and the external are not torn apart and consigned to separate selfsufficient domainsThey are recognized rather to be two facets of a single whole complementary poles of a unified field which mirror one another implicate one another and penetrate one another with their own respective potentialities of influenceActions performed by body and speech are not from the Buddhist standpoint so many detachable appendages of a distinct spiritual essence but concrete revelations of the states of mind which stand behind them as their activating sourceAnd states of mind in turn do not remain closed up in a purely mental isolation but spill forth according to the play of circumstances from the fountain of consciousness where they arise through the channels of body speech and thought out into the world of interpersonally significant eventsFrom the action we can infer the state of mind and from the state of mind we can predict the probable course of actionThe relationship between the two is as integral as that between a musical score and its orchestrated performance on the concert stageBecause of this mutual dependence of the two domains moral conduct and purity of character lock up with one another in a subtle and complex interrelationshipThe fulfillment of the purification of virtue requires that both aspects of sila be realized on the one side behavior of body and speech must be brought into accord with the moral ideal on the other the mental disposition must be cleansed of its corruptions until it is impeccably pureThe former without the latter is insufficient the latter without the former is impossibleBetween the two the internal aspect is the more important from the standpoint of spiritual development since bodily and verbal deeds acquire ethical significance primarily as expressions of a corresponding disposition of mindIn the sequence of spiritual training however it is moral discipline that comes firstFor at the beginning of training purification of character stands as an ideal which must be reached it is not a reality with which one can startAccording to the Buddhist principle of conditionality the actualization of any given state is only possible through the actualization of its appropriate conditions and this applies as much to the achievement of the various stages of the training as to the bare phenomena of matter and mindSince beginningless time the consciousnesscontinuum has been corrupted by the unwholesome roots of greed hatred and delusion it is these defilements which have functioned as the source for the greatest number of our thoughts the ground for our habits and the springs for our actions and general orientation towards other people and the world as a wholeTo uproot these defiling afflictions at a single stroke and reach the peak of spiritual perfection by a mere act of will is a wellnear impossible taskA realistic system of spiritual training must work with the raw material of human nature it cannot rest content merely with postulated paragons of human excellence or demands for achievement without showing the method by which such demands can be realizedThe Buddha rests his teaching upon the thesis that with the right method we have the capacity to change and transform ourselvesWe are not doomed to be for ever burdened by the weight of accumulated tendencies but through our own effort we can cast off all these tendencies and attain a condition of complete purity and freedomWhen given the proper means in the context of right understanding we can bring about radical alterations in the workings of consciousness and mould a new shape out of the seemingly immutable stuff of our own mindsThe first step on this path is the purification of character and the efficient means for the restructuring of character the Buddha provides in the observance of sila as a set of precepts regulating bodily and verbal conductSila as moral discipline in other words becomes the means for inducing sila as moral virtueThe effectiveness of this measure stems from the reciprocal interlocking of the internal and external spheres of experience already referred toBecause the inner and outer domains are mutually implicated the one can become the means for producing deep and lasting changes in the otherJust as a state of mind expresses itself outwardly in an action  in deed or speech  so too the avoidance and performance of certain actions can recoil upon the mind and alter the basic disposition of the mental lifeIf mental states dominated by greed and hatred can engender deeds of killing stealing lying etc then the abstinence on principle from killing stealing and lying can engender a mental disposition towards kindliness contentment honesty and truthfulnessThus although sila as moral purity may not be the starting point of spiritual training conformity to righteous standards of conduct can make it an attainable endThe medium which bridges the two dimensions of sila facilitating the translation of outward behavior into inner purity is volition or cetanaVolition is a mental factor common to every occasion of experience a universal concomitant of every act of consciousnessIt is the factor which makes experience teleological ie oriented to a goal since its specific function is to direct its associated factors towards the attainment of a particular endAll action the Buddha teaches is in essence volition for the act itself is from the ultimate standpoint a manifestation of volition through one of the three doors of action  body speech or mind It is volition bhikkhus that I call actionFor having willed one performs an action through body speech or mindVolition determines an action as being of a definite sort and thence imparts to action its moral significanceBut since volition is invariably present in every state of consciousness it is in its own nature without ethical distinctivenessVolition acquires its distinctive ethical quality from certain other mental factors known as roots in association with which it always arises on occasions of active experienceRoots are of two morally determinate kinds unwholesome and wholesomeThe unwholesome roots are greed hatred and delusion the wholesome roots are nongreed nonhatred and nondelusionThese latter though expressed negatively signify not merely the absence of the defiling factors but the presence of positive moral qualities as well generosity lovingkindness and wisdom respectivelyWhen volition is driven by the unwholesome roots of greed hatred and delusion it breaks out through the doors of the body and speech in the form of evil deeds  as killing stealing and fornication as lying slander harsh speech and gossipIn this way the inner world of mental defilement darkens the outer world of spatiotemporal extensionBut the defiled trend of volitional movement though strong is not irrevocableUnwholesome volition can be supplanted by wholesome volition and thence the entire disposition of the mental life made subject to a reversal at its foundationThis redirecting of volition is initiated by voluntarily undertaking the observance of principles of conduct belonging to a righteous order  by willing to abstain from evil and to practice the goodThen when volition tending to break out as evil action is restrained and replaced by volition of the opposite kind by the will to behave virtuously in word and deed a process of reversal will have been started which if followed through can produce farreaching alterations in the moral tone of characterFor acts of volition do not spend their full force in their immediate exercise but rebound upon the mental current which gave birth to them reorienting that current in the direction towards which they point as their own immanent tendency the unwholesome volitions towards moral depravation and the wholesome volitions towards moral purificationEach time therefore an unwholesome volition is supplanted by its wholesome opposite the will to the good is strengthenedA process of factor substitution built upon the law that incompatible mental qualities cannot be simultaneously present on a single occasion of experience then completes the transformation through the efficacity of the associated rootsJust as unwholesome volitions invariably arise in association with the unwholesome roots  with greed hatred and delusion  so do wholesome volitions inevitably bring along with them as their concomitants the wholesome roots of nongreed nonhatred and nondelusionSince opposite qualities cannot coexist the replacement of unwholesome volition by wholesome volition at the same time means the transposition of the unwholesome and the wholesome rootsContinually called into play by the surge of volition the wholesome roots perfume the mental stream with the qualities for which they stand  with generosity lovingkindness and wisdom and these as they gather cumulative force come to prominence as regular propensities of the personality eclipsing the inclination towards the unwholesomeIn this way the exercise of wholesome volitions on repeated and varied occasions effects a transformation of character from its initial moral susceptibility to a pitch of purity where even the temptation to evil remains at a safe removeThough volition or cetana is the primary instrument of change the will in itself is indeterminate and requires specific guidelines to direct its energy towards the actualization of the goodA mere good will from the Buddhist standpoint is altogether inadequate for despite the nobility of the intention as long as the intelligence of the agent is clouded with the dust of delusion the possibility always lies open that laudable motives might express themselves in foolish or even destructive courses of actionThis has been the case often enough in the past and still stands as the perennial bugbear of the ethical generalistAccording to the Buddhist outlook goodness of will must be translated into concrete courses of actionIt must be regulated by specific principles of right conduct principles which though flexible in their application possess normative validity independently of any historical culture or existing scheme of values entirely by virtue of their relation to a universal law of moral retribution and their place in the timeless path of practice leading to deliverance from suffering and the samsaric roundTo guide the will in its aspiration for the good the Buddha has prescribed in definite and lucid terms the factors of moral training which must be fulfilled to safeguard progress along the path to enlightenmentThese factors are comprised in the three items which make up the aggregate of virtue in the Noble Eightfold Path namely right speech right action and right livelihoodRight speech is the avoidance of all harmful forms of speech  the abstinence from falsehood slander harsh speech and idle chatterThe speech of the aspirant must be constantly truthful conducive to harmony gentle and meaningfulRight action applies a brake upon unwholesome bodily action by prescribing abstinence from the destruction of life from stealing and from sexual misconduct the latter means incelibacy in the case of monks and adultery and other illicit relations in the case of householdersThe behavior of the aspirant must always be compassionate honest and pureAnd right livelihood requires the avoidance of trades which inflict harm and suffering upon other living beings such as dealing in meat slaves weapons poisons and intoxicantsAvoiding such harmful trades the noble disciple earns his living by a peaceful and righteous occupationThe training factors embedded in these components of the Noble Eightfold Path simultaneously inhibit the base ignoble and destructive impulses of the human mind and promote the performance of whatever is noble and pureThough worded negatively in terms of the types of conduct they are intended to shut out they are positive in effect for when adopted as guidelines to action they stimulate the growth of healthy mental attitudes which come to expression as beneficient courses of conductIntensively these training rules reach into the recesses of the mind blunt the force of unwholesome volition and redirect the will to the attainment of the goodExtensively they reach into the commotion of mans social existence and arrest the tide of competition exploitation grasping violence and warIn their psychological dimension they confer mental health in their social dimension they promote peace in their spiritual dimension they serve as the irreplaceable foundation for all higher progress along the path to emancipationRegularly undertaken and put into practice they check all mental states rooted in greed hatred and delusion promote actions rooted in nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion and lead to a life of charity love and wisdomFrom this it will be seen that from the Buddhist point of view formulated rules of conduct are not superfluous accessories to a good will but necessary guidelines to right actionThey are an essential part of the training and when implemented by the force of volition become a fundamental means to purificationEspecially in the context of the practice of meditation the training precepts prevent the eruption of defiled actions destructive to the purpose of the meditative disciplineBy following carefully the prescribed rules of conduct we can rest assured that we are avoiding at least the coarser expressions of greed hatred and delusion and that we will not have to face the obstacle of guilt anxiety and restlessness that comes in the trail of regular moral transgressionsIf we return to our earlier comparison of the Buddhist discipline to a tree and take virtue to be the roots then the principles of right conduct become the soil in which the roots growJust as the soil contains the nutritive essences required for the tree to sprout and flourish so do the precepts contain the nutriment of purity and virtue required for the growth of the spiritual lifeThe precepts embody the natural conduct of the arahant or perfected saintFor the arahant his conduct flows outward as the spontaneous expression of his innate purityBy his very nature all his deeds are flawless free from blemishHe cannot follow any course of action motivated by desire ill will delusion or fear  not through any forced conformity to rules but by the very law of his beingThe worldling however is not immune from the possibility of immoral conductTo the contrary because the unwholesome roots remain firmly planted in the makeup of his mind he is constantly prone to the temptation to moral transgressionHe is liable to kill steal commit adultery lie drink etc and in the absence of any sound moral code prohibiting such actions he will often succumb to these liabilitiesHence the necessity of providing him with a set of ethical principles built upon the pillars of wisdom and compassion by which he can regulate his actions and conform to the natural spontaneous behavior of the Liberated OneA precept is therefore from the Buddhist perspective much more than a prohibition imposed upon conduct from withoutEach precept is a tangible expression of a corresponding attitude of mind a principle which clothes in the form of concrete action a beam of the light of inward purityThe precepts render visible the invisible state of purificationThey make it accessible to us by refracting it through the media of body and speech into specific rules of conduct we can apply as guides to action when we find ourselves in the diverse situations they are designed to coverBy bringing our conduct into harmony with the precepts we can nourish the root of our spiritual endeavors our virtueAnd when virtue is made secure the succeeding stages of the path unfold spontaneously through the law of the spiritual life culminating at the crest in the perfection of knowledge and the serene azure of deliveranceAs the Master saysFor one who is free from remorse no deliberate volition need be exerted Let gladness arise in me This is the natural law bhikkhus that gladness arises in one free from remorseFor one who is gladdened no deliberate volition need be exerted Let rapture arise in me This is the natural law bhikkhus that rapture arises in one who is gladdenedFor one filled with rapture no deliberate volition need be exerted Let my body become tranquil This is the natural law bhikkhus that for one filled with rapture the body becomes tranquilFor one tranquil in body no deliberate volition need be exerted May I experience bliss This is the natural law bhikkhus that one tranquil in body experiences blissFor one who is blissful no deliberate volition need be exerted Let my mind become concentrated This is the natural law bhikkhus that for one who is blissful the mind becomes concentratedFor one who is concentrated no deliberate volition need be exerted May I know and see things as they really are This is the natural law bhikkhus that one who is concentrated knows and sees things as they really areFor one knowing and seeing things as they really are no deliberate volition need be exerted May I become disenchanted and dispassionate This is the natural law bhikkhus that one knowing and seeing things as they really are becomes disenchanted and dispassionateFor one who has become disenchanted and dispassionate no deliberate volition need be exerted May I realize the knowledge and vision of deliverance This is the natural law bhikkhus that one who is disenchanted and dispassionate realizes the knowledge and vision of deliveranceThus bhikkhus one stage flows into the succeeding stage one stage comes to fulfillment in the succeeding stage for crossing over from the hither shore to the beyondAnguttara NikayaAs we cast our gaze out upon the landscape of animate nature it does not take long before our attention is struck by the tremendous diversity of forms the animate order displaysThe folds of natures lap we find teem with a multitude of living beings as staggering in their range of specific differentiation as in the sheer impression of their quantitative forceBefore our eyes countless varieties of creatures  insects and reptiles fish and birds mammals domestic and wild  turn the earth With its seas and skies into a complex metropolis throbbing with the pulse of sentient lifeBut realms of being beyond sight  vouched for by spiritual cosmology folklore and the reports of seers  are no less crowded and no less diversified in their compositionAccording to this testimony gods Brahmas angels and demons populate boroughs of the city of life invisible to fleshly eyes while other creatures such as fairies ghosts and goblins fill up unfamiliar pockets of the same boroughThe human world again is itself far from homogeneousThe family of man breaks down into a great diversity of types  into people black white brown yellow and red dividing still further according to their fortunes and faculties into the longlived and the shortlived the healthy and the sickly the successful and the failures the gifted and the deprivedSome people are intelligent others are dullwitted some are noble others ignoble some are spiritually evolved others spiritually destituteHuman beings range all the way from mental retards who can manage their bodily needs only with great difficulty to sages and saints who can comprehend the deepest secrets of the universe and lift the moral outlook of their less acute brothers and sisters to heights undreamed of in the common stream of thoughtTo the thinker who would dig below the surface presentations and discover the reasons for the manifest phenomena the question naturally arises why life exhibits itself in such variegated apparelReflection upon this question has given birth to a multitude of schools of thought religious and philosophical each offering its own speculations as the key to unravel the riddle of natures kaleidoscopic designIn the intellectual history of humanity the two dominant positions around which these schools cluster are theism and materialismPitted against one another by their antithetical tenets the two have come down in different guises from ancient times even to the presentTheism refers the diversity of sentient life including the disparities of fortune evident in the human world to the will of GodIt is God the theist holds the omnipotent omniscient author of the universe who creates through the fiat of his will the variety of natural forms allots to beings their respective shares of happiness and suffering and divides people into the high and the low the fortunate and the miserableMaterialism in contradistinction rules out any recourse to an extraterrestrial agency to account for the differentiation in the faculties and capacities found amongst living beings and attempts to provide in its place a system of explanation which works exclusively with naturalistic principles pertaining to the material orderThe entire gamut of living forms together with all lifes modes of expression the materialist claims can be effectively reduced in the end to the adventures of matter governed by physical chemical and biological lawsEven consciousness represents for the materialist only a secondary superstructure built upon a material base devoid of any larger significance in itselfIt is not our present purpose here to examine at length these two rival doctrinesLet it suffice to note that both in different ways throw into jeopardy the postulate of a progressive spiritual evolution of beings by withholding implicitly or explicitly the necessary condition for such a course of evolution  namely an inwardly autonomous will which finds in the diversity of the sentient order the field for the working out of its own potentialities for growth and transformation in accordance with laws governing freely chosen possibilities of actionTheism withholds this condition by its basic postulate of an omnipotent deity directing the entire field of nature from aboveIf all of nature runs its course in obedience to divine command then the individual will which belongs to the natural order must be subject to the same divine supervision as the rest of animate natureThe autonomy of the individual will and its direct impact on the sentient sphere are excluded and with them also goes the thesis of a genuine longterm spiritual growth to which they are essentialMaterialism likewise shuts out the notion of a progressive spiritual evolution of beings but more simply and directly by explicitly denying the basic presupposition of such a notionThe wills claim to freedom is here rejected its autonomy usurped by the irresistible pressure of the determinative influences at its baseConsciousness becomes a mere byproduct of material processes the individual lifestream leaves no impact on any continuous current of experience enduring beyond the graveBoth conscious action and evolution in the biotic sphere proceed in the grip of the same play of cosmic forces  blind brute and insentient in their fundamental mode of operationBuddhism also offers an explanation for the diversity of the sentient order an explanation which bridges the gap between volition and the diversity and thus opens up the prospect for longterm spiritual developmentAccording to Buddhism the explanation for the variegation of sentient beings  in their kinds faculties and fortunes  lies in their kamma that is their volitional actionBeings are in the words of the Buddha heirs of their action They spring forth from their store of accumulated action as a matrix out of which they are fashioned inheriting the results proper to their deeds even across the gulf of lifetimes
