No venerable here means internal venerables the venerable qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha within the mindWhen we meditate were handing our minds over to these venerable qualitiesTheyre qualities that are kind and considerateThey wont abuse us or cause anyone any harmThis is why we can wholeheartedly entrust our valuables  our mind  to themFor example when we meditate buddho buddho we have to be sincere to these qualitiesWe really have to think about themWe dont just think about them in jestThinking in jest means that we think without really being intentWe have to be really intent on keeping buddho with the mind and the mind with buddho each and every time we breathe in and outThis is what it means to be sincere in our thinkingIts the kind of thinking that serves a purposeThe purpose here is to develop something of real and abundant essence within ourselves  to create results that will be lastingThings that dont serve any real purpose are those giving results that dont lastWhen we talk about lasting results for example when you sit here and meditate youll find that the results will continue appearing even after you dieBut if you arent really meditating if you let your mind think about other things youll find that the results will vanish at death because the things you think about arent certain or sureTheyre not lastingTheyll have to change deteriorate and end up disappearing and dying in the same way that you willWhen we make ourselves quiet and still  when we put the mind into concentration  its as if were charging our batteryOnce our battery is charged we can put it to use whenever we wantWhen our battery is fully charged  full of discernment  we can use it for any sort of purpose at allWe can hook it up to a wire and use it to cook our food or light our homeIf we simply charge it without connecting it up to anything the current will stay there cool in the battery without causing danger of any sort like the current in a flashlight cellIf a battery is just sitting there we can touch it with our hands and see that it feels cool not the least bit hot  and yet theres still the fire of electricity in thereIf we need light or want to cook our food all we have to do is hook up a wire and turn on the switch and the electricity will come out of the battery to achieve whatever aims we have in mindOur battery is the mind in concentrationIf we hook up the wire of ardency to roast our defilements the power of our current or discernment will burn them to ashesAs when we cook food to get rid of its rawness the food will be saved from going spoiled and will benefit the bodyIn the same way people who have discernment within themselves can eliminate all the defilements that present a danger and cause suffering to the body and mindThis is why were taught to develop concentration so as to accumulate the discernment that will benefit us both in this present lifetime and on into the nextWhen you sit and meditate keep observing two important factors  the body which is where the mind dwells and  the mind which is the factor responsible for good and evilThe mind is a factor thats extremely fickle and fastIt likes to slip off looking for all sorts of nonsense for things that bring us nothing but troubleIt doesnt like to stay in placeNow it goes running here now it goes running there bringing back different kinds of sufferingThats why we say that its fickle and fast easily diverted hard to look afterNow since our mind is so fickle and fast the Buddha had to search for a method by which we can take this weak point and turn it around into something goodHe teaches us to develop concentration by focusing on the bodyIn other words he has us fix our attention on one of the really important factors of the body the breathThe breath is what helps us find comfort and ease in all the parts of the bodyIts what keeps the body aliveAll of our sense doors  the eyes the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mind  depend on the breath to create the sensations by which they receive impressions of outside things and bring them in to have an effect on the bodyFor instance the function of the eyes is to receive impressions of forms for us to seeThe function of the ears is to receive impressions of sounds for us to hearThe function of the nose is to receive impressions of aromas for us to smellThe function of the tongue is to receive impressions of flavors for us to tasteThe function of the body is to receive impressions of tactile sensations for us to touchThe function of the mind is to receive impressions of the various things that come in via these other five sensesSo when we meditate we have to close all of these sense doors off tightWe close our eyes we dont have to look at pretty sights or ugly onesWe close our ears so that we dont listen to anything that isnt necessary  ie anything that isnt beneficial to listen toOnly the words that advise us to do good should we listen toAs for the nose its necessary for lifeIf we dont have the nose as our breathing passage we start having problems in the other parts of the body so we keep it openAs for the mouth we keep it closedAnd as for the body we keep it in one position as when we sit with our legs crossed like were doing right nowWe have to try to keep these sense doors closed off so that we dont use our eyes ears nose tongue body or mind in any other activity aside from practicing concentrationWe herd the mind into one preoccupation so that it stays in its home the body with the windows and doors all shutThe mind is the heartproperty or heartelementThe nature of the mind is that its faster than the wind in the air which flows to and fro up and down and never stays in placeSo we have to bring our mindfulness into the mind so that we can take this weak point and turn it around into something goodThis is called bhavana or mental development through meditationWe focus on the breath and recollect the qualities of the BuddhaWhen we start off recollecting the Buddha in this way we simply think of the word buddhoWe dont yet have to analyze what it meansBuddho is a name for mindfulnessIt means being aware being awakeBut if we simply think of the word buddho it doesnt fulfill all the factors for mental development through meditationWhen we think the word we have to steady and adjust it so that it stays in rhythm with the breathWhen we breathe we have to breathe just right not too slow not too fast whatever feels naturalThen we think buddho back and forth with the breath adjusting our thinking so that it merges with the breathingThats when we can say that were fulfilling the factors of meditationThis is called recollection of the Buddha in which we think of the qualities of the Buddha in an abbreviated way depending on the breath as our focal point and keeping our mindfulness in charge of the thinkingWhen mindfulness becomes one with the breath and with our awareness in this way our various senses will grow even and calmThe mind will gradually grow more and more quiet bit by bitThis is called getting established in the first guardian meditation  recollection of the Buddha  in which we use our thinking as a path of practiceThis kind of thinking gives results for Buddhists of all sortsAt the same time it brings us into the factors that are helpful for the mind  mindfulness and alertness  the factors that support the mind in getting established in goodnessThe second guardian meditation is good willThe word good will  metta  comes from mitta or friendAs a quality it means love benevolence familiarity intimacyWhen we imbue our mind with good will we escape from animosity and hostilityIn other words we should remind ourselves that were going to stay with our friend at all timesWe wont go wandering offWe wont leave our friend in a lurchOur friend here is the body because the body and mind have to depend on each other at all timesThe body has to depend on the mindThe mind has to depend on the bodyWhen people are friends they have to love each other wish each other well stick with each other be intent on helping each other at all timesThey dont abandon each otherSo tell yourself that when the body breathes in youre going to stick with the breathIn Pali the breath is called kayasankhara or bodily fabrication because its what fixes the body to keep it aliveIts like the cook who fixes food in a home so that the people in the family can eat their fill and be happyIf theres something wrong with the cook then theres going to be turmoil and chaos in the houseIf the cook of the body  the breath  gets weird everyone else in the body  the properties of earth water wind and fire  will all have to suffer and get thrown into a turmoil as wellSo we can say that the breath is the property that looks after all the properties in the bodyFor example we inhale the breath into the lungsThere it cleanses the blood in the lungs which gets sent to the heartThe function of the heart is to send the blood out to nourish all the parts of the body so that the blood and the breath energy flow normallyIf the breath isnt as good as it should be the lungs wont be as good as they should beThe heart wont be good the blood it pumps out wont be good so all the various parts of the body will have to suffer as a resultThis is when the properties of the body are said to be defiledIf the mind really has good will for the body then it has to look after the breath in the body to keep it functioning properlySo we have to keep after our cook to make sure that she isnt filthy lazy or apatheticOtherwise shell put poison in our food to kill us or filth in our food to make us sickSo we have to make sure that our cook is clean and pure in her habits as when we breathe the qualities of the Buddha in with the breathThe breath accompanied by buddho is called the sukka breath or the clean clear breathWhen the master of the house is clean and circumspect like this the cook will have to be clean and circumspect tooAll the employees in the house will have to be cleanIn other words when were mindful the breath that goes into the body will be a pure breathWhen it reaches the heart it will cleanse the blood in the heart so that its pure as wellWhen the heart pumps this pure blood sending it to nourish the body the body will be purified tooAnd then the mind will have to feel wellIn other words the heart is good the nourishment in the blood is goodWhen the mind is in good shape like this the blood wont become abnormalAnd when this good blood is sent to nourish the nerves throughout the body the body will have to function wellIt wont feel tired or achingThis is because weve adjusted our breath well so that we can treat all kinds of diseases and painsWhen the purity of the breath spreads throughout every blood vessel the bad things already there in the body will have to scatterThose that havent yet appeared wont be able to appearThis will help the body to be balanced and normalWhen the breath is in good shape and the heart is in good shape then the fire property in the body wont be too strongIf the breath isnt right or if its too hot then the fire property gets thrown out of balanceWhen it grows too hot the blood thickens and gets stuck in the capillaries making us sleepy or giving us a headacheIf it grows too cold it gives us the shivers or makes us feverishSo the breath is more important than any of the other the properties in the bodyIt assists the fire property which in turn distills the liquid propertyThe liquid property in the body falls into two sorts the part that hardens and turns into earth and the part that stays liquid by its natureWhen the breath functions properly all the other properties function properly and the body will feel rested and at easeThis is called showing good will for yourselfThe mind sticks with the breath the breath sticks with the body the body sticks with the mindThey dont abandon one anotherTheyre affectionate intimate harmonious  theyre good friendsWhen people stay together they become intimate and familiar with one anotherIf they dont stay with one another they cant become familiar with one anotherAnd when theyre not on familiar terms they dont really know one anotherWhen people are friends and on familiar terms they trust one anotherThey tell one another their secretsThey dont hide whats going onIn the same way when we become close friends with the body and on familiar terms were going to learn all the bodys secretsFor instance we may learn what kamma in the past led to the birth of the body the way it is  what our previous lifetimes were like what good and bad things we did that led to the bodys being like this or thatWell learn how the four properties of the body functionWell learn how things arise and pass away at the properties of the eye ear nose tongue body and intellectWell get to know the secrets of the various affairs connected with the body because it will have to reveal its true nature to us in every way  just as when we open the cover on a serving dish enabling us to see whats there in the dishWhen we come to know how things function in the body this way thats called vijja or clear knowingThis sort of clear knowing arises from the stillness of the mindWhen the body and mind are both quiet together they give knowledge to each otherJust as with people if were friendly with them theyre bound to be friendly with usIf were antagonistic with them theyre bound to be antagonistic with usIn the same way when the body is friendly with the mind the mind is bound to be friendly with the bodyIn other words it can help the various parts of the bodyIt can help make the body act in line with its thoughtsIf for instance theres a feeling of pain or weariness we can gather the power of the mind at full strength to think of the feeling going away and that feeling of pain or weariness may completely vanish simply through the power of a single mental momentPeople who have helped each other in the past have to help each other all the timeIf we can help them theyre bound to be able to help usThe ability to do this comes from the power of the mind thats capable of giving orders in line with its aspirationsWhen we can make our friend good through the power of our thought then all our friends can become goodFor example when we think of purifying the breath the breath will help improve the fire propertyThe fire property will help improve the liquid propertyThe liquid property will help improve the earth propertyWhen all the properties help one another in this way they become balanced and a help to the body so that the body can be healthyAs for the mind it grows cool and calmAnyone who comes near will pick up some of that calmness as wellJust like a mountain cool in its depths whoever walks past will be cooled as well even though the mountain didnt make a point of splashing water on them to cool them offHere weve been speaking about the bodyAs for the mind when its pure it gives even greater resultsWhen we think using the power of the pure mind the currents go faster than lightning through the sky and they can go all around the worldIf anyone wants to come and harm us they cant get near because the current of a pure strong mind has the power to ward off all kinds of dangerTake the Buddha as an example No one could kill himPeople who thought of killing him as soon as they got near him saw him as their loving fatherThose who were subject to the current of the Buddhas purity let go of their evil habits and turned into good people they let go of their violence and viciousness becoming gentle and mildAngulimala for instance If he hadnt been willing to listen to the Buddha he would have been swallowed up by the earthBut he was able to think The Buddha wont kill meI wont kill anyone He immediately put down his weapons gave up killing once and for all ordained and became one of the Buddhas noble disciplesSo in the same way we should think of the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha with every inandout breathWhen we stay within the territory of the Dhamma in this way its as if we were having an audience with the Buddha himselfEven though  when we keep thinking of the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  we keep going over the same old territory over and over again whats wrong with thatActually when we use our powers of directed thought and evaluation back and forth this way the results we end up with are positive a sense of fullness that spreads throughout every part of the bodyThe mind will feel full and brightThe heart will feel blossoming established in the sense of fullness or rapture that comes with thoughts of good willWhen the heart is full in this way its at ease just as when weve eaten our fill of foodAnd when the heart is full its friend the body is sure to feel full and rested as wellWell be at our ease both in body and in mind just as when we see our children and grandchildren wellfed and sleeping soundlyThis is called pleasureAnd when we see that something gives pleasure to our children and grandchildren we have to focus our efforts on it continuallyThis is how the mind reaches singleness of preoccupation entering into a state of peace free from every sort of disturbance and dangerWhen you sit and meditate tell yourself that your body is like your homeWhen you repeat the word buddho in with the breath its like inviting a monk into your homeWhen people invite a monk into their home what do they do in order to qualify as having good manners They have to prepare a place for him to sit down They provide him with good food or drinking water They have to converse with himWhen we meditate preparing a place to sit down means thinking bud in with the inbreath and dho out with the outIf were mindful to think in this way the word buddho will always stay snug with the breathWhenever our thinking slips away from the breath its as if we put a rip in the seat were preparing for our guestAnd dont forget that before you prepare a seat you first have to sweep the place cleanIn other words when you first start out you should breathe in long and deep and then let the breath come all the way out two or three timesThen you gradually allow the breath to grow lighter bit by bit until its just enough for you to follow comfortablyDont let it grow any weaker or stay any stronger than just rightThen you start combining buddho with the inandout breathWhen you do this your visiting monk will come into your homeNow make sure that you stay with himDont go running off anywhere elseIf your mind runs off to hang around with external concepts of past or future its as if youve run away from the monk youve invited into your home  which is really bad mannersOnce the monk has sat down in the seat youve prepared for him you have to give him some good food or water and then find good things to converse with himThe good food here is the food of intentions the food of sensory contact and the food of consciousnessThe food of intentions stands for the way you adjust the breath so as to make it comfortable both for the body and for the mindFor instance youre observant to see which kind of breathing is good for the body and which kind is badWhat kind of inbreathing feels easyWhat kind of outbreathing feels easyDoes it feel good to breathe in fast and out fastHow about in slow and out slowYou have to experiment and then taste the food youve preparedThis is one kind of food for the mindThis is why being intent to stay with the breath is called the food of intentionWhen you adjust the breath to the point where it feels comfortable and in good order itll give rise to a sense of fullness and easeThats when you can say that youve provided your visiting monk with good nourishing foodWhen hes finished his meal hes going to chant blessings for the sake of your wellbeing and happiness so that youll be free from pain and sufferingOr as the saying goes the power of the Buddha gets rid of sufferingIn other words when youve adjusted the breath properly the pains in the body will disappearEven though there may be some that dont disappear they dont impinge on the mindAs for pain and suffering in the heart that will all disappearThe mind will cool downWhen it cools down itll be at its ease  quiet blooming and brightAnd as for the saying the power of the Dhamma gets rid of dangers the various forms of Mara coming to disturb the body such as the pains of the aggregates will all vanishThe mind will be free from dangers and animositiesAnd as for the saying the power of the Sangha gets rid of disease all the various diseases in the mind  sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair  will disappearThis way once youve invited this monk into your home and provided him with good food hes going to give you three kinds of blessing you escape from pain from danger and from diseaseThis is part of the blessing that your visiting monk will give youBut if when youve invited a monk into your home you go running off outside  in other words if you forget the breath or go hanging around with external thoughts  its really impolite and the monk is going to be put to difficultiesIts as if you had invited him into your home but had forgotten to prepare his mealSo if you arent really intent on the breath and dont really welcome your monk into your home you wont get this kind of blessingThe last part of inviting your monk into your home is to converse with himOnce hes eaten his fill you talk with himThis stands for the qualities of directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationYou connect all six types of breath energy in the body so that they all flow into one another  as when you put up a telephone lineIf the line stays in good shape you can hear what they say all over the worldBut if the line is cut you cant get word of what theyre saying even in Bangkok just down the roadSo when you keep your line in good shape you can hear anything being said anywhere at allWhen the mind stays in the first jhana this way its as if your visiting monk is talking with you and youre talking with himAnd the things youre talking about are all DhammaThis puts you in a good moodAs time passes you feel so good that you dont even want to eatThis is rapture the body feels fullAt the same time the mind is free from disturbances and so feels pleasureWherever you get a sense of pleasure you keep staying interested in that point this is singleness of preoccupationWhen you welcome your visiting monk in this way hes going to keep coming to visit youNo matter where you go hell be able to reach youEven if youre staying in the mountains or forest wilderness hell be able to give you whatever help you needOur goodness what can we do to make it really goodFor todays goodness I want each of us to set our minds on casting a Buddha within the mind to protect ourselves because Buddhas are things that are more sacred and numinous that any other object in the worldThey can protect us and help us survive all sorts of danger and sufferingAs were told in the Pali chant Sabbadukkha sabbabhaya sabbaroga vinassantu which means All sufferings all dangers all diseases can be destroyed through the power of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaWhoever has an inner Buddha is protected from all three major fearsThe first kind is the fear of suffering ie birth aging illness and deathThe Buddha isnt afraid of these things at all for he has warded them off in all their forms The various kinds of danger such as danger from criminals Whoever might try to come and steal his valuables the Buddha isnt the least bit afraid for his valuables arent the kind that anyone can stealThe danger of fire Dont mention house fires or being bombed by nuclear weaponsEven if the fires of the end of the aeon were to burn up the entire world he wouldnt be startled or fearfulThe danger of floods even if water were to flood from the earth up to the sky he wouldnt be concernedThe danger of famine drought and pestilence wouldnt make him suffer or put him to any hardshipThe various diseases that arise in the body dont cause him any fearJust look at the Buddha image in front of you What dangers is he afraid ofFrom whereNo matter what anyone does to him he just sits there perfectly still not afraid of anything at allThis is why we should cast a Buddha within ourselves so that we can wear it around our neck and protect ourselves from fear wherever we goNow when they cast a Buddha image what do they doThe first thing is to make a mold thats beautiful and wellproportionedThen they heat it until its hot through and throughThen they pour molten metal into the moldThen they let it coolWhen its thoroughly cooled they pull off the pieces of the mold leaving only the Buddha image but even then the image is still rough and unattractiveThey have to polish it until it gives off clear reflections or else paint it with lacquer and cover it with gold leafOnly then will they have a finished Buddha image in line with their aimsSo now that were casting a Buddha within ourselves we have to heat our mold before we can pour the metal into itPretend that the body here is your mold your mind is the expert craftsmanI want us all to set our minds on casting a Buddha within ourselvesWhos going to have the most beautiful Buddha will depend on how skillful and capable each craftsman is at smeltingHow do we heat our moldWe heat the mold by sitting in concentration your right leg on top of the left your hands placed palmup in your lap your right hand on top of your leftSit up straightDont lean forward or back or tilt to either sideIf the mold is offcenter your Buddha will have to be offcenter tooThe next step is to fix your mindfulness on the breath thinking bud with the inbreath and dho with the outStay focused exclusively on the breathYou dont have to think of anything else  just as if you were pumping air into your furnace to heat up the moldIf your mindfulness doesnt stay with the breath  if you forget or absentmindedly think of other things  its as if your air pump breaks downThe fire wont grow strong and the mold wont get heated throughIf the mold isnt heated through then when you pour your molten metal into it the mold will crack and the metal will leak out all over the placeSo you have to be careful that your mold doesnt crack and make sure that your air pump doesnt wear out eitherIn other words keep watch over your mindfulness so that it isnt absentminded or forgetfulNow lets talk about how you melt your metal  the bronze gold silver or whatever kind of metal youre going to use to cast your Buddha imageWhen they cast an image they have to melt the metal and remove all the specks and impurities leaving nothing but the metal in its pure formOnly then do they use it to cast the imageIn the same way we have to cut away from the heart all the concepts and preoccupations that act as HindrancesThe five Hindrances are like impurities mixed in with goldIf we dont melt them away or remove them from the heart our Buddha image wont turn out as perfect and powerful as wed likeItll be blemished and full of holesIf you were to put it on an altar it wouldnt look inspiringIf you were to give it away no one would want to receive itTherefore its necessary  crucial  that your expert craftsman be meticulous circumspect and not careless that he make a concerted effort to purify the metal hes usingIn other words you have to brush away all concepts of past and future leaving only the present the breathBe aware only of the breathWhen your mold is thoroughly heated your air pump is working well and your metal is pure and free from specks then the Buddha image youre casting will be beautiful to your satisfactionCasting a Buddha image within you means sitting in concentration giving rise to peace and calm in the mindWhen the mind is at peace the body is at peaceRapture  a sense of fullness in body and mind  will arise within youWhen rapture arises in full force it gives way to pleasureWhen theres a lot of pleasure the mind grows clear and brightThe brightness of the mind is the knowledge of liberating insightYou come to see the truth of the body that its simply the four properties of earth water fire and wind  not yours or anyone elsesIts inconstantStressfulThis gives rise to a sense of weariness and disenchantment so that you let go of the process of mental and physical fabrication seeing that theres no real substance to itYou can separate the body from the mindThe mind will then be free of its burden in having to haul the physical body aroundIt turns into a mind thats free light and at easeWhichever way you look is wide open  as if you were to remove the floors walls and roof of your home if you look down you see the groundIf you look up youll see the starsLook around in all four directions and youll see that theres nothing to obstruct your line of sightYou can see everything clearlyIf you look to the west youll see the noble truth of stressLook south and youll see the cause of stressLook east and youll see the cessation of stressLook north and youll see the pathIf you can see in this way youre said to be a full dollar ie worth four full quartersAnd if you get four full quarters many times over youll grow more and more valuable all the timeYoull turn into a rich person with lots of wealth  ie noble treasuresYoull be released from povertyWhoever has noble treasures is said to be a noble personNoble people are those who have seen the four noble truthsWhoever sees the four noble truths is said to see the Buddha withinThe Buddha likes to stay with people of that sort  and when the Buddha is staying with us well be blessed and wont fall into hardshipWell simply keep heading higher and higherThis is why we should all cast a Buddha within ourselves by practicing concentration whenever we have the opportunityAnother way of casting a Buddha within ourselves is to meditate constantly on the foulness of the body as when we chant Ayam kho me kayo this body of mineUddham padatala from the tip of our big toe up to the head  what is it likeAddho kesamatthaka from the crown of the head down to the big toe what is it likeTacapariyanto inside this burlap bag what valuables do we haveThe skin covering the body is like a burlap bag full of all kinds of things so lets see what fantastic valuables we have here in this bagStarting with the ribs heart liver lungs intestines food in the stomach and intestines blood gall lymph urineWhat kind of lovely valuables are these thingsIf you look carefully at your body youll see that what you have here is the four states of deprivation nothing wonderful at allThe first state of deprivation is the animal kingdom all the worms and germs that live in our stomach and intestines in our blood vessels and in our poresAs long as theres food for these things to eat in there theyre always going to be with us multiplying like crazy making us illOn the outside of the body there are fleas and liceThey like staying with those who dont keep themselves clean making their skin red and soreAs for the animals living in the blood vessels and pores they give us rashes and infectionsThe second state of deprivation is the kingdom of hungry ghosts ie the properties of earth water fire and wind in the bodyFirst they feel too cold then too warm then they feel ill then they want to eat this or thatWe have to keep pandering to them running around to find things for them to eat with never any chance to stop and restAnd they never have enough  like the hungry ghosts who starve after they die with no one to feed themThese properties keep pestering you and no matter what you do you can never please themFirst the food is too hot so you have to put ice in itThen its too cold so you have to put it back on the stoveAll of this comes down to an imbalance in the properties sometimes good sometimes bad never coming to a stable state of normalcy at all making us suffer in various waysThe third state of deprivation is the land of angry demonsSometimes when we get ill or lose our senses we run around naked without a stitch of clothing as if we were possessed by angry demonsSome people have to undergo operations getting this removed or cutting out that or sucking out this waving their arms and moaning in a way thats really pitifulSome people get so poor that they have nothing to eat they get so thin that they have nothing left but ribs and eyeballs suffering like the angry demons who cant see the brightness of the worldThe fourth state of deprivation is purgatoryPurgatory is the home of all the spirits with a lot of bad karma who have to suffer being roasted speared with redhot iron spikes and pierced with thornsAll the animals whose flesh weve eaten after theyve been killed and cooked gather together in our stomach and then disappear into our body in huge numbersIf you were to count them youd have whole coops of chickens herds of cattle and half a seas worth of fishOur stomach is such a tiny thing and yet no matter how much you eat you can never keep it fullAnd you have to feed it hot things too like the denizens of purgatory who have to live with fire and flameIf theres no fire they cant liveSo theres a big copper frying pan for themAll the various spirits weve eaten gather in the big copper frying pan of our stomach where theyre consumed by the fires of digestion and then they haunt us Their powers penetrate throughout our flesh and blood giving rise to passion aversion and delusion making us squirm as if we were burned by the fires of purgatory tooSo look at the bodyIs it really yoursWhere did it come fromWhose is itNo matter how much you care for it its not going to stay with youItll have to go back to where it came from the properties of earth water fire and windThe fact that its able to stay for a while depends entirely on the breathWhen theres no more breath to it it starts to decay and no one wants it thenYou wont be able to take it with you when you goTheres no one who can take his arms legs feet or hands along with himThis is why we say that the body is notselfIt belongs to the worldAs for the mind its the one that does good and evil and will be reborn in line with its karmaThe mind is what doesnt dieIts the one that experiences all pleasure and painSo when you realize this you should do as much good as you can for your own sakeThe Buddha felt compassion for us and taught us in this way but we dont feel much compassion for ourselvesWe prefer to fill ourselves with sufferingWhen other people teach us its no match for our teaching ourselves for other people will teach us only once in a whileThe possibility of being a common animal a human being a heavenly being or of entering nibbana all lie within us so we have to choose which one we wantThe good you do is what will go with you in the futureThis is why the Buddha taught us to meditate to contemplate the body to give rise to dispassionIts inconstant stressful and nothing of oursYou borrow it for a while and then have to return itThe body doesnt belong to the mind and the mind doesnt belong to the bodyTheyre separate things that depend on each otherWhen you can see this you have no more worries or attachmentsYou can let go of the body and three hunks of rust  selfidentity views attachments to precepts and practices and uncertainty in the Path  will fall away from your heartYoull see that all good and evil come from the heartIf the heart is pure thats the highest good in the worldWhen you meditate you have to be mindful of three things at onceIn other words as you breathe in and out three things  the breath the meditation word and the mind  have to stay together with every momentAt the same time alertness always has to be in chargeOnly then can you say that youre established in the factors of meditation lying at the essence of whats meritorious and skillfulMindfulness  heedfulness  counts as whats meritorious hereForgetfulness  heedlessness  counts as evilAlertness is what surveys the results of our activities  seeing what we do that gives good results what we do that gives bad  and then makes adjustmentsFor example if the breath isnt yet comfortable we move the mind to a new spot or change the way were breathingIts like changing the place where we sitIf where were sitting isnt comfortable we have to get up and find a new place to sit downOnce weve found a comfortable place to sit we have to keep it going as long as we canWe dont have to change seats any moreWhen mindfulness stays with the breath its called anapanasatiWhen its immersed in the body its called kayagatasatiWhen mindfulness stays with the body and mind at all times its called developing our meditation theme  as when we sit here meditating were doing our work ie our work on our meditation themeMindfulness is the causeIf we focus our attention on working with the mind well get lots of results on the level of the mindIf we focus on working with the body well get lots of results on the level of the bodyThe results that come from developing our meditation theme are we calm down the evil qualities of the mind and we calm down the physical properties of the bodyThe mind will be wide open and free like the ocean when its free of waves the wind is still the water smooth and the air is clearWhen this is the case we can see all kinds of far distant thingsThis way we get to know the affairs of the bodyOn the lowest level we come to know the body in the present we understand whats going on with the properties of earth water fire and wind both in their important parts and in their unimportant partsThe important parts are the ones that stay in the body the unimportant parts are the ones that come and go forming a bridge between the properties inside the body and those outsideIn terms of the wind property well see how many types of breath energy stay in the body and how many types of breath come in and outWell see which parts of the earth water fire and space properties stay in the body and which parts come and goThe same holds true with the property of consciousnessFor instance when our eyes dont see clearly whats wrong with the property of eyeconsciousnessWell be able to see all the ways in which it changes as well as all the changes in the properties of ear nose tongue body and intellectconsciousnessWell have mindfulness and alertness constantly in chargeMindfulness and alertness are like binoculars for seeing great distancesThe mind is like the binoculars ownerIf the properties in the body arent at normalcy if they arent smooth and calm then no matter how fantastic our binoculars we wont be able to see anythingFor example when the Buddha surveyed the beings of the world hed wait until the world was quiet and still  the last watch of the night before dawn when the minds of human beings were quiet still and asleepThats when hed use his special binoculars to survey all that was going on in the worldWhen the mind is calm its like an ocean thats calm the wind is still the boat isnt rocking the water is clear and the air wide openAs we keep training the mind it keeps getting more and more mature more tempered and sharp able to cut right through anything at allLike a knife that we always keep sharpening theres no way it cant become sharpSo we should keep at the practice in the same way we sharpen a knifeIf any part of the body or mind isnt in good shape we keep adjusting it until we get good resultsWhen good results arise well be in a state of Right ConcentrationThe mind will be firmly established in the present in a state of singleness of preoccupationWell gain power both in body and in mindPower in body means that wherever there are pains we can adjust the properties of earth water fire and wind to give rise to a sense of comfort in the same way we trim a treeIf any branches are broken or rotten we cut them away and graft on new branchesIf the new ones break we graft on more new onesWe keep doing this until the tree is healthy and strongWhen we work at the mind in this way the four bases for success arise in full strengthAnd as the Buddha said whoever develops the bases for success will live longIn other wordsviriya we stick with our work and dont get discouraged or give upcitta we focus our full attention on nothing but our workvimansa were circumspect in the mind circumspect in the causes and results of what were doingAll four of these qualities are bases or steps to the PathTheyre the cause for developing power in body and power in mind all the way to the knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations and on into nibbanaWhat Ive said so far is meant to give us all a sense of how to develop mindfulness and alertness as our own special binoculars for surveying events in terms of the world and of the DhammaSo you should train your mind to stay firm and upright in the factors of your meditation riding herd on it so that it will stay with the body in the presentRegardless of how much you can remember of what Ive said you should set your mind on practicing at all timesDont abandon the practice or do it in fits and starts for that will prevent you from reaching any kind of successThink of yourself as a supervisor constantly keeping an eye on the body and mindWhen you do this your workers  the properties of earth water fire and wind  wont dare shirk their jobs or be slack in their workEach will have to fulfill its responsibilities to the fullIn this way youll come to succeed in your work in every wayAt the same time once youve developed your special binoculars your eyesight will go further than that of ordinary peopleIn this way youll be able to keep yourself protected on all sidesYoull escape from dangers and meet with happiness and fulfillment in every wayThe currents of the heart are fast erratic and dont take on any shape that can appear to the eyeThe currents of sound and smell can be measured in terms of numbers  etc but the currents of the mind cant be measured at allAnd its the nature of fast things that they be subtle as wellThats why the currents of the mind are impossible for anyone whos not really interested in researching them to seeSome people even maintain that there is no mind in any individual that all we have is a body like treesWhen we die theres nothing left nothing to take rebirthTheres only the properties of earth water wind and fireIts the nature of really fastmoving things that we cant see them  what they are what their shape or characteristics areFor example when we ride in a car or a boat passing another one coming in the opposite direction at top speed we cant see the faces of the people riding in the other car or boat well enough to recognize who they areOr suppose that two people run past each other at high speedThey wont be able to see each others facesSome birds fly through the air so quickly that we cant even see themAll we can hear is the whoosh going past in the airThe currents of the mind that flash out of the body are the same sort of thingThe Buddha discovered that the human mind is something powerful  stronger and more numinous than anything else there isBut because the mind spins so fast we cant see itIf we want to see it we have to get it to spin more slowlyAs it spins more and more slowly we can get it to stopWhen it stops well realize that the mind is something true something that doesnt dieAt the same time its coolWhen it hasnt yet stopped its hotThe heat comes from the spinningWhen it spins really fast it can generate the electricity of passion aversion and delusionAs we generate these three kinds of electricity within ourselves the mind will go running out the six wires  the nerves of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mindIf any of these wires get shorted they can set our home our town on fireWhen these currents flare up in the mind they can wear out the nerves of our eyes ears nose tongue and body so that they start sending us the wrong information and make us misunderstand thingsIf we go around with exposed wires and meet up with someone else whose wires are exposed were going to get shorted and both of us will be devastatedIts bad enough that both of us are generating electricity to make things worse we go ahead and put our hands right on each others exposed wiresWhen this happens well get electrocutedThe danger of exposed wires is that their current sucks us inWhen we connect the heat builds up and explodes into fireThe spinning of the mind builds up heat in the properties of the body and when the properties get unbalanced like this they can give rise to pain and illnessWhen the mind spins in this way it darkens everythingOur eyes ears etc get darkened so that they cant see the truth of sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasThis is why the Buddha teaches us to give rise to stillness by developing the ballast of skillful and meritorious actionsAnd what acts as ballast for the mindWere taught to create ballast for the mind by looking for three big hunks of rock generosity making donations of material things virtue keeping our words and deeds at normalcy and meditation training the mindIf the mind isnt slowed down by the weights of whats skillful and meritorious theres no way it can get relief from the heat of its firesSometimes evil pulls it in one direction while goodness pulls it in anotherGoodness is like the positive current evil like the negative currentThe mind alternates between good and evil looking for good only from time to time but it doesnt find any real peace and quietStill its beginning to see things a little more clearly as when a car begins to slow down but hasnt yet stoppedSo we have to find four other ways to slow the mind downIn other words we have to make sure that our thoughts words and deeds dont fall under the four kinds of bias bias based on desire based on aversion based on delusion and based on fearWe have to be fair and gentle with other people harming neither ourselves nor othersThis helps our mind spin even more slowlyIf it spins forward it has four blockades in the wayIf it spins back it has three rocks weighing it downWe need principles in how we sit stand walk lie down speak actThese are the mainstays of the mind in developing tranquillity and insightThis is whats meant by meditationThe mind is like a machineWhen the machine stops we can safely touch all its belts and gearsThe belts here are its various concepts and perceptionsIn other words perceptions of past and future spin back and forth which is why the mind cant find any coolnessAs it keeps spinning it develops heatIf it spins really fast itll set on fire burning itself and spreading out to burn other people as wellThis is why were taught to stop the spinning by cutting the beltsIn other words we practice tranquillity meditation not allowing the mind to spin along after the currents of the worldWhatever activity youre involved in keep the mind fully involved in what youre doingThis is like water in the ocean when its full of waves if we take a bowlful of water and set it apart until the waves grow still or if we clarify the water with an alum crystal we can look into the water and see our reflection clearlyOur face is something that normally we never seeEven though we use our mouth to speak day in and day out weve never seen what shape it isEven though we breathe through our nose with every moment weve never seen itOur ears hear sounds all day long but weve never seen what they look likeOur eyes can see all kinds of things but they cant see themselvesThis is why we have to depend on mirrors to see our reflectionsOnly then can we see our faceWhen people have discernment its as if they have a large mirror for looking at themselves because discernment is the clear knowing that comes from a mind bright clean and pure free from spinning free from wavesWhen the mind stops spinning it comes to stillnessThis stillness is what gives rise to the discernment that develops into cognitive skills within us  the three skills and the eight such as recollection of former lives which enables us to see ourselves knowledge of the passing away and arising of living beings  once weve seen enough of ourselves we can see other people and knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations we can see whats good whats evil what should be abandoned what should be developed what takes birth and dies what doesnt take birth and doesnt dieWhen these skills arise within us we will thoroughly comprehend our own bodies and minds as well as fabricated things in generalThe three fires of passion aversion and delusion will stay separated far from the heartThe heart stops spinning and when theres no more spinning the fire and electricity stop leaving nothing but coolness and easeThis is why were taught to find ballast and blockades for the mind so that it will spin more and more slowly more and more slowly until it stops for the sake of the coolness ease and peace Ive mentioned hereRestraint of the senses means making sure theyre in harmony with their objectsIn other wordsCakkhusamvaro Exercise restraint over the eyesDont let your eyes be bigger than their visual objects and dont let the visual objects be bigger than your eyesAn example of small eyes and big objects is when you see something and the heart latches onto it for days on endThis is called not being straightforward in your practice because youve let the visual object get bigger than your eyesAs for big eyes and small objects thats when you cant see enough of an objectWhen it disappears you want to see it again and againYou cant let go of itThis is called eyes bigger than their objectsThis is what gives rise to greedWhen objects are bigger than your eyes that also gives rise to greed and delusionAnyone who doesnt know how to exercise restraint over the eyes gives rise to the three fires of passion aversion and delusion which burn the eyes and give rise to sufferingSotasamvaro Exercise restraint over your ears and their sounds so that theyre the right size for each otherSometimes your ears are bigger than the sounds they hear sometimes the sounds are bigger than the earsFor example someone says something and you take it to think about for many daysThats a case of the sound being bigger than the earsThis gives rise to liking or dislikingThe fires of passion aversion and delusion burn the ears of people like this for they havent watched out for evil and so evil can come flowing into their heartsGhanasamvaro Exercise restraint over the nose and smellsIf a smell smells good dont fall for itIf it smells bad and you cant stand it get away from itDont hate itIf you contemplate the nose and its smells youll see that sometimes a smell is bigger than the nose ie one whiff and it gets stuck in the heart for many days months and yearsThe smell may have been over and gone for many days months and years but the nose hasnt gotten over itPassion and aversion get provoked and then delusion goes running after the smellThis is called not exercising restraint over the noseJivhasamvaro means restraint over the tongue and flavorsIf the food you get is edible dont go struggling to look for things to make it more special than it already isIf you like it eat your fillIf you dont like it eat just a littleChoose foods that benefit the bodyOtherwise youll sufferDont follow your taste budsSometimes the flavors are bigger than the tongueYou sit thinking about eating chicken or duck pork or fish and so you go looking for themWhen you get them your tongue shrivels up and you can hardly eat them at allThis is called not having a sense of enough not exercising restraintIn addition to eating the tongue plays a role in speakingSometimes the tongue grows large what you say goes way beyond the truthYou speak without stopping and its all nonsenseOther times the topic is big but the tongue grows small theres a lot to be explained but you hem and haw so that no one can understand the truthThis is called not exercising restraint so that the tongue is the same size as its topics and its one way of bringing on sufferingKayasamvaro means restraint over the body and tactile sensationsSometimes they feel comfortable together sometimes they dontIn other words the place where youre staying may be big but the body is smallSometimes the place is small but the body feels bigThey dont go togetherThe tactile sensations that touch the body dont fitSometimes the body is small but the sensations are bigFor example you come across a sensation you likeThen even when its vanished for many days you still miss itSometimes the body is big but the sensations are smallFor example you dont feel comfortable wherever you sit or lie down for the whole world seems narrow and confiningThats called not exercising restraint to keep the body and its tactile sensations in line with each otherAnd that gives rise to sufferingManosamvaro Exercise restraint over the heart to keep it on the right path in line with things as they ariseSometimes your thoughts are bigger than the mind you worry and stew about something going way beyond the truth of the situationThis leads to misunderstandings making the mind restless and anxiousSometimes the mind is bigger than your thoughts you take a minor problem and turn it into four or five big onesIn other words you dont exercise restraint over the heart to keep it in line with your situation  what they call harvesting grass to roof the field This leads to useless distraction which opens the way for greed anger and delusionThis is why were taught to exercise careful restraint over the heart to bring it to peace and calmThats whats meant by restraint of the sensesThe dangers faced by the mind are like poisonous snakes fires and great thieves  things that are always lying in wait to lay us to waste robbing us killing us and stripping us of our valuables our human goodness every day and nightPoisonous snakes here stand for passion aversion and delusion which have a painful poison that seeps into the minds of runofthemill peopleWhen it reaches the heart this poison can kill youAs for fires there are two kinds forest fires and house firesA forest fire doesnt have any one ownerIt arises of its own accord by its nature and spreads its destruction far and wide without bounds until it dies out on its ownThis stands for the fires of birth aging illness and death forms of suffering that arise in the bodies of all living beingsThis fire can burn up both our worldly treasures and our noble treasuresAs for house fires those are the fires that arise from within the heart  defilements ignorance craving and clinging  the hindrances that get in the way of the goodness that comes from training the heart and mindThe great thieves or  most wanted criminals stand for our five aggregates form feeling perception thoughtconstructs and consciousness which are constantly robbing us killing us and oppressing us destroying both our worldly treasures and our noble onesIn addition there are the underground criminals that keep sneaking up on us without our realizing it material gain status praise and pleasure from external thingsWhoever gets duped by these criminals finds it hard to work freeThis is why they can destroy the goodness that wed otherwise be able to attain in the area of the heart and mindAll of these poisonous snakes fires and criminals pose a tremendous danger to the heartThey keep destroying our goodness every momentIf were not wise to them well have trouble gaining release from themThe only way to prevent these dangers is through the power of the Dhamma in other words the practice of meditation using our powers of directed thought and evaluation within ourselves to the point where we give rise to the discernment that clearly knows and sees the truth of all fabricated thingsWhen we can see the dangers on all sides well learn to be careful and on our guard to look for ways of destroying them or of escaping from themWhen we can do this our lives will be happyWhen we practice the Dhamma its as if we were going through a lonely desolate forest on the way to a goal thats the highest form of happiness and safetyTo get through the forest we have to depend on the practice of concentration with our mindfulness circumspect on all sidesWe cant be heedless or complacentWe must make the effort to cut away all the concepts and preoccupations that come in to destroy the goodness of the mindWhen we know that there are poisonous snakes fires and the most wanted criminals lying in wait for us along our way we have to be mindful alert and wakeful at all times and to get good weapons ready so that we can fight them offAt the same time we need provisions to help us on our way  in other words the factors of jhanaDirected thought is what focuses the mind on what it wants to knowEvaluation is what kills off the HindrancesThese two qualities are like fixing dinnerBut if we have only these two qualities its as if weve prepared our dinner but dont yet know the flavor of the different kinds of food we haveIf we can still the mind until its one with its object thats like eating and swallowing our foodThats when well know its flavor and be able to gain a sense of fullness and nourishment from it in other words a sense of rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThe heart will then be able to gain full strength just like the body when its had a nourishing mealOuter food is what nourishes the body and gives it strengthWhen the body has strength we can walk or run anywhere we wantWhatever we want to do well have the strength to succeedAs for inner food  the Dhamma  thats what nourishes the heart and mindWhen the heart and mind are well nourished the power of the heart is made resilient and strongWhatever we set our mind on will succeed in line with our thoughtsIf the mind is deprived of the food of the Dhamma it gets feeble and weakIts thoughts meet with no success or at best with success in some things and not in others not fully in line with our hopesThats why we have to shore up the strength of our own minds as much as we can for the strength of the mind is the most important thing within us that will take us to our goal of the highest happinessAs long as youre still alive and breathing dont let yourself be heedless or complacentDont let time pass you by to no purposeHurry up and accelerate your efforts at developing goodness  for when theres no more breath for you to breathe youll have no more opportunity to do goodYou should focus exclusively on whatever thoughts help make the mind firm so that it can give rise to goodnessDont dally with any other kinds of thinking regardless of whether they seem more sophisticated or lessShake them all offDont bring them into the mind to think aboutKeep the mind firmly set in a single preoccupation thats your true heart the true heart of the Buddhas teachingsThose of us who are training our hearts and minds in hopes of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana if we dont study to understand the fundamental principles of the world are likely to wander off the pathOr else well keeping circling around without ever reaching our goalSo if we really want to put an end to suffering we should ask ourselves what do we have within us that can act as a true refuge for ourselvesThis is the sort of question we should keep reflecting on all the timeAs we chant every day Svakkhato bhagavata dhammo sanditthiko akaliko  The Dhamma wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now is timeless In other words if we want to reach it well be able to reach itIf we dont want to reach it we wontBut whether or not well reach it depends on underlying causes which come in two sorts an enduring principle and supporting principlesThe enduring principle called dhammathiti is what stays unmoving by its natureThe supporting principles are our training and education which can be either good or badThis is why our practice sways back and forth like a tree in the middle of an open field swaying back and forth in the windIf we dont discover the enduring principle within us we wont be able to find anything to act as a true refuge  for our training and education are simply supporting factorsThis is why we should keep asking ourselves Have we found any principle within ourselves that can act as our refuge As long as were still depending on other people other things we dont have a true refugeOur training and education are nothing more than supporting factors  like the fertilizer we give to plantsWhen the fertilizer runs out the plant will have to fall to the ground and decomposeThe same holds true for the Buddha when his body ran out of strength it turned into the four elementsThe Dhamma when it no longer has any power turns into nothing but letters on paper or palm leaves which then disintegrateAs for the Sangha when they run out of strength they dieSo the refuge we take in these things is nothing more than a snack or finger food but people for the most part misunderstand them to be our true refugeThey think that the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha will carry or drag them to heaven or nibbanaFrom one angle this is right but from another its wrongIts right in the sense that the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha keep alive the tradition of goodness that we can hold onto and followIts wrong though in the sense that they arent the things that will make us reach the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaReaching nibbana depends on our own actions our practiceSo we have to ask ourselves What do we want in life If we really want something were sure to succeed at it in every wayBut the fact that we dont succeed comes from ourselvesIf we want to be millionaires well have to become millionairesIf we want to be beggars well have to become beggarsSuccess and lack of success come from within ourselves  in other words from the causal factors lying within the limits of our own goodnessIf we practice correctly were sure to succeedIt all depends on the enduring principles in the world together with the supporting factors that point us in the right directionThe supporting factors are the teachings formulated by wise people and sagesThe enduring principles  dhammathiti  come from the principles of natureTo reach the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana requires dhammathitiTake our Buddha or the Private Buddhas as an example when they were born there was no Buddha to teach themBut they had met up with sages and Buddhas in previous lives so they were born with character traits that spurred them on to be highminded to see the drawbacks of the world so crowded with defilement and craving with birth aging illness and deathDisenchanted they aspired to gain release from all this suffering  for as long as we human beings are subject to birth and death then even if we had wings to fly we still wouldnt escape from our sufferingBut if were free from birth and death then even if we have to crawl on all fours in the dirt we wont feel any sufferingThis is why the Buddha left the householder life and went off into the wilderness to be alone developing virtue concentration and discernment until he attained full BuddhahoodOnce he had attained his goal he had another character trait  his great compassion  that inspired him to teach the Dhamma to his relatives and to living beings in general so that they could gain release from suffering as wellPracticing virtue is called compassion in terms of ones actionsThis is followed by compassion in terms of ones speech and thoughtsWhen the Buddha expressed this sort of compassion people responded to him in kind they loved him respected him and were willing to grant him powerThe Buddhas compassion expressed itself in two ways for the well being of the world and the well being of his relativesIn terms of the world the Buddha spread his good will and compassion to beings all over the world without showing any partiality for any group or individual at allAs for the well being of his relatives like everyone else he had parents grandparents and siblings and these people in turn had children grandchildren and inlawsThe Buddhas compassion spread out along all of these connections expressed in terms of compassionate actions compassionate words and compassionate thoughtsThis compassion spread out from a heart that had found its own dependable refuge withinThis was why he was able to spread his compassion so that others could depend on him as wellIts the nature of the heart that when it can depend on itself its goodness gradually spreads out of its own accordIf theres any kind of connection  whether people are relatives or not  it spreads out along those connectionsIt spreads out in terms of words when you can teach and instruct othersIn terms of thoughts theres no anger hatred or jealousyTheres simply the willingness to sacrifice for othersWhen there were ways the Buddha could help others with his thoughts he spread those thoughts at all timesHe had seen that the lay life wasnt convenient for spreading goodness so far and wide which was why he became a monkHe had seen that being a member of the noble warrior class involved both good and evil for its the nature of the world that people are proud of their birth their race their class which divides us into factions and creates inequalitiesWhen divisions like this arise in the world its difficult to spread goodnessThat was why he left his relatives cutting himself off from his class and raceAnd this is why when a new monk is being ordained the announcing teacher asks him Have your mother and father given their permission and the candidate answers Yes He has left the limitations of the worldly life and now doesnt belong to any family at allThen once hes ordained hes taught not to go hanging around with his old familySo when the Buddha left home he went off on his own to find the truth of the DhammaRegardless of whether he was to get teachings from others he explored within himself without depending on his old wealth or family connectionsHe gave himself totally to the practiceAt first he had studied with the Six Teachers but they were unable to convince him of their teachingsThe first teacher was Teacher EyeThis teacher fools us in all sorts of waysIt tells us that this sight is beautiful that sight is ugly this sight is good that sight is badIt whispers to the heart causing us to trip and fall because we dont see things in terms of their basic principles  that all sights are the sameWhether theyre birds rats people animals trees vines whatever they differ only in terms of their featuresTheir basic condition is the same they arise decay and then disappear in line with the principles of natureThe second teacher was Teacher EarAt first there are two of these teachers but then they turn into four which gets things even more confusingIn other words the left ear hears good sounds and bad sounds the right ear hears good sounds and bad sounds all of which gives rise to distorted perceptionsWe imagine good things to be bad and bad things to be good true things to be false and false things to be trueSo Teacher Ear is another teacher who fools usThe Buddha thus left both Teacher Eye and Teacher Ear to study withTeacher NoseAt first this teacher has two nostrils but then they split into fourSometimes it likes good smells sometimes it doesnt like good smells and likes bad smells insteadThen it goes whispering to the heart to make it misunderstand thingsIf we could take a photo of the mind wed see that the eyes are big and bulging the ears are set out like huge sails while the nose is wide wide openWhen the Buddha saw that he had no use for these three teachers he went on to study withTeacher TongueThis teacher  the mouth  is even more of a turmoilIf it were part of the army itd be called a multitask forceOn the one hand it eats food on the other it says all kinds of thingsSometimes it likes to say good things sometimes bad thingsSometimes it doesnt like to say good things and prefers to say bad things insteadOne little tongue but it too splits into fourWhen its not speaking it eatsSometimes that person gets to eat this person doesnt get to eatThis person has only a little to eat that person starves while that person over there has more than enough to eatThe dangers that come from these affairs block the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaSo the Buddha moved on to study with the fifth teacherTeacher BodyThis teacher is made up of the six elements but as soon as the elements get unbalanced it gets feverish or chilled weak or stiffAs it meets up with friction it wears outAs for the sixth teacher thatsTeacher MindThis teacher thinks and worries deluding itself in all sorts of waysSuppose for instance that were leaving the house to come to the monasteryAs soon as weve left the door it starts deceiving us What a painIts so far to walkA waste of timeThe sun is hot When we get to the monastery and start sitting in meditation it starts deceiving us again Weve been sitting too longIm tiredMy legs hurtTheyre numbMy back is stiff Then it squeezes our legs squeezes our arms beats our back pokes our stomach giving us heartburn or a stomachacheWhen were whipped and beaten like this we eventually give inSometimes it comes whispering Why dont you stopTimes almost upOpen your eyes So we leave meditation raise our hands in respect and bow down to the BuddhaAnd thats itIf were weak by nature we fall for itThis is why the Buddha left all of these six teachers closed his eyes closed his ears nose tongue body and mind not letting his heart go running after sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations or ideasHe closed off his senses to escape from these things leaving only the door of the mind which he focused on goodnessWhen this was the case he didnt concern himself with any of the sensesHe went to sit crosslegged under the Bodhi tree on the full moon day in May and gave rise to discernment within himselfHe gathered all his thoughts so that they were right and didnt let them associate with anything outside of the DhammaHe began meditating cutting off all connection to the past and future cutting all connection to the nerves of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mindHe focused on the breath making it more and more refined to the point where the condition of the body disappeared leaving just the qualities of the six elements seeing for example how the breath actually moves how it stopsThis is called buddhavijja the skill of the awakened onesThis skill sees things in terms not of their characteristics but in terms of their basic qualitiesInconstancy is a characteristicStress and notself  burdensomeness what cant be controlled  are all characteristicsBasic qualities though are neutral and constantInconstancy is on the level of characteristicsTo make an analogy the mouth cant turn into the noseThats an affair of basic qualitiesIf things could change like that we wouldnt be able to liveFor example if tonight our ears changed into eyes or our leg became an arm or our nose became a mouth if this happened everything would break out into chaosIf we see things only in terms of their characteristics thats the knowledge of the six teachersChangeoflineage knowledge though sees from both sides both as characteristics and as basic qualitiesTo make another analogy our leg ever since we were two has been a legItll still be a leg when were in line with its basic qualityThis is constancyWhatever its been thats what itll continue to be until we dieWhoever doesnt see through to basic qualities like this will get dragged off by the six teachersThis is why the Buddha left the six teachers to study the skill of the awakened ones to see both what it is that changes and what it is that doesntWhoever sees both sides  the side of inconstancy and the side of constancy  without getting stuck on either side thats changeoflineage knowledge knowing the principles of the world and the basic quality of the DhammaThis is why the Buddha taught Sabbe sankhara anicca sabbe dhamma anatta All conditioned things are inconstant all phenomena are notself Regardless of whether people might say constant or inconstant stress or bliss There is a self or There is no self the Buddha could remain unswayedThis is called Attahi attano natho Those who can give rise to this knowledge and skill within themselves can truly depend on themselvesTheyre not attached to knowledge of the past knowledge of the future knowledge of the presentTheyre not stuck on any dimension of time at allThey can let go of conventions formulated teachings formulated ultimate truthsThey can let go within themselves alone know within themselves aloneThis is called truly depending on yourselfWhen you reach this point your training for the sake of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana will have to succeed in line with your aimsThere wont be any wandering astrayAnd thats enough for nowNow Im going to remind you of some of the Buddhas teachings as a way of encouraging you to be intent on practicing correctly in line with the Buddhas instructionsThese teachings are called DhammaThe Dhamma is an ornament for the mindIts also a means for developing the faculties of the mindThe teachings Im about to discuss come in the OvadaPatimokkha the Patimokkha ExhortationThis is a talk that deals with the duties of those who have ordained in line with the Buddhas instructions but these practices also apply to lay people as wellLay people can take these practices and train themselves to be good people so that they can be eyes and ears legs feet and hands to help look after the work of the religion and to help it prosperThese guidelines which apply to all of us fall under six headingsThe first guideline anupavadoDont go finding fault with one anotherIn other words dont say evil things about one another dont misrepresent one another dont say anything that will cause people to fall apart from one anotherDont start false reports about one another and dont encourage themDont curse or yell at one anotherInstead of finding fault with one another each of us should look at his or her own faultsThis is whats meant by anupavadoYou can use this principle anywhere whether youre ordained or notAnupaghato Dont allow yourself to hate one anotherIts only normal that when people live together their behavior isnt going to be on an equal levelSome people have good manners some people have coarse manners  not evil mind you just that their manners are coarsePhysically some people are energetic industrious and strong others are weak and sicklyVerbally some people are skilled at speaking others are notSome people talk a lot some people hardly talk at all some people like to talk about worldly things some people like to talk about the Dhamma some people speak wrong some people speak rightThis is called inequalityWhen this is the case there are bound to be conflicts and clashes at least to some extentWhen these things arise among us while we live together within the boundaries of the same Dhamma we shouldnt hold grudgesWe should forgive one another and wash away that stain from our heartsWhyBecause otherwise it turns into animosity and enmityThe act of forgiving is called the gift of forgivenessIt turns you into the sort of person who doesnt hold onto things doesnt carry things around doesnt get caught up on things  the sort of person who doesnt bear grudgesEven when there are missteps or mistakes from time to time we should forgive one anotherWe should have a sense of love affection and kindness for everyone around us as much as we canThis is called anupaghatoIts a part of our training as Buddhists both for householders and for contemplativesPatimokkhe ca samvaro Act in a way that keeps you near the entrance to nibbanaWhats the entrance to nibbanaThe PatimokkhaMukha means mouth or entranceMokkha means liberationSit close to your food so that your mouth is near liberationDont sit far away or youll have trouble eatingSit close enough so that liberation is within reach and you can stick it right in your mouthIn other words whatever behavior is near the ways of the religion thats the behavior you should followTo be near the religion means following the holy lifeLay people have their holy life too you know just as monks have theirsLay people follow the holy life in two waysThe first is observing the first five of the eight precepts no killing no stealing no sex  this is what makes it the holy life no telling lies and no intoxicantsThis is one form of holy life near the entrance to nibbanaThe second way for lay people to follow the holy life is by observing all eight preceptsAs for novices and monks they should maintain restraint in line with the ten or preceptsAt the same time they shouldnt omit any of the good types of behavior that they should followThis is called acaragocarasampannoDont go wandering around in areas that are out of bounds and can harm youIn other words dont let your body go there dont let your speech dwell on those places and dont let your mind go there eitherDont associate with immoral people who are coarse in their habitsDont ask advice from unvirtuous peopleDont let your mind get entangled with themTry to keep in mind people who are good together with the goodness that you yourself are trying to developThis is called the holy lifeWhoever behaves in this way is said to be restrained in line with the Patimokkha right next to nibbanaMattaññuta ca bhattasmim Have a sense of moderation in the food you eatHere Ill talk about physical foodPeople eat in three ways and the first is eating greedilyEven though the stomach is full the mind isnt fullThe mouth is full you cant swallow what youve got the stomach is full and yet the mind still wants to eat moreThis is called eating greedilyDont let this greed take charge of the heartThe second type is eating contentedlyYoure content with what you have in your alms bowl and dont eat anything outside your bowlOr youre content with the food within reachYou dont ask for anything out of reachYou dont give any sign with your hand your eyes or your expression that youd like more to eatYou eat only whats on your plate whats in your bowlThis is called eating contentedlyThe third type is eating modestlyThis type of eating is very good both in terms of the world and of the DhammaTake VenSivali as an exampleHe ate modestlyHow did he eat modestlyAll that most of us know about VenSivali is that he was wealthy in terms of the donations he receivedBut where did that wealth come fromIt comes from eating modestlyEating modestly is the source that gives rise to wealthWhat VenSivali did was this whenever he received cloth if he didnt then give a gift of cloth he wouldnt wear what he had receivedWhen he received food in his bowl he wouldnt eat until he had given some of it as a gift to someone elseNo matter which of the four requisites he received  food clothing shelter or medicine no matter how much or how little  once it was in his possession he wouldnt use it until he had shared some of it with those around himWhen he received a lot he would make a large gift to benefit many peopleWhen he received just a little hed still try to benefit othersThis gave rise to all sorts of good thingsHis friends loved him his community loved him and they were kind to himThis is why being generous is said to tie the knot of friendship and to wipe out your enemiesSo thats what VenSivali didWhen he passed away from that lifetime and was reborn in his last lifetime he gained all kinds of wealth and never had to go hungryEven when he went to live in places where food should have been scarce he never suffered from scarcity never had to do withoutWhat this means for us is that whatever we get we eat only a third and give the other two thirds awayThe parts appropriate for animals we give to animalsThe parts appropriate for human beings we give to human beingsThe parts we should share with our fellows in the holy life we give with a clear heartThis is what it means to be modest in our consumptionWe feel ease of heart and ease of bodyWhen we die we wont be poorThis principle is something very good not only in terms of the religion but also in terms of the modern world at largeIts a great means for subduing terrorismHow does it subdue terrorismWhen people arent poor they dont get stirred upWhere does terrorism come fromIt comes from people having nowhere to live nothing to eat no one to look after themWhen theyre poor and starving like this they think As long as Im suffering lets have everyone else suffer all the sameDont let there be any private propertyLet everything be owned in common This kind of thinking comes from poverty and deprivationAnd why is there povertyBecause some people eat all aloneThey dont share with people at largeThen when people at large suffer and feel revenge they turn into communists and terroristsSo terrorism comes from greed and selfishness from not sharing what weve gotIf we get ten baht we can give away nine and eat what we can get for the one baht remainingThat way well have lots of friendsThere will be love and affection peace and prosperityHow can that come aboutWhen people have places to live and food to eat when they can eat their fill and can sleep when they lie down why would they want to bother their heads with the confusion of politicsThis is why the Buddha taught us that modesty in our consumption is something good something noble and outstandingWhen we practice in this way were in line with the phrase mattaññuta ca bhattasmimWell be practicing right practicing properly for the benefit of ourselves and othersPantañca sayanasanam Dont be a busybodyWherever you live try to be quiet and at peaceDont get entangled or play the gongs with the other members of the groupDont get involved in issues unless it really cant be helpedWhen youve studied and understand your duties look for quiet solitary places to live and to meditateWhen you live with others look for quiet groups to live withWhen you live alone in physical seclusion be a quiet personEven when you live with the group be a secluded personTake only the good peaceful things the group has to offerWhen you live alone dont get involved in a lot of activityBe quiet in your actions quiet in your speech quiet in your mindWhen you live in a group  either two or three people  dont get involved in quarrels for when theres quarreling theres no peaceYour actions arent peaceful for you have to get up and storm aroundYour words arent peacefulYour mind  with its thoughts of anger revenge and ill will  isnt peacefulAnd this gives rise to all sorts of bad karmaWhen you live in a community  anywhere from four on up to  you have to make sure that the community is at peace that theres no conflict no quarreling no hurting one anothers feelings or doing one another harmThe community should be a cooperative for training peacefully in virtue and the DhammaThats when its a good community orderly and civilized fostering progress for all its membersThis is one of our duties as part of the Buddhas following in line with the Buddhas instructionsIts called patañca sayanasanam creating a quiet place to live at your ease in both body and mindAdhicitte ca ayogo Dont be complacentBe diligent in practicing concentration to the level of adhicitta or the heightened mindPractice concentration frequently sit in concentration frequently as an example to the rest of the communityWhen you talk seek advice in how to develop your meditation themeDiscuss the rewards of concentrationPractice ridding the heart of its hindrancesWhen you do this youre acting in line with the principle of heightened mindAnother level of heightened mind is when the mind has been freed from its hindrances and has entered concentration without any ups or downsIts solid stalwart and strong with nothing defiling itThis is called adhicitte ca ayogo commitment to the heightened mindSo dont be complacentKeep working at this alwaysEtam buddhanasasanam When you do this youre acting in line with the Buddhas instructionsThese are the Buddhas words straight from his mouthSo we should all work at giving rise to these principles within ourselvesIf you establish yourself in these teachings in all honesty and integrity then even if you cant liberate your mind totally from suffering at the very least youll be developing yourself in the right directionYour bad habits will disappear day by day and the good habits youve never had before will arise in their placeAs for the good habits you already have theyll prosper and flourishSo now that youve listened to this take it and put it into practiceTrain yourself to behave in line with the Buddhas exhortationWhen you do that youll meet with happiness and prosperity as you flourish in line with his instructionsDuring my second year as a monk I was invited to give a Dhamma talk to the woman  whom I knew only as Aunty  who had raised the woman who had sponsored my ordinationAunty had suddenly fallen ill and her relatives were sure that she didnt have much longer to liveIn her time she had known many of the great masters of the forest tradition so rather than give her a talk of my own I decided to read her some by Ajaan LeeWhen I finished she asked Whose talks were thoseAjaan Lees I told herThats what I thought she repliedNobody could give a Dhamma talk as beautifully as heIve often thought of her comment since then and in particular of what she meant by beautifulFor most Thais of her day a beautiful talk was one that made use of formal courtly language with heavy literary embellishments often saying as little as possible with a maximum number of wordsThat however was not Ajaan Lees styleWhat I think Aunty meant was a different kind of beauty a directness and clarity of expression with imaginative similes and metaphorsAjaan Lee was skilled at making obscure points of Dhamma clear and more familiar teachings memorableAlthough he had a poets sense of how to play with words the beauty of his talks was more a natural beauty of the mind than of studied verbal effectsIn this book which is drawn from Ajaan Lees collected talks this is the kind of beauty I have kept in mind in selecting the passages for translationOnly in the last year of his life were any of Ajaan Lees talks taperecordedWe owe our records of his earlier talks to a handful of followers who took notes while he spoke a nun Arun Abhivanna a monk Phra Bunkuu Anuvaddhano and a lay woman Thao Satyanurak who included some of Ajaan Lees talks in her diary which was published after her deathIn compiling this book I have drawn on notes made by all threeOf the three Arun Abhivanna was by far the most prolificFor years she took notes of Ajaan Lees talks  sometimes simply jotting down catchy phrases other times reconstructing entire talksHer notes  together with those by Phra Bunkuu and transcripts of the recorded talks  have more recently been collected in two large volumesBecause of their haphazard arrangement the collections are hard to read straight through but they are excellent companions for meditators who simply want to open to a passage at random read enough to throw light on their problems and then return to the practiceAjaan Lee was unique among the forest masters in leaving behind systematic guides to meditation and Buddhist practice in general books like Keeping the Breath in Mind The Craft of the Heart Frames of Reference and Basic ThemesAnyone who wants to understand the general outlines of his teaching should turn to those books firstHis talks though are where he reveals something of his roughandready personality giving small asides that throw a revealing light on his more systematic teachings and making points that he makes nowhere elseI have already translated a number of the talks in Lessons in Samadhi Food for Thought and Inner StrengthThose volumes though consist entirely of reconstructed talks that fit around specific themesIn this volume I have given a more general selection including a few full talks some short passages and sometimes even halfthoughts if they seemed provocative enoughThis book is designed to be read reflectively a little at a timeMany of the short passages in particular will reveal their meaning only after repeated thoughtAlso some of the passages that present Ajaan Lees personality will challenge many current ideas on how a Dhamma practitioner ought to speakAs Ajaan Lee cautioned his listeners Dhamma teachings should not be accepted or rejected right off handInstead they should be listened to with an open mind and then put to the test in experience to see if they can help uncover unwitting preconceptionsThis is how I hope this book will be readIn the course of selecting the passages that make up this book I found that two themes in particular stood outThe first which has provided the book with its title is Ajaan Lees frequent portrayal of Buddhism as a skillThis skill involves mastery not only of the techniques of meditation but also of adroit ways of viewing the world and events in daily life so that one can gain freedom from all the burdens that the unskillful mind places on itselfThis approach culminates in what he calls the skill of release the awareness that brings about the minds total liberationThe second theme concerns the central role that breath meditation plays in developing this skillFor Ajaan Lee Buddhist doctrines show their true meaning only when one refers them to the practice of keeping the breath in mindTo underline this point I have included a section on the Wings to Awakening  the Buddhas own list of his central teachings  to show how Ajaan Lee interprets them in terms of the breathAlthough the passages presented here have been arranged so that the book will stand on its own they are also meant to fill in some of the gaps left by Ajaan Lees other writingsMy hope is that this will give the Englishspeaking world a more rounded picture of the skill of release and of the beauty with which Ajaan Lee presented itI like going different places not just for the fun of it but also because I want to learnTo learn something of value depends on three things seeing listening and thinking ie using all of your senses so as to serve a purposeSometimes when you meet people and find that their beliefs and practices are on a level lower than yours you can serve a purpose by teaching them to get started on the right pathBut when you see with your eyes hear with your ears and are convinced in your heart that something is really good dont think about whether its yours or theirsRemember it and put it into practice yourselfBecause my heart has been set on serving the purposes of the religion Ive kept on trying to do whats goodNo matter whether Im in a high place or a lowly one I always think only of serving a purposeAs for the question of manners  in other words how to benefit advanced people and people not so advanced  that depends on the situationThe religion isnt the exclusive property of homes or monasteries of this or that city or nationThe religion is something meant to benefit everyone everywhereIt belongs to the worldThe further we can spread its benefits the betterBut even though Ive meant well practicing in line with these thoughts I cant escape being criticized probably because the people who criticize dont understandJust a short while back  last April th  I was talking with an old nobleman but I didnt want to come down too hard on himHis criticism to put it briefly was You spend an awful lot of time involved with lay people so how can you practice for the sake of releaseI answered him frankly  but first I asked him just to make sure What are you getting atTeach people to reach nibbana he saidDont get too involved with themSo I said I like teaching people to reach nibbana but its hardI like it mind you I like it but if I did as you said Id be crazySuppose you plant some riceWhen its golden and ripe can you harvest just the white grains of riceWithout taking anything elseI take everythingPeople may say Im crazy but why should I careI take the whole plant because it has lots of usesThe straw you can keep to feed water buffaloes or sell or use as kindlingAs for the rice husks you can use them to feed pigsYou know he said youre right And that was the end of the matterIm different from most other monks in that I dont like to eat only one flavor of food ie the physical food we eat every dayI like the kind of food that has three flavors in every biteIts a fine food  food for the heart not food for the bodyIts three flavors are the food of sensory contact the food of consciousness and the food of intentionsIf you were to compare it to durian fruit its the type thats sweet and rich and a little bit bitter all at once  the kind of durian that people really love to eatThe nourishment of the food of sensory contact here means likable sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasThe nourishment of the food of consciousness means taking note of likable things by way of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mindAnd the nourishment of intentions means the success of the good things we aim atTaken together these things are called Dhamma food three flavors in a single biteWhoever keeps eating this kind of food regularly will have a long happy and healthy lifeThis is the kind of food I wantTo put it in simple terms its the sense of satisfaction I get when I see my students  monks novices and lay people  practicing rightlyThis isnt rice food its people foodIm a monster monk I like to eat peopleIf anyone acts in a way to make me feel happy and satisfied thats going to help me live longerIf anyone misbehaves thats going to make me die fasterThe reason Im here is to help benefit the religion to benefit the worldIm looking for a living hoping to make a profitIf the rice I plant produces big fat grains and good profits Ill hang around for a good whileIf all I get are stunted grains and nothing but losses Ill be on my waySo if I see that staying on will serve a purpose Ill try to breathe good and long good and longIf I see that staying on doesnt serve a purpose any more Ill try to breathe shorter and shorter until I go in an instantThats when I can be at my ease the kind of happiness that nothing else can match with no need to sit here tormenting my body listening to anyones troubles any more shining bright all by myself with no worries or concerns at allSo thats the kind of food I likeAs for food for the body I eat it because I have to thats allIts not that I really want it for theres no real substance to itYou eat it today and tomorrow you have to get rid of itBut with food for the heart what you eat in one day can stay with you for ten years yearsYou never grow tired of it and you stay full until you forget what its like to be hungryTurmoil comes from our own defilements not from other peopleYou have to solve the problem within yourself if you want to find peaceWhatever has anything to do with the world no matter how good it may be is all an affair of stress and sufferingIf you have one dollar you have one dollars worth of sufferingIf you have  you have s worth of suffering  because the affairs of money are heavy and weightyAs for the affairs of the Dhamma theyre light with no need to wrap them up and carry them with you nothing but shedding setting aside and letting goOur major loves are our major enemiesOur minor loves are our minor enemiesWhatever we dont love at all is simply neutralThings of the world at best are either good but not true or true but not goodOther peoples thoughts words and deeds are things that arent trueTheyre affairs of the worldThe Dhamma though is really true and really good and really beneficialIts an affair of the heart something very profoundSo when we know that the affairs of the world arent true in their goodness or good in their truth we shouldnt latch onto themWe have to brush them asideIf people say were good or bad theres no truth to their words  because good is true only in the mouth of the person speaking and the same is the case with bad So dont latch onto anything they sayFocus instead on the good and bad that are actually within youDont latch onto outside wordsIf people say youre good or bad or if they curse you let them keep it for themselvesIf theres a dog barking in the middle of the road kick it off to one sideBarking dogs dont biteSilent dogs might so watch outEars that listen to gossip are the ears of a pitcher not the ears of a personDont believe everything you hearIf they say youre a dog check to see for yourself if youve got a tailIf you dont then theyre wrongThe world is taken with words but I dont go along with thatId rather take hold of the truth in the heartAs for words theyre things you spit out not things you should keepTheyre not the truthThe truth lies in your heartSo whether your words are good or not pleasing or not make sure at least that your hearts goodBeing easygoing and being at ease are two different thingsEasygoing means that youre slow and laid back and dont finish the things you shouldYou spoil your work and waste your timeBeing at ease means that theres a subtle comfort and coolness in the heart with no inner stress or turmoil mixed in at allPeople who can be at ease in this way are people the world really wants  and the Dhamma wants even more because coolness is like medicine that can drive away fever and soothe burning painA person in charge of the work means that we use concentration and discernment to get the job doneWork in charge of the person means that were lacking in concentration and discernment and think of the work even when were lying in bedWork in charge of the work means that everything is all out of controlMy motto is Make yourself as good as possible and everything else will have to turn good in your wake If you dont abandon your own inner goodness for the sake of outer goodness things will have to go wellDont cut down a tree that gives you shade Give it fertilizer and look after it so that it will growDont forget the people who have helped youFind some way of doing good to repay themIf you cant do it with your words or actions then at least do it with your thoughtsIf people can kill off their own goodness theres nothing to keep them from killing off other people as wellIf what youre going to say isnt good or true keep stillEven if its good and true but serves no purpose itll still cause harmA stupid person can sit in a gold mine but wont have the sense to make anything of itAn intelligent person can take dirt and grass and turn them into silver and goldEven if a stupid person gets a huge inheritance from his parents or grandparents he wont be able to prevent himself from creating a lot of bad kamma with itAn intelligent person though even if he has only an ax to his name can use it to set himself up for lifeMost of us know so much that there are no bounds to our knowledgeWhen our knowledge has no bounds its like a forest fire that burns everything in sightIn other words were so smart that we outsmart ourselvesWe know whats right and wrong but cant keep ourselves from doing whats wrongThis kind of knowledge serves no purpose and can only cause us harmThats why its like a forest fire that goes out of control and destroys everyones orchards and fieldsPeople like this end up a total lossThey know everything in the world except for themselvesKnowledge with no bounds can cause two sorts of harm We ourselves are harmed by it and other people get harmed as wellPeople who are thick with ignorance see turmoil as something fun just like a fish that sees waves in the ocean as a fun place to playGreed means getting fixated and attached to things our own things or those of othersIf we get attached its like getting sucked into an electric current until we dieThe nature of everything in the world is that it spins around with each moment just like an electric generatorIf we touch the wires without any insulation the current will suck us in until were fried to a crispWe see the current as something pretty and bright and so we want to fondle it  and itll electrocute usIf we latch onto things our desires will get us stuck right thereDont let defilements inside make contact with defilements outsideIf we have defilements at the same time that other people do the result will be troubleFor instance if were angry when theyre angry or were greedy when theyre greedy or were deluded when theyre deluded it spells ruination for everyonePeople arent equal but you have to make your heart equal for everyoneIf you see other peoples bad side turn your eyes around until you can see their good side as wellA person who makes a mistake is better than a person who doesnt act at all for mistakes can be correctedBut if you dont act how will you know how to correct yourself for you dont know whether youre mistaken or notThe fact that you dont act is a mistake in and of itselfThe more you study the affairs of the world the more they branch outThe more you study the affairs of the Dhamma the more they narrow down and convergeThe treasures of the world last only as long as our breathingAs soon as we die they go to somebody elseThe King of Death keeps changing our clothes  our eyes our hair our skin etc as a way of forewarning us that were going to be evacuated to another countryIf we dont get our provisions ready were going to be in trouble when the evacuation order comesThis body that weve borrowed from the world The original owners keep coming to take it back bit by bit without our realizing itFor example the hair on our head They take it back one or two strands at a time turning it grayOur eyes they take back one at a time making them blurryOur ears they take back bit by bit as our hearing starts to goOur teeth they take back one by oneA tooth will start feeling loose then it stops for a while and then it starts growing loose againEventually it whispers to the dentist to take all the teeth outThe original owners also cut away our flesh bit by bit as our muscles atrophy and our skin gets loose and wrinkledOur spine they keep coming to pull forward until its so bent that we cant straighten upSome people end up having to crawl or to walk with a cane stumbling and swaying falling down and picking themselves back up a sorry sight to seeUltimately the owners come and call for the whole thing back in what we call deathIf you look carefully at the body youll see that what you have here is the four states of deprivation nothing wonderful at allThe first state of deprivation is the animal kingdom all the worms and germs that live in our stomach and intestines in our blood vessels and in our poresAs long as theres food for these things to eat in there theyre always going to be with us multiplying like crazy making us illOn the outside of the body there are fleas and liceThey like staying with whoever doesnt keep himself clean making his skin red and soreAs for the animals living in the blood vessels and pores they give us rashes and infectionsThe second state of deprivation is the kingdom of hungry ghosts ie the properties of earth water fire and wind in the bodyFirst they feel too cold then too warm then they feel ill then they want to eat this or thatWe have to keep pandering to them running around to find things for them to eat with no chance to stop and restAnd they never have enough  like the hungry ghosts who starve after they die with no one to feed themThese properties keep pestering you and no matter what you do you can never please themFirst the food is too hot so you have to put ice in itThen its too cold so you have to put it back on the stoveAll of this comes down to an imbalance in the properties sometimes good sometimes bad never coming to a stable state of normalcy at all making us suffer in various waysThe third state of deprivation is the land of angry demonsSometimes when we get ill or lose our senses we run around naked without a stitch of clothing as if we were possessed by angry demonsSome people have to undergo operations getting this removed or cutting out that or sucking out this waving their arms and moaning in a way thats really pitifulSome people get so poor that they have nothing to eat they get so thin that theyre all eyeballs and ribs suffering like the angry demons who cant see the brightness of the worldThe fourth state of deprivation is purgatoryPurgatory is the home of the spirits with a lot of bad kamma who have to suffer being roasted speared with redhot iron spikes and pierced with thornsAll the animals whose flesh weve eaten after theyve been killed and cooked gather together in our stomach and then disappear into our body in huge numbersIf you were to count them youd have whole coops of chickens herds of cattle and half a seas worth of fishOur stomach is such a tiny thing and yet no matter how much you eat you can never keep it fullAnd you have to feed it hot things too like the denizens of purgatory who have to live with fire and flameIf theres no fire they cant liveSo theres a big copper frying pan for themAll the various spirits weve eaten gather in the big copper frying pan of our stomach where theyre consumed by the fires of digestion and then they haunt us Their powers penetrate throughout our flesh and blood giving rise to passion aversion and delusion making us squirm as if we were burned by the fires of purgatory tooSo look at the bodyWhose is itIs it really yoursWhere did it come fromNo matter how much you care for it its not going to stay with youItll have to go back to where it came from the properties of earth water fire and windThe fact that its able to stay for a while depends entirely on the breathWhen theres no more breath to it it starts to decay and no one wants it thenYou wont be able to take it with you when you goNo one can take his arms legs feet or hands along with himThis is why we say that the body is notselfIt belongs to the worldAs for the mind its the one that does good and evil and will be reborn in line with its kammaThe mind is what doesnt dieIts the one that experiences all pleasure and painSo when you realize this you should do as much good as you can for your own sakeThe Buddha felt compassion for us and taught us in this way but we dont feel much compassion for ourselvesWe prefer to fill ourselves with sufferingWhen other people teach us its no match for our teaching ourselves for other people will teach us only once in a whileThe possibility of being a common animal a human being a heavenly being or of reaching nibbana all lie within us so we have to choose which one we wantThe good you do is what will go with you in the futureThis is why the Buddha taught us to meditate to contemplate the body to give rise to dispassionIts inconstant stressful and nothing of oursYou borrow it for a while and then have to return itThe body doesnt belong to the mind and the mind doesnt belong to the bodyTheyre separate things that depend on each otherWhen we can see this we have no more worries or attachmentsWe can let go of the body and three hunks of rust  selfidentity views attachments to precepts and practices and uncertainty in the Path  will fall from our heartWell see that all good and evil come from the heartIf the heart is pure thats the highest good in the world Someone once came to Ajaan Lee with a problemSome of his friends had said to him If the bodys notself why cant we hit you Ajaan Lee said to answer them by saying LookIts not mineIve borrowed it so I have to take good care of itI cant let anyone else mistreat itThe Dhamma doesnt belong to anyoneIts common property like unsettled land If we dont lay claim to it by developing it its simply vacant uncleared land without any cropsIf we want to lay claim to it we have to develop it in line with established principles if we want it really to be oursWhen difficulties arise  poverty pain illness and death  well then have something to protect usBut if we havent followed the established principles then well put the blame on the Buddha Dhamma Sangha and inner worth in general for not helping us when these things ariseAnd that will discourage us from developing any inner worth at allThe mind is the most important factor in life the most important factor in the world for its the basic foundation of our inner worthIf the mind is dark and defiled instead of being bright and pure then no matter how much we practice generosity virtue or meditation we wont get any resultsThe Buddha knew that were all going to have to go abroad which is why he taught us to develop inner worth as a way of knowing how to get our provisions readyWe have to know how to get to where we want to go how to dress properly and how to speak their languageWell also have to put money in the bank so that well be able to exchange it for their currencyPutting money in the bank means generosity in making donations and being charitableLearning their language means knowing how to say that we take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaBeing complete in our virtue is like having fashionable clothes to wearYet even if we have funds to exchange good clothes to wear and know how to speak their language but are basically loony  ie our minds are wandering all over the place with no basis in concentration  we still wont pass inspectionThis is why the Buddha wanted us to develop our minds as much as possible making them pure and brightWhen our wealth and inner merit are complete in this way theyll spread to our children and other people around usAll people have inner worth within them but whoever doesnt know how to lay claim to it and develop it wont get any benefit from it at allHuman treasures arent importantThieves and fools can find them with no problem at allBut the treasure of a human rebirth is something that people without virtue cant gainThe Buddha taught that with noble treasures whoever has a lot isnt poor whoever has even a little isnt poorThe important thing is that you give rise to them within yourself and youll always be wealthyFor example if you make up your mind to donate a material object to Buddhism it immediately turns into the noble treasure of generosity in your heartWhen you abstain from evil in your words and deeds they turn into the noble treasure of virtueWhen this is the case your treasures are within youYou havent deposited them with anyone elseYour generosity lies within you your virtue  the virtue of restraint of the senses  lies in your eyes your ears your mouthWhen your treasures are with you like this its like keeping your money in your own pocket without depositing it with anyone else There are bound to be no problemsYou dont have to worry that theyll swindle or cheat youWhen youve got your money right in your own pocket what is there to fearThe Buddha teaches us not to be possessive of thingsLet them go in line with their nature and take only the nourishment they have to offerMaterial things are dregs and leavings their nourishment is the joy we feel when were willing to give them awaySo dont eat the dregsSpit them out so that they can be of use both to others and to yourself in the sense of inner worth that comes from being generousWe have to build up our inner worth our perfections as quickly as possible because our conviction in these things isnt yet sureSome days it shrinks out of sight Thats called turtlehead convictionSome days it stretches back out againSo if it stretches out today act on itTomorrow it may shrink back in againTwo legs two arms two hands two eyes one mouth These are your perfectionsPut them to usePeople who dont believe in goodness rarely do good but people who dont believe in evil do evil all the timeEvil isnt something natural that happens on its ownIt happens only if we do itThe Buddha teaches us to develop inner worth by meditating on good will but you have to be intent on really doing it if you want to get real resultsEven if its only for a short time  the wiggle of an elephants ears or the flicker of a snakes tongue  it can give rise to amazing power like the power of an elephant or a snake in being able to kill off people or other animals in the twinkling of an eyeAll an elephant has to do is wiggle his ears just once and people trip all over themselves trying to run awayBut if youre not really true in what you do the power of truth wont appear in the mind and you wont be able to use it to get any results  like the ear of a dog or a cat It can wiggle all day long and yet it wont cause anyone any fearMindfulness and alertness are the quality of the BuddhaThe cool sense of happiness they give is the quality of the DhammaIf you can maintain that coolness until it hardens into a block of ice  ie you make that goodness solid and strong in your heart  thats the quality of the SanghaOnce youve got a solid block of goodness like this you can pick it up and put it to any use that you likeBeing a slave to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha is called being a slave to a noble family the kind of people we can willingly be slaves toBut being a slave to our moods  cravings and defilements  is like being a slave to bandits and thievesWhat sort of valuables are they going to have to give usBut even though its proper to be a slave to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha its still no match for not having to be a slave to anyone for the word slave means that were not yet freeSo the Buddha teaches us to learn how to depend on ourselves  attahi attano natho the self is its own mainstayThats when well be able to rise up free released from our slavery with no need to have anyone order us around ever againWhen we come to the monastery we come looking for peace and calm so dont go releasing tigers crocodiles and rabid dogs into the monastery grounds endangering everyone who comes hereTigers crocodiles and rabid dogs stand for our very own greed anger and delusionWe have to chain them and cage them and lock them up tightMake absolutely sure that they dont come escaping out your thoughts words and deeds in any wayPeople who dont get ahead in life are the ones whose bodies are human but whose minds drop down to lower levelsIn other words theyre all right in physical terms but not in terms of their mindsFor instance when we come to the monastery we depend on our feet to walk us here but then when we get here if we let our minds and manners fall into lower ways were no different from bats that hook their feet up on high places and then let their heads hang down lowThe Dhamma is an affair of the heartThe words spoken are Dhamma the intention in speaking is Dhamma and you have to make your heart into Dhamma if you want to hear it as DhammaWhen these three factors come together listening to the Dhamma can give countless rewardsWhen we listen to the Dhamma its as if the monk is giving us each a knife its up to us to accept it or notWhen we get back home and run into problems or issues in our families we can use the knife to cut right through themBut if we throw the knife down right here or hand it back to the monk we wont have any weapon to use when we meet up with issues at homeThe study of the Dhamma is like reading a cookbookThe practice of the Dhamma is like fixing foodThe attainment of the Dhamma is like knowing the taste of the foodIf we simply read the texts without putting them into practice its like knowing that there are such things as peppers onions and garlic but without having them for a mealIf you study the Dhamma without practicing it its as if youre missing parts of your bodyIf you study and practice its like having two eyes two hands and two legsYou can do things a lot more easily than a person with only one eye one hand or one legHaving selfrespect means that you respect your thoughts words and deedsRespect for your deeds means that whatever you do you always follow the three principles of skillful action no killing no stealing no illicit sexRespect for your words means that whatever you say you always follow the four principles of skillful speech no lying no divisive talebearing no harsh language and no idle chatterRespect for your thoughts means that whatever you think you always follow the three principles of the skillful mind trying to keep your views straight with no greed or ill willHaving broken precepts is better than not having any precepts to breakWearing torn clothes is better than going around nakedLots of dead beings have gone into your mouth  pigs chickens cattle etc so make sure that it isnt possessed by their spiritsBefore you say anything no matter what your intention look right and left and speak only when youre sure that its just right for the situationDont give in to bad mannersConcerning Right Livelihood Even if our basic livelihood is honest but we practice it dishonestly its considered wrongFor example were farmers but we lay claim to other peoples fields as our own This is Wrong Livelihood and the crops we grow on that land will do us harmThere are two kinds of foulness the kind the Buddha praised and the kind he criticizedThe kind he praised is the filth and foulness of the body for it makes us see clearly the aging and unattractiveness of compounded things so that the mind will gain a chastened sense of dispassion grow disenchanted with its attachment to suffering and set its sights on developing its inner worth so as to escape from that sufferingAs for the foulness the Buddha criticized thats the foulness of an evil mind which defiles our thoughts words and deedsThis is something the Buddha criticized and penalized in very heavy termsSo we have to keep washing off our actions in all situationsOnly when our thoughts words and deeds are clean will wise people praise us as being uncomplacent and goodRestraint of the senses means that we bring the senses and their objects into proportion with one anotherFor instance guarding the eyes means that we dont let our eyes get bigger than the sights they see and we dont let the sights get bigger than the eyesIf the sights are bigger than the eyes they get lodged thereWe think about them night and dayIf the eyes are bigger than the sights that means we cant get enough of those sights and keep wanting to see them moreIn either case we give rise to greed and delusionThe fires of passion aversion and delusion burn our eyes and make us sufferOne important noble treasure is meditation keeping the mind from wandering aimlessly around in all kinds of issuesWhen we keep the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in mind its as if we were soaking in their virtuesWhen thats the case the mind will have to become saturated with inner worthIts the same as if we were to take a handful of bitter herbs and soak them in syrup until the syrup saturates themTheir bitterness will disappear and be replaced with sweetnessNo matter how shoddy a persons mind if it gets constantly soaked in goodness it will have to become more and more refined like bitter herbs sweetened in syrupWhatever you do be true in doing it if you want to meet up with the truthIf youre really true in what you do doing just a little bit can be enoughOne million in real money is better than ten million in counterfeit billsWhen you speak stay right with your speakingWhatever you do stay right with what youre doingWhen you eat stay with your eating when you stand stay with your standing when you walk stay with your walking when youre sitting stay with your sitting when youre lying down stay with your lying downDont let your mind get ahead of the truthThe heart is like food in a serving dishMindfulness is like a cover over the dishIf you lack mindfulness its as if you left the dish uncovered Flies are sure to come and land on it and contaminate it with all sorts of germs so that the food becomes toxic and can make you sickSo you always have to be careful to keep the dish coveredDont let flies land on itThat way your heart will be clean and pure and will give rise to wisdom and knowledgeA deserted house a house where someone has died gives you the chillsOnly if there are people in the house will you feel secureA person who is not mindful of the present is like a deserted houseWhen you see such a person you dont feel secureDefilements are like sand bars or stumps in a river that will keep our boat from getting to shoreIn other words passion is something that snags us anger is something that bumps into us and delusion is something that makes us spin around and sinkTheres a story they tell of two men who were hired to row a boat along the rivers and canals to sell plowshares shovels and hoesIf they sold all the wares in the boat their employer would give them their full wages of one kahapana which was equal to about four dollars a dayThe first day their employer went out with them and they sold all their waresAfter that he didnt go out with them so the two of them went out to sell their wares on their ownOne day as they were out rowing along calling out Plowshares shovels and hoes their minds wandered and they started getting drowsyAll of a sudden they crashed smack into a stump and ran aground on a sandbarEven after they got free they were so shaken up that instead of calling out Plowshares shovels and hoes they started calling out Sandbars and stumpsSandbars and stumps all along the river but nobody wanted to buyWhen evening came they rowed back to their employers house their boat still full of plowshares shovels and hoesThey hadnt been able to sell a thingSo the employer gave them each only a dollar for their days wagesOne of the men took the money back to his wife who was surprised to see that she was getting only one dollar instead of the usual fourMaybe hes given the rest of the money to another woman she thought so she gave him a piece of her mindNo matter how much he tried to explain things she wouldnt listenSo he told her to go ask the employerIf what he said wasnt true hed be willing to let her hit him once on the headThe wife impatient because she was so angry said No let me hit you first and then Ill go ask As she said this she reached for a shovel handle but all she could grab was the stick they used to drive the dog out of the house so she used that to bash her husband three times on the headLater of course she found out the truth but by that time it was too late for the husband had already gotten three free hits on the headThis story shows the harm that can come from not being mindfulIf you let your mind wander away from what youre doing you can end up getting yourself into troubleTheres danger that comes from being goodIf youre not especially good nobody gets fixated on youThe important thing is that you know how to use your goodness to your benefitIf youre a good person but dont know how to use your goodness  ie you use it at the wrong time or place or in a way that gets other people upset  it wont benefit you and will instead cause you harmIn this way your goodness turns into evilSo you have to be circumspect in how you let your goodness showKeep your evil intentions to yourself and be careful with your good intentions tooIts like handing a knife to a person You may have good intentions hoping that hell put it to good use but if he uses it to kill someone your intentions backfire on both of youGoodness comes from evil in that once you really take a good look at evil it losesWhatever you look at look at it from all sidesThis is why they dont let you look a long time at pretty things or beautiful women because after a while youll see that they arent all that beautiful after allSo if you see something lovely look at it long and hard until you see that its not as lovely as you thoughtIf someone makes you angry contemplate them until you feel compassion for themThe same principle holds for delusionIf youre wise then greed anger and delusion can help youIf youre wise even desire can help you by making you want to develop your inner worthSo dont look down on these thingsYoure sitting here listening to a sermonWhat made you comeDesire didWhen people ordain as monks and novices what gave the orderCravingSo dont look only at the drawbacks of craving and desireIf you dont have the desire to be good you cant develop inner worthPeople who develop their inner worth have to start out with the intention to do itIgnorance is good in that when we know were ignorant well do something to remedy the situationIgnorance leads us astray but in the end it will lead us backKnowledge never led anyone to look for learningIgnorance is what leads people to look for knowledgeIf you already know whats there to look forWhen we practice the Dhamma it gives three kinds of benefits We help ourselves gain release from suffering we help other people and we help keep the religion aliveWherever there are effects there always have to be causesThe world we experience comes from the heart as its causeIf the heart is good the world will have to be goodIf the heart is bad the world will have to be badThe mind when its not with the body in the present is world When its with the body in the present its DhammaIf its world it has to be as hot as fireIf its Dhamma its as cool as waterDont be complacentRemind yourself that were all being chased out of the world day by dayIn other words aging rears up illness roars and death runs up the scoreSo dont be oblivious partying around with your defilementsAssociate with the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha until your mind develops Right ConcentrationThat way you wont have anything to fear from the dangers of the worldBelieving other people is all right but its not really specialIts like borrowing money Well have to share the return on our investment with our lendersWhen we dont yet know cant yet have any real conviction in ourselves and still have to believe what other people say its like being an infant who has to depend on its parentsIf we dont get stronger well have to keep being nursed all the way through old ageIf we dont try to train the mind until its firm and unwavering it wont give rise to the strength of concentration and will have to keep on being a childWhen were able to shake off all the issues in the mind leaving just the mind in and of itself three gems will appear in it the Gem of the Buddha the Gem of the Dhamma and the Gem of the SanghaOnce these three gems appear within us we wont have to load ourselves down by carrying around much of anything elseSimply put them under your arm if you like or even up your noseWhen you have this kind of wealth your mind can be light and noble treasures will arise within youIn other words conviction in the qualities of the Buddha will appear within the mindThen you practice in line with those qualities until you gain the various results they have to offerYoull see the true Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in your heartIf you try to take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha on the outer level youre going to die for sureThe Buddha on the outer level entered nibbana a long time agoThe Dhamma on the outer level is just letters in booksThe Sangha on the outer level is the monks with shaven heads and yellow robes that you see roaming all over the countryIf you try to hold onto these things its like carrying a heavy hoe that wont do you any goodBut if you hold onto the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha within you and then put them into practice youll realize that what youre looking for is right here in the heartAnd then what do you wantTo return to the human stateTo attain a heavenly stateTo attain nibbanaOr go to hellTheyre all possible without your having to look for them anywhere elseThe Buddha taught that the five aggregates are a heavy burden because they all get to the point where we cant bear carrying them around anymore and have to throw them down in the mudIf you dont keep cleansing them they keep getting heavier and heavierIf you then try to go depending on other people you weigh them down and you yourself are helplessThis is because stashing things away in the heart is like taking pictures without ever developing the filmWhat you eat gets put on the film what you say gets put on the film what you hear gets put on the film but thats as far as it gets on the filmYouve never stopped to look at what kind of pictures you have pretty or uglyIf you want to see your pictures you have to take the film into the darkroom by closing your eyes and practicing concentration attaining the first jhana directing your thoughts to the present and evaluating it until you can see yourself clearlyIf you dont go into the darkroom now someday the King of Death is going to blindfold you tie up your feet and hands and drag you into his darkroomIn other words when youre on the verge of death you wont be able to open your mouth or eyesNobody will be able to feed youYoull want to eat but wont be able to eatYoull want to speak but wont be able to speakYour ears will get closed off so that you cant hear anything clearlyYou wont be able to see your parents family children or grandchildrenYou wont be able to tell them your last wishesThats called the darkroom of the King of DeathThe mind is the only thing that senses pleasure and painThe body has no sense of these things at allIts like taking a knife to murder someone They dont hunt down the knife and punish itThey punish only the person who used it to commit murderIf your mind isnt good then the goodness of your actions isnt really good and the goodness of your words isnt really good eitherYou have to develop power within yourself like stocking up on gunpowderIf a gun has no gunpowder it cant be used to destroy anythingPeople who have to be servants are the ones who lack the power to be anyone elses bossAs for the people who have that power all they have to do is point their fingers and other people will jump up and runIf we dont develop our own powers well have to be servants  slaves to defilement  throughout timeThe body is like a knifeIf you have a knife but dont keep sharpening it it will get coated thick with rustIn the same way if you have a body  physical elements aggregates and sense media  but dont train it and keep it polished itll get coated thick with defilementsIf it were a gun it wouldnt even kill a flyNormally the mind doesnt like to stay where it isIt keeps flowing out the eyes ears nose tongue and body  like a river that splits into five streams instead of flowing as oneIn a river like that the force of the current is weakened and cant run at full strengthIn addition to flowing out the five senses the mind also leaks out through thoughts of the past and future instead of staying firm in the presentThis is why the mind has no peace or strength because it never gets to restWhen the mind loses strength the body loses strength as well and wont be able to succeed at anythingIf the mind doesnt stay with the body in the present and instead wanders around exposed to external perceptions its bound to get into all sorts of difficulties just like a person who doesnt stay in his house and instead goes running around outsideHes bound to be exposed to sun and rain and he may get run over by a car or bitten by a rabid dogIf we stay in our home then even though there may still be some dangers they wont be too serious and we wont get into difficultiesWhen the mind isnt quiet its like running around with a flaming torchYoure bound to burn yourselfOnly when you stop running will you be able to cool downPeople who accumulate merit but dont develop the hearts foundation are like people who own land but dont have a deedThey might be able to sell it for money but theyre an easy mark for a swindler because they dont have any firm basis for their claimIf you practice generosity and virtue but not meditation its like taking a bath on a hot day only from the waist downIf you dont bathe all the way from the head on down you wont get totally refreshed because the coolness doesnt go all the way to the heartExternal merit  generosity and virtue  is like the skin of a fruitInternal merit  meditation  is like the flesh of the fruitYou cant have one without the otherIf fruit doesnt have skin its flesh wont growIf it has skin but no flesh you cant eat itEach helps the other but they differ in qualityExternal merit is what protects internal merit while the internal merit nourishes merit outsideToday Im going to talk about how to drill a wellThis is a difficult skill not like simply digging or plowingWe all want happiness but we dont really know what happiness isReal happiness is nothing other than the inner worth and skillfulness of the heartSo where are we going to find inner worthInner worth is like a wellThe first kind of well is simply a depression in the ground for catching rain water like a pondWe cant get too much use out of this kind of well because there are times when water buffaloes cattle and other animals get in the water to bathe and drink making it muddyIf you want to use the water you have to filter it many timesThis kind of well is like generosity which gives only shallow rewards like the water in a shallow depressionThe second kind of well is like a deep reservoirCattle cant bathe or drink in itThe only animals that go into the reservoir are toads and frogs but even so if we want to use the water we have to filter it firstThis kind of well is like the virtue of observing the precepts which gives deeper rewards than generosityThe third kind of well is an artesian well with a constantly running springNo matter how much water you use it never runs dryThis kind of well is so deep that even mosquitoes cant get down into the waterTo drill this kind of well you need to use a drill with a diamond bit and a strong steel shaft if you want to reach the underground waterThis kind of well is like meditation because you have to use strong mindfulness discernment persistence and endurance if you want to succeed at drillingMindfulness has to be like the diamond bit and endurance the steel shaftWhen you use your persistence to drill on down the results will arise as inner worth and skillfulness that keep flowing in bathing the mind like the waters of immortality that provide the mind with a constant stream of refreshment and delightIf we dont have a safe place for our inner worth how is it going to help usIts like raising horses or cows but not fencing in a place for them to stayIf they go wandering off its your fault not theirsIf you dont practice virtue concentration and discernment on your own youre going to get taken in by the symbols of refuge and never get to the real thingThe symbols of refuge are Buddha images which are just symbols of the Buddha Buddhist texts which are symbols of the Dhamma and Buddhist monks and nuns who are symbols of those who have practiced rightly and well until becoming noble disciplesIf you get stuck on the outer level youll never meet with the real thingInner worth is like moneyIf your pocket has a hole itll let your money slip right throughIf you do things that give rise to inner worth but dont keep that worth in your heart it wont stay with youWhen youre about to die and you call on it to help you what will there be to answer your callWhen this is the case you cant criticize all the good things youve done for not helping youYou have to put the blame on yourselfIf you stick a dollar in your pocket but your pocket is torn then when the time comes to buy a cup of coffee you wont have any money to buy itIn that case what are you going to blame the money or your pocketTo practice meditation is like harvesting your crop of inner worth and eating itIf you dont harvest it itll spoilIf you eat it in time itll nourish your bodyIf you dont eat it in time itll go to wasteIf you dont take your inner worth into your heart youll never feel fullGenerosity is something that poor people cant practice but crazy people canVirtue is something that crazy people cant practice but poor people canAs for meditation everyone can practice it no matter what their age sex or station in lifeA mind without concentration is like a pile of wooden posts left lying on the ground for people and animals to step all overBut if we stand the posts up and plant them in the soil we can get good use out of themEven if theyre not tall  only a meter or so  but we put them close together in a line we can fence in our yard and prevent people and animals from coming in and traipsing all over our propertyIts the same with the mindIf we take a firm stance in concentration as the hearts foundation keeping our mindfulness and alertness close together in line we can keep defilements from slipping into the mind and making it soiledThe Dhamma is something constant and trueThe reason we dont see the truth is because were always on the moveIf were riding in a car we cant clearly see the things that pass near by us on the road such as how big the stones on the ground are their color or shapeWe look at trees and mountains and they all seem to be on the moveIf weve been in a car since birth without stopping to get out and walk around on our own were sure to think that cars run trees run and mountains runWhat we see isnt in line with the truthThe running is in us in the car not in the mountains and treesWhoever develops concentration will end up with three eyesIn other words your outer left eye will see good things your outer right eye will see bad things and theyll send them in to the inner eye which will remain normalYoull also have three ears Your outer left ear will hear praise your outer right ear will hear criticism and theyll send them in to the inner ear which will stay normalThis is how you can receive all the guests the world sends your wayAs for the eye of the mind  intuitive insight  it will receive your defilementsOnce it really understands them it will be able to send them packingThat way youll be able to live in the world without sufferingIf you really apply yourself you can accomplish all kinds of things even with a single pocket knifeIn the same way if you really apply yourself to making the mind still you can get much better results than a person who studies and memorizes hundreds and thousands of textsMaking the mind still is something we can all doIf it were beyond our powers the Buddha wouldnt have taught us to do itThe paths and fruitions leading to nibbana arent the property of stupid people and they dont belong to smart people eitherThey belong to those who are true and really determined in developing goodness for themselvesThe body is like a mountain containing all kinds of mineralsTheres gold silver and diamond ore buried here in this rock  ie the Unconditioned is in hereAnd theres also the Conditioned which is like trees weeds dirt and rocks where all sorts of people and animals  monkeys tigers and elephants  dwellAs for the gold and silver theyre not a dwelling place for animals at allSo if we act like monkeys tigers and elephants well meet up with nothing but trees weeds dirt and rocksWell never meet up with things of value like silver or goldTo act like monkeys means that we never apply ourselves to anythingWe wander everywhere with no fixed place to eat or sleep swinging from branch to branch as we feel like itWhat this means is that our minds have no firm place to stay no concentrationWe wander here and there in the past and future in our thoughts and moods with no time to stop and stay in placeThis is what it means to act like a monkeyAs for tigers theyre violent and fierceThis stands for the anger that arises in the human heart and erupts outward smothering whatever goodness we may haveAs for elephants they like to hear nothing but sweet words and praiseThey cant take criticism at allThis is like people who when they do something wrong cant stand to be told that its wrongIf they do something right and get a little praise they smile until their cheeks hurtThis is what it means to be like an elephantSo we have to get rid of the monkeys tigers and elephants in ourselves so that we can turn into human beingsThat way we can look at our mountain and realize that if we want valuable things well be able to get valuable things out of itIf we want worthless things well get worthless things out of itWe can then gather all kinds of treasuresWe can level the dirt and turn it into fieldsWe can take the rocks and extract the silver and goldAs for the trees we can cut them down and turn them into firewood or charcoal so that we can cook our food and fire our smelter or else turn them into posts and boards so that we can build ourselves a homeAll of these things well be able to get from our mountain but we have to apply ourselves and really be persistentIf we want silver and gold we have to set up a smelter and heat the rocks to see which elements are there in a pure form and which ones are mixedThis is how we do it We have to get a lot of fuel we have to set up a furnace and we have to start a fireOnly then will we be able to extract the ore from our rockFinding lots of fuel means being willing to let go of things both inside and outAs for setting up a furnace we have to find a place with good solid ground and a roof that doesnt leakThis stands for our persistenceOnce weve got our furnace we start a fireThis refers to the ardency of our practiceOnce our practice is ardent the various elements in our rock  the body  will melt and separate out on their own just as when they melt down minerals the silver lead and tin etc will separate out on their ownThe same holds true with the bodyWhen it undergoes ardent inspection by the mind the pure ore and the various impurities will separate out of their own accordBut most meditators nowadays want to separate things out even before theyve put their rock into the smelterThey think things out on their own without a single one of the tools needed for smeltingNo fuel no furnace no fire a leaky roof and a piece of cavedin ground What are they going to smeltThey say that the transcendent has to be like this insight meditation has to be like that streamentry has to be like this you have to let go like this and that in order to reach this and that stage the stages of oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship have to be reached in this and that way the four levels of jhana have to be done in this and that wayThey try to separate things out in line with their own ideas but no matter how much they try they cant get things to separate because they dont have any fuel any fire any furnaceWhere are they going to get any resultsResults dont come from thinkingThey come from the qualities we build into the mindSo dont try to separate things out in line with your own notionsSome people see a person carrying a big hunk of rock to his home and think that hes a stupid foolFirst of all the rock is heavy and besides  what can there be of any value in a plain old rockSo they take a shovel to the mountain to dig up only the silver and gold  not too much just some tiny light nuggets to wrap up and carry back home in a clothBut they end up with nothing at all because the nuggets they want are firmly embedded in the mountain theyll need more than a shovel to get them outAs for the stupid person as soon as he gets home he clears out a space builds a furnace gathers fuel starts a fire and throws the rock inWhen the rock is subjected to strong heat the various ores in the rock will begin to melt and to separateThe silver will come seeping out and go one way the gold another the tin and lead another the diamond another without getting mixedThis way the stupid person will be able to choose the silver gold and diamond as he likesAs for the people who think theyre intelligent who know that this is this and that is that that you have to reach this level before you can reach that level that concentration is like this insight meditation is like that the transcendent is like this In the end they have nothing to swallow but their own salivaThey gain no valuables at allThe person who thinks hes stupid when he encounters something has to keep contemplating reflecting digging away until he comes to an understandingIf we want happiness we have to give rise to the causesGather a lot of fuelWhat this means is that were willing to give up the sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas within ourselves as well as being generous with outside things by making donations observing the precepts and practicing meditationThis is how we burn away our defilements through the perfection of generosityThe perfection of generosity is excellent fuel for roasting our defilementsSet up a furnaceThis stands for the effort we put into abandoning physical pleasure and sitting in meditation thinking of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as a way of calming the mindThen we keep pumping the breath into the body in the same way that they pump air into a furnace for casting a bronze Buddha imageWe make the heart steady and firm with mindfulness and alertness constantly in controlThis way the inner fire of our ardency will get stronger and strongerAs we keep pumping the breath in the sense of inner light will get brighter and brighterOnce youre able to keep this up gather your body and mind together into oneDont try to crack or divide them up at all for thats the way of a fool who thinks he knows everything beforehandAs the fire of our ardency keeps getting stronger the various elements in the body will melt and separate out of their own accordWhen you practice the Dhamma dont worry about how its going to goDont try to plan or arrange things to go this way or thatWhen the fire of your practice reaches full strength all the various impurities will fall away on their own leaving just the pure oreThe rock clinging to the ore  the various Hindrances  will fall away from the heartBut if your furnace is full of holes the fire will flicker outside and the heat inside will dissipateYou wont be able to burn away the hearts various impuritiesSo you have to learn how to act like a person making charcoalStart a fireWhen people make charcoal they start their fire and then close off their furnace leaving just a tiny air ventWith the furnace entirely closed off in this way the wood they place in the furnace wont burn up or turn into ashesWhen they finally open the furnace theyll find hard highquality charcoalIn the same way once we can remember our meditation word without getting distracted the closing off of the furnace means that we close off the various perceptions that register by way of the eyes ears nose tongue body and intellectWe close off the Hindrances and dont let the mind flicker out after outside perceptionsOnce everything is closed off in this way the wood will keep smoldering away in the furnaceWhen the time comes to open it up well find that there are no ashes and that weve ended up with good hard charcoal of high qualityThe solid goodness we develop in the heart is like charcoal that we can then use to smelt our oreThis way the elements within us will gain strength able to separate themselves into the Conditioned and the UnconditionedOnce we give rise to the four stages of jhana unskillful mental states  the rock  will separate out and fall awaySensual desire will separate out ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty will all separate out and fall awayThe mind will be totally absorbed in jhana with directed thought and evaluation in chargeJust this is enough for insight to ariseWell be able to see clearly whats diamond whats silver and whats goldThe silver is the sense of fullness or rapture the gold is the sense of pleasure and ease that arises withinOnce theres pleasure no disturbances will appear in the mind like a burning lantern when theres no wind to disturb the flameThis is the light of the Dhamma or the brilliance of discernment ie insight meditation arisingWell see the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha withinThe heart will give rise to treasuresThis is like setting up a furnace and using charcoal to smelt oreThe various elements in the rock will separate out leaving the UnconditionedInsight meditation is the fire we use to heat the rockIf we want things to separate out like this we have to use insight meditationDont try to separate things out on your ownWhatever is going to turn into light ashes charcoal or smoke will do so of its own accordThis is how we get past the ConditionedThe Unconditioned will separate out to one side the Conditioned to anotherThis way well get to see whats really trueBut however things separate out you have to keep using your discernment even furtherIf you get attached to good things they can backfire on youIf you get attached to bad youve gone wrongWhen we practice breath meditation weve been given methods for warding off the various Hindrances that will destroy the good results of what were doingWere told to focus on the inandout breath and to keep mindfulness in charge together with the meditation word buddho buddho in and out with the breathIf you want just to think buddho you can but its too lightYour awareness wont go deepIts the nature of shallow things that dust and dirt can blow in easily and fill them up quicklyAs for deep things dust and dirt cant easily blow inIn the same way when the mind is deep it isnt easily affected by preoccupationsSo when you simply focus on buddho buddho it doesnt carry much weightIts like taking a knife and slicing away at the airYou dont feel much of anything because theres nothing for the knife to strike againstBut if you take the same knife and use it to slice away at a stump or any other object youll feel that your hand has more weight and your arm gains strength able to ward off any enemies that may threaten youThis is why were taught to focus on a single spot so that the mind will gain strength solid and steady in a single preoccupationTake as your target any of the meditation objects in the basic list of fortyYour mind will gain strength your mindfulness will mature into Right Mindfulness and Right ConcentrationBuddho is the meditation wordBeing mindful and alert to the inandout breath is the actual meditationOnce the mind is in place you can let go of your meditation wordThe meditation word is like baitFor example if we want a chicken to come our way we scatter rice on the groundOnce the chicken comes for the rice we dont have to scatter any moreBeing mindful remembering to stay with the breath is one thingAlertness  examining the breath sensations that flow throughout the entire body knowing whether the breath feels constricted or broad shallow or deep heavy or light fast or slow  is something elseTogether they form the component factors of meditationThe inandout breath is like the wick of a candle or a lanternFocusing mindfulness on the breath is like lighting the wick so that it gives off lightA single candle if its wick is lit can burn down an entire cityIn the same way mindfulness can destroy all the bad things within us defilement unawareness craving and attachmentMindfulness is the consuming fire of the practiceBeing mindful of the breath is like casting a Buddha image inside yourselfYour body is like the furnace mindfulness is like the moldIf mindfulness lapses the bronze will leak out of the mold and your Buddha image will be ruinedLetting mindfulness lapse is like getting a hole in your clothesLetting it lapse again is like getting a second holeIf you keep letting it lapse its like getting a third fourth fifth and sixth hole in your clothes until ultimately you cant wear themThere are three ways in which mindfulness lapsesThe first is by bringing inside things out to think aboutIn other words you grab hold of any lights or visions that may appear and in this way your path washes outThe second way is by bringing outside things in to think about ie abandoning your meditation objectThe third way is by losing consciousnessYou sit there but its as if you were asleepAll of these things are called a washedout path like a road that washes out and is full of deep potholesTo keep preoccupations out of the mind is to cut a path in the mindTo let outside preoccupations in is to let the path wash outWhen the path washes out theres no way that insight or discernment will arise just as when a road washes out no cars or trucks can run along itWhen concentration gets extinguished in this way you cant practice insight meditationTheres nothing left but thoughts about insight thoughts about concentration thinking guessing groping in line with your old preconceptionsThe virtues of your heart disappear without your realizing itIf you want to go back and start all over its hard  like going back over a washedout roadThe mind in concentration is like genuine silver malleable and white because nothing else is adulterating itWe can make it into whatever we want easily and quickly without having to waste time placing it in a crucible and heating it to get rid of the impuritiesThe mind not in concentration is like imitation or adulterated silver hard brittle and black because its mixed with copper or leadThe more the impurities the lower its valueA pure mind is thus like genuine silverThe various thoughts that darken the mind are like the impurities that make the silver black brittle and dullSo if we let thoughts get mixed up in the mind we turn the mind into imitation silverWe wont be able to find any purity in it at allWhen this is the case the mind will have no stillnessBut if we brush away the various thoughts and preoccupations adulterating the mind it will become firmly established in concentration in line with the factors of the pathOnce the mind turns into the path we have to watch over it carefully in the same way that we try to keep a road from washing outWe have to survey it continually to see where its getting rutted or forming potholesWherever it needs repairing we fix it right awayIf we dont fix it immediately and let it get full of potholes or wash away itll be really hard to repairOnce the mind is following the path any Hindrances that interfere are a break in the roadIf we dont hurry up and repair it the break will get wider and deeper until the road turns into an ordinary piece of groundSo while youre trying to develop the path if you let yourself be forgetful  if you let your mindfulness lapse letting distractions into the mind  the state of mind that forms the path will immediately be destroyedYour meditation will be spoiled your concentration will be spoiled the mind will return to its ordinary state and wont be able to find the path to genuine goodnessWhile were sitting in concentration if our mind doesnt stay with the body in the present its as if weve earned some food but dont watch over itDogs and cats are bound to come and eat itThe dogs and cats here are the five Hindrances  sensual desire ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty  that we like to keep as our petsAs soon as our back is turned theyre going to sneak in and eat up our food  the happiness and inner worth that we should have received from our practiceBeing lost is better than being asleepBeing aware even if you have defilements is better than being absentmindedIf you know you have defilements you can work to end themA person whos not aware is deadIf your mind doesnt stay in one place its like standing on a lawn If you stand in ten different places the grass will grow in all ten places because first you stand here for a while and then go stand there for a while and then go stand over thereIf you dont stay long in any one place grass will grow everywhereBut if you really stand still in one place how will the grass grow thereNo grass will be able to grow on the spot where the soles of your feet are standingIn the same way if your mind stands firm in one place always mindful of the inandout breath no Hindrances or defilements will be able to ariseThe path were following is a shortcutIts a path worn smoothFollowing a smooth path means that there are no weeds growing on it no obstacles in our way no need to stop here and there and slow down our progressThe reason we dont yet know how to follow this path is because we dont know how to walkWe walk like people in general all over the world going forward turning back looking left and rightThis is why we keep running into one another all the time falling down and then picking ourselves back upSometimes even when nobody runs into us we staggerEven when nobody trips us up we fallSometimes we get lazy and lie down to restSometimes we stop to look at things we meet along the wayThis way we never get to the goal because we arent really intent on walkingWe wander here and there without following the pathSo we have to learn a new way to walk the Buddhas wayWhat is the Buddhas wayThe Buddhas way of walking is to walk like a soldierSoldiers dont stagger back and forth the way we doThey walk standing up straight staying in place stamping their feet on the groundThis way they dont get tired because they dont have to go farIf we were to walk in place for three hours the grass beneath our feet would be flattened outAny grass that tried to grow in its place wouldnt be able to get above ground levelIts the same with the work were doing right now being mindful to focus on the breathIf were really intent on it focusing our attention solely on the breath without letting it wander off and disappear all the various Hindrances  thoughts of past and future good and bad  wont be able to reach in to touch usAll the Hindrances which are like grass will have to be flattened outNo evil unskillful thoughts will be able to appear in the heartWhen this is the case the mind wont have to follow the paths to deprivation and instead will keep following the path that goes higher and higherThis is called following the path worn smooth in line with the Buddhas wayPracticing meditation is like digging a diamond mineThe body is like a big rock mindfulness is like a shovelIf you dont really dig  ie if you dig little shallow holes here and there instead of digging away at one place  you can dig for a month and yet get no deeper than your kneesBut if youre really intent on digging away at one place the hole you dig will keep getting deeper and deeper until you get down to the rockNow when stupid people hit the rock they throw down their shovels and run awayAs for intelligent people when they meet up with the rock they keep chipping away at it until they get past it and thats when they find the valuable diamond that lies on the underside of the rockIf its a diamond seam they wont have to work again for the rest of their livesGems and diamonds that are really valuable lie deep so well have to dig deep if we want to find things of valueIf we dont go far beneath the surface well end up with dirt and sand that sells for only five cents a bushelWhen were true in what we do  when we dont stop or grow lax or give up  the results even if they show up slowly are bound to be greatThe fact that they are all growing at once is what makes them slowIts like a tree with lots of branches to protect itself and give lots of shadeIts bound to grow more slowly than a banana tree which has only one stem and gives good fruit but is exposed to lots of dangersSome people get results quickly others more slowlyThe slower people shouldnt compare themselves or compete with the quick onesThe quick ones shouldnt compete with the slow onesIts like polishing boards and mirrorsPolishing a mirror so that you can see your reflection in it doesnt take all that much talent because the nature of the mirror is already reflectiveBut to polish a board so that you can see your reflection in it even though it may take a long time is a sign of real expertiseIn keeping the mind pure we have to cut away perceptions so that they dont stick in the heartIts like looking after a white sheet that we spread on our bedWe have to watch out for the dust or insects that blow in on the wind and land on the sheetIf we see any dust we have to take the sheet and shake it outWherever there are any stains we have to launder it immediatelyDont let them stay long on the sheet or else theyll be hard to wash outIf there are any insects we have to remove them for they may bite us and give us a rash or keep us from sleeping soundlyWhen we keep looking after our sheet in this way it will have to stay clean and white and be a comfortable place for us to sleepThe dust and insects here are the Hindrances that are the enemies of the heartWe have to look after our heart in just the same way that we look after our beddingWe cant let any outside perceptions come in and stick to the heart or nibble at itWe have to brush them all awayThat way the mind will become calm free from distractionsOnce you cut off thoughts of past and future you dont have to worry about the HindrancesWhen you think about things outside you have to choose carefully what youre going to think aboutThink only about good things and not about things that will cause harmWhen you think about things inside though you can think about anything good or bad old or newIn other words mindfulness and alertness can handle whatever comes their wayIts as if we have our curry in a pot thats tightly covered where no flies can get to itWhether its bland or salty its all safe to eatThinking about is longThinking of is shortYou have to focus them both into one when youre making the mind stillThinking of means that you focus on a single preoccupationThinking about means that you examine and evaluate to see that when you arrange the causes a certain way what results do you get good or badIf you look with both of your eyes you wont be able to see your target clearlyIf you want to see it clearly you have to look with one eye in the same way that when people shoot a rifle or an arrow they use only one eye to aimIf you make your mind one with its object youll be able to see things clearly within yourself in just the same wayYou have to practice concentration in all four posturesWhen the body sits the mind sits with itWhen the body stands the mind stands with itWhen the body walks the mind walks with itWhen the body lies down the mind lies down with itIf the body sits but the mind stands or if the body walks and the mind sits or lies down thats no good at allThe six elements in the body are earth water fire wind space and consciousnessYou have to keep familiarizing yourself with them until they become your friendsTheyll then tell you their secrets and wont put you in chains or throw you in prisonThe mind is like a childMindfulness is like an adultThe adult is responsible for looking after the child and taking good care of itOnly then will the child eat and sleep properly without crying and making a fussYou have to give the child good food to eat by focusing the mind on the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThen you have to give it four big dolls to play with the properties of earth water fire and wind in the bodyWhen the child is wellfed and has dolls to play with it wont run outside and get into mischiefIf you let it go wandering outside all kinds of dangers can happenBut if it stays in the house even though there are some dangers theyre not all that seriousYou have to teach the mind how to play around in the elements of this body a cubit wide a span thick a fathom longThat way it wont get into troubleOnce the child gets tired of playing it will lie in its cribIn other words the mind will settle down in jhana the resting place of sagesThat way the mind will gather into onenessWhen the body is still you gain knowledge from the bodyWhen the mind is still you gain knowledge from the mindWhen the breath is still you gain knowledge from the breathOrdinary everyday breathing doesnt do anything special for you except keep you from dyingThe breathing on which your awareness is intent can give rise to all kinds of good thingsOrdinary breathing is the breath of suffering and stressIn other words when it comes in it reaches a point of discomfort so it has to go back outWhen it goes out it runs into discomfort again so it comes back inThis kind of breathing isnt called meditationMeditation means gathering all your awareness into the mindThe present aspect of the body is the breathThe present aspect of the mind is mindfulness and alertnessSo bring the present of the mind together with the present of the bodyThe breath is like waterMindfulness is like soapThe mind is like clothingIf you dont keep washing the mind itll get dirtyWhen your clothing isnt white and clean it doesnt feel comfortable to wearDont put pressure on the breath force it or hold itLet the breath flow easily and comfortably as when you put a fresh egg in cotton battingIf you dont throw it or push it down the egg wont get dented or crackedThis way your meditation will progress smoothlyIf the mind isnt yet still just watch the inandout breath without trying to notice whether its comfortable or notOtherwise the mind will start to strayIts like a farmer planting an orchard If he mows down too much grass all at once he wont be able to plant all his trees in time and the grass will start growing againHe has to mow down just the area that he can plant in one dayThats how hell get the results he wantsWhether or not the breath is even you have to keep your mindfulness evenThe breath is like wavesMindfulness is like a boatThe mind is like a person sitting in the boatIf the waves of the breath arent still the boat will tip or overturn and the person in the boat will drown or at the least get into difficultiesYou have to make your mind still like a boat that has cast anchor in the middle of the sea when theres no wind or wavesThe boat wont tip and the person in the boat will be still and at peaceThis is the point where the mind enters the noble path Its a free mind with full power released from the sway of the HindrancesThe breath in the body isnt limited just to the breath that flows in and out the noseThe breath in the body spreads out to every pore like the vapor that gets exhaled from an ice cubeIts much more refined than the air outsideWhen the internal breath goes out the pores it gets reflected back into the bodyThis breath is called the supporting breathIt helps keep the body and mind cool and stillSo when you breathe in let the breath fill the inside of your body when you breathe out let it spread in all directionsWhen you breathe in you have to feel the effects of the inner breath in three parts of the body the lungs  heart the liver stomach  intestines and the rib cage  spineIf the breath doesnt have an effect all over the body youre not getting the full results of concentrationHot breathing is destructiveIt gives rise to pain and makes the body ageCool breathing is constructiveWarm breathing is like medicineThe common breath is like an emeticThe refined breathed is like a curativeThe intermediate breath is like a food supplementThe common breath is long and slowThe refined breath is short and lightIt can penetrate into every blood vesselIts a breath of extremely high qualityIf the breath is heavy you can keep it in a narrow rangeWhen its light you have to make it broadIf its so light that its very refined you dont have to breathe through the noseYou can be aware of the breath coming in and out through every pore all over the bodyWherever theres pain in the body focus on making the breath go past it if you want to get resultsSuppose you have a pain in your knee You have to focus on breathing all the way down to the ends of your toesIf you have a pain in your shoulder focus the breath past it to your armBreath subdues painMindfulness subdues the HindrancesWhen we meditate its as if we were milling the rice grains in our granary so that theyll be ready to cookThe mind is like grains of riceThe Hindrances are like the husksWe have to crack the husks and then polish away the dirty red skin underneathThats when well end up with good white riceThe way to polish is to use directed thought and evaluationDirected thought is when we focus the mind on being aware of the inandout breath which is like taking a handful of rice and putting it in the teeth of our millWe have to make sure that the teeth of the mill are in good shapeIf were aware of just the inbreath and then get distracted with the outbreath its as if the teeth of our mill were brokenWhen this happens we have to fix them immediatelyIn other words we reestablish mindfulness on the breath and brush away all other perceptionsEvaluation is being observant taking careful note of the breath as we breathe in to see what its like to see whether its comfortable easy and freeflowingWe then let the good breaths spread throughout the body to chase out the bad breath sensationsAll the properties of the body will become pure the mind will become brightThe body will feel cool and at easeWe have to look after the breath in this way in the same way that we catch baby chicks to put in the coopIf we hold them too tight they dieIf we hold them too loosely they run awayWe have to gather them in our hands in a way thats just rightThat way theyll all end up safely in the coopWhen we use directed thought and evaluation its as if we polish away the dirty red skin from our rice grainsWell end up with nice white riceIf we take the rice to market itll fetch a good priceIf we cook it it will taste good and nourish the bodyThis is why we should all be intent on polishing the rice in our granary so that well end up with Grade A riceThe factors of jhana  directed thought evaluation rapture and pleasure  all have to be gathered at the breath if you want to reach singleness of preoccupationDirected thought is like laying claim to a piece of landEvaluation is like planting it with seedWhen the seed bears fruit thats rapture and pleasureKeeping awareness with the breath is directed thoughtKnowing the characteristics of the breath is evaluationSpreading the breath so that it permeates and fills the entire body is raptureThe sense of serenity and wellbeing in body and mind is pleasureWhen the mind is freed from the Hindrances so that its one with the breath thats singleness of preoccupationAll of these factors of jhana turn mindfulness into a factor of AwakeningSpreading the breath letting all the breath sensations spread throughout all the elements and parts of the body  the blood vessels the tendons etc is like cutting a system of connecting roads through the wildernessAny country with a good system of roads is bound to develop because communication is easyIf we constantly adjust and improve the breath in the various parts of the body its like cutting away the dead parts of a plant so that it can begin to grow againDirected thought focusing on the breath is like putting food in your mouthEvaluation  adjusting spreading and improving the breath  is like chewing your foodIf you chew it carefully before swallowing the food will digest easily and give full benefits to your bodyThe digesting is the duty of the body but if you want to get good results you have to help with the chewingThe more refined you can make the breath the better the results youll getThere are two kinds of evaluation when we meditate on the breathThe first is to evaluate the inandout breathThe second is to evaluate the inner breath sensations in the body until you can spread them out through all the properties of the body to the point where you forget all distractionsIf both the body and mind are full theres a sense of rapture and ease that results from our directed thought and evaluationThis is Right Action in the mindOne of the benefits from working with the breath is that the properties of the body become friendly and harmonious with one anotherWe spread the breath all over the body and then when it grows still it gives you a sense of physical seclusionThis is one of the physical benefitsAs for the mental benefits mindfulness becomes enlargedWhen mindfulness is enlarged awareness is enlargedThe mind becomes an adult and doesnt go sneaking off like an ordinary mindIf you want it to think it thinksIf you want it to stop it stopsIf you want it to go it goesWhen the mind is welltrained it gains knowledge like an educated adultWhen you converse with it you understand each otherThe mind of a person who hasnt trained it is like a childThis kind of mind doesnt understand what you say and likes to slip off to roam around  and it goes without saying goodbyeYou have no idea what it takes with it when it goes or what it brings back when it returnsWhen the breath mindfulness and awareness are all enlarged they all become adultsThey dont get into spats with one another the body doesnt quarrel with the mind mindfulness doesnt quarrel with the mindThats when we can be at our easeWhen you spread the breath as you evaluate it mindfulness runs throughout the body like an electric wireMaking yourself mindful is like letting the current run along the wireAlertness is like the energy that wakes the body upWhen the body is awake pains cant overcome itIn other words it wakes up the properties of earth water fire and wind so that they get to workWhen the properties are balanced and full they put the body at easeWhen the body is nourished with breath and mindfulness like this it grows into an adultWhen the properties are at peace they all become adults the great frame of referenceThis is called threshold concentration or evaluationWhen the mind is broad wandering after outside perceptions it loses the strength it needs to deal with its various affairsWhatever it thinks of doing will succeed only with difficultyIts like a gun with a broadgauged barrelIf you put tiny bullets into it they rattle around inside and dont come out with much forceThe narrower the gauge of the barrel the more force the bullets will have when you shoot themIts the same with the breath The more you refine your focus the more refined the breath will become until eventually you can breathe through your poresThe mind at this stage has more strength than an atomic bombMaking the mind snug with mindfulness and the breath is like weaving clothIf the weave is so fine that water wont pass through the cloth will fetch a high priceIf you use it to sift flour youll get very fine flourIf the weave is coarse the cloth wont be worth muchIf you use it to sift flour the flour will come out all lumpyIn the same way the more refined you can make your awareness the more refined and valuable the results youll getWhen the breath fills the body awareness gets more refinedThe breath that used to be fast will slow downIf it used to be strong it will become more gentleIf it used to be heavy it will grow light  to the point where you dont have to breathe because the body is full of breath with no empty spacesIts like water we pour into a vessel until its fullThats the point of enough you dont have to add any moreThis sense of fullness gives rise to a feeling of coolness and clarityThere are five levels to the breathThe first level is the most blatant one the breath that we breathe in and outThe second level is the breath that goes past the lungs and connects with the various properties of the body giving rise to a sense of comfort or discomfortThe third level is the breath that stays in place throughout the bodyIt doesnt flow here or thereThe breath sensations that used to flow up and down the body stop flowingThe sensations that used to run to the front or the back stop runningEverything stops and is stillThe fourth level is the breath that gives rise to a sense of coolness and lightThe fifth level is the really refined breath so refined that its like atomsIt can penetrate the entire worldIts power is very fast and strongThe most refined level of awareness which is like atoms has the same sort of power as an atomic bomb buried underground that can explode people and animals to smithereensWhen the refined mind is buried in the breath it can explode people and animals to smithereens tooWhat this means is that when the mind reaches this level of refinement its sense of self and other disappears without a traceIt lets go of its attachments to body and self people and beings This is why we say that its like an atomic bomb that can explode people and animals to smithereensMomentary concentration is like a house roofed with thatch its posts are made out of softwoodMomentary concentration isnt jhanaThreshold concentration is like a house made out of hardwood with a tile roofFixed penetration is like an immovable concrete buildingThis is where we become one in a single preoccupation on the single or direct pathIts like sitting alone in a chair or lying alone on a bed without anyone trying to come and take up our space or like being alone in a room without anyone else coming in to disturb usWhen were alone in a room we can be at our easeWe can even take off our clothes if we likeWe can behave with good manners or bad and no one will complainThis is why a mind with jhana as its dwelling can be at its easeIt has a deep well so that it can get plenty of water  to the point where it can drop directed thought and evaluation leaving nothing but pleasure This is where feeling becomes your frame of referenceThe body feels fullAll four properties  earth water fire and wind  feel fullWhen the mind feels full in this way nothing is lackingThats raptureYou dont want any more of the four propertiesWhen the mind soaks for a long time in this sense of rapture its like something youve soaked in water for a long time The water is bound to permeate it to a point of saturationThis sense of rapture is the second jhanaWhen the sense of rapture begins to move you dont feel at ease in the same way as when a boat begins to sway you want to get back on landSo once rapture fills the body you let go of it leaving nothing but pleasure and singleness of preoccupationWhen the mind has soaked itself in pleasure to a point of saturation it lets go leaving an empty sense of equanimityWhen the mind is really empty it feels spacious and lightThe more it soaks in equanimity the more still it gets giving rise to an inner sense of lightWhen the light is really intense you arrive at Right MindfulnessDirected thought  focusing on the breath without getting distracted  is like planting a treeEvaluation is like loosening the soil around the roots giving it fertilizer and watering it from the roots to the topmost branchesThe body which can be compared to the soil will soften allowing the fertilizer and water to penetrate down to the rootsRapture is like the trees being fresh and green and bursting into blooman unusual sense of heaviness or lightness in the body a sense of the body floating a sense of coolness or heat a sense of thrill passing over the surface of the body the body beginning to sway Pleasure means stillness of body and mind free from HindrancesSingleness of preoccupation means being neutral toward other things perfectly still in a single preoccupationThis is what the Buddha was referring to when he said that concentration matured with virtue is of great benefit great rewardsDirected thought is like standing and looking out a windowWhoever walks past we know but we dont call out to them or turn to look after them as they walk down the roadWe simply stand perfectly still at the windowDirected thought and evaluation applied to the breath are like car mechanicsThe mind is like the head mechanicWhen we drive our car we have to be observant and keep checking all the mechanical parts  such as the steering wheel the springs the tires the gas line  to see if anything is wearing out or not working properlyIf we find that anything is not working properly we have to fix it immediatelyThat way the car will take us safely to our destinationWhen you practice concentration you have to be observant checking your breath to see whether or not its coming in smoothly and adjusting it to make it comfortableYour concentration will then progress step by step and ultimately take you to the transcendentWhen people criticize you saying that youre in a blind state of jhana its still better than having no jhana to be inAnd if they say that youre like a baby chick that hasnt come out of its egg thats okay tooWhen a baby chick is still in the egg no hawk can swoop down on it and catch itWhen it comes out of the egg is when it becomes preyThey may say that youre sitting in stump concentration but dont pay them any mind because stumps can have their usesSometimes they grow new branches with tender leaves you can eatBut if the stump catches fire and burns to a crisp thats no good at allAs we keep training the mind it keeps getting more and more mature more tempered and sharp able to cut right through anything at allLike a knife that we always keep sharpening Theres no way it can not become sharpSo we should keep at the practice in the same way that we sharpen a knifeIf any part of the body or mind isnt in good shape we keep adjusting it until we get good resultsWhen good results arise well be in a state of Right ConcentrationThe mind will be firmly established in the present in a state of singleness of preoccupationWell gain power both in body and mindPower in body means that wherever there are pains we can adjust the properties of earth water fire and wind to give rise to a sense of comfort in the same way that we trim a treeIf any branches are broken or rotten we cut them away and graft on new branchesIf the new ones break we graft on more new onesWe keep on doing this until the tree is healthy and strongMaking the mind still is good for two things suppressing and cuttingIf we cant yet cut we can still suppressSuppressing means that there are defilements in the mind but we dont let them flare up into actionWe keep them in lineCutting means that we dont even let them ariseIn putting the mind in shape we have to be observant to see what things need correcting what things need fostering what things need letting goIf you do nothing but correcting it wont workThe same holds true for just letting goWe do whatever the practice requiresWhen the mind is in concentration it doesnt get distracted by any thoughts that come passing byIts like a person entirely focused on his work If anyone walks by and tries to strike up a conversation he doesnt want to respond or even look up from his workIn the same way when the mind has really cut away its outside preoccupations its bound to stay entirely in the object of its meditationThe mind full of defilements is like salt water in the oceanYou have to use a lot of directed thought and evaluation to filter and distill the mind to the point where the salt water turns into rain waterPeople in the world are like people floating in boats in the middle of the sea when its filled with waves and monsoon windsSome people are so far out that they cant even see landSome are bobbing up and down sometimes able to see land and sometimes notThis stands for people who are meditating buddho Others are beginning to come into harbor where they can see fish traps sailboats and the green trees on the coastSome have swum in so far that theyre almost ashore but not quiteAs for the Buddha hes like someone who has reached the shore and is standing on the land free from every kind of dangerHe sees all the perils that human beings are subject to and so he feels compassion for us trying to help us reach the shore and escape from the dangers at seaThis is why he teaches us to develop generosity virtue and meditation which are things that are going to pull us safely to solid groundWhen we develop the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha within ourselves we wont have to sufferWe make the mind into Dhamma and the various defilements that spoil it will disappearThis is how we can escape from the seaOnce we get on land we can have lots of fun because there are a lot of things we never saw at seaIts like when we come into the mouth of the Chao Phraya River where there are marsh trees and fresh green plantsWe become enchanted and keep walking further inland to Sukhumvit RoadThere we see bicycles and trucks and jeeps and pretty automobiles of different colorsThis gets us even more excited and some of us get smitten with what we see on landIn other words we fall for the visions and signs that come in meditationFor instance we may begin to remember previous lifetimesIf we remember bad things we become sadIf we remember good things we get happyThis turns into craving the desire to be this or that and some people get really deluded thinking that they actually are the things they seeIf our discernment isnt strong enough then whatever we see will turn into the corruptions of insight  like people who get all excited the first time they see a carThey go running to the car wanting to ride in it wanting to drive it but without looking right or left or stopping to take note of anythingThey run right out into the middle of the road get run over and either die or break an arm or a legAfter all the trouble they went to in order to get out of the sea they get deluded and put themselves in danger all over againBut if our discernment is strong enough whatever we see will turn into noble treasuresIf we see a forest of marsh tress we can put them to useWe can cut them into firewood to use ourselves or sell in the marketIf the land is a tangle of weeds we can clear it and turn it into fieldsIf we dont let it lie fallow its sure to yield cropsFalling for visions is also called skewed perception The right way to act when you see a vision is to remember to evaluate it and then let it go in line with its true natureDont latch onto what you see because all things are inconstantIf youre born poor you suffer from your desire to be richIf youre born rich you suffer in looking after your possessions afraid that theyll wear out afraid that youll get cheated out of them afraid that thieves will break in and steal themTheres nothing certain or dependable at allThe same holds true with visionsSo whatever you see you have to let it go in line with its natureLeave the trees in the forest the grass in the meadows and the rice in the fieldsIf you can do this you can be at your ease because you know what its like on land what its like in the water when to get in and when to get outOnce youre skilled you can travel on water or land at your ease in every wayYou can go forward or back without any obstaclesThis is called lokavidu knowing the worldYou can stay with what you know but youre not stuck on itYou can live in the ocean without drowningYou can live in the world without getting sunk in the world  like a lotus leaf in the water the water doesnt seep into the leaf at allWhen youre true in what you do your work will succeed in every wayFor instance if youre true in observing the precepts your precepts will get resultsIf youre true in practicing concentration your concentration will get resultsIf youre true in developing discernment your discernment will get resultsThe reason we dont see results is because were not true in what we doOnly five precepts and yet we cant catch them by the head or the tailAnd when this is the case how can we ever hope to make a living at anythingOnly four concentrations  the four stages of jhana  and yet we keep groping around and cant find themThere are people who can manage farms covering hundreds and thousands of acres and yet we cant even manage just four concentrationsIsnt that embarrassingIf we arent true to the Buddhas teachings in our thoughts and actions the results of our not being true will keep pushing us further and further away from the DhammaWell have to be hungry and suffer in various waysFor this reason the Buddha taught us to be true in whatever we doWhen were true in this way then even though we live in the world we can be at our easeWe know how to flush the suffering out of our heart to the point where the body feels comfortable in every partPeace and calm depend on the hearts having enough and being fullIf the heart is full external fires wont be able to seep into itWhen the body is filled with mindfulness then where will there be anything lacking in the heartThis is why if we want to be full we have to make an effort at developing our meditation as much as possibleRapture will then ariseWhen rapture arises were not stuck on it because we realize that its undependableIt eventually has to fade awaySo we let go of the raptureWhen we let go of the rapture the mind is at ease in a sense of pleasureThis sense of pleasure and ease is much more refined and profound than rapture with none of its active symptomsRapture is like a person whos pleased by something and so shows it by smiling or laughingAs for pleasure it doesnt have any external signsIts hidden in the heart as when a person is very rich but doesnt show his wealth in any way that people would catch onThis pleasure is what calms the mindIf it were to show itself externally it wouldnt serve any purposePleasure of this sort can cool the heart and give it respite and this is what leads to stillness and peaceWhen the mind is at peace it grows bright and clear just like a sea without any waves You can see the boats ten miles awayWhatever comes from the north south east or west you can see it clearly without having to use a spyglassOur vision goes out further than normalThis is how we give rise to vipassana or the insight that allows us to know and see the truths of the worldIf we have a coconut crack it open and eat the flesh it fills us up only onceIf we forego eating it and plant it in the ground until it grows into a tree with more coconuts then take those coconuts and plant them eventually well become coconut plantation millionairesIf we get money and simply stash it away it wont serve any purpose and the day will come when its no longer safeSo we have to find the right place to put it by making donations to the religionThats when it will give rise to further resultsIf the mind goes no further than concentration it simply gets a sense of easeWe have to invest that stillness in giving rise to discernmentThats when well meet with the highest happinessIf the mind has a sense of inner fullness then when we associate with other people theyll pick up on that sense of fullness as wellIf were miserable then when we associate with other people well make them miserable tooIf we can develop the power of the mind we can send thoughts of good will to help lessen the sufferings of other peopleBut if we dont straighten ourselves out first we cant really help anyone else in the same way that a crazy person cant help another crazy person become saneIf were on fire and other people are on fire how can we help themWe have to put out our own fires first before we can help them cool downWe have to have before we can giveWhen you keep the breath in mind you get all four frames of reference in oneThe breath is body feelings lie in the body the mind lies in the body mental qualities lie in the mindThe four frames of reference when we sit in meditation The breath is body comfort and discomfort are feeling purity and clarity are states of mind and steadiness of mind is mental qualityWhen practicing concentration we have to imbue it with the four paths to successChanda Have a friendly interest in the breath keeping track of it to see when we breathe in what we breathe in with itIf we dont breathe out well have to dieIf we breathe out but dont breathe back in well have to die as wellWe keep focused on this without focusing the mind on anything elseViriya Be diligent in all affairs related to the breathYou have to be intent that Now Im going to breathe in now Im going to breathe out Im going to make it long short heavy light cool warm etc You have to be in charge of the breathCitta Focus intently on the breathBe observant of how the external breath comes in and connects with the internal breath in the upper middle and lower parts of the body in the chest  the lungs the heart the ribs the backbone in the abdomen  stomach liver kidneys intestines the breath that goes out the ends of the fingers and toes and out every poreVimansa Contemplate and evaluate the breath that comes in to nourish the body to see whether it fills the body to see whether it feels easy and natural to see if there are any parts where you still have to adjust itNotice the characteristics of how the external breath strikes the internal breath to see if they connect everywhere or not to see how the effects of the breath on the properties of earth water and fire arise remain and pass awayAll of this comes under meditation on physical events and qualifies as the great frame of reference as wellWhen the mind has fully developed the four paths to success complete with mindfulness and alertness the results in terms of the body are the stilling of painIn terms of the mind they can lead all the way to the transcendent the stages of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantshipIf you really develop concentration it will result in the five kinds of strength conviction when you gain conviction in the results you see coming from your efforts then persistence arises without anyone having to force youFrom there mindfulness becomes more comprehensive in what you are doing concentration becomes firmly established in what you are doing giving rise to discernment of all things right and wrongAltogether these are called the five strengthsTranquillity meditation is a mind snug in a single preoccupationIt doesnt establish contact with anything else it keeps itself cleansed of outside preoccupationsInsight meditation is when the mind lets go of all preoccupations in a state of allaround mindfulness and alertnessWhen tranquillity imbued with insight arises in the mind five faculties arise and become dominant all at once Saddhindriya Your conviction becomes solid and strongWhatever anyone else may say good or bad your mind isnt affectedViriyindriya Your persistence becomes resilientWhether anyone teaches you the path or not you keep at it constantly without flagging or getting discouragedSatindriya Mindfulness becomes dominant enlarged in the great frame of referenceYou dont have to force itIt spreads all over the body in the same way that the branches of a large tree protect the entire trunk without anyone having to pull them down or shake them upAwareness becomes entirely radiant in every posture sitting standing walking and lying downIt knows on its own without your having to thinkThis allaround awareness is what is meant by the great frame of referenceSamadhindriya Your concentration becomes dominant tooWhatever youre doing the mind doesnt waver or strayEven if youre talking to the point where your mouth opens a meter wide the mind is still at normalcyIf the body wants to eat lie down sit stand walk run think whatever thats its businessOr if any part of it gets weary or pained again thats its business but the mind remains straight and set still in a single preoccupation without straying off into anything elsePaññindriya Discernment becomes dominant within you as well to the point where you can make the mind attain streamentry oncereturning nonreturning or even arahantshipIn order to divest our hearts of sights sounds smells tastes etc we have to develop concentration which is composed of seven basic qualities Analysis of present qualities as a factor of Awakening We let the breath spread throughout the body making an enlarged frame of referenceWe know how to adjust improve choose and use our breaths so that they give us comfortWe throw out whichever breaths are harmful and foster whichever ones are beneficialPersistence as a factor of Awakening We dont abandon or forget the breathWe stick with it and it sticks with us as we keep warding the Hindrances from the heartWe dont fasten on or become involved with distracting perceptionsWe keep trying to make our stillness of mind stronger and strongerRapture as a factor of Awakening When the mind is quiet the breath is full and refreshingWere free from the Hindrances and from every sort of restlessness like a white cloth thats spotlessly cleanWhen the mind is clear in this way it feels nothing but comfort and fullness which gives rise to a sense of satisfaction termed raptureSerenity as a factor of Awakening The breath is solid throughout the bodyThe elements are at peace and so is the mindNothing feels troublesome or arousedConcentration as a factor of Awakening The breath is firm steady and unwaveringThe mind takes a firm stance in a single preoccupationEquanimity as a factor of Awakening When body feelings mind and mental qualities are fully snug with one another in these two types of breath  when the mind stays with these aspects of the breath  it doesnt have to fashion anything at allIt doesnt latch onto any manifestation of good or badNeutral and unperturbed it doesnt approve or disapprove of anythingMake a resolution intending to keep mindfulness and alertness firmly focusedKeep continual watch over the mind to keep it with the breath in line with your original intentionKeep warding off the Hindrances the various distractions that will come to spoil the energy of your concentrationThis is mindfulness as a factor of AwakeningOnce the breath is well cleansed and purified let this purified breath spread to care for the body throughout its various partsOnce the body is nourished with this purified breath it becomes purified as wellOur words and thoughts become purified tooWhat we experience now is pleasure and easeOr if you want to use the breath to care for any particular part of the body  a great deal or a little heavily or lightly blatantly or subtly  you can do so as you likeThis is analysis of present qualities as a factor of AwakeningTend to the breath keeping watch over the mind not letting it stray off in search of other preoccupations that would break your original resolutionDont grow discouraged in the face of weariness or difficulties for body or mindBe resolved on cutting away obstacles whatever direction they may come from even if you have to put your life on the lineThis is persistence as a factor of AwakeningWhen these first three qualities are fully developed and pure they give rise to a feeling of brightness fullness and satisfactionThe breath is fullThis is the breath of cognitive skillIn other words the breath lies under the direction of mindfulnessThis is rapture as a factor of AwakeningWhen the mind stays with the full breath it doesnt waver or loosen its grip in the wake of any passing distractions as when sounds strike the ear and so forthFeelings are still experienced as they are felt but at this point they dont give rise to craving attachment states of being or birthAwareness is simply awareThis is serenity as a factor of AwakeningWhen awareness is solid and sure radiant and full in every way knowledge arisesWe both know and see what our present condition comes from and where it will goWe see this so clearly that we will perceive kamma and its results both in ourselves and other peopleThis is concentration as a factor of AwakeningOnce the mind has followed these steps from the first to the sixth and then lets go to be still with a spacious sense of relaxation not fastening onto any sign preoccupation or anything at all thats equanimity as a factor of AwakeningWhen we understand all seven of these qualities and can develop them in full measure within the heart they all come together at a single point in a single momentThe reason were taught to develop these seven qualities in our breathing is so that we can still the feelings within us  because feelings lie at the essence of the HindrancesThe Hindrances are the breath impregnated with ignorance and darknessWhen this happens were like a person standing in the darkness who cant see himself or anyone else because we lie fermenting in our defilements full of conditionsThis is the ordinary breath untended and undirectedIts full all right but full of darknessThis state is the important one that cuts and closes off our pathOnly when we get rid of these Hindrances will the mind be radiant and bright seeing the Dhamma clearly in terms of both cause and effectWhen mindfulness saturates the body the way flame saturates every thread in the mantle of a Coleman lantern the elements throughout the body work together like a group of people working together on a job Each person helps a little here and there and in no time at all  almost effortlessly  the job is doneJust as the mantle of a Coleman lantern whose every thread is soaked in flame becomes light white and dazzling so if you soak your mind in mindfulness until its aware of the entire body both the body and mind become buoyantWhen you think using the power of mindfulness your sense of the body will immediately become thoroughly bright helping to develop both body and mindYoull be able to sit or stand for long periods of time without getting tired to walk for great distances without getting fatigued to go for unusually long periods of time on just a little food without getting hungry or to go without food and sleep altogether for several days running without losing energyAs for the heart it will become pure open and free from blemishThe mind will become bright energetic and strongSaddhabalam Your conviction will run like a car running without stop along the roadViriyabalam Your persistence will accelerate and advanceSatibalam Your mindfulness will be robust and vigorousSamadhibalam Your concentration will become unwavering and resilientNo activity will be able to kill itIn other words no matter what youre doing  sitting standing walking talking whatever  as soon as you think of practicing concentration your mind will immediately be centeredWhenever you want it just think of it and you have itWhen your concentration is this powerful insight meditation is no problemPaññabalam Your discernment will be like a doubleedged sword Your discernment of whats outside will be sharpYour discernment of whats inside will be sharpWhen these five strengths appear in the heart the heart will be fully matureYour conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment will all be mature and preeminent in their own spheresIts the nature of mature adults that they cooperateWhen they work together on a job they finish itSo it is when you have these five adults working together for you Youll be able to complete any taskYour mind will have the power to demolish every defilement in the heart just as a nuclear bomb can demolish anything anywhere in the worldWhen your concentration has strength it gives rise to discernment the ability to see stress its cause its disbanding and the Path to its disbanding all clearly within the breathWe can explain this as follows The inandout breath is stress  the inbreath the stress of arising the outbreath the stress of passing awayNot being aware of the breath as it goes in and out not knowing the characteristics of the breath This is the cause of stressKnowing when the breath is coming in knowing when its going out knowing its characteristics clearly  ie keeping your views in line with the truth of the breath This is Right View part of the Noble PathKnowing which ways of breathing are uncomfortable knowing how to vary the breath knowing That way of breathing is uncomfortable well have to breathe like this in order to feel at ease This is Right ConsiderationThe mental factors that think about and properly evaluate all aspects of the breath are Right SpeechKnowing various ways of improving the breath breathing for example in long and out long in short and out short in short and out long in long and out short until you come across the breath thats most comfortable for you This is Right ActionKnowing how to use the breath to purify the blood how to let this purified blood nourish the heart muscles how to adjust the breath so that it eases the body and soothes the mind how to breathe so that you feel full and refreshed in body and mind This is Right LivelihoodTrying to adjust the breath so that it comforts the body and mind and to keep trying as long as you arent fully at ease This is Right EffortBeing mindful of the inandout breath at all times knowing the various aspects of the breath  the upflowing breath the downflowing breath the breath in the stomach the breath in the intestines the breath flowing along the muscles and out to every pore  keeping track of these things with every inandout breath This is Right MindfulnessA mind intent only on matters of the breath not pulling any other objects in to interfere until the breath is refined giving rise to fixed absorption and then liberating insight This is Right ConcentrationWhen all of these aspects of the Noble Path  virtue concentration and discernment  are brought together fully mature within the heart you gain insight into all aspects of the breath knowing that Breathing this way gives rise to good mental states breathing that way gives rise to bad mental states You let go of the factors  ie the breath in all its aspects  that fashion the body the factors that fashion speech the factors that fashion the mind whether good or bad letting them be as they truly are in line with their own inherent nature This is the disbanding of stressWhy did the Buddha grow weary of the worldBecause he asked himself When were born in the world what does the world have to offer thats really satisfyingParentsRelativesServantsFriendsWealthTheres nothing really satisfying about any of these things at allWhen this is the case why should we put up with staying in the world This is why he went out into the homeless life so that he could find the way to keep us from having to come back and be reborn in the worldWhen we ordain we have to practice in line with the training rules the Buddha laid down if we want to live up to our name as Sons of the SakyanThe Buddhas true children are the four groups of Noble Disciples streamwinners oncereturners nonreturners and arahants those who have released their hearts step by step from defilements and mental fermentations in line with their strength of mindThese are the religions true relatives the Buddhas children who deserve to receive his inheritance without a doubtThis kind of ordination anyone can undergo  women men novices anyoneIts internal ordinationAs for the monks who shave their heads and wear the ochre robe thats external ordinationWhoever can undergo both internal and external ordination so much the betterWhenever you find pleasure you should transform it so that it wont spoil on youThis is like the women who sell fruit in the marketWhen they see that their mangoes are getting overripe and they wont be able to eat them keep them overnight or sell them before they spoil they take them peel them cut them up and make them into jamThis way they can keep them for a long timeThe jam tastes good and it can fetch a good priceThis is called having the intelligence to keep ripe things from spoilingIn the same way when we gain pleasure we shouldnt get complacentWe should take that pleasure and pulverize it into pain so that we can uncover the kind of inner pleasure and wellbeing that doesnt change thats solid longlasting and valuableFor example there are monks and novices who find themselves wellprovided with the necessities of life that other people have given them without having to work hard the way lay people do  carrying loads and responsibilities taming the wilderness exposed to the sun and rainAll they have to do is harvest cooked rice and they can eat their fillThis is the kind of pleasure that comes with the renunciate lifeBut if monks like this get stuck on their material possessions  robes almsfood lodgings and medicine  without behaving themselves properly in line with the sacrifices that other people have made for their sake then theyre not really contemplativesTheyre simply taking advantage of their donorsSo when you find that your needs are being taken care of you should take that sense of ease and pleasure and pulverize it into pain by putting effort into the practice sacrificing the pleasure youre receiving by taking on the dhutanga practices in line with the Buddhas exampleThis way youll come to comprehend the pain and stress that are an inherent part of having a bodyYou should contemplate the pleasure you receive from others to realize that theres nothing of any lasting essence to itThe pleasure with a lasting essence has to be the type that you give rise to yourselfWhat this means is that you have to practice patience and endurance contending with the stress and pain that come from the bodyWhen you can do this the mind will become steady and solid so strong that it rises step by step to higher levelsEventually youll come to realize the true pleasure and wellbeing that the Buddha called the highest form of happinessWherever you live you should take care of it as your homeWherever you sleep you should take care of it as your homeWherever you eat you should take care of it as your homeThis way you can find happiness wherever you stay and wherever you goOpen your ears and eyes wide so that you can do a thorough job of helping to look after the monasteryEach of us should have big big eyesWhen you stay here in the monastery your eyes have to be as big as the monastery and so do your earsPeople who have a good opinion of themselves but arent good in their behavior are burdensome and heavy causing cracks wherever they stayThis is why wise people are said to be light like cats paws soft and furry with safe places to keep the claws until theyre really neededIf they walk on a floor they dont make sound or leave any footprintsAs for fools people who dont know how to behave themselves theyre said to be like dogs pawsTheyre heavyIf they walk on a floor their claws make a noise and their paws leave printsWhen we live together in a group like this there are bound to be all kinds of sounds when we come into contact with one anotherIf you were to make a comparison were no different from an orchestra which has to include the sound of the oboes the sound of the gong the sound of the xylophones high sounds low sounds treble and bassIf all the instruments had the same sound there would be no fun in listening to the orchestra for a onesound orchestra wouldnt sound good at allIn the same way when lots of people live together there are bound to be good and bad sounds arising in the groupSo each of us has to look after his or her own heartDont let yourself feel anger or dislike for the bad sounds because when theres a lot of disliking its bound to turn to angerWhen theres a lot of anger its bound to turn to ill willWhen theres ill will its bound to lead to quarrels and disturbancesFor this reason we should spread thoughts of good will to people above us below us and on the same levelWhen people below us show disagreeable attitudes in their words or actions we should forgive themWhen we can do this well be contributing to the peace and calm of the groupDont hang around with the group more than you have to or youll waste your time for meditatingThe dangers of associating are if your behavior isnt on the same level it gives rise to irritationIf your views arent in line with one another youre going to argue which will give rise to defilementsIts just like water where the land is on two different levelsThe water on the higher level will flow down to the lower level and make a big roarIf water is flowing along a piece of level ground the flow of the water hardly makes a sound at allHanging around with the group is like curry ladled onto a plate of rice It spoils quickly and you cant keep it for longIf the rice and the curry are kept in two separate dishes they dont spoil as quicklyWhen people keep to themselves they rarely have issuesTo be a monk who ordains without spending time in the wilds is like knowing the taste of rice but not curryMonks who go looking for seclusion in the forest are bound to know the taste of the Dhamma like a person who eats rice with curryThe taste is sure to be very differentTake roosters for instanceWild roosters are very different from domesticated roostersTheir eyes are quick their tailfeathers short their call short their wings strongThey have to be this way because they always need to keep up their guardAs for domesticated roosters their tail feathers are long their eyes slow their wings weak and their call longWhen theyre this way theyre bound to become the prey of leopardsThis goes to show that the taste of living in the forest and the taste of living in a settled area are bound to be differentThere have been times when Ive been criticized for going out into the forest but I just smile to myselfThey say Im a coward that I cant contend with people and so run off and hideSo I keep quiet and laugh to myself until I have to speak up and say Living in town is good all right but it doesnt require any special talentsWhyIve never seen town people last any length of time in the forest but in towns  to say nothing of monks  there are dogs and chickens all over the placePeople with thick defilements are easier to teach than people with thin defilementsTheyve got a thick shell so its easy to crack openIf their skin is thin its hard to peelPeople come in all typesSome make themselves into pigs some make themselves into chickens some make themselves into water buffaloes and some make themselves into peopleOnly when people are like people can you feed them rice  and even people like people come on many levelsSome eat the best rice others eat second best and others take whats leftSomeone once came to me and said Unawareness and ignorance are what cause people to think so actually theyre something positive  because if people dont think how are they going to become intelligentBut here you are teaching people to sit still with their minds quiet and not thinkingWhat good can it accomplishSo I answered him Theres no need to talk about subtle things like unawarenessLets talk about simple thingsWhen you were small and learning how to read they started out by having you put letters together  s plus o is so n plus o is no g plus o is go and so on  until you knew that g plus o is goNow youre in BangkokSuppose you put your learning aside and go to ChantaburiIf you meet a sign that says go you can tell immediately that it says go without having to think  right because you already knowIf someone really knows why does he have to thinkThe person who has to think is the one who doesnt really knowSometimes if you want to serve a purpose you have to take their own words and pour them back down their throatsIt makes them sit up and take noticeWhen Im in Bangkok everyone who comes to my quarters sits still and meditates  not because I tell them to but because thats what Im doing myselfThat in and of itself is enough to teach themI sit with my eyes closed when they see me sitting with my eyes closed they sit with their eyes closed as well and dont dare say anythingIf I were to get involved in their issues theyd get involved in mineWhen your eyes are blurry you have to learn how to put eyedrops in them yourselfIf you go around trying to get other people to put them in for you youre weighing them downWhat this means is that you have to take note of thingsFor example they may be speaking to you or not but if you notice something about what they say you take note of it When this person does this what is he afterWhen she acts in this way what does she want Just this is enough for you to begin to understand thingsThis is what it means to put drops in our own eyesWith some people you have to pry their eyelids open with a rod and even then they dont want to open upThats when theyre impossible to teachIf your eyes arent too blurry you dont have to watch things too oftenIf you see something once its enough for you to take as a guide for a long time to come with no need for too many examplesLike expert shoemakers All they need is one model and they can set themselves up in business making hundreds and thousands of shoesWhat it means to be a person with good ears Your teacher may say something only once but you can put it to use the rest of your lifeWhatever appears and takes shape is bound to give rise to stressIf we lay claim to unstable things as our own our lives will have to be unstable tooWhen pain arises stay right there with the painWhen pleasure arises stay right there with the pleasureGet to know themGet to know what arises whenWhen you stay with them really focus on being observant to see them all the way throughUltimately theyll fade away in the same way as when we place a rock on a lawn the grass underneath it gradually dies on its ownWhen pain arises you can focus your attention on something or somebody else in order to forget the pain all right but thats just mindfulness not alertnessYour awareness has to be right at whats happening within you if you want to have both mindfulness and alertness togetherAging illness and death are treasures for those who understand themTheyre Noble Truths Noble TreasuresIf they were people Id bow down to their feet every dayIts because of illness that Ive been able to stay a monk as long as I haveEating just a little food is very useful in the practiceWhen I want to make a careful survey of my breath I eat as little as possibleWhen the body is hungry I can see right where all the painful breath sensations ariseIf the body is wellfed its hard to observe these things because nothing usually happens in the body in its normal stateSo from my point of view when Im hungry or sick its good for the practiceWhen Im really in pain so much the betterI can close the door and dont have to get involved with anyone elseThe body is death The mind is birth If we can separate them from each other well gain release from birth and deathIf the mind is endowed with defilements and mental fermentations it will have to experience birth aging illness and death as a matter of courseIts like grains of rice covered by their outer coating and kept in a granaryAs soon as the conditions are right in terms of the soil moisture sunlight and air the grains are bound to sprout and grow into rice plants resulting in even more grains of rice without endBut if we scrape off the covering and roast the grains in a pan they wont be able to sproutIn the same way if we use the effort of the practice to burn away the defilements that arise in the mind  by practicing concentration and constantly contemplating the qualities of the mind in line with the four frames of reference  the defilements will pop out of the mind in the same way that roasted rice will pop out of the panWhen we reach this point we reach the mind that doesnt die that gains release from deathWhen we see the aspect of the body that doesnt die and the aspect of the mind that doesnt die thats when we reach the truthWise people see that death is like stripping off old ragged clothes and throwing them awayThe mind is like a body the body is like ragged clothingTheres nothing of any real essence to the rags but they have us scaredAs soon as we see that theres the tiniest hole in our clothes we rush to find something to patch them upThe more patches we put on our clothes the thicker they getThe thicker they get the warmer they feelThe warmer they feel the more we get attached to themThe more we get attached to them the more deluded we becomeAs a result well never get awayWise people though see that the issue of whether we live or die is not as important as the issue of whether we can serve a purposeIf living on will serve a purpose for themselves or other people then even if their clothes are nothing but rags theyll put up with wearing themBut if they see that living on will serve no purpose at all then when the time comes to take off their clothes they immediately let them goPracticing concentration is like gathering vegetable seeds and storing them until theyre matureAs soon as they get moistened theyre going to sprout into plants with branches and leaves and flowersIn the same way our concentration will sprout into discernment giving us allaround insight into the affairs of the world and the affairs of the DhammaWell come to know what the elements aggregates and the sense media in the body are  to the point where we see that theres no reason to fear aging illness and deathIts just like when we grow up and our childishness disappearsDont make an issue out of whether or not youre going to dieDont even think of itJust purify your mind and that will take care of everythingThe Dhamma is in everyoneWhether or not you realize it its thereWhether or not you study it its thereIts simply a matter of whether you know how to decipher itOnce you know the labels formulated by the Buddha you can decipher yourself in the same way that you learn how to read a bookTake a baby who doesnt know anything As soon as its born it cries Wae Thats feelingIf its eating and comes across something it doesnt like it throws it away and goes for something better Thats thoughtformationWhen it gets older it can begin to remember things Thats perceptionSo the Dhamma is in everyoneSo why do we studyWe study to learn the names for things and then we eventually have to get rid of all perceptions old new past and futureThats when well reach nibbanaPolicemen who dont take off their uniforms and go around as plainclothesmen will have trouble uncovering the secrets of criminalsThis is why we have to practice virtue concentration and discernment so that we can get on familiar terms with the five aggregatesThats whats meant by insight meditationConcentration is something you doInsight meditation is letting goYou cant do insight meditationIts a resultWhen virtue is the cause concentration is the resultWhen concentration is the cause discernment is the resultWhen discernment is the cause release is the resultThe skills of insight are things that cant be taughtAt most you can teach people to do the meditation but you cant teach them to be insightfulYou have to do before you can know You have to know before you can let goYou have to give rise to the causes and then the results will come on their ownWhen people out in the sun keep running around they dont realize how hot the sun really isIf you want to know how hot it is you have to sit out in the middle of a field when the sun is really strong for about five minutesThats when youll know what real heat is likeIts the same with stress and painIf the mind goes running around without stopping it doesnt really see stress and painIt has to be still if it wants to seeConcentration is like a mirror for seeing ourselves clearlyDiscernment is like a telescope so that small things will appear large and distant things nearYou have to stop searching  in other words the mind has to be still  before you can give rise to discernmentSearching is ignorance or avijjaThe understanding you gain from listening and reading is like a person who has woken up but hasnt yet opened his eyesHe doesnt see any light and so has to grope around uncertain sometimes laying hold of the right things and sometimes laying hold of the wrongThe understanding you gain from thinking is like a person who has woken up but hasnt yet left the mosquito net and hasnt yet washed the sleep out of his eyesHis vision is blurry and unclearAs for the understanding you gain from meditation thats like getting out of the mosquito net and washing your face so that youre able to see things clearlyThis is the highest kind of understandingTry to develop itTo get full results from our meditation the mind has to give the ordersMindfulness is what does the work and assists in the progress of all our activities while alertness is what observes the results of what weve doneTo speak in terms of the frames of reference these qualities are called mindfulness and alertnessTo speak in terms of jhana theyre called directed thought and evaluationTheyre the qualities that give rise to discernmentDiscernment comes from observing causes and effectsIf we know effects without knowing causes that doesnt qualify as discernmentIf we know causes without knowing effects that doesnt qualify eitherWe have to know both of them together with our mindfulness and alertnessThis is what qualifies as allaround knowing in the full sense of the termThe allaround knowing that arises within us comes from causes and effects not from what we read in books hear other people tell us or conjecture on our ownSuppose we have some silver coins in our pocketIf all we know is that other people say its money we dont know its qualitiesBut if we experiment with it and put it in a smelter to see what its made of and to see how it can be made into other things thats when well know its true qualitiesThis is the kind of knowledge that comes from our own actionsThis knowledge when we meditate comes in five formsWe find within ourselves that some things are caused by the properties of the body some are caused by the mind some causes come from the mind but have an effect on the body some causes come from the body but have an effect on the mind some causes come from the body and mind acting togetherThis kind of knowledge is discernmentSo we have to learn from virtue concentration and discernment by giving rise to themIf we dont well suffer from unawareness and delusionMindfulness is what brings light to the mind like a candleIf we take a candle into a room at night close the windows and doors and fill in all the cracks in the walls no wind from outside will be able to slip in and make the flame waverThe flame will give off even more light and well be able to see everything in the room clearlyClosing the windows and doors and filling in the cracks means exercising restraint over our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind so that our attention doesnt go straying out after outside perceptions and preoccupationsThis is called restraint through mindfulnessOur mindfulness will gather into oneWhen mindfulness is strong the results are immediate a sense of ease and mental wellbeingWhen mindfulness is solid and unflagging our concentration will become strongerThe mind will be still and uprightLight will arise in one of two ways from within ourself or from whats reflected off the wallsThis is why mindfulness is the cause the supporting factor that keeps our concentration progressingFor this reason we shouldnt forget to appreciate this mental qualityWhen we know that certain causes give rise to happiness and wellbeing we should look after those causesIts like when other people share food with usWe shouldnt forget their kindnessOr when our parents raise us and care for us from when we were small When we grow up and can establish ourselves in the world we shouldnt forget their kindnessWe have to show our gratitude and take care of them at all times to repay their kindnessOnly then will we be able to progress in life without backslidingSo mindfulness is like our parentsWe have to look after it always for its the mother of all skillful qualitiesThe reason we gain any happiness in life is because of mindfulnessFor this reason mindfulness is what brings peace to the mindSitting here and bringing the mind to stillness is not really all that hard to doThe reason it seems hard is because we misunderstand thingsOur views are wrong and so are our presuppositionsIf we study so as to understand this point well know the truthFor example when we think that the mind goes here or there thats not the truthIts just a preconceived notionActually the mind stays with the body at all timesWhat goes is just the light as with a flashlightThe bulb stays in the flashlight its simply the light that goes flashing outThe bulb and the light are two different thingsThe bulb has light but the light outside of the flashlight doesnt have a bulbThe mind  awareness itself  stays with the body with each inandout breathThe knowledge that goes flashing out isnt the real thingYou cant take the light and put it back in the flashlight just as when a person tries to catch a light beam it doesnt stick in his handsSo if the mind is always in the present why do we practice concentrationWe practice concentration because there are two kinds of fire or electricity in the mind hot fire the fires of passion aversion  delusion and cool fire the fire of jhana or mental absorptionIf we understand how to train the mind well meet with the cool fireHot fire is bad for the nerves of our eyes ears nose tongue and bodyOur sense organs are like light bulbsThe nerves of the senses are like the filaments in the bulbsIf we hook them up to the wrong kind of current theyll explode immediatelyIf we hook them up to the right current but never turn them off theyll wear outSo we practice concentration because we want cool electricity the cool fire of jhanaCool electricity does no damage to our senses and enables us to use our senses to see the truth to understand everything we see hear smell taste touch and think aboutThis way the mind can be cool and at peaceThis is the skill of insight meditationWhen sights strike against the eye perceptions arise right at the contact and we can see them with discernmentWhen sounds strike the ear when smells strike the nose when flavors strike the tongue when tactile sensations strike the body or ideas strike the mind discernment gets right there in between themThis way sights dont stick to the eye and the eye doesnt stick to sights sounds dont stick to the ears the ears dont stick to sounds and so forthThis is intuitive insight or sixfactored equanimity which can let go both of the senses and of their objectsThe true mind stays cool and at peace like the cool fire that lasts and poses a danger to no oneWhen people dont train their minds they have to live with hot fire which wears down different parts of their minds such as the nerves of their eyes ears nose tongue and bodyWhen these nerves wear down they become ignorantTheir eyesight is darkenedWhen they see sights they dont know the truth of those sightsThis is called unawarenessTheir ears go deaf When they hear sounds they dont know the truth of those soundsThe same holds for their nose tongue body and mindWhatever they sense they dont know the truth of those thingsThis is called unawarenessIt gives rise to craving and defilement and leads to sufferingThis is what it means to be ignorant of the truthPeople ignorant of the truth are like the blindThey have trouble everywhere they walk thinking that high things are low and low things are high  as when a blind person walks along level ground lifting his feet up high because hes afraid he might trip over somethingIn the same way people who dont know the truth think that deep Dhamma is shallow shallow Dhamma is deep high Dhamma is low low Dhamma is highThats Wrong ViewWhen your views are wrong your practice is wrong your release is wrong  like lifting your feet to walk up a set of stairs that doesnt have any stepsThere are people who want to put themselves on a high level but without the proper basisTheir minds dont have any concentrationThey keep walking thinking imagining about highlevel Dhamma but they end up back where they startedTheyre like a blind person trying to climb a staircase whose bottom step is missingHell just keep stomping on the same spot of groundIn the same way people on a low level who think theyre on a high level end up sinking further and further into the groundThe more they try to climb up the deeper they goLike an elephant fallen into the mud The more she struggles the deeper she sinksThe steps of the stairs are virtue concentration and discernmentIf we follow the steps well get to where we want to go  like a person with good eyesight climbing stairs that actually have stepsPeople who practice concentration can know things whether their eyes are opened or closed because they have brightness within themSankhara means fashioningSankharas are things that we have to study in order to know them clearly for what they areAnd we have to be wise to them tooThere are two kindsWorld sankharas are things like gain status praise and pleasureThese things arise and then pass awayDhamma sankharas are our own physical and mental phenomena aggregates elements and sense mediaThese things also arise and pass away in just the same waySo as long as we have them we should put them to a good useOtherwise theyll turn around and kill usIf we dont work at training them they simply stay at the level of plain phenomenaBut if we train them we get more and more worth out of themLike clay If were intelligent enough we can make it into a pot to cook our foodHigher than that we can make it into tiles to cover our roofIf we put a glaze on the tiles they become even more valuableIt all depends on how much discernment we have in understanding how to work with things so as to increase their valueThe breath is the bodily sankhara ie the factor that fashions the bodyVerbal sankharas are the thoughts that you put into words so that you have them ready to say but without speaking out loudMental sankharas are thoughts that arent involved with speakingYou simply think and then know what the thought is aboutVerbal and mental sankharas are very similarIn training the mind the important point is to make an effort to prevent verbal sankharas from arisingWhether they deal with past or future perceptions you have to brush them all awayBodily sankharas are the present aspect of the body ie the breathMental sankharas are the present aspect of the mind ie the awareness that forms the basis for thinkingMental sankharas form the essence of sufferingSankharas are the valuables of stupid peopleYou have to get rid of the smoke if you want to see the flameYou have to get rid of the sankharas in the mind if you want to see the UnfashionedTaking pleasure in sights sounds smells tastes etc is sensual cravingThe mental state that wanders out in search of an object but hasnt yet found anything that pleases it is craving for becomingThe mental state that wavers or leans in its present preoccupation is craving for no becomingNot knowing these aspects of the mind is unawarenessLabels of the past and future are the world The present is the DhammaDont let yourself get taken in by even the slightest labelingEven if you get only slightly involved thats a state of becoming and youll have to suffer more birth aging illness and deathThe skill of release is when past is simply a movement future is simply a movement and present is simply a movement but theres no kammaYou can think of the past but the mind doesnt taste any results from the thinkingFor the mind to attain dispassion you need to have the skill to determine whats detrimental in the present so that you can spit out any passion immediatelyThe past isnt for real the future isnt for realIf they were for real they would have to stay for goodIf youre intelligent you wont take the things that youve already spit out and put them back in your mouth againPassion and craving are like eating and swallowing or gathering inDispassion is like spitting out or throwing awayIf you grasp after things that have gotten away from you or havent reached you yet thats craving and passionDispassion is like when food touches your tongue you notice it immediately and spit it out before it gets swallowedWhen the Buddha was still a lay person he tried to track down the source of true happinessHe asked himself Does happiness come from being wealthy But when he looked at wealth he saw that it had its drawbacksSo he turned to learning but learning also had its drawbacksHe turned to power but he saw that power involved killing and warSo he contemplated things back and forth like this asking himself what he could do to find true happinessFinally he realized that happiness comes from pain pain comes from happinessThe world has to keep spinning around like thisAnd when something spins around it has to have an axle  otherwise how could it spinSo when theres something that spins there also has to be something that doesnt spinHe kept contemplating this until he found the source of all spinning and not spinning which lies right here in the heartThere are two kinds of knowing true knowing and imitation knowingTrue knowing is what stays right here and now without going anywhere elseYou know when youre standing you know when youre lying down speaking thinking etcAs for imitation knowing thats the knowledge that goes after labels and perceptionsLabels are an act of knowing but theyre not the knowing itselfTheyre like the shadow of knowingTrue knowing is being mindful of the present seeing causes and effectsThis is discernmentKnowing in line with labels in line with books or with what people say is imitation knowing not the real thingIts like the shadow of knowingReal knowing is the knowing that arises within yourselfIts paccattam ie entirely personalIts the kind of knowing that cant be taught and cant be toldIt has to arise within youOnly then will you know whats inconstant stressful and notself and whats constant easeful and selfChangeoflineage knowledge sees both sides and lets go of bothThe truth of the Dhamma is Dhammathiti the aspect of mind that stays in place without changingThe movements and characteristics of the mind are simply shadows or imitations of knowingIn practicing the Dhamma you want true knowingIf you dont really practice youll meet up only with the shadows of the DhammaFor this reason we should practice so that true knowing will appear within us Dhammathiti is something that by its nature stays in placeIt doesnt change or waver rise or fall in line with the mental objects that come into contactIts the mind released from suffering and stress the mind that stays in line with its true natureEven though there may be thinking or talking or acting in all kinds of ways the mind simply is awareIt doesnt show any symptoms of changing from its primal natureSay for example that we place a glass here without anyone or anything touching it or moving itIt will stay right there for ten years one hundred years without breakingThe mind thats Dhammathiti is just like thatOr you can say that its like writing the number without changing it into anything elseIt will have to stay the same it was in the first placeThis is called DhammathitiAlways contemplate things in terms of inconstancy stress and notself  but you also have to look at them in terms of constancy ease and self as wellYou have to look at things from both sides and not just at their shortcomingsYou have to look at their uses too but you cant let yourself get attached to either sideOtherwise youll be like a person with one eye Constancy ease and self will be able to sneak up and hit you over the head without your realizing itInsight has two sides the side that sees in line with what were taught and the side that sees in the other directionSeeing in line with what people say can turn into a corruption of insightSeeing in the other direction means seeing in line with things they dont sayWherever they say theres inconstancy thats where theres constancyWherever they say theres stress thats where theres easeWherever they say theres notself thats where theres selfThis is intuitive insightThe still calm of discernment is not something the Buddha wanted because its not really calm not really stillThe ultimate happiness is something even higher than discernmentThose who have attained the transcendent  streamwinners oncereturners nonreturners and arahants These terms apply not to people but to the mindWe are like a treeAttachment is like vinesIf we feel desire for sights theyll wind around our eyesIf we feel desire for sounds theyll wind around our ears and so forthWhen were all tangled up like this well have to dieSome people dont let themselves die naturallyThey take their attachments and tie up their own throatsThe world is like red ants that crawl along vinesIf we cut away the vines that entangle our tree the ants wont be able to get to itWe have to cut away whatever we canIf the mind is long make it shortIf its short make it roundIf its round make it smoothIf its smooth make it shineThat way it can roll around without getting stuck on anything and can gain release from all suffering and stressSuffering comes from having This is why people in the world are suffering soIf they have five they want to increase it to tenOnce they have ten they think theyll be able to relaxBut when they actually get ten they then increase it toAnd then they have to keep looking for more all the time for fear that theyll lose what they haveOnly when they stop breathing will they stop looking for moreThis is why were taught that having is sufferingAnd this is why the Buddha arranged not to have anything at allHe said Physical form feeling perception thoughtformations and consciousness are not mineThe senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation are not mine When nothing was his how could anyone take anything away from himWho could come and oppress himIf people give us things we say that we get that we have If they take them away we say that we lose But when theres nothing to own theres no having or losingAnd when thats the case where will there be any sufferingNibbana is the end of all having and lackingIf we dont know how to let go were going to sufferSuppose that were carrying something in our handIf we dont let it go and put it down we wont be able to take hold of anything better than what weve gotThis is why the Buddha taught us to let goFor one thing our hand wont get sweaty from carrying things aroundSecondly we can take what weve put down turn it over and look at it from every side to see what it really isSay that were holding a knife tight in our fistWe cant look at it to see what kind of knife it isBut if we open our fist and put the knife down we can then look at it carefully to see whether its made from steel wood horn or ivory whether its wellmade or not and what uses its good forTo hold onto the body is to hold onto old kammaTo let go of the body is to let go of old kammaAnd when we can let go in this way there will be no more kamma in the bodyIts the same as with a piece of propertyIf we take possession of it with a deed and the boundary staked out there tend to be problems with trespassing swindling boundary disputes and cases in courtBut if we dont take possession of it and simply let it be public property there will be no troubles or quarrelsThis way the heart can be at its easeIf the heart gets caught up on anything its got to be badIf you can see being born and not being born as equal being sick and not being sick as equal dying and not dying as equal as having the same price then the mind can relax and not be caught up on anything at allIn the first stage we let go of evil and start doing goodIn the second stage we let go of evil and some forms of goodIn the third stage we let go of everything good and evil because everything is fashioned by nature and thus undependableWe do good but were not attached to itWhen you let go you have to do it intelligently and not in a ruinous way  ie by not doing goodYou cant hold on even to your opinions much less to material thingsWhen you do good you do it for the sake of the living beings of the world for your children and grandchildrenYou do everything in the best way possible but youre not attached to it because you know that all things fashioned are inconstantThis way your heart can be clear and bright like a jewelIf you get caught up on praise or blame youre foolishIts like drinking other peoples salivaWhen you act rightly there are people who will say that youre right and those who will say that youre wrongWhen you act wrong there are people who will say that youre wrong and those who will say that youre rightTheres nothing constant about good or evil right or wrongEvil comes from good and good from evilFor example when we eat rice we say its delicious but then as it goes down through the body it turns into something just the oppositeThieves come from rich peopleIf people didnt have possessions and treasures where would there be any thieves to steal from themThe Buddha saw that evil isnt something you can depend uponGood isnt something you can depend uponThats why he let go of both good and evil by not connecting their wires into his heartHe gained release from all good and evil and so transcended all the affairs of the worldThat was how he entered the highest happinessThe power of good and evil is like a magnet that pulls the mind to do good or evil and then be born in good or evil places in line with its pullIf we do good or evil its as if we leave magnets behind in the worldThose magnets will pull our minds to their levelPeople who arent intelligent enough to know how to avoid or extract themselves from the power of good and evil are sure to be pulled along by the force field of these magnetsTheyll have to keep swimming around in the world of rebirthThis is why wise people try to find a way to cut the force field so that they can escape its power and float freeIn other words they do good and cut the force fieldThey do things that may not be good and they cut the force fieldThey dont let these things connectIn other words they dont get attached to the things theyve doneThey dont keep fondling themThis is what it means to be discerning knowing how to cut the force fields of the worldThe mind is neither good nor evil but its what knows good and knows evilIts what does good and does evilAnd its what lets go of good and lets go of evilIts not the case that things will progress if we cling to them or deteriorate if we let them goAttachment is like a bridgeIf theres no bridge whos going to walk across itTheres just this side of the river and the other sideThe eye exists so it can see both sides but theres no connectionThe mind that isnt caught up on its preoccupations is like a lotus leaf in the waterThe water cant seep into the leafIt simply rolls around as a bead across the surfaceTheres awareness but no attachmentAwareness without attachment is like electricity without a wireTheres just brightnessWhen theres no wire no one can get electrocutedOr you could say that its like a flame that doesnt need a lampNo wick gets used up no oil gets consumed and yet theres lightIf we separate the body and the mind from each other our ordinary awareness disappears but that doesnt mean that awareness is annihilatedIts still there but its a special awareness that doesnt have to depend on the body or mindIts the same as when we separate the wax of a candle from its wick The flame disappears but the fire potential isnt annihilatedWhether or not theres fuel it exists in the world by its very natureThis is the awareness of nibbanaArahants can speak and act but they dont speak or act the way ordinary people doThey know how to separate thingsLike a person speaking over the radio Even though we may hit the radio it doesnt reach the person speakingThe experience of release has no sense of before or after or even any presentWhen the heart is empty it feels light and free with no preoccupations at allLike a bird Even though it has feet it doesnt leave any tracks in the airIn the same way when the mind is empty even if people criticize you theres no writing in the airNothing gets stuck in the heartTranquillity meditation means to keep the mind quiet in cravingInsight meditation means knowing both the mind with craving and the mind without cravingKnowing perceptions of past and future for what they are is intuitive knowledgeThis kind of knowledge isnt stuck on any perceptions at allThis is called the skill of releaseIts not stuck on the mind with craving or the mind without cravingIts like writing letters in the airThe air doesnt get used up the writing doesnt require any effort and you cant read what it says at allWhether you write good or bad things you cant read what they sayThe air is there but as for shapes in the air there are noneNibbana The unbinding of the mind from sensations and mental acts preoccupations and suppositionsAs this term is also used to refer to the extinguishing of a fire it carries the connotations of stilling cooling and peaceIn Buddhism we use the words self and noself and so it is important to understand just what this noself anatta is all about even if it is first just an idea because the essence of the Buddhas teaching hinges on this conceptAnd in this teaching Buddhism is uniqueNo one no other spiritual teacher has formulated noself in just this wayAnd because it has been formulated by him in this way there is also the possibility of speaking about itMuch has been written about noself but in order to know it one has to experience itAnd that is what the teaching aims at the experience of noselfYet in order to experience noself one has first to fully know selfActually know itBut unless we do know what this self is this self called me it is impossible to know what is meant by there is no self there In order to give something away we have to first fully have it in handWe are constantly trying to reaffirm selfWhich already shows that this self is a very fragile and rather wispy sort of affair because if it werent why would we constantly have to reaffirm itWhy are we constantly afraid of the self being threatened of its being insecure of its not getting what it needs for survivalIf it were such a solid entity as we believe it to be we would not feel threatened so oftenWe affirm self again and again through identificationWe identify with a certain name an age a sex an ability an occupationI am a lawyer I am a doctorI am an accountant I am a student And we identify with the people we are attached toI am a husband I am a wife I am a mother I am a daughter I am a son Now in the manner of speech we have to use self in that way  but it isnt only in speechWe really think that that self is who we areWe really believe itThere is no doubt in our mind that that self is who we areWhen any of these factors is threatened if being a wife is threatened if being a mother is threatened if being a lawyer is threatened if being a teacher is threatened  or if we lose the people who enable us to retain that self  what a tragedyThe selfidentification becomes insecure and me finds it hard to say look at me this is me Praise and blame are includedPraise reaffirms me Blame threatens me So we like the praise and we dislike the blameThe ego is threatenedFame and infamy  same thingLoss and gainIf we gain the ego gets bigger if we lose it gets a bit smallerSo we are constantly in a quandary and in constant fearThe ego might lose a little bit of its grandeurIt might be made a bit smaller by someoneAnd it happens to all of usSomebody is undoubtedly going to blame us for something eventuallyEven the Buddha was blamedNow the blame that is levied at us is not the problemThe problem is our reactionThe problem is that we feel smallerThe ego has a hard time reasserting itselfSo what we usually do is we blame back making the others ego a bit smaller tooIdentification with whatever it is that we do and whatever it is that we have be it possessions or people is so we believe needed for our survivalSelf survivalIf we dont identify with this or that we feel as if we are in limboThis is the reason why it is difficult to stop thinking in meditationBecause without thinking there would be no identificationIf I dont think what do I identify withIt is difficult to come to a stage in meditation in which there is actually nothing to identify with any moreHappiness too may be an identificationI am happy I am unhappy Because we are so keen on survival we have got to keep on identifyingWhen this identification becomes a matter of the life or death of the ego which it usually is then the fear of loss becomes so great that we can be in a constant state of fearConstantly afraid to lose either the possessions that make us what we are or the people that make us what we areIf we have no children or if they all die we are no longer a motherSo fear is paramountThe same goes for all other identificationsNot a very peaceful state of living and what is it due toOnly one thing ego the craving to beThis identification results of course in craving for possessingAnd this possessing results in attachmentWhat we have what we identify with we are attached toThat attachment that clinging makes it extremely difficult to have a free and open viewpointThis kind of clinging whatever it may be that we cling to  it may not be clinging to motor cars and houses it may not even be clinging to people  but we certainly cling to views and opinionsWe cling to our world viewWe cling to the view of how we are going to be happyMaybe we cling to a view of who created this universeWhatever it is we cling to even how the government should run the country all of that makes it extremely difficult to see things as they really areTo be openmindedAnd it is only an open mind which can take in new ideas and understandingLord Buddha compared listeners to four different kinds of clay vesselsThe first clay vessel is one that has holes at the bottomIf you pour water into it it runs right outIn other words whatever you teach that person is uselessThe second clay vessel he compared to one that had cracks in itIf you pour water into it the water seeps outThese people cannot rememberCannot put two and two togetherCracks in the understandingThe third listener he compared to a vessel that was completely fullWater cannot be poured in for its full to the brimSuch a person so full of views he cant learn anything newBut hopefully we are the fourth kindThe empty vessels without any holes or cracksCompletely emptyI dare say we are notBut may be empty enough to take in enoughTo be empty like that of views and opinions means a lack of clingingEven a lack of clinging to what we think is realityWhatever we think reality is it surely is not because if it were we would never be unhappy for a single momentWe would never feel a lack of anythingWe would never feel a lack of companionship of ownershipWe would never feel frustrated boredIf we ever do whatever we think is real is notWhat is truly reality is completely fulfillingIf we arent completely fulfilled we arent seeing complete realitySo any view that we may have is either wrong or it is partialBecause it is wrong or partial and bounded by the ego we must look at it with suspicionAnything we cling to keeps us bound to itIf I cling to a tableleg I cant possibly get out the doorThere is no way I can moveI am stuckNot until I let go will I have the opportunity to get outAny identification any possession that is clung to is what stops us from reaching transcendental realityNow we can easily see this clinging when we cling to things and people but we cannot easily see why the five khandhas are called the five clungto aggregatesThat is their name and they are in fact what we cling to mostThat is an entire clingingWe dont even stop to consider when we look at our body and when we look at our mind or when we look at feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  vedana sañña sankhara and viññanaWe look at this mindandbody namarupa and we dont even doubt the fact that this is my feeling my perception my memory my thoughts and my awareness of my consciousnessAnd no one starts doubting until they start seeingAnd for that seeing we need a fair bit of empty space apart from views and opinionsClinging is the greatest possessiveness and attachment we haveAs long as we cling we cannot see realityWe cannot see reality because clinging is in the wayClinging colors whatever we believe to be trueNow it is not possible to say all right Ill stop clinging We cant do thatThe process of taking the me apart of not believing any more that this is one whole is a gradual oneBut if meditation has any benefit and success it must show that first of all there is mind and there is bodyThere isnt one single thing acting in accord all the timeThere is mind which is thinking and making the body actNow that is the first step in knowing oneself a little clearerAnd then we can note this is a feeling and I am giving this feeling a name which means memory and perceptionThis is the thought that I am having about this feelingThe feeling has come about because the mindconsciousness has connected with the feeling that has arisenTake the four parts of the khandhas that belong to the mind apartWhen we do that while it is happening  not now when we are thinking about atbut while it is happening then we get an inkling that this isnt really me that these are phenomena that are arising which stay a moment and then ceaseHow long does mindconsciousness stay on one objectAnd how long do thoughts lastAnd have we really invited themThe clinging the clungto are what make the ego ariseBecause of clinging the notion of me arises and then there is me and me having all the problemsWithout me would there be problemsIf there werent anyone sitting inside me  as we think there is  who is called I or me or John Claire then who is having the problemThe khandhas do not have any problemsThe khandhas are just processesThey are phenomena and that is allThey are just going on and on and onBut because I am grasping at them and trying to hold on to them and saying its me its me feeling its me wanting then problems ariseIf we really want to get rid of suffering completely and totally then clinging has to goThe spiritual path is never one of achievement it is always one of letting goThe more we let go the more there is empty and open space for us to see realityBecause what we let go of is no longer there there is the possibility of just moving without clinging to the results of the movementAs long as we cling to the results of what we do as long as we cling to the results of what we think we are bound we are hemmed inNow there is a third thing that we do we are interested in becoming something or somebodyInterested in becoming an excellent meditatorInterested in becoming a graduateInterested in becoming something which we are notAnd becoming something stops us from beingWhen we are stopped from being we cannot pay attention to what there really isAll this becoming business is of course in the futureSince whatever there is in the future is conjecture it is a dream world we live inThe only reality we can be sure of is this particular moment right now and this particular moment as you must be able to be aware of  has already passed and this one has passed and the next one has also passedSee how they are all passingThat is the impermanence of it allEach moment passes but we cling trying to hold on to themTrying to make them a realityTrying to make them a securityTrying to make them be something which they are notSee how they are all passingWe cannot even say it as quickly as they are doing itThere is nothing that is secureNothing to hold on to nothing that is stableThe whole universe is constantly falling apart and coming back togetherAnd that includes the mind and the body which we call I You may believe it or not it makes no differenceIn order to know it you must experience it when you experience it its perfectly clearWhat one experiences is totally clearNo one can say it is notThey may try but their objections make no sense because you have experienced itIts the same thing as biting into the mango to know its tasteTo experience it one needs meditationAn ordinary mind can only know ordinary concepts and ideasIf one wants to understand and experience extraordinary experiences and ideas one has to have an extraordinary mindAn extraordinary mind comes about through concentrationMost meditators have experienced some stage that is different then the one they are use toSo it is not ordinary any moreBut we have to fortify that far more than just the beginning stageTo the point where the mind is truly extraordinaryExtraordinary in the sense that it can direct itself to where it wants to goExtraordinary in the sense that it no longer gets perturbed by everyday eventsAnd when the mind can concentrate then it experiences states which it has never known beforeTo realize that your universe constantly falls apart and comes back together again is a meditative experienceIt takes practice perseverance and patienceAnd when the mind is unperturbed and still equanimity evenmindedness peacefulness ariseAt that time the mind understands the idea of impermanence to such an extent that it sees itself as totally impermanentAnd when one sees ones own mind as being totally impermanent there is a shift in ones viewpointThat shift I like to compare with a kaleidoscope that children play withA slight touch and you get a different pictureThe whole thing looks quite different with just a slight shiftNonself is experienced through the aspect of impermanence through the aspect of unsatisfactoriness and through the aspect of emptinessEmpty of whatThe word emptiness is so often misunderstood because when one only thinks of it as a concept one says what do you mean by empty Everything is there there are the people and there are their insides guts and their bones and blood and everything is full of stuff  and the mind is not empty eitherIts got ideas thoughts and feelingsAnd even when it doesnt have those what do you mean by emptinessThe only thing that is empty is the emptiness of an entityThere is no specific entity in anythingThat is emptinessThat is the nothingnessThat nothingness is also experienced in meditationIt is empty it is devoid of a specific person devoid of a specific thing devoid of anything which makes it permanent devoid of anything which even makes it importantThe whole thing is in fluxSo the emptiness is thatAnd the emptiness is to be seen everywhere to be seen in oneselfAnd that is what is called anatta nonselfEmpty of an entityThere is nobody thereIt is all imaginationAt first that feels very insecureThat person that Ive been regarding with so much concern that person trying to do this or that that person who will be my security will be my insurance for a happy life  once I find that person  that person does not really existWhat a frightening and insecure idea that isWhat a feeling of fear arisesBut as a matter of fact its just the reverseIf one accepts and bears that fright and goes through it one comes to complete and utter relief and releaseIll give you a simile Imagine you own a very valuable jewel which is so valuable that you place your trust in it so that should you fall upon hard times it will look after youIts so valuable that you can have it as your securityYou dont trust anybodySo you have a safe inside your house and that is where you put your jewelNow you have been working hard for a number of years and you think you deserve a holidaySo now what to do with the jewelObviously you cannot take it with you on your seaside holidaySo you buy new locks for the doors to your house and you bar your windows and you alert your neighborsYou tell them about the proposed holiday and ask them to look after you house  and the safe in itAnd they say they will of courseYou should be quite at ease and so you go off on your holidayYou go to the beach and its wonderfulMarvelousThe palm trees are swaying in the wind and the spot youve chosen on the beach is nice and cleanThe waves are warm and its all lovelyThe first day you really enjoy yourselfBut on the second day you begin to wonder the neighbors are very nice people but they do go and visit their childrenThey are not always at home and lately there has been a rash of burglaries in the neighborhoodAnd on the third day youve convinced yourself that something dreadful is going to happen and you go back homeYou walk in and open the safeEverything is all rightYou go over to the neighbors and they ask Why did you come backWe were looking after your placeYou didnt have to come backEverything is fineThe next year the same thingAgain you tell the neighbors Now this time I am really going to stay away for a monthI need this holiday as Ive been working hard So they say Absolutely no need to worry just take offGo to the beach So once more you bar the windows lock the doors get everything shipshape and take off for the beachAgain its wonderful beautifulThis time you last for five daysOn the fifth day you are convinced that something dreadful must have happenedAnd you go homeYou go home and by golly it hasThe jewel is goneYou are in a state of complete collapseTotal desperationDepressedSo you go to the neighbors but they have no idea what has happenedtheyve been around all the timeThen you sit and consider the matter and you realize that since the jewel is gone you might as well go back to the beach and enjoy yourselfThat jewel is selfOnce it is gone all the burden of looking after it all the fears about it all the barring of doors and windows and heart and mind is no longer necessaryYou can just go and enjoy yourself while youre still in this bodyAfter proper investigation the frightening aspect of losing this thing that seemed so precious turns out to be the only relief and release from worry that there isThere are three doors to liberation the signless the desireless and emptinessIf we understand impermanence anicca fully it is called the signless liberationIf we understand suffering dukkha fully it is the desireless liberationIf we understand noself anatta fully then it is the emptiness liberationWhich means we can go through any of these three doorsAnd to be liberated means never to have to experience an unhappy moment againIt also means something else it means we are no longer creating kammaA person who has been completely liberated still acts still thinks still speaks and still looks to all intents and purposes like anybody else but that person has lost the idea that I am thinking I am speaking I am actingKamma is no longer being made because there is just the thought just the speech just the actionThere is the experience but no experiencerAnd because no kamma is being made any longer there is no rebirthThat is full enlightenmentIn this tradition three stages of enlightenment have been classified before one comes to the fourth stage full enlightenmentThe first stage the one we can concern ourselves with  at least theoretically  is called sotapanna streamentererIt means a person who has seen Nibbana once and has thereby entered the streamThat person cannot be deterred from the Path any moreIf the insight is strong there may be only one more lifetimeIf the insight is weak it can be seven more lifetimesHaving seen Nibbana for oneself once one loses some of the difficulties one had beforeThe most drastic hindrance that one loses is the idea that this person we call I is a separate entityThe wrong view of self is lostBut that doesnt mean that a sotapanna is constantly aware of noselfThe wrong view is lostBut the right view has to be reinforced again and again and experienced again and again through that reinforcementSuch a person no longer has any great interest and certainly no belief in rites and ritualsThey may still be performed because they are traditional or that are customary but such a person no longer believes they can bring about any kind of liberationAnd then a very interesting thing is lost skeptical doubtSkeptical doubt is lost because one has seen for oneself that what the Buddha taught was actually soUntil that time skeptical doubt will have to arise again and again because one can easily think Well maybeMaybe its so but how can I be sure One can only be sure through ones own experienceThen of course there is no skeptical doubt left because one has seen exactly that which has been described and having seen it ones own heart and mind gives an understanding which makes it possible to see everything elseDhamma must have as its base the understanding that there is no special entityThere is continuity but there is no special entityAnd that continuity is what makes it so difficult for us to see that there really isnt anybody inside the body making things happenThings are happening anywaySo the first instance of having seen a glimpse of freedom called streamentry makes changes within usIt certainly does not uproot greed and hate  in fact they are not even mentionedBut through the greater understanding such a person has the greed and the hate lessenThey are not as strong anymore and they do not manifest in gross ways but do remain in subtle waysThe next stages are the oncereturner then the nonreturner then the arahantOncereturner one more life in the fivesense worldNonreturner no human life necessary and arahant fully enlightenedSensual desire and hate only go with nonreturners and complete conceit of self only with arahantSo we can be quite accepting of the fact that since we are not arahants we still have greed and hateIt isnt a matter of blaming oneself for having them its a matter of understanding where these come fromThey come from the delusion of meI want to protect this jewel which is meThat is how they ariseBut with the continued practice of meditation the mind can become clearer and clearerIt finally understandsAnd when it does understand it can see transcendental realityEven if seen for one thoughtmoment the experience is of great impact and makes a marked change in our livesSister Khema was born in Germany educated in Scotland and China and later became a United States citizenShe now lives at Wat Buddha Dhamma Forest Monastery near Sydney Australia which was established in on land purchased and donated by herIn she ordained as a Nun in Sri Lanka and in she established the International Buddhist Womens Centre near ColomboShe spends most of her time teaching meditation course in different parts of the worldRains Retreat is spent in Sri LankaThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIts the nature of the world that nothing is totally badEverything has to have at least some good to itThe same holds true with the various forms of Mara or the demons of temptation that get in the way of our practiceIts not the case that they always obstruct usSometimes they turn into our friends and companions sometimes into our workers and supporters sometimes into our slaves helping us and caring for usThis is why if youre discerning you have to walk a middle courseOn one hand you have to focus on their bad sideOn the other you have to focus on their goodTheir good and bad sides are realities that have to exist togetherAs for us we have to take a stance in the middle examining things so that we dont act out of suspicion or prejudiceOnce we see the good side of these things we can get more familiar with themWe can get intimateWhen we get familiar and intimate we develop a sense of kinship with themAs the Buddha said vissasa parama ñati familiarity is the highest form of kinshipEven our enemies when we become familiar with them can become our friendsOur companionsOur servantsOur slavesWhen we can look at things in this way both sides benefitWe benefit and our Maras benefit as wellIn the time of the Buddha for instance the Buddha got so familiar with Mara that eventually Mara got converted and felt favorably inclined to the merit and skillfulness that the Buddha had developedOnce Mara had no more power over the Buddha he paid homage to the Buddha and found himself transported to heavenAnd thats not allHe became a bodhisattvaIn the future hell gain Awakening as a fully selfawakened BuddhaSo he benefited and the Buddha benefitedThis is the nature of people with discernment they can take bad things and turn them into goodAs for us we still lie under the sway of Maras of various kindsThese intimidating Maras are called KilesaMaras the demons of defilementThe big ones the really infamous ones are greed aversion and delusionThese are the famous onesAs for the ones that stay more in the background behind the scenes those are kamatanha craving for sensuality struggling to get things in ways that are offensive to the Dhamma bhavatanha craving for things to be this way or that and vibhavatanha craving that things not happenFor instance once weve gained wealth we dont want to lose it once weve gained status we dont want anyone to wipe out the edge we have over othersThis is vibhavatanhaThese three forms of craving are also demons of defilement but theyre not very well knownOnly once in a long long while do you hear anyone mention their namesAs for greed aversion and delusion theyre very big very powerful very well knownThe mother of all these Maras is ignoranceEverything comes out of ignoranceGoodness comes from ignoranceEvil comes from ignoranceTo call things by their proper names ignorance is the requisite condition for fabrications and fabrications when they arise come in three sortsThese forms of fabrication are also demons of defilementTheyre the children of Mara but they rarely show their faces in publicTheyre like the children of nobility children in the royal palaceThey hardly ever show their faces outside so very few people know their names very few people have seen their facesUnless you develop the mind in concentration you wont get to see these beautiesIf you develop concentration you can peer inside using your discernment to part the curtains and then youll get to see these children of MaraThe mother of Mara ignorance lies even deeper insideIgnorance means not being acquainted with your own mind  mistaking your thinking for your mind mistaking your knowledge for the mind thinking that your thoughts of the past or future are the mind thinking that the body is the mind or the mind is the body that feeling is the mind or the mind is feeling that mental qualities are the mind or that the mind is mental qualities that the mind is the self or the self is the mind not being able to separate these things from yourself getting yourself all entangled thats called ignoranceIn short ignorance means getting caught up on the presentAll of the things Ive mentioned so far are called the demons of defilementThey bother us all the time get in our way all the time which is why theyre called the demons of defilementHow are they demonsWhen you get really greedy for instance it gets in the way of your being generous and giving donationsYou simply want to get and dont want to giveThats how greed is a demonWhen we get possessive of things holding on tight and someone destroys what were holding onto we get upset and feel mistreatedThis puts our mind into a turmoil and gets it all stirred upThis is how greed is a demonThe same holds true for angerOnce it arises you dont give a damn about anythingYou see other people as nothing more than red or black ants all you have to do is step on them and theyre done forThe explosive power of anger is more violent than anything elseWhether or not youll actually be able to get your way you dont careYoure brazen and foolhardyBut if anyone comes along at that time and tries to persuade you to act in a skillful way you dont want anything of what they have to sayThe anger has to go its course until it runs out on its ownThis is why its called a demon because you cant do anything good while youre under its powerDelusion is even worseDelusion seeps into you the way blood seeps throughout every part of your bodyWhen we do evil were deludedWhen we do good were still deludedEven though were welleducated in the Dhamma we cant yet escape from the power of delusionNo matter who we are it stays right on our heelsWe may want to make merit but when were deluded we dont know whats right and whats wrongWe simply want the meritWe observe the precepts because we want to be good but we dont know what real virtue isIts the same when we practice concentrationWe want to get results but we cant tell right concentration from wrongWe simply keep on wantingThis is called delusion in that our knowledge isnt in line with the truthIts not that we dont know anythingWe know but what we know goes straying away from the truthWere like a person who has lost his way he can still keep going its just that hes not on the right pathSuppose for instance that we want to go to Bangkok but we get confused about the way and start heading to BangPuuWere off the path as far as Bangkok is concerned but were on the right path for BangPuu  and we can keep on goingIts not the case that when youre on the wrong path you cant goYou can but its the wrong path as far as the destination you wantYoure simply going to end up disappointedThis is why delusion is called a demonThe second level of demons are the forms of cravingThere are three forms of craving but they boil down to two sortsWe translate craving as desire and desire has two typesOne is desire mixed with lust in the ordinary way of the worldThe second has no lustIts simply a sense of inclination affection a liking for objectsFor example we feel a liking for certain sightsWe see certain material objects and we like the way they look so we search for them  in other words we want to get themThis too is a type of cravingThe same holds true for the various sounds we likeWe struggle to get hold of themOur desire pulls us yanks us drags us along  whether or not well get what we want we have to keep runningIf we get what we want we at least have something to show for our effortsIf we dont its a waste of time and energy and we sufferThis kind of desire is also called craving craving for objects for sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations things we likeThis is desire combined not with lust but with greedSo craving has these two flavors distilled out of kamatanha bhavatanha and vibhavatanha desire combined with lust and desire free of lustThese too are demons of defilementEach of them prevents the mind from inclining toward right concentrationThis is why desire  chanda  is classed as a hindranceDesire on the level of a hindrance covers inclination a sense of liking without any lust mixed inBut theres another type of chanda  called chandaraga or desireandpassion  which is heavier than chanda as a hindranceChanda as a hindrance is lightChandaraga is an enemy of the preceptsChanda as a hindrance is an enemy of concentrationThis is why desire in either sense of the word is classed as a demon a demon of defilementThis is the second levelThe next level of demons are the forms of mental fabricationFor example meritorious fabrications the minds thoughts of concocting or giving rise to meritNow suppose that those thoughts dont succeedThe mind soursLike King Asoka who ruled over the Indian subcontinent governing in two waysOne was through his goodness as a personHis subjects respected him honored him and so they obeyed himThe other way was through his military power and mightThis was why there was law and order among his peopleIn the area of the religion he gave tremendous support and encouragement building a great deal of goodness  so much so that it backfired on himHe gave continual donations to the bhikkhu sangha until one day toward the end of his life he decided that he wanted to use some money to buy donations as a form of homage to the Buddha homage to the Dhamma and homage to the SanghaAfter he had formulated this intention but before he had had the opportunity to spend as much as he wanted he fell illSo he wanted to hurry up and finish making merit in line with his plansHe sent one of his officials to draw more money from the treasury which held both government funds and the kings private fundsWhen the official got to the treasury the treasurer wouldnt hand over the money because he felt that it should go only to the governmentSo the official returned to inform King Asoka who got upsetThese are my funds he thoughtHe wanted to use the funds as a form of homage to the Buddha homage to the Dhamma and homage to the Sangha but when he couldnt do it his mind turned sourAnd it so happened that while his mind was soured he diedNow because he died while he was angry at his treasurer for not letting him make merit the result was that he was born as a gigantic snake an enormous python slithering back and forth around the royal treasuryAnd there he had to stay fixated on his possessions for many days which prevented him from enjoying the results of the good he had doneWhen he was alive he had done good in lots of ways building temples building chedis planting huge numbers of Bodhi trees giving huge donations to the Sangha observing the precepts listening to the DhammaWhen he died he should have been reborn as a male or female deva but instead he went and took birth as a snakeThis is an instance of how good intentions meritorious intentions when they arent fulfilled can lead to defilement and rebirth as a common animalThis is why thoughts of making merit even though theyre meritorious can turn into demonsThe same is even more true with demeritorious fabrications thoughts of doing evilSimply thinking evil is enough to get in the way of our goodnessWhen thoughts of this kind arise in the mind even though we havent yet acted on them even though we havent yet spoken under their influence the simple fact of having a bad intention in the mind is enough to prevent us from reaching the noble paths and fruitionsAn example of this is the story of two villagers two friends on the Buddhist sabbathEarly in the morning the people in the village heard the sound of the bell and gong in the local temple so they got up before daylight and got ready to go give food and listen to a sermon at the templeOne of the friends thought to himself If I go make merit at the temple then when I get back home I wont have anything to eatId better go fishing instead So he cooked some rice and prepared the food for the other friend to take to the templeAs for the friend who went to the temple while he was placing food in the monks bowls taking the precepts and listening to the sermon all he could think was evil thoughts Will my friend catch any fish for us to eat this evening I wonder As he thought about this he developed a strong desire to eat fish curry made from the fish his friend was out killing in the streamThats all he could think about as he was putting food in the monks bowls and listening to the sermonHe wasnt thinking about the killingHe simply thought If my friend catches some fish Ill get to eat As for the friend who was out catching fish all he could think about was I wonder if my friend has put food in the monks bowls yet By now hes probably taken the precepts By now hes probably listening to the sermon and getting lots and lots of merit Thats all he could think aboutNow through the strong meritorious power of his thinking not a single fish got caught in his netEvery time he heard the gong being struck at the temple hed put down his net raise his hands and say Sadhu  all day until darkness fellBecause his thoughts were so lost in doing good his efforts to do evil didnt succeedAs for the friend who went to make merit in the temple his thoughts were lost in eating fish with his friend so he ended up getting hardly any merit at allThe returns on his merit werent worth all the time and effort that had gone into fixing food for the monks taking the precepts and listening to the sermon with his hands folded in respectIn other words his state of mind canceled out his goodness so he ended up no match for his friend who was out doing evil without really wanting toThus his state of mind turned into a demon and harmed him in two ways The first was that he wanted to eat fish but didnt get a single biteThe second was that even though he did gain some merit from the donations he had made to the monks it was only a little bitHe simply went through the motions of putting food in the monks bowls taking the precepts listening to the sermon but his mind was focused on eating murrelfish curry with his friendSo he didnt get any of the good results that he should have from his actionsThis is why its said that evil thoughts cancel out our goodnessEven if were doing good thoughts of this sort cut off our goodness like a palm tree or a coconut tree with its crown cut offOr a banana tree that has borne fruit it wont be able to grow any further to bear flowers or produce any more fruitPeople who think in ways that are evil even if they do good dont meet with any progress in lifeThey meet with nothing but failureThis is called demeritorious fabrication another kind of demon that prevents us from succeeding at giving rise to goodnessThe third kind of mental fabrication is thinking thats neutral that isnt yet good or evilThis kind of thinking can also be a demon of defilementSay for instance that we plan to work on our farmWe dont have time to go to the monastery we tell ourselvesWe dont yet have enough to eat Or if we plan to go selling thingsIf we go to the monastery we wont have time to get a good return Or we spend our time thinking about some important business we have to do that well have to do this and say thatOr we think about going out to cruise around and relax a bitWhen we think in this way it takes up the time we can use to develop goodness within ourselvesWe keep putting it offIn what wayWhen were children we tell ourselves that we can wait until were olderWere not going to die anytime soon so we should take the time to study insteadWhen we become young adults we tell ourselves that we can wait until we get marriedOnce we get married and get ourselves established in our career we tell ourselves to wait until our children are grown and they get marriedGoing to the monastery can wait until weve aged a bitWe keep on putting it off and turn ourselves into nice sweet pigs for Mara to swallow down easily without our even realizing itFinally if we really do survive until old age our children get worried and try to dissuade us from goingMom dont go to the monasteryYoure oldYoull suffer all sorts of hardships And we believe themIf you feel faint or get sick its going to be hard for you Your eyes get so that you cant see your ears get so that you cant hearYou cant hear the sermons cant hear when theyre giving the preceptsYour eyes your ears every path for doing good gets closed off and sealed up tightThis is what happens to people who get all wrapped up in their work  worried about how theyre going to eat sleep and live worried about wealth and poverty to the point where they cant develop any skillfulness and see it throughThese ways of thinking are a type of mental fabrication that fools us trips us up pulls us back ties us downThats why they count as a type of Mara as demons of defilementThe demon of defilement on the fourth level is ignorance not being acquainted with thingsWe arent acquainted with suffering and stress arent acquainted with the cause of stress arent acquainted with the cessation of stress or with the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressOur not being acquainted with these four noble truths is one aspect of ignoranceAnother aspect is not knowing which affairs are past which ones are future and which ones are presentThese three plus the four noble truths add up to sevenAnd then theres not knowing ignorance itself which makes eightThese forms of unawareness are called avijja or ignoranceWhat this all boils down to is not knowing the pathFor instance when we practice the four frames of reference kayanupassana  we focus on the body in and of itself but we dont understand the bodyWe think that the body is the mind or the mind is the bodyThis is ignoranceIts darkIt closes off the body and closes off the mind so that we think that theyre one and the same thingWe cant separate the body from the mind or the mind from the bodyThis is called not knowing our pathVedananupassana we focus on feelings in and of themselves but we arent really acquainted with feelingsFeelings here means the act of savoring sensations which sometimes are pleasant sometimes painful sometimes neither pleasant nor painfulWe think that the pleasure is the same thing as our own mind or that our self is what has pleasureOr we think that the pain is the same thing as our self or that our self is what has painWe cant separate the pleasure and pain from the mind so they get tightly tangled up togetherWe cant separate them cant tell whats whatThis is called ignorance not being acquainted with the pathCittanupassana we focus on the mind in and of itself but we arent really acquainted with the mindWhat is the mindActually there are two aspects to the mindTheres mental consciousness and then theres the mind itselfWe think that consciousness is the mind that the mind is consciousnessActually consciousness is what goesSay that we see a sight in BangkokCakkhuviññana  eyeconsciousness  is what goes to the sight but the mind doesnt goThe act of going is whats called consciousness but theres no substance to itSotaviññana Sometimes we remember sounds from the pastThoughts of sounds appear in the mind and we focus on them so that we can remember what this or that person said how beautiful it wasWhat weve remembered is sotaviññana consciousness at the earThen theres consciousness at the noseWe can recognize what smells are making contactWe can remember what smells there were and what things we smelled in the pastThe mental current that goes out to know these things is called ghanaviññanaThen theres kayaviññana consciousness at the bodyWe can recognize hot air cold airWe can recognize that This kind of coolness is the coolness of water that kind of coolness is the coolness of wind this kind of heat is the heat of fire this kind of heat is the heat of hot air that kind of heat is the heat of the sun We can recognize these things clearlyWe could even write a textbook about themKnowing these things is called kayaviññanaManoviññana consciousness at the intellectOur thinking goes out to Bangkok to the forest to the wilderness all around the worldOur knowledge of these thoughts is manoviññana while the mind is what stays right here in the presentIt cant go anywhereThe part of the mind thats awareness itself cant go anywhere at allIt stays right hereIt goes out only as far as the skinTheres awareness of things beyond the skin but that awareness isnt the mindIts consciousnessTheres no substance to consciousness no substance at all just like the airSo we dont have to get entangled with itWe can separate consciousness out of the mind separate the mind out of consciousnessThe mind is like a fire consciousness the light of the fireThe light and the fire are two different things even though the light comes out of the fireWhen we dont understand this thats called ignoranceWe conceive consciousness to be the mind and the mind to be consciousnessWhen we have things all mixed up like this thats called ignoranceDhammanupassanaWe focus on dhammas in and of themselves ie the mental qualities that arise in the mindWhen unskillful qualities arise in the mind we dont know how much harm they causeThats ignoranceAs for skillful qualities which ones give only small benefits which ones give medium benefits and which ones give overwhelming benefits we dont knowThis means that we arent acquainted with the qualities of the mindWhen we dont know the qualities of the mind we cant separate good from evil or evil from good we cant separate the mind from its qualities or the qualities from the mindEverything is firmly stuck together in a big thick mass so that we cant pry them apartThis is called ignoranceIgnorance is a Mara a demon a demon that stands in the way preventing us from attaining the highest good ie nibbanaAll four of these types of defilement are called the Maras or demons of defilementThe mother of Mara is ignoranceThe children of Mara are mental fabrications the grandchildren of Mara are the three forms of craving and the greatgrandchildren of Mara are greed aversion and delusionSometimes these members of the Mara family help us develop merit and skillSometimes they get up and sit on our heads lording it over us ordering us aroundSay for instance that greed gets really strongWe grab hold of whatever we can get our hands on with no thought for who it belongs to or whether taking it is right or wrongWhen greed gets really strong it can pressure us into doing evilWhen anger gets really strong it puts pressure on our nerves to the point where we can hand down a death sentence and commit murderThe same is true with delusionEach of these things is an enemy blocking off our goodness but each can also benefit us as wellIf we have any discernment greed can help usAnger can help usDelusion can help usIf we have any discernment craving can help motivate us to develop goodnessDont look down on itWeve come here to listen to a sermonWho talked us into comingCraving thats whoWhen people ordain as monks and novices what forces them to do itCraving thats whatWe shouldnt focus only on its bad sideAs for meritorious fabrications if we didnt have any of them at all we wouldnt be able to develop any goodnessEveryone who develops goodness in any way has to start out with the intention to do itIgnorance is also goodWhen we know that we have ignorance we hurry up and find some way to overcome itIgnorance is what leads us astray but ultimately ignorance is what will have to lead us backKnowledge never led anyone to studyIgnorance is what makes people want to learnWhen people already know why would they want to look furtherDelusion is what makes us look for knowledge  by joining society by associating with peopleOur knowledge grows broader and broader from the first impulse born in ignoranceSo when dealing with the demons of defilement you have to look for both their good and their bad pointsOnly when you see both sides can you be said to be discerning and wiseWhen you can take bad things and make them good thats when youre really outstandingIf you take good things and make them bad thats no good at allEven when you take good things and make other good things out of them thats not really specialThere are three levels of goodness good excellent and outstandingA good person does goodAn excellent person takes something good and makes it betterThats excellent but not outstandingAn outstanding person takes bad things and makes them good takes good things and makes them excellentSo these are the three levels of goodness good excellent and outstandingSo today Ive talked about the demons of defilement after the talk the other day on the demons of the aggregatesWe should all learn to think to consider things to ponder things over so that we can find goodness on every side in every corner we lookThis way if we look beneath us well find treasuresIf we look above us well find treasuresLooking beneath us means looking at the things that are our enemiesWell be able to gain treasures from them goodness on the outstanding levelWhen we look at the things that are our friends we can gain excellence from themWe should try to develop all three levels of goodnessIf we have discernment we can gain all three levels of goodness from the demons of defilement and the demons of the aggregates and well gain all three of the benefits Ive mentionedFor this reason we should develop our mental faculties until theyre strong capable and mature so that they dont fear Maras of any sortA person who has studied snakes can pick them up with no fear of their venomA person who has studied tigers can catch them and they wont biteIn the same way if we have any discernment we can capture and tame the demons of defilement so that they support us in being outstanding all the way to the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaWhoever doesnt have the ability or discernment will get carried off by the demons of defilement to get tortured and killedSo we should use our sharpest discernment to consider these thingsThats what will lead us to the noble paths and their fruitionsSo when weve heard this we should consider what weve heard and take it to heart bringing it inside to see the ways things actually are inside us and then practicing accordingly in line with the way of right practiceThats when we can be at our easeEvil people will help usGood people will help usWell be free of dangerThieves will be our servants helping us in our various tasksWise people will help us in our work  so how can we failIf we look to bad people they come and help usIf we look to good people they come and help usIf we focus on the Maras who are our enemies they turn into our friends and companionsWhen we reach this point we wont know whats a Mara  because nothings a Mara in any way at allEverythings neutral the common property of the worldWhoever can see things in this way has no more suffering no more obstaclesEverything is bright beaming and easyIf you go forward you dont get stuckIf you go back you dont get entangledYou can go as smoothly as a boat over waterThats why this sort of person is said to be sugato someone who goes well whos wellgoneSo all of us who are developing our perfections should practice in this wayAnd now that Ive explained the demons of defilement Ill end right hereId now like to explain the Dhamma as a gift for those of us who have gathered hereAll of us both lay and ordained have come here with skillful intentions from many different provincesOur coming here is of two sortsThe first sort is connected with our having received an invitation or notice of this gathering so that weve come to join in with the meritmaking for the past eleven daysThe second sort didnt receive any notice or invitation but as soon as word of this gathering passed by our ears we gave rise to a good intention  good in one of two waysThe first is that we see that people here are doing something good and so we should join inThats why some of you are hereThis includes many of the monks and novices who came you simply heard the news of this gathering and so you came to join your hearts with oursThis is called a skillful intention that has borne fruit in the hearts of all of usAnd then there are those who considered that this is a gathering of our friends of our teacher even though we havent been called to join we should goSome of you have thought in this way and so have joined in our gathering participating in the various activities up to todayFor all of these things Id like to express my thanks and appreciation to each and every one of you  because this celebration has involved many duties many activities of many sortsIf I were to try to do it all by myself Im sure I wouldnt succeedThe fact that we have managed to succeed so well is due to the goodness of all of you togetherNow the fact that youve succeeded in completing these activities will give you results in two ways the first is through merit  theres no need to doubt thatThe second is through benefactionResults through merit means that weve never been here before were not intimate with the people here but weve learned that what theyre doing here is meritorious and so weve come in hopes of meritThe other way is as Ive said earlier weve come on the basis of being students or friends or of being students of the same teacherWhen we willingly come to help in these activities this too is meritoriousThe results well receive will come in two ways through merit and through benefactionMerit is an individual affair something for which each person has to be responsible in terms of him or her own selfAs for benefaction the person who has benefited from your help and support wont forget your kindnessThe memory will stay buried there in the heart that when we held the celebration in that year or that time our friends came to help usIf they have any need for our help then  to the extent that were able  we should take the opportunity to return their kindness in line with our abilityWhether they call for our help or not and whether or not we can actually go to help we cant escape having the intention to benefit them in one way or anotherEven though my body may not be able to go or my words cant reach you still my mind  when I hear the news one way or another of any meritorious activities and theres some way I can help  will remember your kindness and the merit that Ive accumulated myself and so Ill spread thoughts of good will dedicating the fruits of that merit to pour down on you allIts as if all of you were farming in a certain place planting rice or vegetables or starting an orchard and then ran into difficulties such as a droughtWhen this happens there are things that have to be done finding water for instance or repairing the dikes in the rice fieldWhen a person who has received your help in the past learns of your difficulties but cant carry the water to you or help with the repair work hell spread thoughts of good willSpreading thoughts of good will is something subtle and hard to perceive like the energy that flows out of our eyesThe eyes of every person shoot beams of energy out into the air the same way that the beams of car headlights light up a roadThe energy from our eyes though is refinedNo matter where we look we dont see the energy flowing past because the current is subtleIts because the current is subtle though that it can flow farIf the current were blatant it would go only a short distanceThis is why when people develop solid concentration theyre able to see many subtle worldsIn other words the nature of eyeenergy has no limit but we simply get no use out of itWhyBecause our minds arent stillIf our minds arent still were like a person preoccupied all wrapped up in his workWhen the mind is wrapped up in confusion this way then even though the eyes have potential energy we cant get any use out of it because its very subtleThe energy can go very far but the problem is that the mind isnt quietIf the mind were really quiet we could immediately see very farThats clairvoyanceThis is something ordinary and natural that exists in every human beingIf the mind is weak then outside currents cut off the energy coming from our eyesIf the mind is strong and resilient the currents of the world cant cut that energy offSuch people can see far regardless of whether their eyes are open or closedThis is a quality that exists in the human body  something of very high quality by its nature but we cant get any use out of it because our minds are distracted and restlessWhen our minds are distracted and restless were like people who are dead drunk even though drunk people may have tools in their possession they cant put them to any use other than as weapons to kill one anotherOnly if theyre good and sober will they be able to use those tools to amass wealth and provide for their physical wellbeingBut if theyre mentally unbalanced you give them a knife and theyll use it to slice somebodys head openAs a result they end up in prisonEven if they dont end up in prison theyll have to get caged or locked up at homeThe same is true with the human beings born in this world even though theyre endowed with good things by nature their minds arent at normalcyAnd so the good things within them end up causing various kinds of harmHere weve been talking about physical natureWhen we talk about subtle matters like merit or the mind theyre much more refined than the bodyFor this reason helping people by way of the mind is something much more profoundWhen a person trains his own mind and trains it well to the point where he experiences happiness and peace and then hears that other people are suffering and that theres a way he can be of help he uses the strength of the mindHe cultivates the mind until its firmly established and then can send that clean current to be of immediate helpThe hearts of ordinary people though are like salt water in the oceanIf you use it to bathe youre not really comfortable  although it can help you get by in a pinchIf you try to drink it it doesnt nourish the bodyYou use it only if you really dont have anything else at allIn the same way the hearts of human beings in this world are adrift in the ocean the flood of sensuality the flood of becoming the flood of views the flood of ignoranceThese four oceans are deep deeper than the water in the seaWe depend on our minds that are swimming in these oceans sinking in salt waterThats why when some people are in really salty water the waves are strongIf they lie down to sleep they toss and turn just like waves in the seaThey lie down on their left side and cant sleepThey turn over and lie on their right side and still cant sleepIt comes from the wavesAnd where do these waves come fromThe oceanIn other words they come from the flood of sensuality sensual desires attachment to sensual objects the flood of becoming wanting to be this wanting to be that struggling to escape from the state were in the flood of views holding fast to our own views to the point of getting into arguments  a sign that were adrift in salt water and the flood of ignorance darkness behind us  not knowing the past darkness in front of us  not knowing the future darkness in the present  not knowing whats good and evil within ourselves letting the mind fall for the ways of the world of rebirthThats whats meant by ignoranceThe normal nature of the human mind is to be floating adrift in this way which is why the Buddha had the great kindness to want us to develop our merit and skillfulnessThats why he advised us to build a boat for ourselves the boat here is the activity of our physical bodyAs for the provisions that well need for crossing the ocean those are the requisites that we as Buddhists sacrifice in order to benefit monastics in our development of generosityIf you can give a lot it means that youll have enough to help you cross over the ocean for youll have enough to eatIf you give only a little you might run out of provisions and start drifting aimlessly with the currents and waves in the middle of the oceanIf youre lucky the waves may wash you ashore so that you manage to surviveBut if the waves are large and your boat small you wont be able to reach landYoull end up sinking in the middle of the seaThe Buddha contemplated this fact which is why he advised us to develop our goodnessOn one level developing goodness is involved with the way we use our material possessionsOn another its involved with the way we look after our actions improving the way we use our physical body so that it becomes fully trainedThe results well receive are of two sortsThe first is that our boat wont sinkThe second is that well have plenty of provisions for crossing over the vast expanse of the seaBut even when people have a seaworthy boat and plenty of provisions they can still run out of water to drinkWhen that happens then although they have plenty of provisions theyre put to difficultiesTo prevent this the Buddha taught us another skill how to distill salt water so that we can drink itIf were intelligent we can distill salt water so that we can drink itWell be able to reach America without having to stop off anywhere along the wayIf we have discernment well be able to drink salt waterIn what waySalt water comes from fresh water so wherever theres salt water there has to be fresh waterThey cant escape from each otherOnce you realize this you can travel around the worldIf youre skilled at distilling your salt water can turn into fresh waterOnce we can turn salt water into fresh water in this way we can be at our easeEven though were in the middle of the ocean well have fresh water to drink and to bathe our bodiesThat way well be at our easeIn the same way those of us who are adrift in the ocean of life have toThe boat here stands for our bodyIts not a big boat  if it were larger than this we human beings would have lots of hardshipsThe body is a fathom long a cubit wide and a span thickThis is a boat that we have to caulk so that its nice and tightCaulking the boat here stands for restraint of the senses restraining the eye  being careful not to give rise to bad kamma because of the eye not letting barnacles build up on it restraining the ear  dont let anything evil come in by way of the ear for anything thats evil is like a barnacleThe same holds true with our nose tongue body and mind we shouldnt take an interest in anything evil or bad for things of that sort are like barnacles or insects that will bore into the wood of our boat and destroy itThis is why were taught to practice restraint over our eyes ears nose tongue body and mindWe abstain from doing whatever shouldnt be doneWe have to protect ourselves and practice restraint considering things thoroughly before we actIf we let barnacles develop all over our body this boat of ours  this Body Ship  will wear out and sink into the oceanAs for the mind we have to be careful that defilements dont arise in the heartWe have to exercise restraint like this at all times continually caulking our six sense media caulking our eyes with the right sights our ears with the right sounds our nose with the right smells our tongue with the right flavors our body with the right tactile sensations and our mind with the DhammaCaulking the eye means that if we see a lack anywhere that will give us a chance to develop merit and skillfulness  whether its inside the monastery or out  we shouldnt be indifferent to itWe should fill up the lack as we can step by stepThis is called caulking the eyeCaulking the ear means that when we hear people say anything  regardless of whether they have the intention of telling or teaching us  when their voices come scraping into our ears we should tell ourselves that the sound is a chance for us to develop our goodnessIn that way the sound will be useful to usNo matter what kind of person is speaking  child or adult monk novice or nun tall short black white whatever we should choose to pay attention only to the things that will be of use to usThis is called using sounds as pitch for caulking for the earsWhen we encounter smells passing by our nose we should search only for smells that will make us cheerful that will give rise to skillful mental states as a way of caulking our noseThis is what will bring happiness and peace to the mindCaulking the body stands for the way we sit here quietly listening to the Dhamma without moving around or making any disturbanceIt also stands for sitting in meditation sitting and chanting performing a candle circumambulation ceremony using the body to bow down to the BuddhaAll of these things count as caulking for the bodyAs for caulking the mind that stands for dhammaosatha the medicine of the DhammaWe caulk the mind by the way we thinkIf when we think of something the mind sours we shouldnt think about that thingWhether its a matter of the world or of the Dhamma if thinking about it gives rise to anger or delusion in the mind we shouldnt pay it any attentionWe should think instead of the good weve done in the pastFor example we can think of the good things we did together in the celebration of the year BEEven though weve parted ways since then weve come back together to do skillful and meritorious things once moreThis is a caulking for the mindIn addition to that we foster another form of goodness called developing concentrationDeveloping concentration is a way of caulking the mind so that it doesnt develop any gaps leaks or holesAll of this is called caulking our boat  the boat of the bodyIn Pali this is called indriyasamvarasila the principles of restraint over the sense facultiesWe exercise restraint over our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind so that our boat will float on the ocean without sinkingThis is called caulking our boatWhat do we do nextWe have to stock our boat with provisionsOnce were born in the world our wellbeing depends on the requisites of lifeWeve eaten food worn clothing lived in shelter and used medicine to treat the bodyThats why weve been able to find as much comfort as we haveWhen we consider this fact we have to turn and consider how others are getting alongWhen we see that we need these things to get along we start stocking our boat by giving gifts of almsfood and making other donations to provide all four requisitesThats called stocking our boat with provisionsThen we put up a mast and unfurl a sailIn other words we invite a monk to get up on the sermon seat and teach the Dhamma as a way of inclining the mind in the right directionThe mind will then zip right along in line with the breeze of the DhammaAnd the body will go right along with itFor example once weve heard the Dhamma we gain a feeling of contentment so that we want to hear it againThis is a sign that our boat has caught wind and the wind is strong so we sail right alongThis will help our boat reach the other shore easilyIf theres no sail to help it along and we stock the boat with too many things it may sinkThis is why theres the custom when anyone makes a donation to have a sermon at the same time as a way of inclining the mind in the direction of the DhammaFor our boat to get anywhere it needs a sailThen no matter how many or how few provisions we haul on board the boat will head in the direction we want it toThis is the second thing we need to knowThe third thing is the method for distilling salt water so that it can become freshThis stands for practicing tranquillity meditation and insight meditationWe give rise to directed thought and evaluation within the mindAnd what is salt waterSalt water stands for defilementThe defilements of the mind are saltier than saltWhen we try to eat salt  even just a little  we cant swallow it because we find it so salty but the defilements are even saltier than thatThey can crust us over so that we spoil and rot in all sorts of waysWhen this is the case what can we doWe have to filter or distill themFiltering refers to yoniso manasikara appropriate attentionWhatever we do we have to reflect to be observant to consider things carefully before we actThis is the first vat in our distilleryOur second vat is meditation contemplating our fabrications by using skillful strategies giving rise to the factors of jhanaThe first factor is directed thought keeping in mind the preoccupation that can act as a foundation for the mind  its gocaradhamma or proper range  as a way of aiming it in the right direction by developing the four frames of referenceThis is how we distill salt waterThe four frames of reference areAll four of these are gathered in the body and mindThis is one way of looking at them called anuloma or in line with the standard wayThe other way is called patiloma in reverse of the standard way in which we take all four and turn them into oneThe standard way is when we practice directed thought and evaluationBut when we take all four and turn them into one we take only one part of the body as they say in the Great Frames of Reference Discourse we focus on the body in and of itself as an object of tranquillity meditationIn other words we take all four parts and gather them into the body the properties of earth water fire and windThats the bodyWhen we see that it has many parts and many aspects preventing the mind from growing still making it distracted we choose only one of the partsFor example we put aside the properties of earth water and fire and stay still only with the property of windWe focus down on the wind property as the object we keep in mind this is called the body in and of itselfThe wind property here means the inandout breathWhen we keep the breath in mind and watch constantly over it thats called developing the body in and of itselfWhen the breath comes in we watch itWhen it goes out we watch itWe keep surveying it constantlySometimes its coarse sometimes its refined sometimes its cool sometimes its warmNo matter what its like we keep watching itSometimes just as were about to reach something good in the meditation we get discouragedIts like boiling water in our distilleryNormally two sorts of things can happenIf the fire is too strong the water starts boiling so fast that it all turns into steam overflows the vat and puts out the fireIf the fire is too weak the water doesnt boil and so it produces no steam at allSometimes the fire is just right  not too strong not too weak  just right in betweenThe middle wayThe fire is just enough to give rise to steam  not so much that it overflows the vat but enough for steam to come out of the vat enough for the steam to become drops of fresh waterThis is why were taught to be observantWhen the desire to succeed in the meditation is really strong it can prevent the mind from growing stillThe breath gets stirred up and cant grow subtleThis is called desire getting in the waySometimes the desire is too weakYou sit there the mind still the breath refined light  and you drift right to sleepThe water never comes to a boilYou have to put things together in the right proportions just right with mindfulness and alertness monitoring things at all timesWhen the mind is staying with coarse breathing you knowWhen its staying with refined breathing you knowWhen your mindfulness and alertness are constant in this way the result is rapture the body is light cool comfortable and at easeThe mind has a sense of fullness blooming and bright in its concentrationThis is where fresh water is beginning to gather in your distilleryThe salt water begins to disappearIn other words the salt water of sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty  letting the mind run to the past run to the future not clearly seeing the present  begins to disappearWhen the mind is really still and refined it gives rise to concentration with a sense of ease and fullness so that you can sit for many hoursThis is the same as taking a single jar of fresh water with us in our boatIf we have the intelligence to distill fresh water out of salt water our one jar of water will become a magic jar providing us with enough water to drink all the way around the worldIn the same way when we develop concentration by using directed thought to lift the mind to its object as the first step in the first jhana and evaluation to keep contemplating the object of our meditation to make it subtle and refined  when the properties of the body have been thoroughly evaluated the mind will be able to contemplate the drawbacks of the five hindrancesThe body will grow quiet  this is called kayapassaddhi physical serenity and the mind will grow still  cittapassaddhi mental serenityThe body will be at ease with no pains or heaviness this is kayalahuta physical lightnessThis is where rapture arisesThe mind will feel full and satisfied with no restlessness or distraction like a person who has eaten his fill or a child who has eaten its fill so that it no longer disturbs its mother or fatherWhen the heart has rapture as its companion it will be free from unrestIt will be coolIt will be able to use the fresh water it has distilled from salt water as a means of washing its clothing as a means of bathing its bodyThen it will be able to wash the earth property  which is like a rag  the water property the wind property and the fire property all of which are like rags theyre always ripping and tearing always getting dirtyThis is why we have to care for them at all timesWhen the mind has given rise to the factors of concentration the power of rapture will come to wash our properties of earth water wind and fireThen if we want to be warm we wont have to sit in the sunlight if we want to be cool we wont have to sit in the breezeIf when were stuck in the sunlight we want to be cool well be coolIf when were stuck in water we want to be warm well be warmThat way we can be at our ease like a person who has clothing to cover his body and so has no need to feel bashful when he enters human societyThis is why meditators have no fear of difficult conditionsWhy is thatBecause they have their own source of fresh water water to bathe in water to drinkTheyve got all the water they need to use for bathing their body for bathing their eyes ears nose tongue body and mind for bathing the properties of earth water wind and fireThats water for usingAs for water for drinking they can develop concentration to an even higher level to give rise to a sense of inner pleasure pleasure that arises from within the mind itselfWhen the mind feels pleasure both the body and mind will be at their easeThe mind will imbibe nothing but pleasure  and theres no pleasure higher than that of the mind at peaceThus rapture is water for using for bathing the body and mind whereas pleasure is drinking water specifically for the mindSo whoever has the discernment to distill fresh water from salt water will experience ease and wellbeingThis is our first distilleryThe second distillery is where we take the water from the first and distill it to even greater purityThis is the same as when they refine sugar after the first stage it still contains some alcohol so they have to refine it a second timeThis stands for developing insight meditation something very refined  so refined that nobody else can see itYou can stand and practice insight meditation sit and practice insight meditation you can lie down you can even be giving a Dhamma talk and practice insight meditation the mouth speaks the mind thinks of its topic  when you think of something to say or thoughts simply arise within the mind theres no attachment to bodily fabrication ie the processes of the body no attachment to verbal fabrication ie the thoughts that fabricate words for other people to hearTheres no attachment to your words and your mind doesnt run out after themAs for thoughts that arise from ignorance and craving you know them immediately for what they areThe mind in that state isnt involved in bodily fabrication verbal fabrication or mental fabricationThe mind is then released from all fabricationsAll fabrications that arise simply change and then disbandThis is true of bodily fabrications verbal fabrications and mental fabricationsWhen you see these things in terms of their common characteristics when you see them asthen whether youre standing sitting lying down performing physical work or speaking  even when youre just sitting and thinking alone by yourself  youll find all things good and noble flowing to you at all timesThis is called practicing insight meditationA person like this can then set up an enormous distillery turning the water of the sea into cloudsWhen the water of the sea has been turned into clouds theyll float through the skyWherever people are suffering from hardships the water in the clouds will come raining down watering the land where people live so that they can grow food convenientlyIn the same way when people have released their hearts from the power of worldliness their goodness is like cloudsWhen the clouds turn into rain the rain water will help good people live in happiness and wellbeingThis is one of the benefits that comes from those who have developed discernmentSo I ask that all of you make a mental note of these three maximsWhoever can give rise to these skills within themselves will at the very least become good peopleIf theyre not heedless and make a continual effort they will be able to take the mind beyond all becomingSo all of you who have gathered together to make merit on this occasion I ask that you accept as a gift the Dhamma described here take it with you and put it into practiceYou will experience pleasure flourish and thrive in the Buddhas teachingsLess than a year before Ajaan Lees death some of his students began taperecording his Dhamma talksThe following talk is one of the nine for which we have transcripts from the tapes  and one of the four for which the tapes are still extantIts a very unusual talk showing his distinctive humor and style and providing a lively discussion of the ways in which the concepts of self and notself actually function in practice the translatorIn all our activities persistence and endurance are things we have to foster within ourselves at all timesThere have been cases both in the past and in the present where people with little education  who couldnt even read or write  have thrown themselves into the effort of the practice and discover that they can read and even memorize whole passagesSome of them have even earned the right to sit for the government exams  this sort of thing has happenedSo we should keep reminding ourselves that everything in the world comes from effort and persistenceNo matter what kind of person you are  very smart or very stupid with a poor education and poor social skills  as long as you have these qualities of persistence and endurance in your heart theres hope for youAs for people who are very smart sophisticated and welleducated if they lack effort and persistence they wont be able to succeed in their aims in terms either of the world or of the DhammaEspecially for those of us who aim at the highest happiness or nibbana effort and persistence are the magnets that will pull us toward our goalNow when effort and persistence are present within us then endurance will have to be present as wellWhyWhen you put effort and persistence into something there are bound to be obstacles that get in your wayIf youre really persistent those obstacles will have to disappear which means that youve been using endurance as wellIf you have effort but no endurance you wont get anywhereIf you have persistence that means that your effort has endurance tooSo we should regard effort as coming first and endurance secondOnce these qualities are constantly working together within you then no matter how deep or faraway your aims may be the Buddha has forecast that youll attain them in line with your hopesThis is why he said as a way of ensuring that well make the proper effort that Viriyena dukkhamacceti Its through effort and persistence that people gain release from the world and reach nibbanaEffort and persistence are our roots or the magnets that will pull us to nibbanaThats what the Buddha saidBut our own wrong views which come from the power of defilement take issue with his teachingIn other words they dont believe itThey believe themselves by and large and arent willing to believe the teachings of the wiseThis is why we have to keep stumbling and crawling along in this worldWe simply believe in ourselves in our own views but ourself is made up of defilementThis defilement is the obstacle that keeps us from believing the Buddha when he tells us that its through effort and persistence that people will gain release from suffering and stressWe simply hear the words but dont understand themWhat we hear goes only as far as our ears and doesnt enter into our heartsAnd this means that were working at cross purposesEven within a single you youre working at cross purposesWhat you hear is one thing what you think is something else and they dont go togetherWhen this happens you start having doubtsUncertaintyThings arent clear to the heartYour practice turns into nothing but ups and downs right things and wrongThis is because the heart of every person Of course theres only one heart in every person but how is it that the heart has so many issuesThis is a really complicated questionWhyBecause if we look only on the surface well say that each person has only one mindThats all we knowBut if we look in another way the texts tell us that there are so many mental consciousnesses that they cant be countedThis makes us wonder How can that beAnd when we turn from the texts and really look at ourselves well see that the body of a human being doesnt have only one consciousnessThere are lots of consciousnesses in thereYour own real consciousness you can hardly find at allYou may have up to three kinds of consciousness inside your bodyThe first is your own consciousness which entered your mothers womb at the time of your conception without any other consciousnesses mixing in with itThere were lots of other consciousnesses around it at the time but they all died out before they could take birthYou cant count how many there are at a time like that but in the fight to take birth only one of them has the merit to make it and the rest all fall away in huge numbers by the waysideSo when we make it into a human womb at the time of conception we can chalk it up to our merit that weve been able to establish a foothold for ourselves in the human worldOnce our consciousness gets established like this it begins to developThe body developsAs it develops other consciousnesses start infiltrating without our realizing itIf you want to see a really clear example look at the human body after it takes birthSometimes a worm two feet long can come out of your intestinesWhat does that come from if not from a consciousnessOr how about germsSome diseases are actually caused by little animals in your body that cause swellings and tumorsAs the traditional doctors used to say there are eight families and twelve clans of diseasecausing animals in our bodyWhat do they come fromFrom consciousness thats whatIf there were no consciousness how could there be animalsAnimals arise from consciousnessAnd some of them you can clearly see as they come crawling in huge numbers out of wounds out your ears and eyes nose teeth anus whole swarms of themSo what are theyTheyre a form of consciousnessThis kind of consciousness you can see clearly but theres another group of consciousnesses that are more insidious that dont have a body you can seeOnly if you meditate and gain psychic powers can you see themThats the third kind of consciousness inhabiting your bodySo altogether there are three Your own consciousness and theres only one of thatAnd then all the many consciousnesses lurking in your body so many that you cant say exactly how many there areThe ones with bodies you can see are more than manyAnd as for the ones with no bodies but are living in your body theres no telling how many there areNow its because there are so many of them with so many agendas that the Buddha tells us not to go joining in with themTheyre not us not ours none of our businessSometimes we sit around with absolutely nothing wrong and all of a sudden one thing starts leading to another inside the mindWe dont want it to happen but the mind seems to take on a mind of its ownThats a clear case of these consciousnesses these crazy consciousnesses getting into the act seeping into our own consciousness and making us fall in line with themThese consciousnesses that lurk in our bodies without any bodies of their own They can get angry too you knowThey can get greedy and deluded they can feel love and hate just like usOnce they start feeling things like this and theyre right next to us our own consciousness follows along with them without our even realizing itThis is why there are so many issues in the heartIts entirely possible you knowSuppose for instance that two of your children are quarreling right in front of youThats enough to put you in a bad mood yourselfEven though you didnt get involved in the quarrel along with them theres a connection and so you end up with a lot of hurt feelings tooThis is why were taught Yam ve sevati tadiso You end up being like the people you hang around withSo were taught to analyze thingsThere are lots of minds in your mindSome of them are animal mindsIts not your mind that gets worked up their minds are the ones getting worked up but theyre right next to yours and as a result you start tilting in their directionThis is why were taught that theyre anatta notselfConsciousness is notselfSo dont get involved with itWe have to use effort persistence endurance to keep things under our thumbAs soon as these things disappear thats when the heart can be bright and at easeBecause actually when things like this arise in the heart its not our doingIts their doingIf it were really our own doing then when things like this appear in the heart we should feel happy and contentWhen they disappear we should feel happy and contentBut actually when things arise in the heart there are only some cases where were delighted about whats happeningThere are other cases where no were not happy at allTheres a conflict in the mindSometimes there are huge numbers of these other consciousnesses and they have lots of agendas of their ownWe get outnumbered and start falling in line with themWhen this happens we do things wrong and say things wrong and end up sorry afterwardsThis is because we act in line with them and not in line with our own true heartSo you have to keep this point in mind if you want to understand consciousnessThe Buddha tells us in really simple terms but we dont understand himHe says Consciousness isnt our self Only four words and yet we cant understand themAnd how can we expect to understand themOur hearts arent established in concentration so everything we hear gets all confusedAll we can think is that consciousness is our mindThats all we can think so we start aligning ourselves with everything taking sidesThis is usThats usWe start siding with everything which is why we dont understand consciousnessNow when we start considering things carefully to see what our own real consciousness is like well check to see if theres anything in there thats honest and loyal and true to usIf theres something that you like to do  you realize its proper you know its right  and you go ahead and do it to completion then thats something you can trustBut there are other things that you dont really like  part of you wants to do them another part doesnt  so when theres a split like this you should realize that youve been associating with fools with certain kinds of consciousnesses that have come to deceive youThats when you have to resist to persist to pen that thinking inIn other words you have to focus on contemplating that particular consciousness to see what kind of consciousness it isIs it your own consciousnessOr is it another consciousness that has snuck in to trip up your consciousness so that you fall in line with itIf you fall in line with it and end up doing things that you later regret thats called getting taken in by consciousnessWhen the Buddha tells us that consciousness isnt our self that its anatta we dont understand what he saysTheres one sort of consciousness thats really oursThe consciousness thats really ours is loyal honest and true to usSuppose that you make up your mind that tomorrow you want to go to the monastery to hear a sermonNow going to the monastery to hear a sermon is something good that you like to doYou really benefit from itYoure really clear on this pointBut by the time tomorrow comes your mind has changed because  its simply changedWhen this happens you should realize that your consciousness has gotten mixed up with some other kind of consciousnessThats how you have to look at thingsDont think that its really your consciousnessThe new thought that repeals your old thought isnt really youIts cheating youIts not really youNormally if something is really you its not going to cheat youIt has to be honest and loyal and devoted to youOnce you make up your mind to do something good you have to stick with it until you succeed and feel happy afterwardsThat sort of thinking is your own real consciousnessIts honestIt doesnt deceive youMost people though deceive themselvesActually they dont deceive themselvesTheyre perfectly all right but these other consciousnesses seep into them so that they end up getting deceivedThis is why the Buddha teaches us asevana ca balanam dont go associating with foolsIf you hang around with that kind of consciousness often youll end up sufferingSo  panditanañca  associate with wise peopleMake your mind firmly settled and establishedIf you think of doing something good make it good all the way until you succeed in line with your aimsThats youDont let any other consciousnesses in to meddle with your affairsIf you run across any thoughts that would make you abandon your efforts realize that youve been associating with fools associating with consciousnesses aside from yourselfThats how you should look at thingsNow if we were to go into detail on all the consciousnesses living in our bodies there would be lots to sayBasically there are two kinds those whose thoughts are in line with ours and those whose thoughts are notFor example when we want to do good there are hungry ghosts and spirits that would like to do good too but they cant because they dont have a bodySo they take up residence in our body in order to do good along with usBut there are other spirits who want to destroy whatever good were trying to doThey were probably our enemies in past lives We probably oppressed them imprisoned them or had them put to deathWe got in the way of the good they were trying to do so theyve got some old scores to settleThey want to block the path were trying to practice so that we dont make any progressThey come whispering into our ears StopStopYoure going to dieYoure going to starveIts going to rain too hard the suns too hot its too early too late they go on and onThese are the consciousnesses that come as our enemiesThere are others that used to be our relatives and friendsThey want to do good but they cant so they take up residence in our body so that they can bow down to the Buddha and chant along with usBecause of all this there are times when our hearts are like monsters and ogresWe cant imagine why its happening and yet its happening even though we dont want it toThen there are other times when our hearts are like devas  so sweet and goodtempered that other people can curse our mother and grandmother and we wont get madThen there are other times when theres no call for anger and yet we manage to get angry in really ugly nasty waysThats the way it is with these consciousnesses all very confused and confusing and they come seeping into our bodiesThats how you should look at thingsTheres yet another group of consciousnesses the ones who have come to collect old kamma debtsTheyre the germs that eat away at our flesh  at our nose our ears  to ruin our looksThey eat away at our lower lip exposing our teeth making us embarrassed and ashamedSometimes they eat away at one of our ears or eat away at our nose all the way up to the foreheadSometimes they eat at our eyes our hands our feetSometimes they eat away at our whole body making our skin diseasedThese are kamma debt collectorsIn the past we made life miserable for them so this time around theyre ganging up to make us squirmThe ones that are really easy to see are the worms that help eat the food in our intestinesIn the past we probably ate their flesh and skin so this time around theyre going to eat oursThey eat eat eat  eat everythingWhatever youve got you bastard Im going to eat it all Thats what they sayHow are we ever going to get rid of themThey eat our outsides where we can see them so we chase them away and they go running inside to eat in our stomach and intestinesThats when it really gets bad we cant even see them and theyre even harder to get rid ofSo they keep making us squirm as they keep eating eating away eating in our intestines eating in our stomach eating our kidneys our liver our lungs eating in our blood vessels eating our body hairs eating everything all over the placeThey eat outside and turn into skin diseasesThey eat inside as worms and germsAnd they themselves get into fights  after all there are lots of different gangs in thereEven just the worms have clansSo when there are so many of them theyre bound to quarrel creating a ruckus in our homeHow can we ever hope to withstand themSometimes we fall in with them without realizing itHow can that happenBecause there are so many of them that we cant resistThese living beings in our body Sometimes they get angry and get into fightsSometimes they run into one another on the street and start biting and hitting each other so that we itch in front and itch in back  scritch scritch scratch scratch The worms have gotten into a gang warThey cruise around in our body the way we do outsideThe blood vessels are like roads so there are little animals cruising down the blood vesselsThis one comes this way that one comes that they meet each other and start talkingSometimes they have real conversations that know no end so they spend the night there eating right there and excreting right there until a swelling starts Thats a little shack for the beings the consciousnesses in our bodyThis is how things keep happeningOur body is like a worldJust as the world has oceans mountains trees vines land so it is with the bodyEach blood vessel is a road for living beingsThey travel down our blood vessels down our breath channelsSome vessels get closed off like a dead end roadOthers stay openWhen theyre open the blood flows the breath flows like the water in rivers and streamsWhen they flow boats can travel along themWhen there are boats there are beings in the boatsSometimes the boats crash into each otherThats why we have aches and pains in our legs and arms and along our breath channelsSo go ahead keep rubbing them and massaging them  its all an affair of the consciousnesses inhabiting our bodiesSome of them live in our eye sockets some live in our earholes some in our nostrils some in our mouth our throat our gumsTheyre just like people only we cant understand their languageThey have jobs and careers families and homes and places to vacation all over our bodyThese consciousnesses in our bodies sometimes get into battles and wars just like red ants and black antsSometimes lizards and toads get into battles  Ive seen it happenIts the same in our body so where are we going to go to escape from it allThe beings in our eyes lay claim to our eyes as their homeThe ones in our ears claim our ears as their homeThe ones in our blood vessels claim those as their homeSometimes their claims overlap so they get into feudsAs the texts say there are feelings that arise from consciousnessThis is why there are so many things that can happen to the bodySome kinds of consciousness give rise to disease some are just waiting their chanceFor instance some kinds of consciousness without bodies hang around our blood vessels waiting for wounds and boils to developThats their chance to take on bodies as worms and germsAs for the ones who dont yet have bodies they travel around as chills and thrills and itches and aches all over our bodyIts all an affair of consciousnessesIn short there are three classes in all  three clans and all of them great big onesThe first are the living beings with bodies that live in our bodyThen there are the consciousnesses that dont have bodies of their own but inhabit our bodyThen theres our own consciousnessSo all in all there are threeThese three types of consciousness get all mixed up together so we dont know which kinds of consciousness belong to animals with bodies which kinds belong to beings that dont yet have bodies and which kind of consciousness is our ownWe dont knowWhen we dont know this how can we know the five aggregatesViññanakkhandho that we chant every morning  how can we know itAll we know is consciousness consciousness but our own consciousness is so slack and limp that its like a rope dragging on the groundIts the same with the phrase Consciousness is notself All we know is the words they sayOnly when we develop discernment from concentrating the mind will we be able to understand consciousnessThats when well be able to understand the properties starting with Cakkhudhatu rupadhatu cakkhuviññanadhatu  eye property form property eyeconsciousness propertyTo understand these three things you need the kind of knowledge that comes from concentrationFor example how many kinds of consciousness are there in our eyeWhen a form appears to the eye and theres consciousness of the form  is it really our consciousness or is it the consciousness of some other being without a body thats getting into the actOr is it the consciousness of a being with a body getting in our way making us doubtful and unsureThe three kinds of consciousness that arise at the eye that see forms how many different ways do they reactAnd are those reactions really a result of our own consciousness or of the consciousness of beings with bodies inhabiting our bodyOr are they the result of consciousnesses without bodiesWe dont knowWe havent the slightest ideaWhen we dont know even this much how are we going to know Cakkhudhatu rupadhatu cakkhuviññanadhatuTheres no wayWe have no insight no knowledge no discernment at allSotadhatu our ear which is the basis for earconsciousness to ariseWhich kind of earconsciousness arises firstDo we knowNo not at allIs it our own consciousness that goes out to listen to soundsIs it the consciousness of some little animal lurking in our earsOr is it the consciousness of some being that doesnt even have a bodyOr is it really our own consciousnessExamine things carefully so that you know this before anything elseYou can tell from the results There are some kinds of sounds that you like to hear but you know that theyre not right and yet you still like to listen to themYou should realize when this happens that its not your consciousness thats listening because its not loyal to youThere are other kinds of sounds that are good and right but you dont like themThats another case when its not your consciousnessSomething else has probably infiltrated and gotten in the wayYou have to watch out for this carefully because there are a lot of different groups of consciousness with their own agendasSometimes you listen to other people speaking What they say is true and right but you dont like itSo you go assuming that this business of liking and disliking is yoursYou never stop to think that consciousness is notselfThe fact that you dont stop to think is why your ears are so deafYoure not listeningSome hungry ghost is listening in your stead without your even realizing itSo how are you going to remember anythingYour mind isnt here with the body in the present so its not listeningHungry ghosts are listening dead spirits are listening angry demons are in the way so as a result you yourself dont know dont understand whats being saidGhosts and demons are doing all the listening and thinking but you assume its all youThis is why the Buddha said that ignorance blinds our eyes and deafens our earsIts all an affair of consciousnessesCakkhudhatu rupadhatu cakkhuviññanadhatu There are these three thingsThe instant the eye sees a form what consciousness goes out to lookHave you ever stopped to take noticeNoNeverSo you dont know whether its really your own consciousness or the consciousness of an animal lurking in your eye whether its an animal with a body or one without a bodyYou dont even know whether these things really existWhen you dont know this what can you hope to knowSotadhatu saddadhatu sotaviññanadhatu You dont know this one eitherAnd so on down the list Ghanadhatu The nose is where smells are known and noseconsciousness arisesSometimes our consciousness likes certain kinds of smells smells that are proper in line with the DhammaSo we search out and find those smells to make meritOther times we give upWe like the smells but we dont follow throughWe dont carry through with our own thoughtsThen there are certain kinds of smells that we dont like but we still go after themSome kinds we like but we dont follow throughThere are all kinds of issues surrounding smellsSmells appear in our nose and consciousness appears in our nose as wellWho knows how many hundreds of kinds of consciousness are living in thereSometimes they know things before we doThey send us all kinds of false reports to deceive usThey whisper to us keeping us misinformed so that we believe themAs a result we close our eyes and follow along with them like a bear getting honey from a bees nestIt just closes its eyes and keeps slurping away slurping away at the honeyIt cant open its eyes because the bees are going to sting out its eye socketsThe same with us when consciousness comes whispering GoGo we go along with it thinking that were the ones who feel the need to goActually we dont know what it is that comes slipping in to pull us around like a medium possessed by a spiritJivhadhatu The tongueThe tongue is where tastes ariseTastes come and make contact at the tongue and an awareness arises called consciousnessBut the consciousness that arises exactly which consciousness arises firstThere are living beings that reside in our taste buds and they have consciousness too you knowThey may know even more than we doFor example say that theres food we know is bad for us to eat but theres the desire to eat itWhy is there the desireSometimes we dont want to eat it but the consciousness of some living being wants to eat itIf we eat it we know it will make us sick but theres still the desire to eat itThis is called getting fooled by flavorsGetting fooled by consciousnessThere are three sorts of consciousness as weve already mentioned so which consciousness is getting in the actIs it our consciousness or notWeve never stopped to checkIs it the kind of consciousness that doesnt yet have a bodyOr is it the kind that already has a body appearing in our mouthWe dont knowWhen we dont know thats why everything we say comes out all screwy and wrongThese spirits are the ones that make us speak speaking in all kinds of ways that get us in troubleActually we dont want to say those things but we go ahead and say themThats a sign that weve been associating with fools with the consciousness of angry demons without our even realizing itIts only afterwards when we end up suffering that we realize whats happenedThis is why we keep losing out to themWe dont know consciousness in the five aggregatesWe keep chanting Viññanam anatta anatta ta ta every day but dont know a thingThis is what the Buddha called avijja or unawarenessKayadhatu The same holds true with the bodyThe body is where tactile sensations are feltTactile sensations make contact and we can know them all cold hot soft hardWe knowThis knowledge of tactile sensations is called consciousnessBut whose consciousness it is weve never made a surveySo we think that were the ones who are cold were the ones who are hot and yet its not us at allLike a person possessed by a spiritWhat happens when a person is possessed by a spiritSuppose theres someone who has never drunk liquorWhen a spirit possesses him he drinks two or three glasses  really enjoying it  but when the spirit leaves the person who has never drunk liquor is dead drunkWhyBecause there was a consciousness from outside possessing himHe  the real him  never drank liquor but he drank when an outside spirit possessed himThe same holds true with our mindWhen these consciousnesses start getting obstreperous we start doing things even though we dont want to do themSome forms of consciousness like the cold some like heatJust like the animals in the world Some like hot weather some like cold weather some like to eat hard things some like to eat soft thingsWorms and caterpillars for instance They like to eat hard thingsIts the same with the living beings in our bodies Some like to eat hard things so they nibble at our bones  or at our flesh until it sloughs off in piecesSome drink the liquid partsSome like hot things some like cold thingsSo when it gets cold we feel that were really cold but weve never stopped to think about whats made us coldWhen it gets hot we dont know whats made us hotWe just think that its us this is us thats usWhen it was that we became a spiritconsciousness along with them we never noticedThis is why the Buddha said that we have no discernmentWe fall for these forms of consciousness forgetting his teaching that consciousness is notselfActually theres only one of us and its not all complicated like thisAs for our mind  manodhatu  the same holds trueIts been possessed by spirits so that it suffers from all sorts of symptomsThe ideas that get thought up in the mind the ideas that cause thoughts in the mind they come from a causeSometimes the cause may be the shock waves from other consciousnesses bumping into usThe thoughts of living beings with bodies may be directed at usThe consciousness of beings without bodies may have some unfinished business involving us and they may cause our own minds to fall in with themWhen this happens you should know OhTheres been an infiltration The thing that has infiltrated is the mood of another living beingIt may be the mood of an animalThe mood of a devaThe mood of an angry demonWe have to decode them so that well knowWhen we can know in this way then there arent all that many issues in our mindTheres only one mindTheres only one consciousness not a whole lot of themWhen one is one it should stay as oneThe problem is that one turns into two and then three and then so on without endThis is what blocks our sensesUnawareness blocks our eyes so that we dont know the consciousnesses that have built their homes in our eyeballsUnawareness blocks our ears the consciousnesses of all the animals that have come and built their homes filling up our earholesUnawareness blocks our nose the consciousnesses of all the animals that have come and built their homes in our nostrilsIt blocks our tongue the consciousnesses of all the animals that have come and built their homes and cities in our tongueIt blocks our body the consciousnesses of all the animals that have come and built their homes in every poreAs for our own single consciousness its no match for themThis is why the effort of our meditation is so limp and lax we dont understand what these things are doing to usThey close off our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind so that we cant see our way outAs a result the qualities were trying to develop just dont growNow when we can wipe out the homes of unawareness thats when well understand whats going onWhen we contemplate to the point where we understand these things well come to see the endless affairs of all the living beings that have taken up residence in our homeAnekajati samsaram Theyve come to quarrel and squabble and create a lot of troubleThey like to pull our mind into all kinds of harmWhen we contemplate so as to see things in this way dispassion arisesCakkhusmimpi nibbindatiWe feel dispassion for the eyeRupesupi nibbindatiDispassion for formsCakkhuviññanepi nibbindatiDispassion for consciousnessWe really get tired of itIts a genuine nuisance to our heartNibbindam virajjati viraga vimuccatiWe spit them outThe eye spits out formsIt spits out consciousnessIt spits them out because its had enoughSotasmimpi nibbindatiWe feel dispassion for the earSaddesupi nibbindatiDispassion for soundsSotaviññanepi nibbindatiDispassion for consciousnessViraga vimuccatiWe spit them all outWhen the eye spits out form forms dont get stuck in the eye so the eye can penetrate and see for milesWhen sounds get spit out our ears can penetrate We can hear what the devas are chatting aboutWhen the nose spits out aromas the entire world smells sweetOur goodness when we let go of it smells sweet in every directionThe tongue spits out flavors it doesnt swallow them it spits out consciousnessThe body spits out tactile sensationsHeat doesnt get stuck in the heartCold doesnt get stuck in the heartHard soft whatever in the body doesnt get stuck doesnt seep inEverything gets spit out all the way to mental consciousnessThe mind lets go of its goodnessIt doesnt hold onto the view or conceit that its goodness belongs to itIt spits out evil unskillful states so that evil cant leak in to get it soakedIt spits out all the various things it knows such as Thats the consciousness of living beings with bodies Thats the consciousness of living beings without bodies Thats really my consciousness All of this gets spit outThats whats called viññanasmimpi nibbindatiDispassion for consciousness dispassion for mental objectsViraga vimuccatiEverything gets spit out nothing gets swallowed so nothing gets stuck in the throatThe eye doesnt swallow forms the ear doesnt swallow sounds the nose doesnt swallow smells the tongue doesnt swallow flavors the body doesnt swallow tactile sensations the mind doesnt swallow ideasVimuccati ReleaseTheres no more turmoil or entanglementThats when youre said to be in the presence of nibbanaVimuttasmim vimuttamiti ñanam hoti khina jati vusitam brahmacariyam  In release there is the knowledge Released Birth is ended the holy life has been fulfilled When we can practice in this way well know clearly whats the consciousness of animals whats our consciousness and we can let go of them allThats when well know that weve gained release from all three sorts of consciousnessThe consciousness of living beings with bodies isnt our consciousnessThe consciousness of living beings without bodies isnt our consciousnessOur consciousness which is aware of these things isnt usThese things get let go in line with their natureThats when we can be said to know the five aggregates the six sense mediaWe gain release from the world and can open our eyesOur eyes will be able to see far as when we slide away the walls on our home and can see for hundreds of yardsWhen our eyes arent stuck on forms we can gain clairvoyant powers and see farWhen our ears arent stuck on sounds we can hear distant soundsWhen our nose isnt stuck on smells we can sniff the smell of the devas instead of irritating our nose with the smell of human beingsWhen flavors dont get stuck on the tongue we can taste heavenly medicine and foodWhen the mind isnt stuck on tactile sensations we can live in comfortWherever we sit we can be at our ease at ease when its cold at ease when its hot at ease in a soft seat at ease in a hard seatEven if the sun burns us up we can be at our easeThe body can fall apart and we can be at our easeThis is called spitting out tactile sensationsAs for the heart it spits out ideasIts a heart released released from the five aggregates released from the three sorts of consciousnessThey cant ever fool it againThe heart is released from stress and suffering and will reach the highest most ultimate happiness nibbanaHere Ive been talking on the topic of consciousnessTake it to heart and train yourself to give rise to knowledge withinThats when you can be said to know the worldsThe consciousnesses that have bodies inhabit the worlds of sensuality from the levels of hell on up to heavenThe consciousnesses with no bodies inhabit the world of the formless BrahmasOur own consciousness is what will take us to nibbanaWhen you know these three kinds of consciousness you can be said to be vijjacaranasampanno consummate in knowledge and conductSugato Youll go well and come well and wherever you stay youll stay wellAll the beings of the world can then get some reliefIn what wayWe hand everything over to themAny animals who want to eat away in our body can go ahead and do soWere no longer possessiveWhatever they want whatever they like to eat they can go ahead and have it We dont give a damnThats how we really feelWere not attachedIf they want to eat our intestines they can go aheadIf they want to eat our excrement they can have itIf they want to eat our blood they can eat all they likeWere not possessiveWhatever any type of consciousness wants theyre welcome to itWe give them their independence so they can govern themselves without our trying to snitch anything away from themAs a result they gain a share of our goodnessThe same for the bodiless consciousnesses in our body They gain their independenceAnd we gain our independence tooEverybody gets to live in his or her own house eat his or her own food sleep in his or her own bedEveryone lives separately so everyone can be at his or her own easeThis is called bhagava The eye gets separated from forms forms get separated from the eye and consciousness gets separated from selfThe ear gets separated from sounds sounds get separated from the ear and consciousness gets separated from selfThe nose gets separated from smells smells get separated from the nose and consciousness gets separated from selfThe tongue gets separated from flavors flavors get separated from the tongue and consciousness gets separated from selfThe body gets separated from tactile sensations tactile sensations get separated from the body and consciousness gets separated from the bodyThe mind gets separated from ideas ideas get separated from the mind and consciousness gets separated from the mindTheres no sense that this is our self or thats our selfThis is called Sabbe dhamma anatta all phenomena are notselfWe dont claim rights over anything at allWhoever can do this will gain release from the world from the cycle of death and rebirthThis is asavakkhayañana  the knowledge of the ending of mental fermentation  arising in the heartSo now that youve listened to this you should take it to ponder and contemplate so as to gain a clear understanding within yourselfThat way youll be on the path to release from stress and suffering using persistence and effort at all times to cleanse your own consciousness so as to know it clearlyThats what will lead you to puritySo for todays discussion of consciousnesses Ill ask to stop hereThis book is an introduction to the Buddhist practice of training the heartIt is taken from the talks of Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo a teacher in the Thai forest tradition of meditation and is called Food for Thought because it invites the reader to fill in the spaces suggested by the talks  to reflect on how the images and teachings they contain relate to one another and to ones own situation in lifeTwo of the talks included here Quiet Breathing and Centered Within briefly describe a technique of breath meditation aimed at giving rise to a centered and discerning state of mindThe rest of the talks deal with how to use such a state of mind in dealing with the problems of life the daytoday problems of anger anxiety disappointment etc and the larger problems of aging illness and deathIn other words this is a book concerned less with the techniques of meditation than with its meaning and worth the questions of why should one train the heart to begin with what personal qualities are involved in its training and how to make the best use of it as it becomes trainedReaders interested in more detailed instructions in the techniques of formal meditation can find them in Ajaan Lees other books  especially Keeping the Breath in Mind and Inner Strength  although it is wise to reflect on the sorts of questions raised by this book before actually sitting down to the practiceThe talks translated here are actually reconstructions of Ajaan Lees talks made by two of his followers  a nun Arun Abhivanna and a monk Phra Bunkuu Anuvaddhano  based on notes they made while listening to him teachSome of the reconstructions are fairly fragmentary and disjointed and in presenting them here I have had to edit them somewhat cutting extraneous passages expanding on shorthand references to points of formal doctrine and filling in gaps by collating passages from different talks dealing with the same topicAside from changes of this sort though I have tried my best to convey both the letter and spirit of Ajaan Lees messageI have also tried to keep the use of Pali words in the translation to a minimumIn all cases where English equivalents have been substituted for Pali terms I have chosen to convey the meanings Ajaan Lee gives to these terms in his writings even when this has meant departing from the interpretations given to these terms by scholarsA few Pali terms though have no adequate English equivalents so here is a brief glossary of the ones left untranslated or unexplained in this bookBrahma An inhabitant of the heavens of form and formlessness corresponding to the levels of meditative absorption in physical and nonphysical objectsBuddho Awake enlightenedAn epithet of the BuddhaDhamma The truth in and of itself the right natural order of thingsAlso the Buddhas teachings on these topics and the practice of those teachings aimed at realizing the true nature of the mind in and of itselfKamma Intentional acts which create good or bad results in accordance with the quality of the intentionKamma debts are the moral debts one owes to others for having caused them hardships or difficultiesNibbana Liberation the unbinding of the mind from mental defilement and the cycle of death and rebirthAs this term refers also to the extinguishing of fire it carries connotations of stilling cooling and peaceSangha The followers of the Buddha who have practiced his teachings at least to the point of gaining entry to the stream to LiberationTo take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha means to take them as the guide in ones search for happiness and to make the effort to give rise to their qualities within oneselfMy hope is that the teachings in this book will serve as more than just food for thought and that they will inspire you to search for the inner worth and happiness that come with the practice of training the heartMost of us tend to concern ourselves only with short small and narrow thingsFor instance we think that there isnt much to human life  were born and then we die  so we pay attention only to our stomachs and appetitesTheres hardly anyone who thinks further than that who thinks out past deathThis is why were shortsighted and dont think of developing any goodness or virtues within ourselves because we dont see the truth and the extremely important benefits well gain from these things in the futureActually the affairs of each person are really long and drawn out and not at all shortIf they were short wed all know where we came from and how we got where we areThe same would hold true for the future If our affairs were really a short story wed know where were going and what well be after deathBut the truth of the matter is that almost no one knows these things about themselvesThe only ones who do know are those whose minds are strong in goodness and virtue and who have developed purity to the point where they gain the intuitive understanding that enables them to see where theyve come from and where theyre goingThese people have the inner eye which is why they are able to see things past and futureSometimes they can see not only their own but also other peoples affairsThis is what makes them realize the hardships and difficulties suffered by human beings and other living beings born into this worldThey see the cycle of birth aging illness and deathThey see their past lives both good and bad and this makes them feel a sense of dismay and dispassion disenchanted with the idea of ever being born againAs a result they try to develop their goodness and virtues even further so that they can reduce the number of times theyll have to be rebornFor example streamwinners  those who have entered the stream to Liberation  will be reborn at most only seven more times and then will never have to be reborn againOncereturners will be reborn in the human world only once more while nonreturners will be reborn in the Brahma worlds and gain Liberation thereAs for streamwinners even though they have to be reborn theyre reborn in secure placesThey arent reborn in states of deprivation such as the realms of hungry shades angry demons or common animalsTheyre reborn as human beings but as special human beings not like the rest of usHow are they specialThey have few defilements in their hearts not thick defilements like ordinary peopleThey have a builtin sense of conscience and scrupulousnessEven though they may do wrong from time to time they see the damage it does and feel a sense of shame so that they wont want their various defilements to lead them into doing wrong ever againPeople disenchanted with rebirth make an extra effort to build up their virtues so that they wont have to come back and be rebornIf you want to cut down the number of times youll take rebirth you should steadily increase your inner quality and worthIn other words make your heart clean and bright with generosity moral virtue and meditationKeep your thoughts words and deeds at equilibrium secluded from evil both inside and outIf you have no vices in word and deed thats called being secluded from outside evilIf your mind is firmly centered in concentration and free from obstructing distractions thats called being secluded from inside evilThis way you can be at peace and at ease both within and withoutAs the Buddha said Happy is the person content in seclusionWhen this kind of seclusion arises in the mind all sorts of worthwhile qualities will come flowing in without stopThe heart will keep growing higher and higher until it no longer wants anything at allIf you used to eat a lot you wont want to eat a lotIf you used to eat in moderation therell be times when you wont want to eat at allIf you used to talk a lot you wont want to talk a lotIf you used to sleep a lot youll want to sleep only a littleHowever you live the heart will be entirely happy with no more danger to fear from anyoneThis is how you cut down the number of times youll take rebirthIf you see any areas in which youre still lacking in inner worth you should try to fill in the lack right awayBe steady in your practice of meditation and make your mind clear free from the distractions that will drag it down into the dirtDirt is where animals live  pigs dogs ducks chickens and cowsIts no place for human beingsIf youre really a human being you have to like living in clean places free from danger and germsThis is why the Buddha praised seclusion as the wellspring of happinessSo try to find a secluded spot for yourself to stay within the mind secluded from hindering distractionsMake your mind as bright as a jewel and dont let temptation come along and try to trade garbage for the good things youve gotYou have to be mindful at all times so dont let yourself be absentminded or forgetfulIf your mind doesnt stay with your body in the present all sorts of evil things  all sorts of distractions  will come flowing in to overwhelm it making it fall away from its inner worth just as a vacant house is sure to become a nest of spiders termites and all sorts of animalsIf you keep your mind firmly with the body in the present youll be safeLike a person on a big ship in the middle of a smooth sea free from wind and waves Everywhere you look is clear and wide openYou can see farYour eyes are quiet with regard to sights your ears quiet with regard to sounds and so on with your other sensesYour mind is quiet with regard to thoughts of sensuality ill will and harmThe mind is in a state of seclusion calm and at peaceThis is where well let go of our sense of me and mine and reach the further shore free from constraints and bondsNormally our hearts can hardly ever sit stillThey have to think about all kinds of thoughts and ideas both good and badWhen good things happen we keep them to think aboutWhen bad things happen we keep them to think aboutWhen we succeed or fail at anything we keep it to think aboutThis shows how impoverished the mind isWhen it thinks about things it likes it develops sensual cravingWhen it thinks about things that are possible it develops craving for possibilitiesWhen it thinks about things that are impossible it develops craving for impossibilities all without our realizing itThis is called unawarenessIts because of this unawareness that we have thoughts judgments and worries that form the wellspring for likes dislikes and attachmentsSometimes the things we think about can come true in line with our thoughts sometimes they cantWhile theres at least some use in thinking about things that are possible we like to go to the effort of thinking about things that are out of the questionIe when certain things are no longer possible we still hold onto them to the point where we feel mistreated or depressedWe keep trying to get results out of things that can no longer beWhen our hopes arent satisfied we latch onto our dissatisfaction when they are satisfied we latch onto our satisfactionThis gives rise to likes and dislikesWe latch onto thoughts of the future and thoughts of the pastMost of us when we succeed at something latch onto our happinessWhen we dont succeed we latch onto our disappointmentSometimes we latch onto things that are good  although latching onto goodness leaves us some way to crawl alongSometimes we actually latch onto things that are clearly badThis is what made the Buddha feel such pity for us human beingsIn what wayHe pitied our stupidity in not understanding what suffering isWe know that red ants can really hurt when they bite us yet we go stick our heads in a red ant nest and then sit around in pain and tormentWhat good do we get out of itWhen we see good or bad sights with our eyes we latch onto themWhen we hear good or bad sounds with our ears we latch onto themWhen we smell good or bad odors taste good or bad flavors feel good or bad sensations or think good or bad thoughts we latch onto them  so we end up all encumbered with sights dangling from our eyes sounds dangling from both of our ears odors dangling from the tip of our nose flavors dangling from the tip of our tongue tactile sensations dangling all over our body and thoughts dangling from our mindThis way sights are sure to close off our eyes sounds close off our ears odors close off our nostrils flavors close off our tongue tactile sensations close off our body and thoughts close off our mindWhen our senses are completely closed off in this way were in the dark  the darkness of unawareness  groping around without finding the right way unable to go any way at allOur body is weighed down and our mind is darkThis is called harming yourself killing yourself destroying your own chances for progressThoughts are addictive and especially when theyre about things that are badWe remember them long and think of them oftenThis is delusion one of the campfollowers of unawarenessFor this reason we have to drive this kind of delusion from our hearts by making ourselves mindful and alert fully conscious with each inandout breathThis is what awareness comes fromWhen awareness arises discernment arises as wellIf awareness doesnt arise how will we be able to get rid of cravingWhen awareness arises craving for sensuality craving for possibilities and craving for impossibilities will all stop and attachment wont existThis is the way of the Noble PathMost of us tend to flow along in the direction of whats bad more than in the direction of whats goodWhen people try to convince us to do good they have to give us lots of reasons and even then we hardly budgeBut if they try to talk us into doing bad all they have to do is say one or two words and were already running with themThis is why the Buddha said People are foolishThey like to feed on bad preoccupations And thats not allWe even feed on things that have no truth to them at allWe cant be bothered with thinking about good things but we like to keep clambering after bad things trying to remember them and keep them in mindWe dont get to eat any meat or sit on any skin and yet we choke on the bonesWe dont get to eat any meat This means that we gather up imaginary things to think about but they dont bring us any happinessA person who opens his mouth to put food in it at least gets something to fill up his stomach but a person who clambers around with his mouth open craning his neck to swallow nothing but air Thats really ridiculousHis stomach is empty without the least little thing to give it weightThis stands for thoughts that have no truth to themWe keep searching them out gathering them up and elaborating on them in various ways without getting any results out of them at all aside from making ourselves restless and distractedWe never have any time to sit still in one place and instead keep running and jumping around until the skin on our rears has no chance to make contact anywhere with a place to sit downThis is what is meant by We dont get to sit on any skin We cant lie down we cant stay seated  even though our bodies may be seated our minds arent seated there with themWe dont get to eat any meat and instead we choke on the bonesWe try to swallow them but they wont go down we try to cough them up but they wont come outWhen we say We choke on the bones this refers to the various bad preoccupations that get stuck in the heartThe bones here are the five HindrancesIll will Things that displease us are like bones stuck in the heartThe mind fastens on things that are bad on things we dislike until we start feeling animosity anger and hatredSometimes we even gather up old tasteless bones that were thrown away long ago  like chicken bones that have been boiled to make stock The meat has fallen off the flavor has been boiled away and all thats left are the hard brittle bones they throw to dogsThis stands for old thoughts stretching back to years that we bring out to gnaw onLook at yourself Your mind is so impoverished that it has to suck on old bonesIts really pitifulTorpor  lethargy When the mind has been feeding on trash like this with nothing to nourish it its strength is bound to wane awayIt becomes sleepy and depressed oblivious to other peoples words not hearing their questions or understanding what theyre trying to sayRestlessness  anxiety The mind then gets irritable and distracted which is followed by Uncertainty We may decide that good things are bad or bad things are good wrong things are right or right things are wrongWe may do things in line with the Dhamma and not realize it or contrary to the Dhamma  but in line with our own preconceptions  and not know itEverything gets stuck in our throat and we cant decide which way to go so our thoughts keep running around in circles like a person who rows his boat around in a lake for hours and hours without getting anywhereThis is called harming yourself hurting yourself killing yourselfAnd when we can do this sort of thing to ourselves whats to keep us from doing it to othersThis is why we shouldnt let ourselves harbor thoughts of envy jealousy or angerIf any of these five Hindrances arise in the heart then trouble and suffering will come flooding in like a torrential downpour and we wont be able to hold our own against themAll of this is because of the unawareness that keeps us from having any inner quality as a mainstayEven though we may live in a seven or ninestorey mansion and eat food at  a plate we wont be able to find any happinessPeople without any inner quality are like vagrants with no home to live inThey have to be exposed to sun rain and wind by day and by night so how can they find any relief from the heat or the coldWith nothing to shelter them they have to lie curled up until their backs get all crooked and bentWhen a storm comes they need to scurry to find shelter They cant stay under trees because theyre afraid the trees will be blown down on top of themThey cant stay in open fields because theyre afraid lightning will strikeAt midday the sun is so hot that they cant sit for long  like an old barefooted woman walking on an asphalt road when the sun is blazing She cant put her feet down because shes afraid theyll blister so she dances around in place on her tiptoes not knowing where she can rest her feetThis is why the Buddha felt such pity for us and taught us to find shelter for ourselves by doing good and developing concentration as a principle in our hearts so that we can have an inner homeThis way we wont have to suffer and other people will benefit as wellThis is called having a mainstayPeople with no mainstay are bound to busy themselves with things that have no real meaning or worth  ie with things that cant protect them from suffering when the necessity arisesA person without the wisdom to search for a mainstay is sure to suffer hardshipsIll illustrate this point with a storyOnce there was a band of monkeys living in the upper branches of a forest each one carrying its young wherever it wentOne day a heavy wind storm cameAs soon as the monkeys heard the sound of the approaching wind they broke off branches and twigs to make themselves a nest on one of the bigger branchesAfter they had piled on the twigs they went down under the nest and looked up to see if there were still any holesWherever they saw a hole they piled on more twigs and branches until the whole thing was piled thick and highThen when the wind and rain came they got up on top of the nest sitting there with their mouths open shivering from the cold exposed to the wind and rainTheir nest hadnt offered them any protection at all simply because of their own stupidityEventually a gust of wind blew the nest apartThe monkeys were scattered every which way and ended up dangling here and there their babies falling from their grasp all of them thoroughly miserable from their hardship and painPeople who dont search for inner worth as their mainstay are no different from these monkeysThey work at amassing money and property thinking that these things will give them security but when death comes none of these things can offer any safety at allThis is why the Buddha felt such pity for all the deluded people in the world and went to great lengths to teach us to search for inner quality as a mainstay for ourselvesPeople who have inner quality as their mainstay are said to be kind not only to themselves but also to others as well in the same way that when we have a house of our own we can build a hut for other people to live in tooIf we see that another persons hut is going to cave in we help find thatch to roof it make walls for the left side right side the front and the back to protect it from storm winds and raise the floor to get it above flood levelWhat this means is that we teach the other person how to escape from his or her own defilements in the same way that weve been able to whatever extent to escape from oursWhen we tell others to practice concentration its like helping them roof their house so that they wont have to be exposed to the sun and rainMaking walls for the front and back means that we tell them to shut off thoughts of past and future and walls for the left and right means that we tell them to shut off thoughts of likes and dislikesRaising the floor above flood level means we get them to stay firmly centered in concentration keeping their minds still with their object of meditationOnce people have a house with good walls a sound roof and a solid floor then even if they dont have any other external belongings  just a single rag to their name  they can be happy secure and at peaceBut if your house is sunk in the mud what hope is there for your belongingsYoull have to end up playing with crabs worms and other creepy thingsYour walls are nothing but holes so that people can see straight through your house in one side and out the otherEven from four to five miles away they can see everything youve gotWhen this is the case thieves are going to gang up and rob you  ie all sorts of bad thoughts and preoccupations are going to come in and ransack your heartAs for your roof its nothing but holesYou look up and can see the starsTermite dust is going to sift into your ears and eyes and birds flying past will plaster you with their droppingsSo in the end all you can do is sit scratching your head in misery because you havent any shelterWhen this is the case you should take pity on yourself and develop your own inner worthKeep practicing concentration until your heart matures step by stepWhen you do this youll develop the light of discernment that can chase the darkness of unawareness out of your heartWhen theres no more unawareness youll be free from craving and attachment and ultimately gain LiberationFor this reason we should all keep practicing meditation and set our hearts on developing nothing but inner goodness without retreating or getting discouragedWhatever is a form of goodness roll up your sleeves and pitch right inDont feel any regrets even if you ram your head into a wall and die on the spotIf youre brave in your proper efforts this way all your affairs are sure to succeed in line with your hopes and aspirationsBut if evil comes and asks to move into your home  your heart  chase it awayDont let it stay even for a single nightPeople who like to gather up thoughts worries etc to hold onto are no different from prisoners tied down with a ball and chainTo fasten onto thoughts of the past is like having a rope around your waist tied to a post behind youTo fasten onto thoughts of the future is like having a rope around your neck tied to a door in frontTo fasten onto thoughts you like is like having a rope around your right wrist tied to a post on your rightTo fasten onto thoughts you dont like is like having a rope around your left wrist tied to a wall on your leftWhichever way you try to step youre pulled back by the rope on the opposite side so how can you hope to get anywhere at allAs for people who have unshackled themselves from their thoughts they stand tall and free like soldiers or warriors with weapons in both hands and no need to fear enemies from any directionAny opponents who see them wont dare come near so theyre always sure to come out winningBut if were the type tied up with ropes on all sides nobodys going to fear us because theres no way we can take any kind of stance to fight them offIf enemies approach us all we can do is dance around in one spotSo I ask that we all take a good look at ourselves and try to unshackle ourselves from all outside thoughts and preoccupationsDont let them get stuck in your heartYour meditation will then give you results your mind will advance to the transcendent and youre sure to come out winning somedayInner wealth according to the texts means seven things  conviction virtue a sense of conscience scrupulousness breadth of learning generosity and discernment  but to put it simply inner wealth refers to the inner quality we build within ourselvesOuter wealth  money and material goods  doesnt have any hard and fast ownersToday it may be ours tomorrow someone else may take it awayThere are times when it belongs to us and times when it belongs to othersEven with things that are fixed in the ground like farms or orchards you cant keep them from changing handsSo when you develop yourself so as to gain the discernment that sees how worldly things are undependable and unsure dont let your property  your worldly possessions  sit idleThe Buddha teaches us to plant crops on our land so that we can benefit from itIf you dont make use of your land its sure to fall into other peoples handsIn other words when we stake out a claim to a piece of property we should plant it full of cropsOtherwise the government wont recognize our claim and well lose our rights to itEven if we take the case to court we wont have a chance to winSo once you see the weakness of an idle claim you should hurry up and plant crops on it so that the government will recognize your claim and issue you a title to the landWhat this means is that we should make use of our material possessions by being generous with them using them in a way that develops the inner wealth of generosity within usThis way they become the kind of wealth over which we have full rights and that will benefit us even into future lifetimesThis body of ours Actually theres not the least bit of it thats really ours at allWeve gotten it from animals and plants  the pigs prawns chickens fish crabs cows etc and all the various vegetables fruits and grains that have been made into the food weve eaten which the body has chewed and digested and turned into the blood that nourishes its various partsIn other words weve taken cooked things and turned them back into raw things ears eyes hands arms body etcThese then become male or female theyre given ranks and titles and so we end up falling for all of these conventionsActually these heads of ours are lettuce heads our hair is pigs hair our bones are chicken bones and duck bones our muscles are cows muscles etcTheres not one part thats really ours but we lay claim to the whole thing and say its this and thatWe forget the original owners from whom we got it all and so become possessive of itWhen the time comes for them to come and take it back were not willing to give it back which is where things get messy and complicated and cause us to suffer when death comes nearIf all the various animals weve eaten were to come walking out of each of us right now there wouldnt be enough room for them all in this meditation hallNone of us would be able to live here in this monastery any moreHow many pigs ducks chickens and shrimp have each of us eatenHow many bushels of fishIf we were to calculate it all who knows what the figures would be  all the animals we ourselves have killed for food or that weve gotten from others whove killed themHow do you think these animals wont come and demand repaymentIf we dont have anything to give them theyre sure to repossess everything weve gotRight when were at deaths door Thats when theyre going to crowd around and demand that we repay our debtsIf we dont have anything to give them theyre going to knock us flatBut if we have enough to give them well come out unscathedIn other words if we develop a lot of inner goodness well be able to contend with whatever pains we suffer by giving back the body with good grace  in other words by letting go of our attachment to itThats when well be at peaceWe should realize that the body leaves us and lets us go bit by bit every dayBut weve never left it never let it go at allWere attached to it in every way just as when we eat food Were attached to the food but the food isnt attached to usIf we dont eat it itll never cry even onceAll the attachment comes from our side aloneThe pleasure we get from the body is a worldly pleasure good for a moment and then it changesIts not at all lasting or permanentNotice the food you eat At what point is it good and deliciousIt looks good and inviting only when its arranged nicely on a plateIts delicious only for the brief moment its in your mouthAfter it goes down your throat what is it like thenAnd when it gets down to your intestines and comes out the other end what is it like thenIt keeps changing all the timeWhen you think about this sort of thing its enough to make you disillusioned with everything in the worldWorldly pleasure is good only when its hot and fresh like freshcooked rice piled on a plate when its still hot and steamingIf you leave it until its cold theres no taste to itIf you let it go until it hardens you cant swallow it and if you let it sit overnight it spoils and you have to throw it awayAs for the pleasure of the Dhamma its like the brightness of stars or the color of goldThe brightness of stars is clear and glitteringWhoever sees it feels calmed and refreshedWhen depressed people look at the stars no matter when their depression disappearsAs for the color of gold its always gleaming and goldenNo matter what the gold is made into its color doesnt changeIts always gleaming and golden as it always wasIn the same way the pleasure of the Dhamma is lasting and gives delight throughout time to those who practice itFor this reason intelligent people search for pleasure in the Dhamma by giving up their worthless meaningless worldly pleasures to trade them in for lasting pleasure by practicing meditation until their minds and actions reach the level of goodness beauty and purity that goes beyond all action all suffering and stressBeautiful things come from things that are dirty and not at all from things that are pleasant and cleanCrops and trees for instance grow to be healthy and beautiful because of the rotten and smelly compost and nightsoil with which theyre fertilizedIn the same way a beautiful mind comes from meeting with things that arent pleasantWhen we meet with bad things the mind has a chance to growBad things here refers to loss of wealth loss of status criticism and painWhen these things happen to a person whose mind is rightly centered in concentration they turn into good thingsBefore they were our enemies but eventually they become our friendsWhat this means is that when these four bad things occur to us we can come to our senses OhThis is how loss of wealth is badThis is how loss of status how pain and criticism are badThis is how the ways of the world can change and turn on you so that you shouldnt get carried away with their good sideWhen meditators meet with these four kinds of bad things their minds developThey become more and more dispassionate more and more disenchanted more and more detached from the four opposites of these bad things  wealth status pleasure and praise  so that when these good things happen they wont be fooled into getting attached or carried away with them and can instead push their minds on to a higher levelWhen they hear someone criticize or gossip about them its as if that person were taking a knife to sharpen themThe more they get sharpened the more they grow to a finer and finer pointLoss of wealth is actually good for you you knowIt can teach you not to be attached or carried away with the money or material benefits other people may offer youOtherwise the more you have the deeper you sink  to the point where you drown because you get stuck on being possessiveLoss of status is also good for youFor instance you may be a person but they erase your good name and call you a dog  which makes things even easier for you because dogs have no lawsThey can do what they like without any constraints without anyone to fine them or put them in jailIf people make you a prince or a duke youre really in bad straitsAll of a sudden youre big Your arms hands feet and legs grow all out of size and get in your way wherever you try to go or whatever you doAs for wealth status pleasure and praise theres nothing the least bit constant or dependable about themThe more you really think about them the more disaffected and disenchanted you become to the point where you find that youre indifferent neither pleased nor displeased with themThis is where your mind develops equanimity and can become firm in concentration so that it can grow higher and higher in the practice  like the lettuce and cauliflower that Chinese farmers plant in rows The more they get fertilized with nightsoil the faster more beautiful and more healthy they growIf they were fed nothing but clean clear water theyd end up all sickly and stuntedThis is why we say that when people have developed mindfulness and concentration theyre even better off when the ways of the world turn ugly and badIf the world shows you only its good side youre sure to get infatuated and stuck like a seed that stays buried in its shell and will never growBut once the seed comes out with its shoot then the more sun wind rain and fertilizer it gets the more it will grow and develop  ie the more your discernment will branch out into knowledge and wisdom leading you to intuitive insight and on into the transcendent like the old Chinese vegetable farmer who becomes a millionaire by building a fortune out of plain old excrementWhen we first meet with the fires of greed aversion and delusion we find them comforting and warmWere like a person sitting by a fire in the cold season As he sits soaking up the warmth he gets more and more sleepy and careless until he burns his hands and feet without realizing it and eventually falls headfirst into the flamesThe pleasures felt by people in the world come from looking at things only on the surfaceTake a plateful of rice for instanceIf you ask people whats good about rice theyll say It tastes good and fills you up too But the Buddha wouldnt answer like thatHed answer by talking about rice both when it goes in your mouth and when it comes out the other endThis is why his view of things covered both cause and effectHe didnt look at things from one side onlyThe Buddha saw that the ease and happiness of ordinary pleasures is nothing lastingHe wanted an ease and happiness that didnt follow the way of the worldly pleasures that most people wantThis was why he left his family and friends and went off to live in seclusionHe said to himself I came alone when I was born and Ill go alone when I dieNo one hired me to be born and no one will hire me to die so Im beholden to no oneTheres no one I have to fearIn all of my actions if theres anything thats right from the standpoint of the world but wrong from the standpoint of the truth  and wrong from the standpoint of my heart  theres no way Ill be willing to do itSo he posed himself a question Now that youve been born as a human being what is the highest thing you want in this world He then placed the following conditions on his answer In answering you have to be really honest and truthful with yourselfAnd once youve answered you have to hold to your answer as an unalterable law on which youve affixed your seal without ever letting a second seal be affixed on topSo what do you want and how do you want itYou have to give an honest answer understandI wont accept anything falseAnd once youve answered you have to keep to your answerDont be a traitor to yourselfWhen he was sure of his answer he said to himself I want only the highest and most certain happiness and ease the happiness that wont change into anything elseOther than that I dont want anything else in the worldOnce he had given this answer he kept to it firmlyHe didnt allow anything that would have caused the least bit of pain or distraction to his heart to get stuck there as a stain on itHe kept making a persistent effort with all his might to discover the truth without retreat until he finally awakened to that truth the reality of LiberationIf we search for the truth like the Buddha  if were true in our intent and true in what we do  theres no way the truth can escape usBut if we arent true to ourselves we wont find the true happiness the Buddha foundWe tell ourselves that we want to be happy but we go jumping into firesWe know what things are poison yet we go ahead and drink them anywayThis is called being a traitor to yourselfEvery person alive wants happiness  even common animals struggle to find happiness  but our actions for the most part arent in line with our intentionsThis is why we dont get to realize the happiness we want simply because theres no truth to usFor example when people come to the monastery If they come to make offerings observe the precepts and sit in meditation for the sake of praise or a good reputation theres no real merit to what theyre doingThey dont gain any real happiness from it so they end up disappointed and dissatisfiedThen they start saying that offerings precepts and meditation dont give any good resultsInstead of reflecting on the fact that they werent right and honest in doing these things they say that theres no real good to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that the Buddhas teachings are a lot of nonsense and liesBut actually the Buddhas teachings are an affair of the truthIf a person isnt true to the Buddhas teachings the Buddhas teachings wont be true to that person  and that person wont be able to know what the Buddhas true teachings areWhen we practice virtue concentration and discernment its as if we were taking the jewels and robes of royalty and the Noble Ones to dress up our heart and make it beautifulBut if we arent true in our practice its like taking robes and jewels and giving them to a monkeyThe monkey is bound to get them dirty and tear them to shreds because it has no sense of beauty at allWhoever sees this kind of thing happening is sure to see right through it that its a monkey showEven though the costumes are genuine the monkey inside isnt genuine like the costumesFor instance if you take a soldiers cap and uniform to dress it up as a soldier its a soldier only as far as the cap and uniform but the monkey inside is still a monkey and not a soldier at allFor this reason the Buddha teaches us to be true in whatever we do  true in being generous true in being virtuous true in developing concentration and discernmentDont play around at these thingsIf youre true then these activities are sure to bear you the fruits of your own truthfulness without a doubtIn Christianity they teach that if youve done wrong or committed a sin you can ask to wash it away by confessing the sin and asking for Gods forgivenessGod will then have the kindness to hold back punishment and youll be pureBut Buddhism doesnt teach this sort of thing at allIf you do wrong you are the one who has to correct the error so as to do away with the punishment on your own behalfWhat this means is that when a defilement  greed anger or delusion  arises in your heart you have to undo the defilement right there so as to escape from itOnly then will you escape from the suffering that would otherwise come as its natural consequenceWe can compare this to a man who drinks poison and comes down with violent stomach crampsIf he then runs to a doctor and says Doctor doctor Ive drunk poison and my stomach really hurtsPlease take some medicine for me so that the pain will go away theres no way that this is going to cure the painIf the doctor instead of the sick man is the one who takes the medicine the sick man can expect to die for sureSo I ask that we all understand this point that we have to wash away our own defilements by practicing the Dhamma  the medicine of the Buddha  in order to gain release from any evil and suffering in our hearts not that we can ask the Buddha to help wash away our mistakes and sufferings for usThe Buddha is simply the doctor who has discovered the formula for the medicine and prepared it for usWhatever disease we have we need to take the medicine and treat the disease ourselves if we want to recoverA single mind moment cant carry out two tasks at onceIn other words the evil youve done is really evil the goodness youve done really goodThe mind cant carry out the tasks of evil and goodness both at the same timeIts like having only one handWhen the things youre carrying fill the hand it cant pick up anything elseYou have to put down what youre already carryingOnly then can you pick up other thingsThis is an analogy for the mindIf the mind is continually in good shape evil wont have any place to land or catch holdBut if our goodness isnt constant evil will be able to find a perchIts like rowing a boat out into the oceanIf we stay close to shore crows flying from the shore will be able to perch on the mast of the boatIf you dont want them perching there you have to row out as far as you canThe crows then wont be able to perch on the mastIf any crow tries to keep flying out to the boat itll lose sight of the shore and is likely to die out there in the ocean because itll run out of strength itll run out of foodItll have to dieIn the same way if goodness catches hold of the greater part of the mind evil will have to circle aimlessly around with nowhere to landIf it stays close by  meaning that goodness has only a small part of the heart  evil will be able to come flying inSometimes it waits on the opposite shoreIf your strength of mind runs low itll stay right nearby and catch hold of you easilyFor example if the goodness you get from coming to the monastery isnt yet enough when you get back home your mind will order you to do evil in this way or that and youll go right along with itOr while youre sitting here listening to this talk evil will perch on the handrail to the stairs outsideWhen you get up at the end of the talk and let yourself get distracted itll immediately land right on youSometimes even while youre sitting here itll come swooping in just like a crowIf the mind is good and strong though evil will wait at a distanceEven when you get home it wont dare land on you  but it might land on someone else someone without any DhammaAs you talk with that person and your words begin to mesh with theirs evil might come sneaking in that wayThats because youre goodness isnt yet strong enoughIf we have a wound on our body  ie evil in our mind  we have to wash off the wound put medicine in it and cover it with a clean bandage in other words observe the precepts and practice meditationThat way the wound has a chance to healWashing the wound means that we dont get involved in thinking about the good and bad points of other peopleThat right there is a skillful mind state arisingThe mind will then be at its ease and will develop an inner nourishment coolness in heart and mindIts like sitting in a mountain glen with a waterfall streaming down and a pure breeze blowing through a cleft in the rockThe mind will feel cool and undisturbedThe heart will blossom like a jasmine filled with dew in the middle of the cool seasonThe mind will give rise to strengthIf the mind doesnt have any inner nourishment though it wont have any strength because its hungry and thinThe Buddha saw that we human beings are thin and malnourished in this way which is why he felt compassion for usHe taught us The mind that goes around swallowing sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations is eating a ball of fire you knowNot any kind of food In other words The eye is burning Everything we see with the eye is a form and each of these forms contains a ball of fire even though on the outside its coated to look pretty and attractiveThe ear is burning All the pleasing sounds we search for and that come passing in through our ears from the day were born to the day we die are burning sounds are flames of fireThe heat of the sun cant burn you to death but sounds can burn you to death which is why we say theyre hotter than the sunThe nose is burning Weve been smelling smells ever since the doctor cleaned out our nose right after birth and the nature of smells is that theres no such thing as a neutral smellThere are only two kinds good smelling and foulsmellingIf our strength is down and were not alert we swallow these smells right into the mind  and that means weve swallowed a time bombWere safe only as long as nothing ignites the fuseThe tongue is burning Countless tastes come passing over our tongueIf we get attached to them its as if weve eaten a ball of fire As soon as it explodes our intestines will come splattering outIf we human beings let ourselves get tied up in this sort of thing its as if weve eaten the fire bombs of the King of DeathAs soon as they explode were finishedBut if we know enough to spit them out well be safeIf we swallow them were loading ourselves downWe wont be able to find any peace whether were sitting standing walking or lying down because were on fire insideOnly when we breathe our last will the fires go outThe body is burning Tactile sensations are also a fire that wipes human beings outIf you dont have any inner worth or goodness in your mind these things can really do you a lot of damageGreed anger and delusion are like three enormous balls of redhot iron that the King of Death heats until theyre glowing hot and then pokes into our headsWhen greed doesnt get what it wants it turns into angerOnce were angry we get overcome and lose control so that it turns into delusionWe forget everything  good bad our husbands wives parents children  to the point where we can even kill our husbands wives parents and childrenThis is all an affair of delusionWhen these three defilements get mixed up in our minds they can take us to hell with no trouble at allThis is why theyre called fire bombs in the human heartBut if when greed arises we have the sense to take only what should be taken and not what shouldnt it wont wipe us out even though its burning us because we have fire insurancePeople without fire insurance are those with really strong greed to the point where theyre willing to cheat and get involved in corruption or crimeWhen this happens their inner fires wipe them outTo have fire insurance means that even though we feel greed we can hold it in check and be generous with our belongings by giving donations for instance to the religionThen even though we may die from our greed weve still gained inner worth from making donations as an act of homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  which is like keeping our insurance payments upThis way even though our house may burn down well still have some property leftAngerWhen this defilement really gets strong it has no sense of good or evil right or wrong husband wives or childrenIt can drink human bloodAn example we often see is when people get quarreling and one of them ends up in prison or even on death row convicted for murderThis is even worse than your house burning down because you have nothing left at allFor this reason we have to get ourselves some life insurance by observing the five or eight precepts so that we can treat and bandage our open sores  ie so that we can wash away the evil and unwise things in our thoughts words and deedsEven if we cant wash them all away we should try at least to relieve them somewhatAlthough you may still have some fire left let there just be enough to cook your food or light your homeDont let there be so much that it burns your house downThe only way to put out these fires is to meditate and develop thoughts of good willThe mind wont feel any anger hatred or ill will and instead will feel nothing but thoughts of sympathy seeing that everyone in the world aims at goodness but that our goodness isnt equalYou have to use really careful discernment to consider cause and effect and then be forgiving with the thought that we human beings arent equal or identical in our goodness and evilIf everyone were equal the world would fall apartIf we were equally good or equally bad the world would have to fall apart for sureSuppose that all the people in the world were farmers with no merchants or government officialsOr suppose there were only government officials with no farmers at all Wed all starve to death with our mouths gaping and dryIf everyone were equal and identical the end of the world would come in only a few days timeConsider your body Even the different parts of your own body arent equalSome of your fingers are short some are long some small some largeIf all ten of your fingers were equal youd have a monsters handsSo when even your own fingers arent equal how can you expect people to be equal in terms of their thoughts words and deedsYou have to think this way and be forgivingWhen you can think in this way your good will can spread to all people everywhere and youll feel sympathy for people on high levels low levels and in betweenThe big ball of fire inside you will go out through the power of your good will and loving kindnessThis comes from getting life insurance practicing tranquillity meditation so as to chase the defilements away from the mindThoughts of sensual desire ill will lethargy restlessness and uncertainty will vanish and the mind will be firmly centered in concentration using its powers of directed thought to stay with its meditation word  buddho  and its powers of evaluation to create a sense of inner lightness and easeWhen the mind fills itself with rapture  the flavor arising from concentration  it will have its own inner food and nourishment so that whatever you do in thought word or deed is sure to succeedThere are two kinds of food for the mind the kind that gives it strength and the kind that saps its strengthWhat this refers to is the food of sensory contact  the contact that takes place at the eye ear nose tongue body and intellectThere are six mouthfuls of this kind of foodThe food of consciousness ie the consciousness of contact that takes place at each of the six sensesThere are six mouthfuls of this kind tooThe food of intention or mental concomitants ie the thoughts that are formed in the heart leading it to think of the past or future and to know if things are good or bad pleasant or painfulOnce we know that our body and mind depend on these kinds of food we should use our discernment to reflect on them and evaluate them carefullyDiscernment is what forms the teeth of the mindWhen children are small they need to depend on others to mince or strain their food but when they grow up they have their own teeth and dont need to depend on anyone elseIf people are really discerning they dont need to chew coarse food at allFor example an intelligent hunter once hes killed an animal will remove the feathers and wings or cut off the antlers and hooves and take home just the useful partThen he cuts the meat off in pieces so that it can serve as foodIn other words if hes intelligent he throws away the inedible parts piece by pieceIn the same way intelligent people who want the inner quality of dispassion have to take the discernment that comes from concentration and use it to evaluate sights sounds smells tastes etc so that these things can serve a purpose and not do them any harmWhoever eats an entire fish  bones scales fins feces and all  is sure to choke to death on the bonesFor this reason we have to find a knife and chopping block  in other words use mindfulness to focus on say a visual object and discernment to consider what kind of object it isIs it something we should get involved with or notWhat kind of benefits or harm will it cause for the mindIf its a visual object that will cause harm to the mind you shouldnt get involved with itIf its a goodlooking object look for its bad side as wellBe a person with two eyesSometimes an object looks good but we dont look for its bad sideSometimes it looks bad but we dont look for its good sideIf something looks beautiful you have to focus on its bad side as wellIf it looks bad you have to focus on its good side tooIf you arent selective in what you eat you can ruin your healthPleasing objects are like sugar and honey Theyre sure to attract all sorts of ants and fliesDisagreeable objects are like filth In addition to carrying germs theyre sure to attract all sorts of other bad things too because theyre crawling with flies and wormsIf we arent discerning well gobble down the filth together with the worms and smelly parts and the sugar together with the ants and fliesYour heart is already in poor health and yet you go gobbling down things that are toxicWhen this happens no one can cure you but you yourselfFor this reason you have to keep the heart neutral on the middle pathDont be pleased by the objects you think are pleasing dont hate the objects you think are disagreeableDont be a person with only one eye or one earWhen you can do this youre equipped with discernmentYou can spit visual objects sounds smells tastes etc out of the heartOnce you can see that good has bad hiding behind it and bad has good hiding behind it  in the same way that the body has both a front and a back  you shouldnt let yourself fall for sights sounds smells etcYou have to consider them carefullyThe mind has two basic sorts of food good mental states and bad mental statesIf you think in ways that are good youll give strength to the mindIf youre discerning youll get to eat fine foodIf you arent youll have to eat crude food  eg youll get a crab and youll eat the whole thing raw without knowing how to boil it and peel away the shell and the clawsThe effort of meditation is like a fire concentration is like a pot mindfulness like a chopping block and discernment a knifeIntelligent people will use these things to prepare their food so that its nourishment  the nourishment of the Dhamma  will permeate into the heart to give it five kinds of strengthThe strength of persistence The heart when were persistent is like the wheels of an automobile that keep turning and propelling it toward its goal enabling us to see the gains that come from our persistenceThe strength of mindfulness Having mindfulness is like knowing when to open and when to close your windows and doorsThe strength of concentration Concentration will be firmly established in the mind whether were sitting standing walking lying down speaking or listeningWe can listen without getting stuck on whats said and speak without getting stuck on what we sayThe strength of discernment Well gain wisdom and understanding with regard to all things so that eventually well attain purity of mind  by letting go of all thoughts of past and future and not being pleased or displeased by any sights sounds smells tastes etc at allThere are three ways in which people order their priorities putting the world first putting themselves first and putting the Dhamma firstPutting the world first Theres nothing at all dependable about the affairs of the worldStop and think for a moment Ever since you were born from your first memory up to the present day what is the best thing that has ever happened in your lifeWhat is the most enjoyable thingWhat have you liked the mostIf you answer you have to say that of all the things in the world only percent are satisfactory the other are unsatisfactoryBut if you asked me Id answer that theres nothing satisfactory about the world at allTheres nothing but stress and miseryYou get friends and they take advantage of youYou get possessions and you have to worry about themYou get money and you end up suffering for itThe people you work with arent as good as youd like them to beYour family and relatives are nothing but troubleIn short I dont see anything that really brings a person any real happinessYou get money and it brings troubleYou get friends and they make you sufferThe people you live and work with dont get along smoothlyThis is the way it is with the worldFor this reason anyone whose mind runs along in the current of the world is bound for nothing but pain and sorrowThe Buddha taught For the mind not to be affected by the ways of the world is to be serene and free from sorrow This is the highest good fortuneThe world has eight edges and each edge is razor sharp capable of slicing human beings to bits without mercyThe eight edges of the world are on the one side the edge of wealth the edge of status the edge of praise and the edge of pleasureThese four edges are especially sharp because theyre things we likeWe keep polishing and sharpening them and the more we do this the sharper they get until ultimately they turn around and slit our throatsThe other side has four edges too but actually theyre not so sharp because no one likes to use themNo one wants them so no one sharpens them and as a result theyre dull and blunt  and like dull knives they cant kill anyoneThese four edges are loss of wealth loss of status criticism and painNo one wants any of these things but they have to exist as part of the worldHow are the sharp edges sharpTake status for an exampleAs soon as people gain status and rank they start swelling up larger than they really areYou dont have to look far for examples of this sort of thingLook at monksWhen they start out as ordinary junior monks they can go anywhere with no trouble at all along highways and byways down narrow alleys and back streets anywhere they likeBut as soon as they start getting a little ecclesiastical rank they start getting abnormally largeThe roads they used to walk along start feeling too narrowThey have trouble walking anywhere  their legs are too long and their feet too heavyTheir rears are too large for ordinary seatsAs for lay people once theyre hit by the edge of status they start swelling up too to the point where they can hardly moveTheir hands get too heavy to raise in respect to the BuddhaTheir legs get so big they cant make it to the monastery to hear a sermon or observe the precepts  theyre afraid theyd lose their edgeThis is how one of the edges of the world kills the goodness in peopleAs for the edge of wealth this refers to money and possessionsAs soon as we get a lot we start getting stingyWe become wary of making too many offerings or of being too generous with others because were afraid well run out of moneyThis is why rich people tend to be stingy and drown in their wealthAs for poor people they can give away everything and then work to replace itThey can give offerings and be generous with rarely any sense of regretTheir arms and legs arent too big so they can come to the monastery with no trouble at allThe edge of pleasure is very sharp because wherever you get your pleasure thats where you get stuckIf your pleasure comes from your friends youre stuck on your friendsIf your pleasure comes from your children or grandchildren youre stuck on your children and grandchildrenIf your pleasure comes from eating sleeping or going out at night then thats where youre stuckYoure not willing to trade in your pleasure for the sake of inner worth because youre afraid of letting your pleasure fall from your graspYou cant observe the five or eight precepts because they make you force and deny yourselfIf you observe the eight precepts you cant go see a movie or show and cant sleep on a nice soft mattressYoure afraid that if you miss one evening meal youll get hungry or weakYou dont want to sit and meditate because youre afraid your back will hurt or your legs will go numbSo this is how the edge of pleasure destroys your goodnessAs for the edge of praise this too is razor sharpWhen people are praised they start floating and dont want to come downThey hear praise and its so captivating that they forget themselves and think that theyre already good enough  so they wont think of making the effort to make themselves better in other waysAll four of these edges are weapons that kill our goodnessTheyre like the paint people use on houses to make them pretty something that can last only a while and then has to fade and peel awayIf you can view these things simply as part of the passing scenery without getting stuck on them they wont do you any harmBut if you latch onto them as really being your own the day is sure to come when youll have to meet with disappointment  loss of wealth loss of status criticism and pain  because its a law of nature that however far things advance thats how far they have to regressIf you dont lose them while youre alive youll lose them when you dieThey cant stay permanent and lastingOnce we realize this truth then when we meet with any of the good edges of the world we shouldnt get so carried away that we forget ourselves and when we meet with any of the bad edges we shouldnt let ourselves get so discouraged or sad that we lose hopeStick to your duties as you always haveDont let your goodness suffer because of these eight ways of the worldPutting yourself first This means acting speaking and thinking whatever way you like without any thought for whats right or wrong good or badIn other words you feel you have the right to do whatever you wantYou may see for instance that something isnt good and you know that other people dont like it but you like it so you go ahead and do itOr you may see that something is good but you dont like it so you dont do itSometimes you may like something and its good but you dont do it  its good but you just cant do itWhen youre practicing the Dhamma though then whether or not you like something you have to make yourself do itYou have to make the Dhamma your life and your life into Dhamma if you want to succeedYou cant use the principle of giving priority to your own likes at allPutting the Dhamma first This is an important principle for those who practiceThe duties of every Buddhist are to develop virtue by observing the precepts to center the mind in concentration and to use discernment to investigate the truth without giving rein to defilementThe basic level of virtue is to prevent our words and deeds from being bad or evilThis means observing the five precepts not killing any living beings not stealing not engaging in illicit sex not lying and not taking intoxicantsThese are the precepts that wash away the gross stains on our conductTheyre precepts that turn us from common animals into human beings and prevent us from falling into states of deprivation and woeThe intermediate level of virtue turns human beings into celestial beingsThis refers to restraint of the senses keeping watch over the way we react to our senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation so that they dont give rise to bad mental statesThis can turn human beings into celestial beings but even then we havent escaped from death and rebirth because when celestial beings run out of merit they have to come back and be reborn as human beings againThey still have to keep swimming around in the cycle of rebirthThose who can gain release from all forms of evil however wont have to be reborn as animals human beings or celestial beings ever againThis refers to people who practice concentration and can abandon all evil in their hearts by developing the stages of absorption and discernment until they reach the level of nonreturningWhen they die they go to the Brahma worlds and there they develop their hearts still further purifying them of all defilements becoming arahants and ultimately attaining total LiberationThe basic level of virtue protects our words and deeds from being evilThe intermediate level protects our senses and keeps them clean  which means that we dont let the three defilements of passion aversion and delusion be provoked into action by what we see hear smell taste touch or thinkAs for the highest level of virtue  inner virtue  this means giving rise to Right Concentration within the mindOn this level not killing means not killing off your goodnessFor instance if bad thoughts arise and you arent careful to wipe them out their evil will come pouring in and your goodness will have to dieThis is because your mind is still caught up on good and evilSometimes you use good to kill evilSometimes you use evil to kill good This is called killing yourselfStealing on this level refers to the way the mind likes to take the good and bad points of other people to think aboutThis sort of mind is a thief  because weve never once asked other people whether theyre possessive of their good and bad points or are willing to share them with usFor the most part what we take is their old dried up garbageIe we like to focus on their bad pointsEven though they may have good points we dont let ourselves see themWe take our own opinions as our guide and as a result we end up as fools without realizing itIllicit sensuality on this level refers to the state of mind that is stuck on sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas or that lies fermenting in greed anger and delusionIn other words the mind is impure and is always involved with sensual objects and moodsLying on this level means not being trueHow are we not trueWe come to the monastery but our minds are at homeWe listen to the sermon but our hearts are thinking of something elseOur bodies may be sitting in the meditation position just like the Buddha but our minds are roaming around through all sorts of thoughts gnawing on the past nibbling at the future not finding any meat at allThis is called lying to yourself and to others as wellHow is it lying to othersSuppose you go home and someone asks Where did you go today and you answer I went to the monastery to listen to a sermon Actually your body came but you didnt comeYour body listened but you didnt listenThis has to be classed as a kind of lyingIntoxication on this level refers to delusion and absentmindednessIf were going to contemplate body feelings mind and mental qualities our minds have to be still and really focused on these thingsBut if were absentminded and forgetful our minds go down the wrong path weaving in and out back and forth like a drunkardSometimes we end up falling down in a stupor and lying there on the side of the roadNothing good will come of itThose who are careful to keep their minds firmly centered in concentration and to keep the five precepts on this level pure and whole though are said to be developing the highest perfection of virtue  showing respect for the Dhamma above and beyond the world above and beyond themselvesThis is called putting the Dhamma first in a way befitting those who practice itThis is what it means to be a true Buddhist in a way that will eventually lead us to release from all suffering and stressNow Id like to explain a little about how to meditateSitting in meditation is a worthwhile activityThe outer part of the activity is to sit in a halflotus position with your right leg on top of your left leg your hands palmup in your lap your right hand on top of your leftKeep your body erectClose your eyes but dont close them off like a person asleepYour optic nerves have to keep working to some extent or else youll get drowsyThese activities are the outer aspects of good meditation but they arent what makes the meditation goodYou also need to have the right object for the mind to dwell on and the right intention the intention to keep the inandout breath in mind to adjust it so that its comfortable and to keep the breath and mind together so that they dont slip away from each otherWhen you can do this properly youll gain beneficial results in terms of both body and mind  ie the right quality youre looking for termed inner worth which means a soothing sense of ease comfort fullness and wellbeingWhen you sit and meditate keep noticing whether or not your mind is staying with the inandout breathYou have to keep mindfulness in charge of the mindFor example when you breathe in think bud when you breathe out think dhoBuddhoBe mindfulDont let yourself forget or slip awayPut aside all your outside responsibilities and let go of all outside thoughts and perceptionsKeep your mind with nothing but the breathYou dont have to turn your attention to anything elseUsually when you sit and meditate though thoughts of past and future tend to appear and get in the way of the quality of your meditationThoughts of this sort  whether theyre about things past or yet to come about the world or the Dhamma  have no good to them at allTheyll simply cause you trouble and sufferingThey make the mind restless and disturbed so that it cant gain any peace and calm  because things that are past have already passedTheres no way you can bring them back or change themThings in the future havent reached us yet so we cant know whether or not theyll be in line with our expectationsTheyre far away and uncertain so theres no way theyll be any help to our thinking at allFor this reason we have to keep hold on the mind to keep it in the present by fixing it on nothing but the breathTo think about the breath is called directed thought as when we think buddho together with the breath  bud in dho out like were doing right nowWhen we start evaluating the breath we let go of buddho and start observing how far the effects of each inandout breath can be felt in the bodyWhen the breath comes in does it feel comfortable or notWhen it goes out does it feel relaxed or notIf it doesnt feel comfortable and relaxed change itWhen you keep the mind preoccupied with investigating the breath let go of buddhoYou dont have any need for itThe inbreath will start to spread throughout the body together with mindfulness and alertnessWhen we let go of buddho our evaluation of the breath becomes more refined the movement of the mind will calm down and become concentration outside perceptions will fall silentFalling silent doesnt mean that our ears go blank or become deafIt means that our attention doesnt go running to outside perceptions or to thoughts of past or futureInstead it stays exclusively in the presentWhen we fix our attention on the breath in this way constantly keeping watch and being observant of how the breath is flowing well come to know what the inbreath and outbreath are like whether or not theyre comfortable what way of breathing in makes us feel good what way of breathing out makes us feel good what way of breathing makes us feel tense and uncomfortableIf the breath feels uncomfortable try to adjust it so that it gives rise to a sense of comfort and easeWhen we keep surveying and evaluating the breath in this way mindfulness and alertness will take charge within usStillness will develop discernment will develop knowledge will develop within usWhen you sit and meditate you should keep in mind the factors that make it a worthwhile activityThe right object for the mind  ie the breath which is the theme of your meditationThe right intentionThis means that you focus your mind steadily on what youre doing and nothing else with the purpose of making it settle down firmly in stillnessThe right quality  inner worth  ie the calm and ease you gain from your practice of concentrationTo have the right object while you sit and meditate you should have your mind set on giving your heart solely to the qualities of the BuddhaWhat this means is that you focus on your inandout breathing together with the word buddho without thinking of anything elseThis is your object or foundation for the mindThe mental side of the object is the word buddho but if you just think buddho buddho without joining it up with your breathing you wont get the results you want because simply thinking on its own is too weak to have a hold on the mind and as a result it doesnt fulfill all the factors of meditationThe mind wont be snug enough with its object to stay firmly put in its stillness and so will show signs of waveringSince this is the case you have to find something to give it some resistance something for it to hold onto in the same way that a nail you drive into a board will hold it firmly to a post and not let it moveA mind without something to hold onto is bound not to be snug and firm with its objectThis is why were taught to think also of the breath which is the physical side of our object together with buddho thinking bud in with the inbreath and dho out with the outAs for the factor of intention in your meditation you have to be intent on your breathingDont leave it to the breath to happen on its own as you normally doYou have to be intent on synchronizing your thought of the inbreath with the inbreath and your thought of the outbreath with the outIf your thinking is faster or slower than your breathing it wont workYou have to be intent on keeping your thinking in tandem with the breathIf you breathe in this way this is the intention that forms the act of your meditationIf you simply let the breath happen on its own its no longer a theme of meditationIts simply the breathSo you have to be careful and intent at all times to keep the mind in place when you breathe in and in place when you breathe outWhen you breathe in the mind has to think budWhen you breathe out it has to think dhoThis is the way your meditation has to beThe quality of inner worth in centering the mind comes when you make the body and mind feel soothed and relaxedDont let yourself feel tense or constrictedLet the breath have its freedomDont block it or hold it force it or squeeze itYou have to let it flow smoothly and easilyLike washing a shirt and hanging it out to dry Let the sun shine and the wind blow and the water will drip away by itselfIn no time at all the shirt will be clean and dryWhen you meditate its as if you were washing your body and mindIf you want the body to feel clean and fresh inside you have to put it at its easePut your eyes at ease your ears at ease your hands feet arms and legs all at their easePut your body at ease in every way and at the same time dont let your mind get involved in any outside thoughtsLet them all drop awayWhen you wash your mind so that its clean and pure its bound to become bright within itself with knowledge and understandingThings you never knew or thought of before will appear to youThe Buddha thus taught that the brightness of the mind is discernmentWhen this discernment arises it can give us knowledge about ourselves  of how the body got to be the way it is and how the mind got to be the way it isThis is called knowledge of form and name or of physical and mental phenomenaDiscernment is like a sail on a sailboat The wider its spread the faster the boat will goIf its tattered and torn it wont catch the wind and the boat will have to go slowly or might not even reach its goal at allBut if the sail is in good shape it will take the boat quickly to its destinationThe same holds true with our discernmentIf our knowledge is only in bits and pieces it wont be able to pull our minds up to the current of the DhammaWe may end up sinking or giving up because we arent true and sincere in what we doWhen this is the case we wont be able to get any resultsOur good qualities will fall away and sink into our bad onesWhy will they sinkBecause our sails dont catch the windAnd why is thatBecause theyre torn into shredsAnd why are they tornBecause we dont take care of them so they wear out fast and end up tattered and tornThis is because the mind spends all its time entangled with thoughts and ideasIt doesnt settle down into stillness so its discernment is tattered and tornWhen our discernment is in bits and pieces like this it leads us down to a low level  like a log or post that we leave lying flat on the ground exposed to all sorts of dangers Termites may eat it or people and animals may trample all over it because its left in a low placeBut if we stand it up on its end in a posthole its free from these dangers apart from the minor things that can happen to the part buried in the groundThe same holds true with the mindIf we let it drift along in its ideas instead of catching hold of it and making it stand firmly in one place  ie if we let it make its nest all the time in concepts and thoughts  its bound to get defiled and sink to a low levelThis is why the Buddha taught us to practice centering the mind in concentration so that it will stand firm in a single objectWhen the mind is centered its free from turmoil and confusion like a person who has finished his workThe body is soothed and rested the mind is refreshed  and when the mind is refreshed it becomes steady still and advances to a higher level like a person on a high vantage point  the top of a mountain the mast of a boat or a tall tree  able to see all kinds of things in every direction near or far better than a person in a low place like a valley or ravineIn a low place the sun is visible for only a few hours of the day and there are corners where the daylight never reaches at allA mind that hasnt been trained to stand firm in its goodness is sure to fall to a low level and not be brightBut if we train our minds to a higher and higher level well be sure to see things both near and far and to meet up with brightnessThese are some of the rewards that come from centering the mind in concentrationWhen we start seeing these rewards were bound to develop convictionWhen we feel conviction we become inspired to pull our minds even further  in the same way that a sail that isnt torn can take a boat to its destination without any troubleThis is one point I want to makeAnother point is that discernment can also be compared to an airplane propellerWhen we sit here stilling our minds its as if we were flying an airplane up into the skyIf the pilot is sleepy lazy or in a blur were not safeNo matter how fantastic the plane may be it can still crash us into a mountain or the forest wilds because the pilot doesnt have any mindfulness or alertnessSo when we sit meditating its like were flying an airplaneIf our mindfulness is weak and our mind keeps wandering off our airplane may end up crashingSo we have to keep observing the body to see where at the moment it feels painful or tense and keep check on the mind to see whether or not its staying with the body in the presentIf the mind isnt with the body its as if the pilot isnt staying with his airplaneThe Hindrances will have an opening to arise and destroy our stillnessSo when we sit and meditate we have to make sure that we dont get absentmindedWe have to be mindful and alert at all times and not let the mind slip away anywhere elseWhen we can do this well develop a sense of comfort and ease and will begin to see the benefits that come from mental stillnessThis insight is the beginning of discernmentThis discernment is like an airplane propellerThe more we practice the more benefits well seeWell be able to take our plane as high as we want land it whenever we feel like it or try any stunts that occur to usIn other words when we develop discernment within ourselves we can have control over our mindIf we want it to think itll thinkIf we dont want it to think it wont thinkWe know how to keep our own mind in lineIf we cant keep ourselves in line theres no way we can expect to keep anyone else in lineSo if were intelligent its like being a pilot who can keep a plane under his full controlWe can keep the mind in lineFor example if it thinks of something bad we can order it to stop and rest and the thought will disappearThis is called keeping the mind in lineOr if we want it to think it will be able to think and to knowOnce it knows thats the end of the matter and so it will then stop thinkingWhatever we want it to do it can do for usAccording to the Buddha people like this are called sages because they have discernment Whatever they do they really doThey know what is harmful and what isntThey know how to put a stop to their thinking and as a result they very rarely meet with sufferingAs for stupid people they simply fool around and drag their feet pulling themselves back when they should go forward and forward when they should go back spending their days and nights thinking about all kinds of nonsense without any substanceEven when they sleep they keep thinkingTheir minds never have any chance to rest at allAnd when their minds are forced to keep working like this theyre bound to run down and wear out and wont give any good results when theyre put to useWhen this happens they sufferBut if we have the discernment to be alert to events we can let go of what should be let go stop what should be stopped and think about what needs to be thought aboutWe can speak when we should speak act when we should act  or simply stay still if thats whats called forPeople who work day and night without sleeping without giving their bodies a chance to rest are killing themselvesIn the same way thoughts and concepts are things that bring on the end of our life and destroy our mind  because they keep the mind working whether were sitting standing walking or lying downSometimes even when were just sitting alone we keep thinking  which means were killing ourselves because the mind never gets a chance to restIts strength keeps eroding away and eventually when its strength is all gone its good qualities will have to dieSo when we sit here centering our minds its like eating our fill bathing ourselves till were thoroughly clean and then taking a good napWhen we wake up we feel bright refreshed and strong enough to take on any job at allThis is why the Buddha was able to develop such strength of mind that he was able to do without food for example for seven full days and yet not feel tired or weakThis was because his mind was able to rest and be still in the four levels of absorptionHis concentration was strong and gave great strength to his body his speech and his mindThe strength it gave to his body is what enabled him to wander about teaching people in every city and town throughout Northern IndiaSometimes he had to walk over rough roads through desolate places but he was never tired in any wayAs for the strength of his speech he was able to keep teaching without respite from the day of his Awakening to the day of his final passing away  a total of yearsAnd as for the strength of his mind he was very astute capable of teaching his disciples so that thousands of them were able to become arahantsHe was able to convince large numbers of people who were stubborn proud and entrenched in wrong views to abandon their views and become his disciplesHis heart was full of kindness compassion and sincerity with no feelings of anger hatred or malice toward anyone at allIt was a pure heart without blemishAll of these qualities came from the Dhamma he had practiced  not from anything strange or mysterious  the same Dhamma were practicing right nowThe important thing is that we have to be intent on really doing it if we want to get resultsIf when we center the mind we really do it well get real resultsIf we dont really do it well get nothing but playthings and dollsThats how it is with the practiceThe four properties of the body  the way it feels from the inside ie earth water wind and fire  are like four peopleIf you keep trying to acquaint yourself with them after a while theyll become your friendsAt first they arent too familiar with you so they dont trust you and will probably want to test your mettleFor instance when you start sitting in meditation theyll take a stick and poke you in your legs so that your legs hurt or grow numbIf you lie down theyll poke you in the backIf you lie on your side theyll poke you in the waistIf you get up and sit again theyll test you againOr they may whisper to you to give upIf you give in to them the King of Death will grin until his cheeks hurtWhat you have to do is smile against the odds and see things throughKeep talking with all four propertiesEven though they dont respond at first you have to keep talking with them asking them this and thatAfter a while theyll give you a oneword answerSo you keep talking and then their answers will start getting longer until you eventually become acquaintances and can have real conversationsFrom that point they become your friendsTheyll love you and help you and tell you their secretsYoull be a person with friends and wont have to be lonelyYoull eat together sleep together and wherever you go youll go togetherYoull feel secureNo matter how long you sit you wont acheNo matter how long you walk you wont feel tired  because you have friends to talk with as you walk along so that you enjoy yourself and reach your destination before you realize itThis is why were taught to practice meditation by keeping mindfulness immersed firmly in the bodyContemplate your meditation themes  body feelings mind and mental qualities  without letting your mind wander astray in outside thoughts and preoccupationsContemplate the body so as to know how its properties are getting along where it feels pleasant painful or neutralNotice how the mind moves around in the various things you know until you reach the mental quality that is still solid and trueThis way its like having friends go with you wherever you go and whatever you doIn other words when the body walks the mind walks with itWhen the body lies down the mind lies down with itWhen the body sits the mind sits with itWherever the body stops the mind stops tooBut most of us arent like thisThe body takes two steps but the mind takes four or five  so how can it not get tiredThe body lies in a mosquito net surrounded by a railing and seven thick walls but the mind can still go running outsideWhen this is the case where will it get any happinessItll have to wander around exposed to the sun wind rain and all sorts of dangers because it has no protectionIf theres no concentration to act as a shelter for the heart itll always have to meet with misery and painFor this reason you should train your heart to stay firm in concentration and to develop full strength within yourself so that you can be your own personThis way youll be bound to meet with all things pure and goodInsight isnt something that can be taughtIts something you have to give rise to within yourselfIts not something you simply memorize and talk aboutIf we were to teach it just so we could memorize it I can guarantee that it wouldnt take five hoursBut if you wanted to understand one word of it three years might not even be enoughMemorizing gives rise simply to memoriesActing is what gives rise to the truthThis is why it takes effort and persistence for you to understand and master this skill on your ownWhen insight arises youll know whats what where its come from and where its going  as when we see a lantern burning brightly We know that Thats the flame Thats the smoke Thats the light We know how these things arise from mixing what with what and where the flame goes when we put out the lanternAll of this is the skill of insightSome people say that tranquillity meditation and insight meditation are two separate things  but how can that be trueTranquillity meditation is stopping insight meditation is thinking that leads to clear knowledgeWhen theres clear knowledge the mind stops still and stays putTheyre all part of the same thingKnowing has to come from stoppingIf you dont stop how can you knowFor instance if youre sitting in a car or a boat that is traveling fast and you try to look at the people or things passing by right next to you along the way you cant see clearly whos who or whats whatBut if you stop still in one place youll be able to see things clearlyOr even closer to home When we speak there has to be a pause between each phraseIf you tried to talk without any pauses at all would anyone be able to understand what you saidThis is why we first have to make the mind stop to be quiet and stillWhen the mind stays still in a state of normalcy concentration arises and discernment followsThis is something you have to work at and do for yourselfDont simply believe what others sayGet so that you know OhOhOh from within and not just OhOhOh from what people sayDont take the good things they say and stick them in your heartYou have to make these things your own by getting them to arise from within youSpending one dollar of your own money is better than spending dollars youve borrowed from someone elseIf you use borrowed money you have to worry because youre in debtIf you use your own money theres nothing to worry aboutStopping is what gives rise to strengthIf a man is walking or running he cant put up a good fight with anyone because the advantage lies with the person standing still not with the person walking or runningThis is why were taught to make the mind stop still so that it can gain strengthThen it will be able to start walking again with strength and agilityIts true that we have two feet but when we walk we have to step with one foot at a timeIf you try to step with both feet at once you wont get anywhereOr if you try to walk with just one foot you cant do that eitherWhen the right foot stops the left foot has to take a stepWhen the left foot stops the right foot has to take a stepYou have to stop with one foot and step with the other if youre going to walk with any strength because the strength comes from the foot that has stopped not from the foot taking a stepOne side has to stop while the other side takes a stepOtherwise youll have no support and are sure to fall downIf you dont believe me try stepping with both feet at once and see how far you getIn the same way tranquillity and insight have to go togetherYou first have to make the mind stop in tranquillity and then take a step in your investigation This is insight meditationThe understanding that arises is discernmentTo let go of your attachment to that understanding is releaseSo stopping is the factor that gives rise to strength knowledge and discernment  the fixed mind that knows both the world and the Dhamma in a state of heightened virtue heightened consciousness and heightened discernment leading on to the transcendentThe Buddha taught The pursuit of heightened consciousness is the heart of the Buddhas teaching Heightened consciousness is a state of mind that lies above and beyond mental defilementThere are two ways it can be reachedThe mind doesnt yet have any heightened inner quality but we heighten it through our effortsThe mind has developed the proper inner quality and uses it to keep itself safe above and beyond defilementThe first case refers to the state of ordinary peoples mindsWhen they arent sitting in meditation their minds arent in any special state of concentration so if defilement arises within them they have to be determined and perceptive  to be aware of the defilement and to make up their minds that they wont let it push them aroundThis is called Right AttitudeEven though the mind isnt in concentration this technique can give resultsWhat this means is that were alert to whats going onFor example when were angry when we meet with something undesirable we should be alert to the fact and make ourselves determined that no matter what were going to keep the defilement of anger under control by resisting it and putting our better side into playIn other words when were angry we act as if we werentInstead of letting the anger overpower the mind we use our inner goodness to overpower the mindThis is called heightened consciousnessWhen you meet with something you dont like dont let the fact that you dont like it showInstead act as if you were happy and calmIe put your good side to useDont let your bad side show under any circumstancesIf youre circumspect and composed enough to hold the mind in check before it can let its defilements come out in word or deed if you can force the defilements to stop and can let only your best manners show you count as having heightened consciousnessYou are also a good member of any social group for you can work toward your own progress and that of the group as a wholeIn the texts this quality is called composure  a state of mind that lies above the defilementsThis is one form of heightened consciousness and is something we should all try to develop within ourselves as we are ableThe second form of heightened consciousness refers to a mind freed from the Hindrances and trained to a state of Right ConcentrationThe mind is firmly established in its inner qualityWhen defilements arise they cant overpower the mind because they cant reach in to touch it for the mind is protected by its own full measure of inner qualityI ask that we all aim at making this form of heightened consciousness arise within ourselves by being persistent and persevering in cherishing our own inner goodness  in the same way that when we have good food we make sure to chase away the flies so that we can enjoy it in good healthTo do this you have to be observant and make two kinds of effort the effort to abandon your defilements and the effort to develop your meditation theme which is the means for wiping out the mental HindrancesThere are five types of Hindrances sensual desire ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and uncertaintyAs for meditation there are two ways of practicing it  in series and in isolation  as Ill explain to you nowTo practice in series is to practice by the book contemplating the unattractiveness of the body for instance by following the lists of its parts without skipping over any of them or mixing them upWhichever theme you choose you have to understand how the topics are grouped and in what order so as to deal with them properlyThis kind of meditation can give great benefits but at the same time can cause great harmFor example if you contemplate the unattractiveness of the body it can lead to a sense of dispassion detachment and calm but there are times it can also get you into a state where you cant eat or sleep because everything starts seeming filthy and disgustingThis is one way it can be harmfulOr sometimes you may contemplate the body until a mental image arises but you get frightened and unnervedIn cases like this you have to try to be up on whats happening so that your theme will help you instead of harming youTo practice in isolation is to focus on a single refined theme that doesnt have a lot of different featuresIe you focus on being mindful of the inandout breath without letting your attention slip awayFocus on whatever kind of breathing feels soothing and the mind will settle downTry to make the breath more and more refined all the while keeping the mind gently with the breath in the same way that youd cup a bit of fluff in the palm of your handDo this until you feel that theres no in or out to the breath at allThe mind doesnt wander aroundIts quiet and still able to cut away thoughts of past and futureAt this point it becomes even more refined with no restlessness at allThe mind is stable and doesnt change along with its objectsIts firmly set and unwavering to the point where it becomes fixed and strongWhen you can develop your meditation to this point it will make the mind let go of its attachments and gain conviction and understanding into the truths of inconstancy stress and notselfYour doubts will fall away and you will know the way of the world and the way of Liberation without having to ask for confirmation from anyone elseWhen your knowledge is clear and free from uncertainty the mind is firm in its own strengthThis is when you become your own refuge  when your mind isnt affected by other people or objects and reaches the happiness and ease of heightened consciousnessThere are four kinds of truth in the body of every human being stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbandingThese truths are like gold No matter whether you try to make gold into a bracelet a ring an earring or whatever it stays gold in line with its natureGo ahead and try to change it but itll stay as it isThe same holds true with the nature of the bodyNo matter how wonderful you try to make it itll have to return to its normal natureItll have to have stress and pain their cause their disbanding and the path to their disbandingPeople who dont admit the normal nature of the body are said to be deluded those who realize its normal nature are said to knowWise people realize the principles of nature which is why they dont get caught up in a lot of fuss and confusionIn other words the body is like an object that originally weighs four kilogramsEven though we may find things to plaster onto it to make it heavier the plaster will eventually have to fall off and leave us with the original four kilogramsYou simply cant escape its original natureThe stress and pain that occur in line with the principles of nature arent actually all that troublesomeFor example pain and disease If we try to fight nature and not let there be disease or if we want it to disappear right away sometimes we make the disease even worseBut if we treat the disease without worrying about whether or not itll go away it will follow its natural course and go away at its own pace without too much trouble or suffering on our partThis is because the mind isnt struggling to fight nature and so the body is strong enough to contend with the diseaseSometimes if we have this attitude we can survive diseases that otherwise would kill usBut if the mind gets all upset and thrashes around wanting the disease to go away then sometimes a small disease can get so bad itll kill us  like a person with a scorpion sting he thinks is a cobra bite who gets so frightened and upset that the whole thing gets out of handSometimes we may come down with a disease that ought to finish us off but the power of the mind is so great that it fights off the pain and the disease goes awayThis is one of the principles of nature  but we shouldnt be complacent about itIf we get complacent then when the disease comes back itll be worse than before because the truth when you get right down to it is that no matter what you do these things cant escape their true natureWhen the bodys normal nature is to have pain and stress then try as you may to make the pain go away itll have to return to its true natureWhether or not you can cure it the truth is still the truthIn other words even when you cure the disease it comes backSuppose for instance that we feel ill take some medicine and feel betterWe think the disease has gone awayPeople of discernment though realize that it hasnt gone anywhereIts simply been suppressed for a while and then itll have to come back out againWe may think that weve made the disease go away but the disease is smarter than we areWhen it comes back again it wears a new costume like actors in a theater troupe If the public gets tired of one play they put on anotherOtherwise no one will spend money to watch them performIn other words the disease is smart enough to come from a new directionIf it put on the old play it wouldnt get any rewardAt first it came in your stomach so this time it comes in your legYou treat it until it goes away but then it comes back in a new play  in your eyeYou treat it in your eye until it goes away and then it comes back in your earSo you treat your earWherever it comes you keep treating it and your money keeps getting spentAs for the disease its glad youre fooledTheres only one of it but it comes in all sorts of disguisesAging illness and death are very smartThey can keep us tied on a short leash so that we can never get away from themPeople who dont train their minds to enter the Dhamma are sure to miss this point but those who train themselves to know the truth of the Dhamma will understand this principle of nature for what it isIf we dont realize the truth we lose in two waysOn the one side we lose in terms of the world We waste our money because we dont realize whats necessary and what isnt so we get worked up and upset all out of proportion to realityOn the other side we lose in terms of the Dhamma because our virtue concentration and meditation all sufferIllness makes us lose in these ways because we lack discernmentThis is why the Buddha taught us to use our eyesWe live in the world so we have to look out for our wellbeing in the world we live in the Dhamma so we have to look out for our wellbeing in the DhammaThe results will then develop of their own accordIf we use discernment to evaluate things until we know whats necessary and whats not the time wont be long before we prosper in terms both of the world and of the DhammaWe wont have to waste money and time and there wont be any obstacles to our practiceIn other words when you see that something is true dont try to get in its wayLet it follow its own courseEven though the mind doesnt age grow ill or die still the body has to age grow ill and dieThis is a part of its nature that you cant fightWhen it gets ill you take care of it enough to keep it goingYou wont be put to difficulties in terms of the world and your Dhamma practice wont sufferThe suffering we feel because of these things comes from the cause of stress delusion ignorance of the truthWhen the mind is deluded it doesnt know the cause of stress or the path to the disbanding of stressWhen it knows it doesnt get caught up in the natural pain and stress of the bodyMental suffering comes from the accumulation of defilement not from aging illness and deathOnce the stillness of the path arises within us then aging illness and death wont unsettle the mindSorrow despair distress and lamentation wont existThe mind will be separateWe can compare this to the water in the sea when its full of waves If we take a dipperful of sea water and set it down on the beach there wont be any waves in the dipper at allThe waves come from waveringIf we dont stir it up there wont be any wavesFor this reason we have to fix the mind so that its steady in its meditation without letting anything else seep inIt will then gain clarity the discernment that sees the truthThe mental state of the cause of stress leads us to pain the mental state of the path leads us to happinessIf you dont want stress or pain dont stay with the flow of their causeMental suffering is something unnatural to the mindIt comes from letting defilement seep inDiseases arise in the body but we let their effects spread into the mindWe have to learn which phenomena die and which dontIf our defilements are thick and tenacious therell be a lot of aging illness and deathIf our defilements are thin there wont be much aging illness and deathFor this reason we should build inner quality  awareness of the truth  within ourselvesHowever far the body is going to develop thats how far its going to have to deteriorate so dont be complacentThe important point is that you develop the mindIf the mind gets developed to a point of true maturity it won t regressIn other words if your concentration is strong and your discernment developed the defilements enwrapping your mind will fall away in the same way as when the flowers of a fruit tree reach full bloom the petals fall away leaving the fruitWhen the fruit develops till its fully ripe the skin and flesh fall away leaving just the seeds that contain all the makings for a new treeWhen the mind is fully developed then aging illness and death fall awayMental stress and suffering fall away leaving the mind in Right ConcentrationWhen Right Concentration is ripe youll know the location of what dies and what doesntIf you want to die then stay with what diesIf you dont want birth dont stay with what takes birthIf you dont want aging dont stay with what agesIf you dont want illness dont stay with what grows illIf you dont leave these things you have to live with themIf you leave them your mind wont age  it wont be able to age it wont grow ill  it wont be able to grow ill it wont die it wont be able to dieIf you can reach this point youre said to have respect for the truth  for the teachings of the BuddhaRespect for the truth isnt a matter of bowing down or paying homageIt means having a sense of time and place If something is possible you do itIf its not you dont  and you dont try to straighten it out eitherThe defilements of unawareness craving and attachment are things that connect us with suffering so dont let them entangle the mindUnawareness is the mental state that is deluded about the past present and futureTrue awareness knows whats past and lets it go knows whats future and lets it go knows whats present and doesnt fall for itIt can remove all attachmentsUnawareness knows but it falls for these things which is why it forms the fuel for sufferingTrue awareness knows what things are past present and future but it doesnt run out after themIt knows but it stays put  quiet and calmIt doesnt waver up or downIt doesnt seep out and nothing seeps inThe past the present and the future it knows in terms of the principles of its nature without having to reason or thinkPeople who have to reason and think are the ones who dont knowWith knowledge theres no thinking or reasoning and yet the mind knows thoroughlyThis is true awarenessAging illness and death all become an affair of releaseIn other words nothing is fashioned in the mind and when nothing is fashioned theres no aging illness or deathAs for attachment it catches us and ties us to a stake like a person being led to his execution with no chance to wiggle freeWere tied with a wire stretching out to the past and futureCraving inches along the wire toward us rolling his eyes and making horrible faces so that we worry about the past and futureBehind us he splits into three craving for sensuality craving for possibilities and craving for impossibilitiesIn front of us he splits into three  the same three sorts of craving  and in the present he splits into the same threeWith nine of them and only one of us how can we expect to be a match for themIn the end were no match at allIf we practice concentration and develop discernment though well be able to cut the wire of DeathWhen the mental state that forms the path arises our thoughts of past and future will all disbandThis is the disbanding of stressAttachment and craving wont exist  so where will stress and suffering have a chance to arisePeople who have defilements  even if they earn  a day  cant keep themselves from falling into hellBut people with no defilements even if they dont have anything at all are happy nonetheless  because the mind has enough to eat enough to drink enough of everythingIts not poorWhen we can think correctly in this way its called respect for the Dhamma  and it can make us happyRespect for the Dhamma means taking seriously all the things coming in and out the house of your mindThe door of the body You have to be careful to make sure that none of your actions stray into ways that are harmfulThe door of speech  the door of the mouth  is very largeThe tongue may be only a tiny piece of flesh but its very important because what we say today can keep echoing for an aeon after we dieWhen the body dies the time isnt long before theres nothing left of it and so its not as important as our speech for the stone engravings we make with our tongue last a long long timeFor this reason we should show a great deal of respect for our mouths by saying only things that are worthwhileThe door of the intellect We have to be careful with our thoughtsIf something is harmful to us when we think about it then we shouldnt think about itWe should think only about things that are beneficial and goodThese three doors are always receiving guests into the mind so we have to pay attention to see who is coming with good intentions and who is coming with badDont let down your guardWhoever comes with good intentions will bring you happiness and prosperityAs for troublemakers and thieves theyll rob you and kill you and cause you all sorts of troubleAs for your eyes ears and nose these are like three windows that you have to be careful about as wellYou have to know when to open and when to close themIf you arent discerning you may invite thieves into your house to rob and kill you plundering all the wealth your parents and teachers gave youThis is called being an ingrate  not knowing enough to care for the legacies that others have passed down to youThe legacies of your parents are your life health and strengthThe legacies of your teachers are all the things they taught to make you a good personIf you leave your thoughts words and deeds wide open so that evil can flow into you evil will keep pouring in wearing down the health and strength of your body and mindThis is called having no appreciation for the kindness of your parents and teachersSometimes we dont leave just the doors open  we leave the windows open as wellLizards snakes scorpions birds and bats will come in through the windows and take up residence in our houseAfter a while theyll lay claim to it as theirs  and we give in to themSo they leave their droppings all over and make a mess of the placeIf we dont exercise selfrestraint our body and mind are going to be ruined and this will destroy the wealth our parents and teachers went to such great trouble to give usSo if anyone tries to come into your house you have to grill them thoroughly to see what theyre up to and what theyre coming for  for good or for badLook them straight in the eyeIn other words you have to be mindful and reflecting in all your actionsAnything that isnt good you have to drive out of your activitiesEven if it would help you financially or make you popular and wellknown dont have anything to do with itThe same holds true with your speechIf something youre about to say will serve a good purpose then open your mouth and say itSay what should be said and dont say what shouldntIf something serves no real purpose then no matter how fantastic it may be dont say itYou have to know how to respond to all the activities that present themselves for you to doLet in the good ones and drive out the badAs for the mind you have to show restraint with that tooIf a thought will lead to good and happy results you should let yourself think itBut as for thoughts that will cause harm dont pull them inIf you go gobbling down everything you like youre going to dieIe your inner quality will deteriorateThe wealth your parents and teachers gave you will disappearAs for your senses  sight hearing smell taste feeling  you should show an interest in everything that will benefit youDrive out whats bad and bring in whats goodWhen you can do this its called showing respect for your parents your teachers and yourself as wellYour house will be clean and you can lounge around in comfort without having to worry about sitting on bird or batdroppingsBut if you dont exercise selfrestraint your actions will be defiled your words will be defiled so how can your mind live in comfortLike a filthy house No guests will want to go into it and even the owner isnt comfortable thereIf you keep your home clean and wellswept though itll be nice to live in and good people will be happy to come and visitWhen good people come and visit they wont cause you any harmIn other words the things that come in through the senses are like guests and they wont cause any harm to the mindThe mind will be good and obedient and will stay put where you tell it toBut even if your couches and chairs are made of marble If theyre dusty and dirty no guests will want to sit there and you yourself wont want to eitherSo if you keep your virtue bright and clear with regard to your senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation your mind will find it easy to attain concentrationThen even when defilements come to visit you from time to time they wont be able to do you any harm  because you have more than enough wealth to share with themIf thieves come you can throw them a hunk of diamond ore and theyll disappearIf aging illness and death come begging you can throw them another hunk and theyll stop pestering youIf your old kamma debts come at you when youre poor they wont get enough to satisfy them so theyll end up taking your lifeBut if they come at you when youre rich you simply share your merit  all the inner wealth youve accumulated  and theyll leave you aloneIf your goodness isnt yet full then evil will have an opening to flow in but if your hands feet eyes ears nose tongue body and mind are filled with goodness evil cant get into you so you can come out unscathedUltimately youll get so rich in inner quality that you can go beyond both good and evilThats when you can be truly happy and free from dangerSo I ask that you all remember this and treat your thoughts words and deeds in a way that shows respect for the Dhamma as Ive explained itYoull then meet with the happiness you hope forMy own motto is Make yourself as good as possible and everything else will have to follow along in being good If you dont neglect yourself for the sake of external things youll have to be goodSo you shouldnt neglect yourselfDevelop your inner worth to your own satisfactionThe world says Dont worry about whether youre good or bad as long as you have money This is just the opposite of the Dhamma which says Dont worry about whether youre rich or poor as long as youre a good personYour good qualities if you dont know how to use them can hurt you  like money which is something good but if you dont know how to spend it wisely can lead to your ruin or like a good sharp knife that if you dont know how to use it properly can do you harmSay for instance that you use the knife to kill someoneWhen youre caught youll have to be thrown in jail or executed which means that you used the knife to kill yourselfEach of us has four kinds of valuables the goodness of our deeds the goodness of our words the goodness of our manners and the goodness of our thoughtsFor this reason we have to care for these valuables as best we canMost of us have good things to our name but we hardly ever bring them out to put them to useInstead we like to bring out only our worst things to useIn other words we keep our goodness to ourselves and show only our worst side  like the plates cups and saucers in our homes The good ones we keep in the cupboard and only the chipped cracked and broken ones get put on the table because were afraid the good ones will breakAs for our best clothes we dont dare use them because were afraid theyll get old stained or tornSo we end up keeping them packed away until they get so moldy or motheaten that they cant be worn and have to become ragsAs a result we dont get any good out of our valuables in line with their worthIn the same way if we have any goodness within ourselves but dont put it to use it serves no purpose at all either for ourselves or for others  like a knife you keep packed away until it gets rusty If you finally bring it out to slice some food the rust will poison youIf you happen to cut your hand or foot with it you may come down with tetanus and dieAn intelligent person knows how to use both good and evil without causing harmArahants even know how to use their defilements so as to be of benefitWhen sages use common language it can serve a good purposeBut when fools use fine language it can be badIf they use bad language its even worseAn example of a person who used common language to serve a good purpose is Chao Khun UpaliOne time he was invited to give a sermon in the palace during the weekly funeral observances for a young prince whose death had caused a great deal of sorrow to the royal relativesOn the previous weeks some very highranking monks from Wat Debsirin had been invited to give sermons and they had all gone on about what a good man the prince had been and how sad it was that he had come to such an untimely end that prevented him from living on to do more good for the worldThis had caused the relatives to cry all the moreWhen it came Chao Khun Upalis turn to give a sermon though he didnt carry on in the same vein at allInstead he started out with the theme of mindfulness of the body describing the ugliness and foulness of the body which is full of repulsive and disgusting things snot spit dandruff sweat etc etcWhen the body dies theres not one good thing about it he said but people sit around weeping and wailing with tears streaming in tracks down their cheeks and mucus running out their noses and dribbling down to their chinsWith their faces all in a mess like this they dont look the least bit attractiveThis made the relatives who had been crying so embarrassed that they stopped crying immediately after which they expressed a great deal of admiration for Chao Khun Upali and his sermonThis is why its said that a person who uses a sharp tongue with skill is a great sageIf people are wise then no matter what they say it serves a good purpose because they have a sense of time place and the people theyre talking toIf something will serve a purpose even if it sounds unpleasant it should be saidIf it wont serve a purpose even if it sounds pleasant dont say itThe affairs of the religion are an affair of the heart Dont go looking for them in the dirt or the grass in temples or in monastery buildingsAlthough people may do good with their words and deeds its still an affair of the worldThe affairs of the religion are quiet and still without any fuss or botherTheyre aimed at a mind thats pure undefiled and brightWith goodness theres no need to do anything much at allSimply sit still and theres purityTake the example of the little novice with quiet and composed manners who as he was going out for alms one morning happened to enter the compound of a stingy moneylender and his wifeWhether or not they would put any food in his bowl he didnt show the least concern and he didnt open his mouth to say a wordWhen he left  his bowl still empty  he went calmly and unhurriedly along his wayThe moneylenders wife seeing him became curious and trailed him from a distance until he reached a point where he suddenly had to go to the bathroomCarefully he put down his bowl and using his foot cleared away the leaves to make a little depression in the dirt so that the urine wouldnt flow off anywhereThen after looking right left and all around him to make sure that there wouldnt be anyone walking past he squatted down to urinate unobtrusively in the proper wayWhen he had finished he used his foot to cover the spot with dirt and leaves as it had been before picked up his bowl and went calmly on his wayAs for the moneylenders wife who had been watching from a distance when she saw the manner in which the little novice was acting the thought occurred to her that he had probably buried something of valueSo she stealthily crept to the spot and using her hand dug the earth out of the hole buried by the novice and sniffed it to see what it was  and that was when she realized that it was urineThe little novice had taken care of his urine as if it were goldIf it were something more valuable than this she thought theres no doubt how well hed care for itWith manners like this we should adopt him as our foster sonHed be sure to look after our fortune to make sure that it wouldnt get wasted awayShe went home to tell her husband who impressed with her story had a servant go and invite the novice into their home so that they could inform him of their intentionsThe novice however declined their offer to make him their heir and taught them the Dhamma making them see the rewards of practicing generosity virtue and meditationThe moneylender and his wife were deeply moved overcame their stinginess and asked to take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha from that day onwardEventually they progressed in virtue meditation and right practice to the point where they both gained a glimpse of LiberationAfterwards they made a large donation to build a memorial over the spot where the novice had urinated as a reminder of the goodness that had grown within them from the puddle of urine the little novice had bestowed on them that dayThe affairs of the religion come down to sacittapariyodapanam  making the heart entirely clean clear and pureEtam buddhanasasanam  this is the heart of the Buddhas teachingsWhen the heart is a slave to its moods and defilements  greed aversion and delusion  its like being a slave to poor people troublemakers and crooks all of whom are people we shouldnt be enslaved toThe poor people here are greed hunger desire never having enoughThis feeling of not enough is what it means to be poorAs for aversion this doesnt necessarily mean outandout angerIt also means being grumpy or in a bad moodIf anyone annoys us or does something displeasing we get irritated and resentfulThis is called being a slave to troublemakersDelusion means seeing good as evil or evil as good right as wrong or wrong as right thinking youre good when youre evil or evil when youre goodThis is called being a slave to crooksBut if the mind becomes a slave to goodness this is called being a slave to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in which case were welloff because the Buddha is a kind personHe wont make us work all hours of the day and instead will allow us time to rest and find peace of mindBut still as long as were slaves we cant say that its really good because slaves have no freedomThey still have a price on their headsOnly when we gain release from slavery can we be fully free and happySo for this reason be diligent in your work Meditate a lot every dayYoull profit from it get to buy yourself out of slavery to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and gain LiberationDont let there be anyone at all over you giving you ordersThats when its really idealActually the Buddha never meant for us to take as our mainstay anything or anyone else aside from ourselvesEven when we take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha he never praised it as being really idealHe wanted us to take ourselves as our refugeThe self is its own mainstay We dont have to take our authority from anyone elseWe can depend on ourselves and govern ourselvesWere free and dont have to fall back on anyone elseWhen we can reach this state thats when well be released from slavery  and truly happyWhen were slaves to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha were told to be generous to observe the precepts and to practice meditation  all of which are things that will give rise to inner worth within usIn being generous we have to suffer and work because of the effort involved in finding wealth and material goods that we then give away as donationsIn observing the precepts we have to forgo the words and deeds we would ordinarily feel like saying or doingBoth of these activities are ways in which we benefit others more than ourselvesBut when we practice meditation we sacrifice inner objects  unskillful thoughts and mental states  and make our minds solid sovereign and pureThis is called paying homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha through the practice  which the Buddha praised as better than paying homage with material objectsEven though the Buddha would have benefited personally from the homage shown with material objects he never praised it as being better than homage shown through the practice which gives all its benefits to the person who pays the homageThis was the sort of homage that pleased the Buddha because the practice of training the heart to reach purity is the way by which a person can gain release from all suffering and stressThe Buddha had the kindness and compassion to want to help living beings gain freedom from all forms of suffering which is why he taught us to meditate so that we can free our hearts from their slavery to the defilements of the worldWhen we become slaves to the religion  to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  were still not released from suffering as long as our minds still have worries and concernsBeing a slave to our concerns is like being in debt to themWhen were in debt we have no real freedom in our heartsOnly when we can find the money to pay off our debts can we be happy free and at easeThe more we pay off our debts the more lighthearted well feelIn the same way if we can let go of our various worries and cares peace will arise in our heartsWell be released from our slavery to craving and defilement and will find happiness because peace is what brings release from sufferingThis is why the Buddha taught us to center our hearts in concentration so as to give rise to stillness peace and the inner wealth with which well be able to pay off all of our debtsThats when well attain happiness and easeAll our burdens and sufferings will fall away from our hearts and well enter full freedomThe mind has two kinds of thoughts skillful and unskillfulUnskillful thoughts are when the mind thinks in ways that are bad  with greed anger or delusion  about things either past or futureWhen this happens the mind is said to be a slave to defilementAs for skillful thoughts they deal in good and worthwhile ways with things future or pastWe have to try to let go of both these kinds of thoughts so that they dont exist in the mind if we want to gain release from our slaveryIf we want to buy ourselves completely out of slavery we have to farm our four acres so that they bear abundant fruitIn other words we have to develop the bodys four properties  earth water fire and wind  to a point of fullness by practicing meditation and using pure breath sensations to soothe and nourish every part of the bodyWhen the mind is pure and the body soothed its like our farms having plenty of rain and ground water to nourish our cropsIn other words our concentration is solid and enters the first stage of absorption with its five factors directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure and singlenessofpreoccupationDirected thought is like harrowing our soilEvaluation is like plowing and scattering the seedRapture is when our crops begin to bud pleasure is when their flowers bloom and singlenessofpreoccupation is when the fruits develop until theyre ripened and sweet  and at the same time their seeds contain all their ancestryWhat this means is that in each seed is another plant complete with branches flowers and leavesIf anyone plants the seed itll break out into another plant just like the one it came fromIn the same way when we center the mind to the point of absorption we can gain insight into our past  maybe even back through many lifetimes  good and bad happy and sadThis insight will cause us to feel dismay and dispassion and to lose taste for all states of being and birthThe mind will let go of its attachments to self to mental and physical phenomena and to all thoughts and concepts  past and future good and badItll enter a state of neutral equanimityIf we then work at developing it further well be able to cut away more and more of our states of being and birthWhen the mind gains changeoflineage knowledge which passes from the mundane over into the transcendent it will see what dies and what doesntIt will blossom as buddho  the awareness that knows no cessation  bright in its seclusion from thoughts and burdens from mental fermentations and preoccupationsWhen we practice in this way well come to the reality of birthlessness and deathlessness  the highest happiness  and on into LiberationThis is how we repay all our debts without the least bit remainingAs the texts say In release there is the knowledge ReleasedBirth is no more the holy life is fulfilled the task done For this reason we should be intent on cleansing and polishing our hearts so that they can gain release from their worries and preoccupations which are the source of pain and discontentPeace coolness and a bright happiness will arise within us in the same way as when we unshackle ourselves from our encumbering burdens and debtsWell be free  beyond the reach of all suffering and stressThis answer key will be an invaluable aid to the beginning student who is teaching him or herself Pali from AKWarders Introduction to PaliIn addition to giving detailed answers to the exercises Kelly includes the references to the sutta passages in the Digha Nikaya from which the exercises were drawnHe has also corrected a number of errors in Warders own referencesSutta references follow the PTS numbering conventionFor example Drefers to volume page of the PTS Pali edition of the Digha NikayaThe numbers that follow refer to the sutta paragraph and subparagraph numbersThis numbering scheme is used both in the PTS Pali edition and in Maurice Walshes The Long Discourses of the BuddhaComparisons between the two editions are thus easily madeEach line in the answers below has three parts the original text to be translated followed by a literal translation and concluding with a more idiomatic and fluent translationPali text is represented here using the Velthuis conventionTo wit long vowels are doubled and punctuation preceding a consonant is used to indicate a diacritic markFor example the cerebral t is written as t the palatal n is written as n and so onFor another take on the EnglishtoPali Exercises see the Pali Text Societys answers to EnglishtoPali Exercises  lthttpwwwpalitextcomsubpagesintropalihtmgt ed Access to InsightWe discuss the practice for the sake of reminding ourselves to keep getting better and better resultsOtherwise if we dont discuss these matters we tend to weaken in the face of thought fabrications as were so accustomed to doingTraining the mind to be quiet and still is something that requires a lot of circumspection because the mind is so unruly and wayward by its basic natureIt wont easily stay under the supervision of mindfulness and discernmentThis is why we have to develop the knowledge that will keep it under control in an appropriate wayTo get the mind to stay under the control of mindfulness and discernment we have to stop and watch it stop and know itThe ways it gets fashioned the ways it can be sensed in and of itself these things arent easy to know because it likes to travel around to know other things in line with whatever its thoughts may fabricateIf we want to sense it in and of itself we have to subject it to a lot of trainingTo be able to supervise it or to have it stay more and more under the control of mindfulness and discernment all of this takes timeAnd it requires that you use your powers of observation and evaluationIf you dont keep on observing and evaluating as part of your practice the mind will slip off quickly and easily to travel along with its preoccupationsThe way it keeps traveling brings you nothing but suffering and stressYou dont gain anything good out of it at allThe mind simply goes out looking for all kinds of troubleRegardless of whether you like things or dislike them you grasp onto them and turn them into sufferingThe eyes ears and so forth are the bridges out which the mind goes traveling the moment you see sights or hear soundsHow can you exercise care and restraint over the sensory doors so that they lie under the power of your mindfulnessThis is something you have to watch and observe to see the results that come from looking and listening in a mindful wayIf you dont use your powers of observation and evaluation you tend to latch onto the sensations of what youve seen or heardThen you label them fabricate things out of them and keep on latching onto things every step of the way until you have the mind all in a turmoil through the power of its loves and hatredsObserve the sensations that arise at each of the sense doors to see that theyre just sensations happening pure and simpleIts not the case that were sensing these thingsFor instance the eye sees formsIts not us thats seeing themTheres simply the seeing of forms by means of eyeconsciousness pure and simpleAt that point theres not yet any labeling of the sight as good or badTheres not yet any thought fabrication following on the sensation of contactWe simply watch the simple sensation and the stop right there to see the characteristics of the sensation as it passes away or as its replaced by a new sensationWe keep watching the passing away of sensations keep watching until we see that this is simply the nature of the eyes and ears to register sensationsThat way we dont latch onto them to the point where we give rise to suffering and stress the way we used toIf we dont watch carefully to see this natural arising and passing away we tend to mix everything upFor instance when the eye sees we assume that we seeThe things we see either please us or dont they give pleasure or pain and we latch onto them to the point where they defile the mindIf youre not careful and observant everything coming in through the sense doors develops into mental fabrication and has an affect on the mindThis gives rise to suffering as youre not aware of how these things arise stay and pass away every time that the eye sees sights the ear hears sounds and so forth under the power of your attachmentsHow can we begin to unravel ourselves from these things so that we dont stay attachedHow should we be mindful in our looking and listeningWe have to keep observing the mind to see that when theres mindfulness at the moment of seeing a sight the mind can stay neutralIt doesnt have to be pleased or displeasedIf were mindful when the ear hears sounds we can make sure that the mind isnt pleased or displeased with the soundsThe same holds true with smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasWe have to focus on the mind which is the factor in charge the stem pointIf we exercise restraint over the mind then that in and of itself keeps all the sense doors restrainedThe eye will be restrained in seeing sights involvement in seeing will get shorterWhen the ear hears sounds the mind can stay neutral as it focuses on being alert to the arising and passing away of sounds or on the sensation of sound as it constantly comes and goesThis all depends on which approach helps you stay observant of sensory contactOtherwise if you dont develop these approaches everything gets thrown into confusionThe mind has nothing but attachments and feelings of self giving rise to all sorts of suffering simply from its lack of restraintThis is something weve all experiencedThe virtue of restraining the senses is a very refined level of virtue  and a very useful one tooIf you develop this level of virtue the other levels become more and more pureIf you dont exercise restraint over the eyes ears nose etc then your five eight or ten precepts cant stay firmTheyre sure to become easily soiledIf the eye which is the bridge isnt restrained then it focuses its attention outsideAnd when this happens overstepping your precepts becomes the easiest thing in the worldIf you allow the mind to get accustomed to running out after outside preoccupations everything gets thrown into a turmoilThe turmoil starts there in the mind and then it spreads out to your words and deeds so that you speak and act in wrong waysIf we try to observe the precepts without restraining the senses our precepts cant become pureThis is because we arent careful about how we look and listen so we arent able to see how desire craving and defilement arise at the moment the eye sees sights or the ear hears soundsThis lack of restraint is what puts holes in our preceptsWe create issues outside and this soils our words and deedsFor this reason the virtue of restraining the senses is a level of virtue that closes off the leaks in the mindIf you develop this level of virtue your words and deeds will be beautiful and admirable  just like monks who are strict in their restraint of the senses who dont gaze far away who dont look at things that are enemies to the mind who arent addicted to the flavors of contact by means of the eye ear nose tongue body and mind who are observant to see the passing away of physical and mental phenomena so that their minds arent thrown into a turmoil because of their likes and dislikesFor the most part we arent interested in exercising restraint and so we fall victim to sensual pleasuresWe let ourselves get pleased and displeased with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations and so the mind gets defiled as it deludedly falls for the savor of these thingsNo matter how deluded we get we dont realize whats happening because the savor of these pleasures makes us keep on wanting moreOur discernment hasnt yet seen the drawbacks of these thingsTo let go of anything you first have to see its drawbacksIf you simply tell yourself to let go let go let go you cant really let goYou have to see the drawbacks of the things youre holding onto and then youll let go automatically  as when you grab hold of fire and realize how hot it is youll automatically let go and never dare touch it againWe havent yet realized the heat of sensual passions which is why we still like them so muchEven though every attachment is stressful by its very nature we see it as goodNo matter what comes our way we keep latching onThis has become our second natureWere not aware that were grabbing hold of fire and so we keep wanting more of itThis is why the mind never wearies of its clinging attachmentsWhen we cant see the drawbacks of sensual passions theres no way we can see the drawbacks of more subtle things that lie deeper still like our sense of selfWere still lured by external baits by way of the eye and ear and yet were not aware of whats happeningThese things are like sugar coating a pill of poison and so we still find them deliciousWe swallow the poison so that it nourishes cravings and defilements that are so painful and seering and yet we dont see them as painfulWere still relishing the sugarWe want moreThis is because the mind has never grown weary of sensuality hasnt developed any sense of renunciation any desire to be free from sensualityIt still likes to lie soaking in sensualityIf it gains sensual pleasure its satisfiedIf it doesnt it gets angry and resentfulEven these external lures still delude usIf we get what we want were happyIf we dont were thrown into a turmoilIf we dont get enough of these lures we go around complaining that other people dont sympathize with us dont care about usWe keep on wanting to get these things with no sense of enough  like worms that feel such relish for foul and smelly things and have no sense of disgustThe savor of sensual passion excites the hearts of all beings so that they want moreThe noble ones feel disgust for itThey dont want to go near itBut ordinary beings want to go right for it and eat their fillThe Buddha compared people like this to worms that relish filth or to a snake thats fallen into a cesspool so covered with excrement that you cant find any part to grab hold of to get it out without soiling yourselfThe Buddha liked to make comparisons like this so that well come to our sensesThe Buddha had a whole long list of comparisons for the drawbacks of sensual pleasuresIf you want to know them go look in a good anthology from the suttasSome of the Buddhas teachings are attractive and appealing but others are really castigatingWe meditators should take an interest in reading his teachings and reflecting on them so that we dont misunderstand thingsThe type of Dhamma that pokes at our sore points is something that goes against the grain with all of usThis is because we dont like criticismWe dont like being reprimandedWe want nothing but praise and admiration to the point where we swell up with airBut people with real mindfulness and discernment dont want any of thatThey want to hear helpful criticism helpful reprimandsThis is what it means to have discernment and intelligenceYou know how to take criticism in an intelligent wayWhen you read the Buddhas teachings you should reflect on themThe Buddha castigates his disciples more than he praises themIs our attitude in line with hisWe like to hear praiseIf people criticize us we get angry and accuse them of having bad motivesThis is really stupid and sadWe get teachings that are meant to help us but we dont use them to reflect on ourselvesInstead we criticize the criticism as being too harshAs a result we dont get any use out of wellmeaning criticismsAs for people with mindfulness and discernment they feel just the other way aroundThey realize that they benefit from their teachers criticisms more than from anything elseChildren have no appreciation for the teachers who have been strict with them because they hate strict treatmentBut as they become more intelligent and mature they begin to realize that strict treatment can be an excellent way of building character of making them come to their sensesThe old saying If you love your ox you cant let it roam wild if you love your child you have to spank it reminds us not to cater to our childrens whims or else theyll become careless and irresponsibleIf were strict with them and scold them when they do wrong theyll develop a greater and greater sense of responsibilityThis is why people who are intelligent and discerning prefer criticism to praiseStupid people prefer praise to criticismAs soon as you criticize them they get so angryThey dont realize the great value of criticismSuppose someone criticizes us when we do wrong the wrong were doing is unskillful and causes sufferingIf were warned against doing something unskillful thats greatly to our benefitIts as if that person has pulled us out of suffering out of a fire out of hellBut stupid people will attack the person who gives them the wellintentioned warningIf they were intelligent theyd have to thank the person who gave them the warning for that person has helped them come to their sensesTheyd have to take that warning to heart to the point where they couldnt forget itIf you dont feel this way about criticism youll never be able to outgrow your old habitsYoull have to stick stubbornly to your old ways more concerned with winning out over others than with taming your own rebelliousnessIf youre the sort of person who cant tame your own rebelliousness then the more youre taught the more you go out of control  and the more you simply end up burning yourselfYou take valuable teachings and use them to harm yourselfThis is why we have to listen well to criticism so that we can get the most benefit from itThink of how harmful defilement craving and attachment can beWere so full of our sense of selfWhat can we do to weaken itWe have to focus on our own minds in a way that gives results that doesnt defile it that doesnt stir it up into a turmoilWe have to use our own intelligence  our own mindfulness and discernment  to keep looking inward at all timesNo one else can do our looking for usWere the ones who have to know ourselves in an allaround wayThis practice of ridding ourselves of defilements think of it as digging into a tall termites nest to get at a vicious animal  like a snake  hiding insideYou have to use the sharpest possible picks and shovels to reach the snakeIn the same way our sense of self lies deepWe have to use mindfulness and discernment which are like the sharpest picks and shovels to penetrate into itWherever theres a sense of self try digging on in to catch itTurn it over and look at its face to see where exactly its your selfTry examining your body or feeling perception thought fabrications and consciousness  all the things youre so attached to that youre not willing to let them goHow can you examine them so that youll know themOnly through seeing the inconstancy of form feeling perception thought fabrications and consciousnessIf you dont know in this way theres no way you can let go of these things for youll keep on seeing them in the wrong way thinking that theyre constant easeful and selfThis is an important pointDont pass over it casuallyThe affairs of inconstancy stress and notselfness are deep and refinedAs we start from the outer levels and work into the inner levels we have to contemplate in a way that grows continually deeper and deeper more and more refinedDont get by with knowing inconstancy stress and notselfness only on a superficial level for thatll have no impact on the roots of your delusion and foolishnessObserve to see which ways of contemplating get results in producing knowledge of inconstancy stress and notselfness with genuine mindfulness and discernmentIf you really know with mindfulness and discernment the mind has to develop a sense of samvega of dismay and dispassion for the inconstancy stressfulness and notselfness of physical and mental phenomena of the five aggregates  in other words of our body and mindItll then unravel its attachmentsBut if our knowledge isnt yet true well keep on holding on blindly trying to make these things constant easeful and selfI ask that all of you contemplate so you can come to really know and clearly see these matters for what they areThe whole reason were trying to quiet our minds or practice meditation is nothing other than this to see the inconstancy stress and notselfness of the aggregates the properties the sense mediaWere not practicing simply for the ease and pleasure that come when the mind is stillWe have to observe and evaluate things so as to see them clearly in a way that allows us to let them goThe mind will then be empty of any sense of selfEven if you can experience this emptiness only momentarily its still very worthwhileKeep your awareness of that experience in mind as capital for giving you continued strength in the practice  better than wandering off to be aware of other thingsWhen we keep on training the mind day after day as were doing here we find that when we go to sleep and then wake up in the morning our awareness has become continuous  more and more continuous to the point where the mind doesnt go wandering off the way it used toIt stays more and more with the body in the presentWhatever arises we can investigate it to see if any part of it is constant or stableRegardless of whether its a physical phenomenon or a mental phenomenon is there any part of it thats constant or stableWhen we see that theres nothing constant or stable to these things that they keep on changing relentlessly well realize that this inconstancy is inherently stressful in and of itself  and that within this inconstancy thats inherently stressful theres no self anywhere at allYou have to investigate to see things clearly in this wayIts not the case that inconstancy is one thing stress another and notself still anotherThats not the case at allYou have to investigate to see clearly that theyre all aspects of the same thingIf you dont see clearly in this way with your own mindfulness and discernment your knowledge isnt trueEven though you may be able to explain things correctly the mind still doesnt knowIt keeps its eyes closed and stays in the darkWhen your knowledge is true there has to be a sense of dispassion of letting goThe mind will be able to abandon its attachmentsThen watch the mind at that momentYoull see that its emptyLook at your mind right nowWhen its at a state of normalcy free from any turmoil its empty on one levelWhen you turn to observe the mind at a state of normalcy when its not latching onto anything its free from any sense of selfTheres simply awareness pure and simple without any labels of me or mine Notice how the mind is empty right now because it doesnt have any attachments for me or mineIf you dont understand this point you wont be able to find the deeper levels of emptiness  or you may go and make it empty in other ways all of which are off the markThe emptiness were looking for comes from letting things go through seeing their inconstancy stressfulness and notselfnessAnd then you have to keep hammering away at this point over and over againTheres no need to pay attention to any other matters for the more things you take on the more the mind is thrown into a turmoilFocus on one matter one thing and keep observing it until its clear to the mindThe moment its clear to the mind is when the mind will be able to loosen its gripItll be able to let goTo be emptyEven just this is enough for extinguishing the suffering and stress of your daytoday lifeYou dont have to go reading or studying a lot of thingsSimply study the mind from this angle  its arising remaining and passing awayObserve this until its clear and the mind will become firmly centered in this awarenessWhen its aware it lets goItll then be emptySo this all boils down to one point Try to be intent on observing and evaluating the mind carefully and it will become empty in the easiest possible wayI hope that this simple point will help you see the truths within your own mind and that youll reap benefits fully correct with each and every momentIts important that we discuss the steps of the practice in training the mind for the mind has all sorts of deceptions by which it fools itselfIf you arent skillful in investigating and seeing through them they are very difficult to overcome even if youre continually mindful to keep watch over the mindYou have to make an effort to focus on contemplating these things at all timesMindfulness on its own wont be able to give rise to any real knowledgeAt best it can give you only a little protection against the effects of sensory contactIf you dont make a focused contemplation the mind wont be able to give rise to any knowledge within itself at allThis is why you have to train yourself to be constantly aware all aroundWhen you come to know anything for what it really is theres nothing but letting go letting goOn the beginning level this means the mind wont give rise to any unwise or unprofitable thoughtsIt will simply stop to watch stop to know within itself at all timesIf theres anything you have to think about keep your thoughts on the themes of inconstancy stress and notselfYou have to keep the mind thinking and labeling solely in reference to these sorts of themes for if your thinking and labeling are right youll come to see things rightlyIf you go the opposite way youll have to think wrongly and label things wrongly and that means youll have to see things wrongly as wellThis is what keeps the mind completely hidden from itselfNow when thoughts or labels arise in the mind then if you focus on watching them closely youll see that theyre sensations  sensations of arising and disbanding changeable unreliable and illusoryIf you dont make an effort to keep a focused watch on them youll fall for the deceptions of thoughtformationIn other words the mind gives rise to memories of the past and fashions issues dealing with the past but if youre aware of whats going on in time youll see that theyre all illusoryTheres no real truth to them at allEven the meanings the mind gives to good and bad sensory contacts at the moment they occur If you carefully observe and contemplate youll see that theyre all deceptiveTheres no real truth to themBut ignorance and delusion latch onto them all and this drives the mind around in circlesIn other words it doesnt know whats what  how these things arise persist and disband  so it latches onto them and gets itself deceived on many many levelsIf you dont stop to focus and watch theres no way you can see through these things at allBut if the mind keeps its balance or stops to watch and know within itself it can come to realize these things for what they areWhen it realizes them it can let them go automatically without being attached to anythingThis is the knowledge that comes with true mindfulness and discernment It knows and lets goIt doesnt clingNo matter what appears  good or bad pleasure or pain  when the mind knows it doesnt clingWhen it doesnt cling theres no stress or sufferingYou have to keep hammering away at this point When it doesnt cling the mind can stay at normalcyEmptyUndisturbedQuiet and stillBut if it doesnt read itself in this way doesnt know itself in this way it will fall for the deceits of defilement and cravingIt will fashion up all sorts of complex and complicated things that it itself will have a hard time seeing through for theyll have their ways of playing up to the mind to keep it attached to them all of which is simply a matter of the minds falling for the deceits of the defilements and cravings within itselfThe fact that it isnt acquainted with itself  doesnt know how mental states arise and disband and take on objects  means that it loses itself in its many many attachmentsTheres nothing as hard to keep watch of as the mind because its so accustomed to wrong views and wrong opinionsThis is what keeps it hidden from itselfBut thanks to the teachings of the Buddha we can gain knowledge into the mind or into consciousness with its many layers and intricacies that when you look into it deeply youll find to be empty  empty of any meaning in and of itselfThis is an emptiness that can appear clearly within consciousnessEven though its hidden and profound we can see into it by looking inward in a way thats quiet and stillThe mind stops to watch to know within itselfAs for sensory contacts  sights sounds smells tastes and that sort of thing  it isnt interested because its intent on looking into consciousness pure and simple to see what arises in there and how it generates issuesSensations thoughts labels for pleasure and pain and so forth are all natural phenomena that change as soon as theyre sensed  and theyre very refinedIf you view them as being about this or that matter you wont be able to know them for what they areThe more intricate the meanings you give them the more lost you become  lost in the whorls of the cycle of rebirthThe cycle of rebirth and the processes of thoughtformation are one and the same thingAs a result we whirl around and around lost in many many levels of thoughtformation not just oneThe knowledge that would read the heart cant break through to know for it whirls around and around in these very same thoughtformations giving them meanings in terms of this or that and then latching onto themIf it labels them as good it latches onto them as goodIf it labels them as bad it latches onto them as badThis is why the mind stays entirely in the whorls of the cycle of rebirth the cycle of thoughtformationFor this reason to see these things clearly requires the effort to stop and watch to stop and know in an appropriate way in a way thats just rightAt the same time you have to use your powers of observationThats what will enable you to read your own consciousness in a special wayOtherwise if you latch onto the issues of thoughts and labels theyll keep you spinning aroundSo you have to stop and watch stop and know clearly by focusing down  focusing down on the consciousness in chargeThat way your knowledge will become skillfulUltimately youll see that theres nothing at all  just the arising and disbanding occurring every moment in emptinessIf theres no attachment there are no issuesTheres simply the natural phenomenon of arising and disbandingBut because we dont see things simply as natural phenomena we see them as being true and latch onto them as our self good bad and all sorts of other complicated thingsThis keeps us spinning around without knowing how to find a way out what to let go of  we dont knowWhen we dont know were like a person who wanders into a jungle and doesnt know the way out doesnt know what to doActually what we have to let go of lies right smack in front of us where the mind fashions things and gives them meanings so that it doesnt know the characteristics of arising and disbanding pure and simpleIf you can simply keep watching and knowing without any need for meanings thoughts imaginings  simply watching the process of these things in and of itself  there wont be any issuesTheres just the phenomenon of the present arising persisting disbanding arising persisting disbanding Theres no special trick to this but you have to stop and watch stop and know within yourself every momentDont let your awareness stream away from awareness to outside preoccupationsGather it in so it can know itself clearly  that theres nothing in there worth latching ontoIts all a bunch of deceitsTo know just this much is very useful for seeing the truth inside yourselfYoull see that consciousness is empty of any selfWhen you look at physical phenomena youll see them as elements as empty of any selfYoull see mental phenomena as empty of any self as elements of consciousness  and that if theres no attachment no latching on theres no suffering or stressSo even if theres thinking going on in the mind simply watch it simply let it go and its cycling will slow downFewer and fewer thoughtformations will occurEven if the mind doesnt stop completely it will form fewer and fewer thoughtsYoull be able to stop to watch stop to know more and moreAnd this way youll come to see the tricks and deceits of thoughtformation mental labels pleasure and pain and so onYoull be able to know that theres really nothing inside  that the reason you were deluded into latching onto things was because of ignorance and that you made yourself suffer right there in that very ignoranceSo you have to focus down on one point one thingFocusing on many things wont doKeep mindfulness in place stopping knowing seeingDont let it run out after thoughts and labelsBut knowing in this way requires that you make the effort to stay focused  focused on seeing clearly not just on making the mind stillFocus on seeing clearlyLook on in for the sake of seeing clearly and contemplate how to let goThe mind will become empty in line with its nature in a way that youll know exclusively withinWhat can we do to see the aggregates  this mass of suffering and stress  clearly in a way that we can cut attachment for them out of the mindWhy is it that people studying to be doctors can know everything in the body  intestines liver kidneys and all  down to the details and yet dont develop any dispassion or disenchantment for it  whyWhy is it that undertakers can spend their time with countless corpses and yet not gain any insight at allThis shows that this sort of insight is hard to attainIf theres no mindfulness and discernment to see things clearly for what they are knowledge is simply a passing fancyIt doesnt sink inThe mind keeps latching onto its attachmentsBut if the mind can gain true insight to the point where it can relinquish its attachments it can gain the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaThis shows that theres a difference in the knowingIts not that we have to know all the details like modernday surgeonsAll we have to know is that the body is composed of the four physical elements plus the elements of space and consciousnessIf we really know just this much weve reached the paths and their fruitions while those who know all the details to the point where they can perform surgery dont reach any transcendent attainments at allSo lets analyze the body into its elements so as to know them thoroughlyIf we do then when there are changes in the body and mind there wont be too much clingingIf we dont our attachments will be fixed and strong and will lead to further states of being and birth in the futureNow that we have the opportunity we should contemplate the body and take it apart for a good look so as to get down to the detailsTake the five basic meditation objects  hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin  and look at them carefully one at a timeYou dont have to take on all five you knowFocus on the hair of the head to see that it belongs to the earth element to see that its roots are soaked in blood and lymph under the skinIts unattractive in terms of its color its smell and where it dwellsIf you analyze and contemplate these things you wont be deluded into regarding them as your hair your nails your teeth your skinAll of these parts are composed of the earth element mixed in with water wind and fireIf they were purely earth they wouldnt last because every part of the body has to be composed of all four elements for it to be a bodyAnd then theres a mental phenomenon the mind in chargeThese are things that follow in line with nature in every way  the arising changing and disbanding of physical and mental phenomena  but we latch onto them seeing the body as ours the mental phenomena as us Its all us and oursIf we dont contemplate to see these things for what they are well do nothing but cling to themThis is what meditation is seeing things clearly for what they areIts not a matter of switching from topic to topic for that would simply ensure that you wouldnt know a thingBut our inner character under the sway of ignorance and delusion doesnt like examining itself repeatedlyIt keeps finding other issues to get in the way so that we think constantly about other thingsThis is why we stay so ignorant and foolishThen why is it that we can know other thingsBecause they fall in line with what craving wantsTo see things clearly for what they are would be to abandon craving so it finds ways of keeping things hiddenIt keeps changing bringing in new things all the time keeping us fooled all the time so that we study and think about nothing but matters that add to the minds suffering and stressThats all that craving wantsAs for the kind of study that would end the stress and suffering in the mind its always getting in the wayThis is why the mind is always wanting to shift to new things to know new things to fall forAnd this is why its always becoming attachedSo when it doesnt really know itself you have to make a real effort to see the truth that the things within it arent you or yoursDont let the mind stop short of this knowledge Make this a law within yourselfIf the mind doesnt know the truths of inconstancy stress and notself within itself it wont gain release from sufferingIts knowledge will simply be worldly knowledge it will follow a worldly pathIt wont reach the paths and fruition leading to nibbanaSo this is where the worldly and the transcendent part waysIf you comprehend inconstancy stress and notself to the ultimate degree thats the transcendentIf you dont get down to their details youre still on the worldly levelThe Buddha has many teachings but this is what they all come down toThe important principles of the practice  the four foundations of mindfulness the four Noble Truths  all come down to these characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfnessIf you try to learn too many principles youll end up not getting any clear knowledge of the truth as it isIf you focus on knowing just a little youll end up with more true insight than if you try knowing a lot of thingsIts through wanting to know a lot of things that we end up deludedWe wander around in our deluded knowledge thinking and labeling things but knowledge thats focused and specific when it really knows is absoluteIt keeps hammering away at one pointTheres no need to know a lot of things for when you really know one thing everything converges right thereIn practicing the Dhamma if you dont foster a balance between concentration and discernment youll end up going wild in your thinkingIf theres too much work at discernment youll go wild in your thinkingIf theres too much concentration it just stays still and undisturbed without coming to any knowledge eitherSo you have to keep them in balanceStillness has to be paired with discernmentDont let there be too much of one or the otherTry to get them just rightThats when youll be able to see things clearly all the way throughOtherwise youll stay as deluded as everYou may want to gain discernment into too many things  and as a result your thinking goes wildThe mind goes out of controlSome people keep wondering why discernment never arises in their practice but when it does arise they really go off on a tangentTheir thinking goes wild all out of boundsSo when you practice you have to observe in your meditation how you can make the mind stillOnce it does grow still it tends to get stuck thereOr it may grow empty without any knowledge of anything quiet disengaged at ease for a while but without any discernment to accompany itBut if you can get discernment to accompany your concentration thats when youll really benefitYoull see things all the way through and be able to let them goIf youre too heavy on the side of either discernment or stillness you cant let goThe mind may come to know this or that but it latches onto its knowledgeThen it knows still other things and latches onto them tooOr else it simply stays perfectly quiet and latches onto thatIts not easy to keep your practice on the Middle WayIf you dont use your powers of observation its especially hardThe mind will keep falling for things sometimes right sometimes wrong because it doesnt observe whats going onThis isnt the path to letting goIts a path thats stuck caught up on thingsIf you dont know what its stuck and caught up on youll remain foolish and deludedSo you have to make an effort at focused contemplation until you see clearly into inconstancy stress and notselfThis without a doubt is what will stop every moment of suffering and stressThe sensations of the mind are subtle and very volatileSometimes passion or irritation can arise completely independent of sensory contact simply in line with the force of our characterFor instance there are times when the mind is perfectly normal and all of a sudden theres irritation  or the desire to form thoughts and get engrossed in feelings of pain pleasure or equanimityWe have to contemplate these three kinds of feeling to see that theyre inconstant and always changing and to see that they are all stressful so that the mind wont go and get engrossed in themThis business of getting engrossed is very subtle and hard to detectIt keeps us from knowing whats what because its delusion pure and simpleBeing engrossed in feelings of pleasure is something relatively easy to detect but being engrossed in feelings of equanimity Thats hard to notice because the mind is at equanimity in an oblivious wayThis oblivious equanimity keeps us from seeing anything clearlySo you have to focus on seeing feelings simply as feelings and pull the mind out of its state of being engrossed with equanimityWhen theres a feeling of equanimity as the mind gathers and settles down when its not scattered around use that feeling of equanimity in concentration as the basis for probing in to see inconstancy stress and notself  for this equanimity in concentration at the fourth level of absorption is the basis for liberating insightSimply make sure that you dont get attached to the absorptionIf you get the mind to grow still in equanimity without focusing on gaining insight its simply a temporary state of concentrationSo you have to focus on gaining clear insight either into inconstancy into stress or into notselfnessThats when youll be able to uproot your attachmentsIf the mind gets into a state of oblivious equanimity its still carrying fuel inside itThen as soon as theres sensory contact it flares up into attachmentSo we have to follow the principles the Buddha laid down Focus the mind into a state of absorption and then focus on gaining clear insight into the three characteristicsThe proper way to practice is not to let yourself get stuck on this level or that  and no matter what insights you may gain dont go thinking that youve gained AwakeningKeep lookingKeep focusing in to see if there are any further changes in the mind and when there are see the stress in those changes the notselfness of those changesIf you can know in this way the mind will rise above feeling no longer entangled in this level or that level  all of which are simply matters of speculationThe important thing is that you try to see clearlyEven when the mind is concocting all sorts of objects in a real turmoil focus on seeing all of its objects as illusoryThen stay still to watch their disbandingGet so that its clear to you that theres really nothing to themThey all disbandAll that remains is the empty mind  the mind maintaining its balance in normalcy  and then focus in on examining thatThere are many levels to this process of examining the diseases in the mind not just oneEven though you may come up with genuine insights every now and then dont just stop there  and dont get excited about the fact that youve come to see things you never saw beforeJust keep contemplating the theme of inconstancy in everything without latching on and then youll come to even more penetrating insightsSo focus on in until the mind stops until it reaches the stage of absorption called purity of mindfulness and equanimitySee what pure mindfulness is likeAs for the feeling of equanimity thats an affair of concentrationIts what the mindfulness depends on so that it too can reach equanimityThis is the stage where we gather the strength of our awareness in order to come in and know the mindGet the mind centered at equanimity and then probe in to contemplateThats when youll be able to seeAn important but subtle point is that even though we practice we continue to fall for pleasant feelings because feelings are illusory on many levelsWe dont realize that theyre changeable and unreliableInstead of offering pleasure they offer us nothing but stress  yet were still addicted to themThis business of feeling is thus a very subtle matterPlease try to contemplate it carefully  this business of latching onto feelings of pleasure pain or equanimityYou have to contemplate so as to see it clearlyAnd you have to experiment more than you may want to with painWhen there are feelings of physical pain or mental distress the mind will struggle because it doesnt like painBut when pain turns to pleasure the mind likes it and is content with it so it keeps on playing with feeling even though as weve already said feeling is inconstant stressful and not really oursBut the mind doesnt see thisAll it sees are feelings of pleasure and it wants themTry looking into how feeling gives rise to cravingIts because we want pleasant feeling that craving whispers  whispers right there at the feelingIf you observe carefully youll see that this is very important for this is where the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana are attained right here at feeling and cravingIf we can extinguish the craving in feeling thats nibbanaIn the Solasa Pañha the Buddha said that defilement is like a wide and deep flood but he then went on to summarize the practice to cross it simply as abandoning craving in every actionNow right here at feeling is where we can practice to abandon craving for the way we relish the flavor of feeling has many ramificationsThis is where many of us get deceived because we dont see feeling as inconstantWe want it to be constantWe want pleasant feelings to be constantAs for pain we dont want it to be constant but no matter how much we try to push it away we still latch onto itThis is why we have to focus on feeling so that we can abandon craving right there in the feelingIf you dont focus here the other paths you may follow will simply proliferateSo bring the practice close to homeWhen the mind changes or when it gains a sense of stillness or calm that would rank as a feeling of pleasure or equanimity try to see in what ways the pleasure or equanimity is inconstant that its not you or yoursWhen you can do this youll stop relishing that particular feelingYou can stop right there right where the mind relishes the flavor of feeling and gives rise to cravingThis is why the mind has to be fully aware of itself  all around at all times  in its focused contemplation to see feeling as empty of selfThis business of liking and disliking feelings is a disease hard to detect because our intoxication with feelings is so very strongEven with the sensations of peace and emptiness in the mind were still infatuated with feelingFeelings on the crude level  the violent and stressful ones that come with defilement  are easy to detectBut when the mind grows still  steady cool bright and so on  were still addicted to feelingWe want these feelings of pleasure or equanimityWe enjoy themEven on the level of firm concentration or meditative absorption theres attachment to the feelingThis is the subtle magnetic pull of craving which paints and plasters things overThis painting and plastering is hard to detect because craving is always whispering inside us I want nothing but pleasant feelings This is very important for this virus of craving is what makes us continue to be rebornSo explore to see how craving paints and plasters things how it causes desires to form  the desires to get this or take that  and what sort of flavor it has that makes you so addicted to it that makes it hard for you to pull awayYou have to contemplate to see how craving fastens the mind so firmly to feelings that you never weary of sensuality or of pleasant feelings no matter what the levelIf you dont contemplate so as to see clearly that the mind is stuck right here at feeling and craving it will keep you from gaining releaseWere stuck on feeling like a monkey stuck in a tar trapThey take a glob of tar and put it where a monkey will get its hand stuck in it and in trying to pull free the monkey gets its other hand both feet and finally its mouth stuck tooConsider this Whatever we do we end up stuck right here at feeling and cravingWe cant separate them outWe cant wash them offIf we dont grow weary of craving were like the monkey stuck in the glob of tar getting ourselves more and more trapped all the timeSo if were intent on freeing ourselves in the footsteps of the arahants we have to focus specifically on feeling until we can succeed at freeing ourselves from itEven with painful feelings we have to practice  for if were afraid of pain and always try to change it to pleasure well end up even more ignorant than beforeThis is why we have to be brave in experimenting with pain  both physical pain and mental distressWhen it arises in full measure like a house afire can we let go of itWe have to know both sides of feelingWhen its hot and burning how can we deal with itWhen its cool and refreshing how can we see through itWe have to make an effort to focus on both sides contemplating until we know how to let goOtherwise we wont know anything for all we want is the cool side the cooler the better and when this is the case how can we expect to gain release from the cycle of rebirthNibbana is the extinguishing of craving and yet we like to stay with craving  so how can we expect to get anywhere at allWell stay right here in the world right here with stress and suffering for craving is a sticky sapIf theres no craving theres nothing no stress no rebirthBut we have to watch out for itIts a sticky sap a glob of tar a dye thats hard to wash outSo dont let yourself get carried away with feelingThe crucial part of the practice lies hereIn making yourself quiet you have to be quiet on all fronts  quiet in your deeds quiet in your words quiet in your mindOnly then will you be able to contemplate whats going on inside yourselfIf you arent quiet youll become involved in external affairs and end up having too much to do and too much to sayThis will keep your awareness or mindfulness from holding steady and firmYou have to stop doing saying or thinking anything that isnt necessaryThat way your mindfulness will be able to develop continuouslyDont let yourself get involved in too many outside thingsIn training your mindfulness to be continuous so that it will enable you to contemplate yourself you have to be observant When theres sensory contact can the mind stay continuously undisturbed and at normalcyOr does it still run out into liking and dislikingBeing observant in this way will enable you to read yourself to know yourselfIf mindfulness is firmly established the mind wont waverIf its not yet firm the mind will waver in the form of liking and dislikingYou have to be wary of even the slightest waveringDont let yourself think that the slight waverings are unimportant or else theyll become habitualBeing uncomplacent means that you have to watch out for the details the little things the tiny flaws that arise in the mindIf you can do this youll be able to keep your mind protected  better than giving all your attention to the worthless affairs of the outside worldSo really try to be carefulDont get entangled in sensory contactThis is something you have to work at masteringIf you focus yourself exclusively in the area of the mind like this youll be able to contemplate feelings in all their detailsYoull be able to see them clearly to let them goSo focus your practice right at feelings of pleasure pain and neitherpleasurenorpainContemplate how to leave them alone simply as feelings without relishing them  for if you relish feelings thats cravingDesires for this and that will seep in and influence the mind so that it gets carried away with inner and outer feelingsThis is why you have to be quiet  quiet in a way that doesnt let the mind become attached to the flavors of feelings quiet in a way that uproots their influenceThe desire for pleasure is like a virus deep in our characterWhat were doing here is to make the mind stop taking pleasant feelings into itself and stop pushing painful feelings awayOur addiction to taking in pleasant feelings is what makes us dislike painful feelings and push them away so dont let the mind love pleasure and resist painLet it be undisturbed by bothGive it a tryIf the mind can let go of feelings so that its above pleasure pain and neitherpleasurenorpain that means its not stuck on feelingAnd then try to observe How can it stay unaffected by feelingsThis is something you have to work at mastering in order to release your grasp on feelings once and for all so that you wont latch onto physical pain or mental distress as being you or yoursIf you dont release your grasp on feeling youll stay attached to it both in its physical and in its mental formsIf theres the pleasure of physical ease youll be attracted to itAs for the purely mental feeling of pleasure thats something youll really want youll really loveAnd then youll be attracted to the mental perceptions and labels that accompany the pleasure the thoughtformations and even the consciousness that accompany the pleasureYoull latch onto all of these things as you or yoursSo analyze physical and mental pleasureTake them apart to contemplate how to let them goDont fool yourself into relishing themAs for pain dont push it awayLet pain simply be pain let pleasure simply be pleasureLet them simply fall into the category of feelingsDont go thinking that you feel pleasure that you feel painIf you can let go of feeling in this way youll be able to gain release from suffering and stress because youll be above and beyond feelingThis way when aging illness and death come you wont latch onto them thinking that you are aging that you are ill that you are dyingYoull be able to release these things from your graspIf you can contemplate purely in these terms  that the five aggregates are inconstant stressful and notself  you wont enter into them and latch onto them as me or mine If you dont analyze them in this way youll be trapped in dyingEven your bones skin flesh and so forth will become mine This is why were taught to contemplate death  so that we can make ourselves aware that death doesnt mean that we dieYou have to contemplate until you really know thisOtherwise youll stay trapped right thereYou must make yourself sensitive in a way that sees clearly how your bones flesh and skin are empty of any selfThat way you wont latch onto themThe fact that you still latch onto them shows that you havent really seen into their inconstancy stress and notselfnessWhen you see the bones of animals they dont have much meaning but when you see the bones of people your perception labels them Thats a persons skeletonThats a persons skull If there are a lot of them they can really scare youWhen you see the picture of a skeleton or of anything that shows the inconstancy and notselfness of the body and you dont see clear through it youll get stuck at the level of skeleton and bonesActually there are no bones at allTheyre empty nothing but elementsYou have to penetrate into the bones so that theyre elementsOtherwise youll get stuck at the level of skeletonAnd since you havent seen through it it can make you distressed and upsetThis shows that you havent penetrated into the DhammaYoure stuck at the outer shell because you havent analyzed things into their elementsWhen days and nights pass by theyre not the only things that pass byThe body constantly decays and falls apart tooThe body decays bit by bit but we dont realize itOnly after its decayed a lot  when the hair has gone gray and the teeth fall out  do we realize that its oldThis is knowledge on a crude and really blatant levelBut as for the gradual decaying that goes on quietly inside we arent aware of itAs a result we cling to the body as being us  every single part of itIts eyes are our eyes the sights they see are the things we see the sensation of seeing is something we senseWe dont see these things as elementsActually the element of vision and the element of form make contactThe awareness of the contact is the element of consciousness the mental phenomenon that senses sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and allThis we dont realize which is why we latch onto everything  eyes ears nose tongue body intellect  as being us or oursThen when the body decays we feel that we are growing old when it dies and mental phenomena stop we feel that we dieOnce youve taken the elements apart though theres nothingThese things lose their meaning on their ownTheyre simply physical and mental elements without any illness or deathIf you dont penetrate into things this way you stay deluded and blindFor instance when we chant jaradhammamhi  I am subject to death  thats simply to make us mindful and uncomplacent in the beginning stages of the practiceWhen you reach the stage of insight meditation though theres none of thatAll assumptions all conventional truths get ripped awayThey all collapseWhen the body is empty of self what is there to latch ontoPhysical elements mental elements theyre already empty of any selfYou have to see this clearly all the way throughOtherwise they gather together and form a being both physical and mental and then you latch onto them as being your selfOnce we see the world as elements however theres no deathAnd once we can see that theres no death thats when well really knowIf we still see that we die that shows that we havent yet seen the DhammaWere still stuck on the outer shellAnd when this is the case what sort of Dhamma can we expect to knowYou have to penetrate deeper in to contemplate taking things apartYoure almost at the end of your lease in this burning house and yet you continue latching onto it as your selfIt tricks you into feeling fear and love and when you fall for it what path will you practiceThe mind latches onto these things to fool itself on many many levelsYou cant see through even these conventions so you grasp hold of them as your self as a woman a man  and you really turn yourself into these thingsIf you cant contemplate so as to empty yourself of these conventions and assumptions your practice simply circles around in the same old place and as a result you cant find any way outSo you have to contemplate down through many levelsIts like using a cloth to filter thingsIf you use a coarse weave you wont catch much of anythingYou have to use a fine weave to filter down to the deeper levels and penetrate into the deeper levels by contemplating over and over again through level after levelThats why there are many levels to being mindful and discerning filtering on in to the detailsAnd this is why examining and becoming fully aware of your own inner character is so importantThe practice of meditation is nothing but catching sight of selfdeceptions to see how they infiltrate into the deepest levels and how even the most blatant levels fool us right before our very eyesIf you cant catch sight of the deceits and deceptions of the self your practice wont lead to release from sufferingIt will simply keep you deluded into thinking that everything is you and yoursTo practice in line with the Buddhas teachings is to go against the flowEvery living being deep down inside wants pleasure on the physical level and then on the higher and more subtle levels of feeling such as the types of concentration that are addicted to feelings of peace and respiteThis is why you have to investigate into feeling so that you can let go of it and thus snuff out craving through being fully aware of feeling as it actually is  free from any self  in line with its nature unentangled uninvolvedThis is what snuffs out the virus of craving so that ultimately it vanishes without a traceThere are many layers to selfdeceptionThe more you practice and investigate things the less you feel like claiming to knowInstead youll simply see the harm of your own manyfaceted ignorance and foolishnessYour examination of the viruses in the mind gets more and more subtleBefore you didnt know so you took your views to be knowledge  because you thought you knewBut actually these things arent real knowledgeTheyre the type of understanding that comes from labelsStill we think theyre knowledge and we think we knowThis in itself is a very intricate selfdeceptionSo you have to keep watch on these things to keep contemplating themSometimes they fool us right before our eyes Thats when it really gets bad because we dont know that weve got ourselves fooled and instead think were people who knowWe can deal thoroughly with this or that topic but our knowledge is simply the memory of labelsWe think that labels are discernment or thoughtformations are discernment or the awareness of sensory consciousness is discernment and so we get these things all mixed upAs a result we become enamored with all the bits of knowledge that slip in and fashion the mind  which are simply the illusions within awarenessAs for genuine awareness theres very little of it while deceptive awareness has us surrounded on all sidesWe thus have to contemplate and investigate so as to see through these illusions in awarenessThis is what will enable us to read the mindIf your awareness goes out dont follow it outStop and turn inward insteadWhatever slips in to fashion the mind you have to be wise to itYou cant forbid it for its something natural and you shouldnt try to close off the mind too muchSimply keep watch on awareness to see how far it will go how true or false it is how it disbands and then arises againYou have to watch it over and over againSimply watching in this way will enable you to read yourself to know cause and effect within yourself and to contemplate yourselfThis is what will make your mindfulness and discernment more and more skillfulIf you dont practice in this way the mind will be darkIt may get a little empty a little still and youll decide thats plenty good enoughBut if you look at the Buddhas teachings youll find that no matter what sort of correct knowledge he gained he was never willing to stop thereHe always said Theres more To begin with he developed mindfulness and clear comprehension in every activity but then he said Theres more to do further to go As for us were always ready to bragWe work at developing this or that factor for a while and then say we already know all about it and dont have to develop it any furtherAs a result the principles in our awareness go soft because of our boastfulness and prideTo open the door so that you can really see inside yourself isnt easy but its something you can train yourself to doIf you have the mindfulness enabling you to read yourself and understand yourself that cuts through a lot of the issues right thereCraving will have a hard time formingIn whatever guise it arises youll get to read it to know it to extinguish it to let it goWhen you get to do these things it doesnt mean that you get anything for actually once the mind is empty that means it doesnt gain anything at allBut to put it into words for those who havent experienced it In what ways is emptiness emptyDoes it mean that everything disappears or is annihilatedActually you should know that emptiness doesnt mean that the mind is annihilatedAll thats annihilated is clinging and attachmentWhat you have to do is to see what emptiness is like as it actually appears and then not latch onto itThe nature of this emptiness is that its deathless within you  this emptiness of self  and yet the mind can still function know and read itselfJust dont label it or latch onto it thats allThere are many levels to emptiness many types but if its this or that type then its not genuine emptiness for it contains the intention trying to know what type of emptiness it is what features it hasThis is something you have to look into deeply if you really want to knowIf its superficial emptiness  the emptiness of the still mind free from thoughtformations about its objects or free from the external sense of self  thats not genuine emptinessGenuine emptiness lies deep not on the level of mere stillness or concentrationThe emptiness of the void is something very profoundBut because of the things weve studied and heard we tend to label the emptiness of the still mind as the void  and so we label things wrongly in that emptiness Actually its just ordinary stillnessWe have to look more deeply inNo matter what youve encountered that youve heard about before dont get excitedDont label it as this or that level of attainmentOtherwise youll spoil everythingYou reach the level where you should be able to keep your awareness steady but once you label things it stops right there  or else goes all out of controlThis labeling is attachment in actionIts something very subtle very refinedWhatever appears it latches onSo you simply have to let the mind be empty without labeling it as anything for the emptiness that lets go of preoccupations or is free from the influence of thoughtformations is something you have to look further intoDont label it as this or that level for to measure and compare things in this way blocks everything  and in particular knowledge of how the mind changesSo to start out simply watch these things simply be awareIf you get excited it ruins everythingInstead of seeing things clear through you dontYou stop there and dont go any furtherFor this reason when you train the mind or contemplate the mind to the point of gaining clear realizations every now and then regard them as simply things to observeOnce you can read your mind correctly you can catch hold of defilements and kill them off Thats insight meditationThe mind becomes razor sharp just as if you have a sharp knife that can cut anything clear throughEven if defilements arise again you can dig them up again cut them off againIts actually a lot of fun this job of uprooting the defilements in the mindTheres no other work nearly as much fun as getting this sense of I or self under your thumb because you get to see all of its tricksIts really funWhenever it shows its face in order to get anything you just watch it  to see what it wants and why it wants it to see what inflated claims it makes for itselfThis way you can crossexamine it and get to the factsOnce you know theres nothing to do but let go to become unentangled and freeJust think of how good that can beThis practice of ours is a way of stopping and preventing all kinds of things inside ourselvesWhenever defilement rises up to get anything to grab hold of anything we dont play alongWe let goJust this is enough to do away with a lot of stress and suffering even though the defilements feel the heatWhen we oppress the defilements a lot in this way it gets them hot and feverish you knowBut remember its the defilements that get hot and feverishAnd remember that the Buddha told us to put the heat on the defilements because if we dont put the heat on them they put the heat on us all the timeSo we must be intent on burning the defilements away even though they may complain that were mistreating themWe close the door and imprison themWhen they cant go anywhere theyre sure to complain I cant take itIm not free to go anywhere at all So simply watch them Where do they want to goWhat do they want to grab hold ofWhereWatch them carefully and theyll stop  stop going stop runningIts easy to say no to other things but saying no to yourself saying no to your defilements isnt easy at all  and yet it doesnt lie beyond your discernment or capabilities to do itIf you have the mindfulness and discernment to say no to defilement itll stopDont think that you cant make it stopYou can make it stop  simply that youve been foolish enough to give in to it so quickly that its become second natureSo we have to stopOnce we stop the defilements can stop tooWherever they turn up we can extinguish themAnd when this is the case how can we not want to practiceNo matter how stubbornly they want anything simply watch themGet acquainted with them and they wont stayTheyll disbandAs soon as they disband you realize exactly how deceptive they areBefore you didnt knowAs soon as they urged you to do anything you went along with themBut once youre wise to them they stopThey disbandEven though you dont disband them they disband on their ownAnd as soon as you see their disbanding the path opens wide before youEverything opens wide in the heartYou can see that theres a way you can overcome defilement you can put an end to defilement no matter how much it arisesBut youve got to remember to keep on watching out for it keep on letting it goThus I ask that you all make the effort to keep sharpening your tools at all timesOnce your discernment is sharp on any point it can let go of that point and uproot itIf you look after that state of mind and contemplate how to keep it going youll be able to keep your tools from growing too easily dullAnd now that you know the basic principles I ask that you make the effort to the utmost of your strength and mindfulnessMay you be brave and resilient so that your practice for gaining release from all your sufferings and stress can reap good results in every wayThose who attended the meditation retreat in November at Pelmadulla Bhikkhu Training Centre Ratnapura District Sri Lanka Have made it possible to print these Dhamma talks given during the retreatThey felt that others too could benefit from them and supported and encouraged this project so that it has now come to fruitNot only am I thankful for their help with this book but also most appreciative of their presence at the retreat which enabled me to give these talksSpecial gratitude is offered to Lasanda Kurukulasuriya who selflessly and lovingly typed and retyped the manuscriptThe Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement through their President DrAriyaratne kindly provided us with transport and offered the use of the Centre premises which was another meritorious service in the long list of their humanitarian effortsAs always my friend and Dhamma sister Ayya Nyanasiri has given the last polish and much invaluable advice without which I would probably never have published any books at allMay the merits of this Gift of Dhamma bring much benefit to allMeditation retreats are a time for introspectionBecause they are held in silence except for Dhamma talks and questions the mind becomes more and more used to mindfulness and concentrationThis gives added impetus to the hearing of Dhamma so that the truth of the Buddhas teaching can leave a lasting impressionWhen you open this book dear reader may be you could imagine being in a meditation retreat where nothing else matters except the clarity and wholesomeness of your own mindThis means leaving all daily preoccupations aside and focusing strictly on the wonderful

insightPeople are often surprised to find it is difficult to meditateOutwardly it seems to be such a simple matter to just sit down on a little pillow and watch ones breathWhat could be hard about thatThe difficulty lies in the fact that ones whole being is totally unpreparedOur mind senses and feelings are used to trade in the market place namely the world we live inBut meditation cannot be done in a market placeThats impossibleTheres nothing to buy or trade or arrange in meditation but most peoples attitude remains the same as usual and that just doesnt workWe need patience with ourselvesIt takes time to change to the point where meditation is actually a state of mind available at any time because the market place is no longer importantThe market place doesnt just mean going shoppingIt means everything that is done in the world all the connections ideas hopes and memories all the rejections and resistances all our reactionsIn meditation there are may be momentary glimpses of seeing that concentration is feasible but it cant be sustainedIt constantly slips again and the mind goes right back to where it came fromIn order to counteract that one has to have determination to make ones life a meditative one it doesnt mean one has to meditate from morning to nightI dont know anyone who doesAnd it doesnt mean we cannot fulfill our duties and obligations because they are necessary and primary as long as we have themBut it means that we watch ourselves carefully in all our actions and reactions to make sure that everything happens in the light of the Dhamma  the truthThis applies to the smallest detail such as our food what we listen to or talk aboutOnly then can the mind be ready with a meditative quality when we sit down on the pillowIt means that no matter where we find ourselves we remain introspectiveThat doesnt mean we cant talk to others but we watch the content of the discussionThat is not easy to do and the mind often slips offBut we can become aware of the slipIf we arent even aware that we have digressed from mindfulness and inner watchfulness we arent on the meditative path yetIf our mind has the Dhamma quality established within then meditation has a good chanceThe more we know of the Dhamma the more we can watch whether we comply with its guidelinesThere is no blame attached to our inability to do soBut the least we can do is to know the guidelines and know where were making mistakesThen we practice to get nearer and nearer to absolute reality until one day we will actually be the DhammaThere is this difference between one who know and one who practicesThe one who knows may understand the words and concepts but the one who practices knows only one thing namely to become that truthWords are an utilitarian means not only for communication but also to solidify ideasThats why words can never reveal the truth only personal experience canWe attain our experiences through realizing whats happening within and why it is as it isThis means that we combine watchfulness with inquiry as to why were thinking saying and reacting the way we doUnless we use our mind in this way meditation will be an onagain offagain affair and will remain difficultWhen meditation doesnt bring joy most people are quite happy to forget about itWithout the meditative mind and experience the Dhamma cannot arise in the heart because the Dhamma is not in wordsThe Buddha was able to verbalize his inner experience for our benefit to give us a guidelineThat means we can find a direction but we have to do the traveling ourselvesTo have a meditative mind we need to develop some important inner qualitiesWe already have their seed within otherwise we couldnt cultivate themIf we want flowers in our garden and there are no seeds we can water and fertilize yet nothing will growThe watering and fertilizing of the mind is done in meditationWeeding has to be done in daily livingWeeds always seem to grow better in any garden than the flowers doIt takes a lot of strength to uproot those weeds but it is not so difficult to cut them downAs they get cut down again and again they eventually become feeble and their uprooting is made easyCutting down and uprooting the weeds needs sufficient introspection into ourselves to know what is a weed and what is a flowerWe have to be very sure because we dont want to pull out all the flowers and leave all the weedsA garden with many weeds isnt much of an ornamentPeoples hearts and minds usually contain equal amounts of flowers and weedsWere born with the three roots of evil greed hate and delusion and the three roots of good generosity lovingkindness and wisdomDoesnt it make sense to try and get rid of those three roots which are the generators of all problems all our unpleasant experiences and reactionsIf we want to eliminate those three roots we have to look at their outcropsTheyre the roots underneath the surface but obviously a root sprouts and shows itself above the surfaceWe can see that within ourselvesCaused by delusion we manifest greed and hateThere are different facets of greed and hate and the simplest and most common one is I like I want I dont like and I dont want Most people think such reactions are perfectly justified and yet that is greed and hateOur roots have sprouted in so many different ways that we have all sorts of weeds growingIf we look at a garden we will find possibly thirty or forty different types of weedsWe might have that many or more unwholesome thoughts and emotionsThey have different appearances and power but theyre all coming from the same rootsAs we cant get at the roots yet we have to deal with what is above the surfaceWhen we cultivate the good roots they become so mighty and strong that the weeds do not find enough nourishment any moreAs long as we allow room for the weeds in our garden we take the nutriment away from the beautiful plants instead of cultivating those more and moreThis takes place as a development in daily living which then makes it possible to meditate as a natural outcome of our state of mindAt this point in time we are trying to change our mind from an ordinary one to a meditative one which is difficult if one hasnt practiced very much yetWe only have one mind and carry that around with us to every activity and also to the meditationIf we have an inkling that meditation can bring us peace and happiness then we need to make sure we have a meditative mind already when we sit downTo change it from busyness to quiet at that moment is too difficultThe state of mind which we need to develop for meditation is well described by the BuddhaTwo aspects of importance are mindfulness and the calming of the sensesInternal mindfulness may sometimes be exchanged for external mindfulness because under some circumstances that is an essential part of practiceThe world impinges upon us which we cannot denyExternal mindfulness also means to see a tree for instance in a completely new wayNot with the usual thoughts of thats pretty or I like this one in may garden but rather noticing that there are live and dead leaves that there are growing plants mature ones and dying onesWe can witness the growth birth and decay all around usWe can understand craving very clearly by watching ants mosquitoes dogsWe need not look at them as a nuisance but as teachersAnts mosquitoes and barking dogs are the kind of teachers who dont leave us alone until the lessons are fully learnedWhen we see all in the light of birth decay death greed hate and delusion we are looking in a mirror of all life around us then we have Dhamma on showAll of us are proclaiming the truth of Dhamma constantly only we dont pay enough attentionWe can use mindfulness to observe that everything in existence consists of the four elements earth fire water air and then check out what is the difference between ourselves and all elseWhen we take practice seriously and look at all life in such a way then we find the truth all around as well as within usNothing else existsThis gives us the ability to leave the marketplace behind where the mind flits from one thing to the next never has a moments peace is either dull and indifferent or hateful and greedyBut when we look at that which really is were drawing nearer to what the Buddha taught out of his compassion for all the beings that are roaming around in samsara from one dukkha to the nextHe taught so that people like us may awaken to the truthWe should neither believe nor disbelieve what we hear or read but try it out ourselvesIf we give our wholehearted attention to this practice we will find that it changes our approach to living and dyingTo be wholehearted is a necessity in anything we doIf we get married and are halfhearted about it that cannot be very successfulHalfhearted practice of Dhamma results in chaotic misunderstandingWholeheartedness may have at its core devotion and a mind which goes beyond everyday thoughts and activitiesAnother facet which goes together with mindfulness is clear comprehensionMindfulness is knowing only without any discriminating facultyMindfulness does not evaluate of judge but pays full attentionClear comprehension has four aspects to itFirst What is my purpose in thinking talking or doing Thought speech and action are our three doorsSecond Am I using the most skillful means for my purpose That needs wisdom and discriminationThird Are these means within the Dhamma Knowing the distinction between wholesome and unwholesomeThe thought process needs our primary attention because speech and action will follow from itSometimes people think that the end justifies the meansIt doesntBoth means and end have to be within the DhammaThe fourth step is to check whether our purpose has been accomplished and if not why notIf we live with these steps in mind we will slow down which is helpful for our reactionsNo inactivity that is not the answer but the meditative quality of the mind which watches over what we are doingWhen we use mindfulness and clear comprehension we have to give time to investigateChecking prevents mistakesOur wrong thinking creates the danger of making bad kamma and takes us away from the truth into nebulous mindstatesThe Dhamma is straight forward simple and pureIt needs a pure mind to stay with itOtherwise we find ourselves outside of it again and againExternal mindfulness can also extend to other people but here we need to be very carefulSeeing and knowing others engenders negative judgmentIf we practice external mindfulness towards other people we have to realize that judging others is making bad kammaWe can pay attention with compassionPeoplewatching is one of the most popular pastimes but usually done with the intention of finding faultEveryone whos not enlightened has faults even the highly developed nonreturner has yet five fetters to loseWhat to say about ordinary worldlingsTo use other people as our mirror is very helpful because they reflect our own beingWe can only see in others what we already know about ourselvesThe rest is lost to usIf we add clear comprehension to our mindfulness and check our purpose and skillful means we will eliminate much grief and worryWe will develop an awareness which will make every day every moment an adventureMost people feel bogged down and burdenedEither they have too much or too little to do not enough money to do what they like or they frantically move about trying to occupy themselvesEverybody wants to escape from unsatisfactory conditions but the escape mechanism that each one chooses does not provide real inner joyHowever with mindfulness and clear comprehension just watching a tree is fascinatingIt brings a new dimension to our life a buoyancy of mind enabling us to grasp wholeness instead of the limitations of our family job hopes and dreamsThat way we can expand because were fascinated with what we see around and within us and want to explore furtherNo my mind my body my tree but just phenomena all around us to provide us with the most fascinating challenging schoolroom that anybody could ever findOur interest in the schoolroom increases as mindfulness increasesTo develop a meditative mind we also need to calm our sensesWe dont have to deny our senses that would be foolishness but see them for what they areMara the tempter is not a fellow with a long tail and a flaming red tongue but rather our sensesWe hardly ever pay attention to what they do to us when they pull us from an interesting sight to a beautiful sound and back to the sight the touch the ideaNo PeaceOur constant endeavor is to catch a moments pleasureA sense contact has to be very fleeting because otherwise it becomes a great dukkhaLets say we are offered a very nice meal which tastes extremely goodSo we say to our host Thats a very nice meal I like it very much The host replies I have lots of food here please stay around and eat for another two or three hours If we did we would not only get sick in body but also disgusted in our mindA meal can last twenty or at the most thirty minutesEach taste contact can only last a second then we have to chew and swallowIf we were to keep it in the mouth any longer it would become very unpleasantMaybe we feel very hot and go to take a cold showerWe say to our friend waiting outside Now I feel good that cold water is very pleasant Our friend says We have plenty of cold water you can have a shower for the next five to six hours Nothing but absolute misery would resultWe can enjoy a cold shower for ten or twenty minutes at the mostAnything that is prolonged will create dukkhaAll contacts pass quickly because that is their natureThe same goes for sight our eyes are continually blinkingWe cant even keep sight constant for the length of time were looking at anythingWe may be looking at a beautiful painting for a little while and really like itSomeone says You can stay here and look at the painting for the next five hours were not closing the museum yet Nobody could do thatWe cant look at the same thing a long time without feeling bored losing all awareness or even falling asleepSense contacts are not only limited because of their inability to give satisfactionThey are actually waves that come and goIf we are listening to some lovely music after a few hours the same music becomes unbearableOur sense contacts are mirroring a reflection of satisfaction which has no real basis in factThats Mara constantly leading us astrayTheres a pertinent story of a monk in the Buddhas time which relates the ultimate in sense disciplineA married couple had a big row and the woman decided to run awayShe put on several of her best saris one over the other wore all her gold jewelry and leftAfter a while the husband was sorry that he had let her go and followed herHe ran here and there but couldnt find herFinally he came across a monk who was walking along the streetHe asked the monk if hed seen a woman in a red sari with long black hair and lots of jewelry around her neck and armsThe monk said I saw a set of teeth going byThe monk was not paying attention to the concepts of a woman with long black hair a red sari and lots of jewelry but only to the fact that there was a human being with a set of teethHe had calmed his senses to the point where the sight object was no longer tempting him into a reactionAn ordinary person at the sight of a beautiful woman with black hair a red sari and lots of jewelry running excitedly along the street might have been tempted to follow herA set of teeth going by is highly unlikely to create desireThat is calming the sensesIf we come upon a snake its not an object of dislike or destruction but just a sentient being that happens to be aroundThats allTheres nothing to be done nothing to react toIf we think of it as a snake that could kill us then of course the mind can go berserk just as the monks mind could have done if he had thought Oh what a beautiful womanIf we watch our senses again and again this becomes a habit and is no longer difficultLife will be much more peacefulThe world as we know it consists of so much proliferationEverywhere are different colors shapes beings and natures growthEach species of tree has hundreds of subspeciesNature proliferatesAll of us look differentIf we dont guard our senses this proliferation in the world will keep us attracted life after lifeTheres too much to see do know and react toSince there is no end to all of that we might as well stop and delve inside of ourselvesA meditative mind is achieved through mindfulness clear comprehension and calming the sensesThese three aspects of practice need to be done in everyday lifePeace and harmony will result and our meditation will flourishThe two aspects of our being are mind and bodyWe have to pay attention to both of them even though meditation is a mind exercise not a body exerciseSome of the most common questions are How am I going to learn to sit How am I not going to have any pain That is only possible through continued application doing it again and againIn the beginning the body just doesnt like sitting crosslegged on the floorWe can use this situation as skillful meansWhen discomfort arises in the body we learn to pay attention to the minds reaction and do not move automaticallyEverybody in the world is trying to get out of any kind of discomfort with an instinctive immediate reactionIts not that were not going to get out of discomfort but in order to make meditation pay off we have to learn to get out of instinctive immediate reactionsIts those that land us in dukkha over and over againWhen there is an uncomfortable feeling it is essential to realize what is happening withinWe notice that there is a sense contact in this case touch The body is making contact the knees with the pillow the legs with each other several contacts are happeningFrom all sense contacts feelings ariseThere is no way out of that this is how human beings are madeThe Buddha taught cause and effect that dependent upon any sense contact feeling resultsThere are three kinds of feelings pleasant unpleasant and neutralWe can forget about the neutral ones because we are hardly ever aware of themNeutral is actually considered pleasant because at least it doesnt hurtFrom this particular touch contact that is being made through the sitting posture there arises after a while an unpleasant feelingThe immediate reaction is to moveDontInvestigateBy getting to know our own mind we get to know the world and the universeAll minds contain the seed of enlightenmentUnless we know our own mind we cannot develop and cultivate that seedhere the mind has been contacted with an unpleasant feeling our perception says this is painful Our next step are the mental formations which are also kamma formations because we make kamma through our thought processesFirst came the sense contact secondly feeling aroseThen perception naming it followed by dislikeAt the moment of dislike there is the running away through changing our positionThat is the kamma making aspectThis is minor negative kamma yet its negative because the mind is in a state of illwill by saying I dont like itThe mind may start all kinds of rationalizations I wish Id brought my own little chair I cant sit At my age I shouldnt do things like this Meditation is too difficult None of these explanations have any intrinsic validity they are only a mind reacting to an unpleasant feelingUnless we become acquainted with our minds reactions were not using meditation in the most beneficial mannerKnowing the unpleasant feeling we can now try to acquaint ourselves with its true natureOur whole life is lived according to our feelingsUnless we become aware of our reactions to feelings we remain half asleepThere is a beautiful little book called The Miracle of Being AwakeThis miracle is nothing but mindfulness knowing whats going on withinWhen we have realized we want to get rid of the unpleasant feeling then we can try to disown it for a momentOnly the arahant is fully capable of complete detachment but we can do so for a short timeThe unpleasant feeling has arisen without our asking for it and we dont have to believe it to be oursWe can let it be just a feelingIf we do that for a moment we can get back to the meditation subject and have won a victory over our own negative reactionsOtherwise we are letting our unpleasant feelings rule us in whatever way they wantThe whole of humanity runs after pleasant feelings and away from unpleasant onesUnless we at least know that we have no reference point for inner changeIt may not be possible to reverse that reaction yet but at least we know it is happeningAfter we have become aware of our minds intention were free to move and change our sitting positionThere is nothing wrong with changing ones posture but theres something wrong with instinctive impetuous habitsMeditation means total awarenessBeing awake is not the opposite of being asleep it is the opposite of being dull and foggySuch mind states are mostly due to an unwillingness to look at our own dukkhaWed rather hide in a fogIn meditation that wont doThe Buddha said that this body is a cancer the body as a whole is a disease and we can experience that when just sitting still it becomes uncomfortableMeditation means samatha and vipassana calm and insightUnless we know the limitations of each and also their possibilities we wont be able to make good use of the practiceWe are generally applying both of them in every session but we must be able to distinguish between themIf there is no understanding of whats happening in the mind the fog settles down in itEverybody would like bliss peace and happinessThat is a natural wishThey are available in meditation with a lot of practice and some good kammaHowever they are not the goal of meditationThe goal of meditation is insightYet skillful means for gaining insight are needed and are found in tranquillity meditationMaking use of a meditation subject the mind after some training will be able to stay on it for a whilePresuming that the mind is able to focus on the breath for even a short time we realize afterwards that some peace arose because the mind was not thinkingThe thinking process in everybodys mind is hardly ever profoundIts just thinkingJust as the body breathes so the mind keeps churningAnd it keeps churning out mostly irrelevant unsubstantial and unimportant details without which we would be much happierThe mind in its original form is pureIts clear and lucid luminous pliable and expandableOur thinking is the impurity and the blockageTheres hardly a person who doesnt think all day long probably without even being aware of itBut when we start meditating we do become aware of our inner restlessnessWe realize we cant keep the mind on the meditation subject because we are thinking instead of meditatingThe moment we experience our thinking habit we accomplish two thingsWe become aware of our minds activity and also the content of our thoughtsWe will realize immediately that our thinking is irrelevant and makes little or no senseBecause of that we can let go of it fairly easily and return to the meditation subjectWe have to be able to stand back and watch the thinking process and not get involved in itOtherwise well just keep on thinking instead of meditatingThe mind is the greatest and most delicate tool existing in the universeAll of us have it but few look after it properlyPractically everybody is interested in looking after their bodiesEating sleeping washing exercising seeing the doctor when the body is sick cutting hair nails filling teeth doing everything thats necessary to keep the body functioning wellIn reality the body is the servant and the mind is the masterSo we are looking after the servant and forgetting the masterIf we do that in our homes we create chaosThats one of the reasons why the world looks as chaotic as it doesPeople kill each other steal from each other are unfaithful lie gossip and slanderMost have absolutely no ideas that the mind is our most precious assetIt gives us wealth beyond compare and yet we dont know how to look after itWe have to do exactly the same thing for the mind as we do for the bodyWe need to give it a restImagine if we didnt go to sleep for three or four days how would we feelWithout energy without strength pretty terribleThe body needs a rest but the mind does tooDuring the day it thinks at night it dreamsIts always busyThe only real rest it can ever get which energizes and gives the needed boost to become clear and lucid is to stay on the meditation subjectThe mind needs a cleanup which means purificationThis happens when all thinking is stopped for a while because of onepointed concentrationOne moment of concentration is one moment of purificationAt that time the mind cannot contain illwill or sensual desire or any other negativityWhen the concentration ceases the mind reverts to its usual behavior againIn meditation we can experience that a purified mind gives us happiness and quite naturally we will try to keep that purification process going also in daily livingThe mind needs the kind of exercise that is not geared towards winning or achieving anything but just to obeyWhen we ask the mind to stay on the meditation subject yet it runs away from it we know immediately that we are not the master of our mind but that the mind does what it pleasesWhen we have realized that we will be less likely to believe our own views and opinions particularly when they are unwholesome because we understand that the mind is simply thinking habituallyOnly through the meditation process can we become aware of thatThe mind also requires the right kind of foodBecause in meditation we can reach states of higher consciousness we are thereby able to nourish the mind in a way which cannot happen in the ordinary thinking processTranquillity meditation leads the mind into realms which are totally unavailable to us otherwiseHappiness and peacefulness arise without dependence on outer conditions which give us a new freedomThe mind of every human being contains the seed of NibbanaWe need training in order to realize what is obscuring our visionThen the seed can be cultivated and nurtured to full growthBecause our minds contain such a potential they also contain the peace and happiness which everybody wantsMost people try to find fulfillment through acquiring material objects seeing or touching eating or knowing themParticularly having more and keeping it all safeThis dependency is a guarantee for dukkhaAs long as we depend on outer conditions whether people experiences countries religions wealth or fame we are in constant fear of losing our footing because everything changes and vanishesThe only way we can have real peace and happiness is by being independent of all around usThat means gaining access to the purity of our mind without thinking which involves staying on our meditation subject long enough for our consciousness to changeThe thinking consciousness is the consciousness we all knowIt contains constant ups and downs either liking or disliking wanting something in the future or regretting something about the past hoping for better days or remembering worse onesIt is always anxious and cannot be expected to be totally peacefulWe are familiar with a different consciousness also for instance when we love someone very muchThat emotion changes our consciousness to where we are only giving from the heartWe know a different consciousness when we are involved with religious activities with faith and confidence arousedWe are giving ourselves to an idealNone of that lasts through and all depends upon outer conditionsThrough meditation we can change our consciousness to an awareness of purity within which all of us have only obscured through thinkingAt that time we realize that such an independent peace and happiness are only possible when the me and mine are forgotten for a moment when I want to be happy is eliminatedIt is impossible to have peace when thinking about self This will be our first inkling of what the Buddha meant when he said nonself is the way out of dukkhaBecause it is difficult for the mind to stay on the meditation subject we have to use everything that arises for insightEventually the mind becomes clear and sharp and is no longer bothered by the outer manifestations that touch upon it such as sound and thought which are the most common onesFinally a depth of concentration is reachedWhen unpleasant feelings arise let us use them for insightWe didnt ask for the feelings why are they oursThey are certainly changeable they get worse or better they move their position and they give us a very good indication that the body is dukkhaThe body isnt doing anything except sitting and yet we have dukkha for the simple reason of not liking the feeling as it isWhen we use the unpleasant feeling to actually realize the first and second noble truths weve come nearer to the Dhamma in our heartsThe first noble truth being the noble truth of dukkha the second being the reason for dukkha namely cravingIn this case were craving to get rid of the unpleasant feelingsIf we were totally accepting of the feeling not making any value judgments there would be no dukkhaWe can try letting go of this craving for a moment anyone with some strength of mind can do thatJust accepting the feeling as it is not disliking itThen theres no dukkha for just that momentThat will be a profound insight experience because it will show without the shadow of a doubt that if we drop our desires dukkha disappearsNaturally when the body feels uncomfortable its difficult to drop the craving to get rid of that discomfortBut anybody can do it for just one moment and its an essential and indepth experience of the DhammaWhen we are able to step back to observe our thought processes we realize that the mind is continually thinkingIt may take from  minutes to become aware of that for someone who hasnt practiced meditation previouslyFor an experienced meditator it may only take a second or twoNext we can see what kind of thinking we are indulging in and the more often we see it the less enraptured well be with itWe become aware of the fact that this is the way the human mind acts not just ours but everybodys and well know the truth about the mindThere is nothing else to be seen except thatWhen we observe that the thinking goes on and that it is insignificant it will be so much easier to let goWe also see how very fleeting thoughts are how they come and go all the timeWell know from experience then that no real happiness is to be found in something so shortlived yet the whole world is trying to achieve happiness that wayWe cant even remember what we thought a moment ago how can that bring happinessSuch insights make it possible to drop the distractions and get back to the meditation subjectWe are using the two approaches of calm and insight in conjunction with each otherWhen calm is firmly established insight arises spontaneouslyIts important to realize that calm meditation is essentialIf isnt as if some people like it and others dontIf the ocean has high waves and we want to look beneath the surface to see what can be found there we cant recognize anything at all while the waves are risingThere is too much movement all is stirred up and nothing is to be seenWhen the waves subside and the ocean surface becomes calm and transparent then we can look underneath the surface of the water and see sand coral and multicolored fishIts the same in the mindWhen the mind has all the waves and motions of thinking that churning in the mind makes it impossible to see absolute realityOn the contrary the mind refuses to look beyond ordinary knowingBut when the mind becomes totally calm then there is no value judgment and we can see easily what lies underneath the surfaceIn order to understand the Buddhas teaching we have to get below the surface otherwise our insights will be superficialThe calm mind is the means for delving below relative realityWhile we are trying to become calm at the same time were objectively examining all that arises so that there is more and more support for letting go of the thinkingThe less we believe in our thoughts the less we expect of them and the happier we will be to let them goThen we get an inkling of what inner peace and happiness meanThese inner feelings are most pronounced in meditation but can be carried into daily living in a milder form primarily because the mind knows it can always return to peace and happiness in meditation without having to depend on any situation or any personWorldly affairs no longer have the former sting in them they are just happening thats all the same as thinking and feeling are arising and ceasing without an owner or a makerIt is important to experience and not to believeIn order to do that we have to pay attentionIn the famous and often quoted Kalama Sutta the Buddha gives ten points which are not suitable as criteria to follow a teacher or a spiritual pathAll of them have to do with a belief system because of traditional lineage or because of sacred booksNot to believe but to find out for ourselves is the often repeated injunction of the BuddhaUnless we do that we cannot have an inner vision which is the first step that takes us on to the noble pathAn inner vision is an understood experienceWithout that insight cannot ariseThat holds true for small matters in daily life just as it holds true for the deepest and most profound understanding of the Buddhas teachingIf for instance somebody is not pleased with us and we dont understand why we shall have that same disharmony happen to us over and over againWe need to realize that we may have said or done something to cause that displeasureThis is a small matter showing the need for understanding an experienceIf we think these happenings are something outside of ourselves we cant change our attitudesPracticing Dhamma means constantly changing ourselves to reach out towards the sublimeIf change were not possible the Buddha would have given a lifetime of teaching in vainUnless we pay total attention to every detail well never change towards the sublimeAttention to detail is the core of mindfulnessMost people lack the practice and also the instructions to be truly mindfulIts one thing to read about it but an entirely different matter to do itMindfulness is the essence of understanding because without it there is no seeing into the heart of any phenomenaWatching the breath means knowing exactly Mindfulness is not judgmental nor discriminating nor telling storiesMindfulness knows when there is concentration and when there isnt when the mind wanders off and when the mind becomes peacefulPerfect mindfulness knows every moment that is occurringWhen we pay attention to our feelings and do not react to them but only observe then were using the second foundation of mindfulness vedananupassanaWhen we know were thinking its cittanupassana and when we know what the content of the thought is its dhammanupassanaIf were not paying attention were not really awakeWe need to practice clear attention to any one of these at all timesIt is possible that in meditation the mind becomes concentratedIf there is a feeling of peacefulness one has to know that quite clearlyWithout realizing what is happening one cannot go further because one doesnt know where one is atThis is an important detail of meditation knowing exactly whats happening and being able to verbalize it after the occurrenceThe verbalization is the understood experience and occurs naturally after the experienceThis holds true for any mindstate and for any feelingThe Dhamma is the Buddhas verbalized experienceUnless we can do that with our own experiences we are left with a belief system which can dull the mindBut meditation is to sharpen the mindThe mindful mind is a sharpened axe with a sharp and finely honed blade which can cut through all our illusionsWhen we sit in meditation we can get to know the disturbances of our own mind such as the dull mind that doesnt know whats going on or the sleepy mind the distracted or the resisting mind that doesnt want to obeyThat is mindfulness of mind objectsLike most human beings we have a distracted mind geared so much towards trying to resist the unpleasant and crave the pleasant that this pattern is very difficult to changeIf we find ourselves resisting the unpleasant seeking the pleasant we just know that this is a normal habit patternThis is how this little spaceship earth operates and how our economy worksDo you know anybody whos blissfully happy because of itIt is an impossible venture it is a guaranteed failure yet everybody is still tryingWe have all been trying long enough we can give it up at least for the time were meditationHowever it is possible to get rid of dukkha but not by eliminating the unpleasant sensations only by getting rid of our reaction to themThis is the most important primary entrance into the spiritual pathUnless this is perfectly understood the rest will not fall into placeWe wont get rid of the unpleasantness of sitting or of mosquitoes or of anything unpleasant we may encounterAll is mindmade and therefore mindreactedDukkha disappears when our reactions disappearUnless we know that we are the creators of our own dukkha Dhamma remains a mysteryWe start practicing when we no longer blame our surroundings other people the political situation the economy or the weatherWe see only our own reactionsNaturally our reactions arent immediately going to be all favorable and wholesomeThat will take a whileBut at least we can start doing something about ourselvesMindfulness needs to be used not only in our meditation practice but also every time we move feel or think in our daily lifeWhile awake mindfulness has to be our primary objectiveOne has to come to terms with oneselfOnly then will the world make sense one dayThe universe is this mind and bodyWe find out what this mind and body are all about and we will know the universe and its underlying truthAll is distinctively the same but we have to know what it isWhen we come out of meditation we should be aware of opening our eyes moving our body of everything we are doingWhyFirst of all it will keep us from thinking unwholesome negative thoughtsIt facilitates meditationThe mind needs to be kept in check and not allowed to run wildThe ordinary unpracticed mind is like a wild bull running around in a gardenIt can make a mess of the garden in no timeThats what our minds are doingTheyre making an awful mess of this world we live inWe dont even have to read the newspapers to know about itIts to be seen everywhere and comes from our own mindsAll of us are included except the enlightened onesA wild mind cant meditateIt has to be caught kept in check and a halter put onEvery time it runs away we bring it back with mindfulness like training a wild horse which in its wild state cannot benefit anyoneIf the horse is tamed and trained it can be extremely usefulHow much more this is true of the mindMindfulness of the body means that we know the movements of all partsAs we watch ourselves we will see that there is mind and bodyThe mind giving the orders the body following suitWe can recognize too that sometimes the body cant obey because it is weakThis is our first entrance into insight realizing there are mind and body and the mind being the more important oneThe difference between a trained and an untrained person is the understood experienceMindfulness which extends to the body movements extends to the other aspects of mindfulness as wellIf for instance we are thinking about the future we are no longer paying attention to the body instead we can pay attention to the thought processWe know that we are thinking and are making kammaThe thoughts are the mental formations as well as the kamma formationsWe are the owners of our kammaWhatever we think that we will beIts an impersonal process which has nothing to do with any particular entityThen we can become aware of the content of our thoughts which means knowing whether it is wholesome or notWe can learn to drop any negative thinking and replace itThis is where our meditation training comes in which is not divorced from outer activitiesWhen we pay attention to the breath in meditation and a thought intervenes we learn to let go of the thought and come back to the breathThe same procedure is used in daily life to let go of unwholesome thoughtsWe substitute at that time with a wholesome thought just as we substitute with the breath in meditationMindfulness of the thinking process is what the Buddha Named the four supreme efforts They constitute the heart of the purification processThe spiritual path is the path of purification and hinges on mindfulnessTheres only one way for the purification of beings for the overcoming of dukkha for the final elimination of pain grief and lamentation for entering the noble path for realizing Nibbana thats mindfulnessTo practice the purification process is necessary not only for ones own peace of mind for adding to the peace in the world but also in order to be able to meditateThe hope that one might sit down on a pillow watch the breath and become concentrated is a mythOne has to have the mind in proper shape for itTherefore we must practice these four supreme efforts not only while we are meditating but in everyday lifeWe will gain inner peace which everybody is looking for and very few people ever findThe first effort is not to let an unwholesome thought arise which has not yet arisenThe requires sharp mindfulnessA thought which has not yet arisen creates waves ahead of itTo realize that these waves are boding no good needs much attention and practiceThe second effort not to continue an unwholesome thought which has already arisen can be done by anyone of good will if it is understood that there is nobody else to blameUnwholesome thinking is not due to outer triggers but results strictly from our own defilementsThe third step is to make a wholesome thought arise which has not yet arisenThis means that we continually watch over our mind and encourage positive wholesome thoughts where none are present even under the most trying circumstancesFinally to make a wholesome thought which has already arisen continueIn the meditation practice this concerns our meditation subjectBut in daily life it means our minds reactionIf we have some sensitivity towards ourselves we can feel that there is a disturbance within when unwholesome thinking arises a feeling of resistanceUnwholesome thoughts have been thought of so often for so many years that they have become part and parcel of our thinking processIt takes mindfulness and determination to let goIn meditation we become aware that our unwholesome thoughts are not caused by someone or something externalThen we gain the power of mind to drop what we dont want to keep and substitute with what is useful for usThese four supreme efforts are the fourth foundation of mindfulness concerned with the contents of our thoughtsIf everybody in the world were practicing this it would be a better world to live inOur inner being manifests in feeling which arises through our sense contactsThinking is also a sense contactUnwholesome thinking produces unpleasant feelings such as being ill at ease or unhappySeeing hearing tasting touching smelling are the five outer sensesThinking is the inner oneAll of them make contact and produce a feelingThere is the eye and the eye objectWhen both are in good condition the eye consciousness arises and seeing resultsThe sense base the sense object and the sense consciousness meetWhen we know how this being which we call me operates we can stop the preprogrammed printout thats always answering the same wayIt is quite possible to predict how a person will react to any given stimulus because we have a program which has never been interrupted yetTo discontinue it we first have to know that there is a program and what it consists ofFor instance we have the hearing base which is the ear drum then there is soundWhen the hearing consciousness arises because both base and object are present hearing results and from that a feeling arisesThe ear can only hear sound the eye can only see form and colorThe mind does all the explainingEverybody has a slightly different explanation so that nobody sees or hears anything alikeWhen one man sees a woman and sees her form and color the mind says isnt she beautiful I must marry her When I see that same woman I dont think anything like thatYet everyone tries to convince the people around them that what they themselves are seeing and hearing is correctBecause they often cant convince others they start shooting or persecuting themThinking is also a sense contactThere is the brain base and there are ideasThe mind consciousness arises contacting the idea and thinking startsFrom that a feeling resultsIf we think we love every being whether we actually can do it or not we certainly get a warm pleasant feeling from the thoughtBy the same token if we think we hate a person we get a cold and distant feelingNow comes the reaction to the feeling which is either wantingcraving or not wantingrejectingBy being attentive to ourselves we can experience that quite clearlyThe reaction to the feeling is our renewed entry into duality and dukkhaAt the same time it provides us with the doorway out of all difficultiesIf for once we dont react but know a feeling just as a feeling if we can do that mindfulness has been establishedWe also gain the confidence that we can do it again and are actually practicing spiritual purificationThat is an important inner convictionThe Buddha said we need both study and practiceIt helps us to know something of what the Buddha taughtBut if we dont practice then we are only parrots or hypocrites proclaiming something we have no personal experience withThrough our practice of mindfulness we become aware of the feelings which arise when we make sense contactsFeelings happen all the time and need to be recognized so that we can change our instinctive way of living to a deliberate way of being aliveInstinctively we are a constant reactorDeliberately we become an actorProbably the most important lesson we can learn is to keep our mindfulness going in our everyday activitiesWe can practice wherever we are at home marketing in the office writing letters telephoning any time at allThe meditation itself gives us the impetus showing how awareness removes the obstacles inherent in our viewpointsWe cannot see the whole only partsWe see what is around us but we never see beyond thatWith mindfulness comes an opening where everything seems to fall into place and has an interconnectionWe lose our exaggerated sense of selfimportance and can unite more with all manifestationsAll these are still side issuesMindfulness means knowingAs we know and really experience we can prove eventually the four noble truths to ourselvesThen our work is completedMindfulness has as one of its factors the ability to be one pointedWe do not become foggy or distracted but can keep the mind in its placeWe have to realize that mind obstructions are a human calamity and not a personal oneThis understanding helps us to patiently endure and gradually changeWe can notice fairly easily what our mind doesIt reflects and reacts and it often has fantasies and also moodsAnyone who doesnt meditate will believe in all of thatEven those who do meditate might still believe in the reactions of their own mind to the outer stimuli or might believe the moods which come into the mind are to be taken seriously that whatever the mind is doing is due to an outside occurrence and not to an inner reactionThis is easily seen if we watch our thinking process not only in meditation but in daily livingThe Buddha gave very exact instructions how to counteract any unskillful mind states and produce skillful onesThey can briefly be expressed as avoiding overcoming developing and maintaining and are called the four supreme efforts which have been briefly mentioned beforeThey are part of the factors of enlightenment so must be part of our practiceWhen perfected they are part of the enlightenment processYou may have heard the expression Nibbana and Samsara are both in the same place It is not a true saying because there is no such place But Nibbana liberation emancipation enlightenment and Samsara the round of birth and death how can they be togetherIn a way they can because they are both in the mind in everybodys mindExcept that everyone is only aware of one of them namely that which makes us continue in the round of birth and death not only when this body disappears and it is called death or when a body reappears and it is called birthBut there is constant birth and death in our every moment of existenceThere is the birth of skillful and unskillful thoughts and the dying away of themThere is the birth of feelings pleasant unpleasant or neutral and the dying away of themThere is the birth of the arising of this body and its dying away moment after moment except that we are not mindful enough to become aware of thatWe can see this quite clearly when we look at a photo of ourselves taken or years agoWe look entirely different from what we see in the mirror nowBut it doesnt follow that a body takes a leap of years and then changes itself suddenlyIt has changed moment by moment until after a longer timespan it is finally noticeable to usWith more mindfulness we could have known it all along because there is constant birth and death in the body the same as with thoughts and feelingsThis is Samsara the round of birth and death within us due to our craving to keep or renew what we think is me When there is liberation that craving ceases whatever dies is left to dieAlthough we have the potential for liberation our awareness is not able to reach it because we are concerned with what we already knowWe are habitformed and habitprone and every meditator becomes aware of the mind habits with their old and tried reactions to outside triggersThey have not necessarily been useful in the past but they are still repeated out of habitThe same applies to our moods which are arising and passing away and have no other significance than a cloud has in the sky which only denotes the kind of weather there is without any universal truth to thatOur moods only denote the kind of weather our mind is fabricating if it believes the moodThe four supreme efforts are in the first place the avoiding of unwholesome unskillful thought processesIf we look at them as unskillful we can accept the fact of learning a new skill more easilyAvoiding means we do not let certain thoughts arise neither reactions to moods nor to outside triggersIf we find ourselves habitually reacting in the same way to the same kind of situation we may be forced to avoid such situations so that we can finally gain the insight which needs to be culled from itWhile we are reacting to a situation or mood we cant assess it dispassionately because our reactions overpowers the mindAvoiding in a Dhamma sense means to avoid the unskillful thought in a practical sense we may have to avoid whatever arouses such mind states in usThat however must not go to the length of running away as the slightest provocation which is a well known yet unsuccessful method of getting out of unpleasant reactionsHabitually running away from situations which create unwholesome reactions in us will not bring about a peaceful mindOnly if there is one particular trigger which arouses unskillful responses in us over and over again we may have to move away from it without blaming anyoneWe just realize that we have not yet been able to master ourselves under certain circumstancesJust as we dont blame the unpleasant feeling anywhere in the body but realize that we havent mastered our nonreaction to dukkha yet and therefore must change our postureIt amounts to exactly the same thingOne is a physical move the other is a mental oneAll it means is that we havent quite mastered a particular situation yetIt brings us to the realization that there is still more to be learned about ourselvesBlaming anything in our outside of ourselves is useless it only aggravates the situation and adds more unwholesome thinking to itIn order to avoid unskillful reactions in the mind we have to be attentive and know the way our mind works before we verbalizeWe can learn about that in meditationAwareness is the prime mover in meditationIt isnt viable or useful to have calm and peaceful mind states without being completely aware of how we attained them remained in them and came out of themHaving learned this through our meditative practice enables us to realize how our mind works in daily life before it says anything such as possibly I cant stand this situation or I hate this person When that happens an unwholesome state has already been establishedBefore the mind is allowed to fall into this trap a dense and unpleasant feeling can be noticed which acts as a warning that an unwholesome mind state is approaching which can be dropped before it has even established itselfIt is much easier to let go before the negativity has taken hold but it is harder to recognizeWhen we notice that a mind state is approaching which does not seem to be accompanied by peace and happiness we can be sure it will be unwholesomeThe more we train ourselves to be mindful of our mind states the more we realize the unhappiness we cause ourselves and others through unskillful thinkingWhen we have not been able to avoid an unwholesome mind we have to practice to overcome itBecause of the difficulty of becoming aware in time to avoid negativities we have to be very clear on how to overcome themDropping a thought is an action and not a passive reaction yet it is difficult to do because the mind needs something to graspIn meditation we need a subject such as the breath or the feelingssensations to hold onto before the mind can become calm and peacefulWhen we want to overcome unskillful mind states it is easier to substitute with wholesome thinking than just trying to let go of unwholesomenessIf we entertain the negative mind states for any length of time they become more and more at homeAs they make themselves comfortable we are more and more inclined to believe them and finally come out with thoughts such as I always hate people who dont agree with me or I always get nervous about thunder These statements are designed to show ones own unchanging character giving our ego an extra boostThe only reason these states might have become ingrained in our character is that having entertained negativities for so long one can no longer imagine to be without themYet these are nothing but unskillful mind states which can and need to be changedThe quicker we substitute the better it is for our own peace of mindIf we have dislike or rejection concerning a person we may remember something good about that person and be able to substitute the negative thought with something concretely positiveEveryone is endowed with both qualities good and evil and if we pick on the negative then we will constantly be confronted with that aspect rather than the oppositeWith some people this will be more difficult that with othersThey are our tests so to sayNobody gets away in this life without such testsLife is an adult education class with frequent examinations which are being thrown at us at any timeWe are not told in advance what is in store for us so we should be prepared all the timeAs we learn the skill of substitution and do it successfully once we gain confidence in our own abilityThere is no reason when why we cannot repeat this whenever neededThe relief we feel is all the incentive we need for practiceWhen we are confronted with situations which we find difficult to handle we can remember that we are faced with a learning experienceOvercoming unwholesome mind states needs mind power which we develop through our meditation practiceIf we are not yet able to keep our attention in meditation where we want it to be we will not be able yet to change our mind when we want to do soThe more skill we develop in meditation the easier it will be for us to either avoid or overcome By the same token as we practice substitution in daily living we assist our meditationWhen we realize that our mind is not a solid entity which has to react in certain ways but is a movable changeable phenomenon which can be clear and illuminated then we will more and more try to protect it from unwholesomenessIt is often a revelation to a new meditator to find out that the mind is not a fixed and believable reactor but can be influenced and changed at willTo develop wholesome states of mind means that we try to cultivate these when they have not arisen yetIf the mind is neutrally engaged or has a tendency to weigh judge and criticize feel hurt or be egocentered we deliberately counteract these tendencies to develop skillful mind statesWe acknowledge that all negative states are not conducive to our own happiness peace and harmonyWhen we develop lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity we experience that these states are conducive to our own inner wellbeingObviously we will then try again and again to cultivate the mind states which result in personal contentmentDeveloping them from that understanding alone that the wholesome states are good for us is a powerful insightWhen our mind is at peace we realize that while there are innumerable unwholesome situations in the world if we have an unwholesome reaction to them that only doubles the dukkhaIt will neither relieve the situation nor be helpful to anyoneIf we develop a capacity for seeing the positive and using whatever arises as a learning situation trying to keep the four supreme emotions mentioned above in mind then there remains only the last effort namely to maintain skillful mind statesAnyone who has not reached full liberation from all underlying tendencies will not be able to maintain positive states at all times but our mindfulness can be sharp enough to tell us when we are not succeedingThat is the awareness we need to effect changesWhen we are not able to maintain wholesomeness we can always try againShould we start blaming ourselves or others however we are adding a second negative state of mind and are blocking our progressA skill can be learnedWe have all learned many skills in this lifeThis is the sort of ability well worth cultivating more important than proficienciesThis is not a character trait we either possess or lackEverybodys mind is capable of developing the wholesome and letting go of the unwholesomeBut that also doesnt mean that we find everything wonderful and beautiful from now onThat too is not realisticThat which can be practiced is that although there is unwholesomeness within and without dislike is not an effective reaction to bring peace and happinessThe pinnacle of all emotional states is equanimity evenmindedness which is developed through our meditation practice and based on insightIt is our tool in daily living to develop and maintain wholesome mind statesIt is neither useful to suppress nor to pretend by thinking I ought to be or I should be Only awareness of what is happening in our mind and learning the skill of changing our mind is called forEventually our mind will be a finely tuned instrument the only one in the whole of the universe that can liberate us from all dukkhaAll of us have that instrument and the guidelines of the Buddha teach us the skill to use this instrument to the best advantage not to believe its moods and reactions to outer stimuli but to watch and protect it and realize its potential for complete liberationIf we want a good tool we need to look after it in the best possible mannerThis means not letting any dirt particles accumulate but to clean it up as quickly as possibleThe same criterion applies to our mindThis is probably the hardest skill to learn which is the reason so few people do itbut a meditator is on the right path towards just that by realizing that the mind cannot be believed implicitly being much too fanciful and fleetingThe four supreme efforts are called supreme not only because they are supremely difficult but also supremely beneficialA serious meditator wants to transcend the human realm while still in human form and these efforts are our challengeThey are so well explained by the Buddha that we can clearly see the difficulties we are faced with and the reasons why we are still roaming about in SamsaraBut we dont have to continue that unendinglyKnowing the path and the way to tread upon it we have the opportunity to become free of all fettersJust as were capable of changing the body at will the same applies to the mindChanging the body can occur when we eat less and get thin eat more and get fat drink too much alcohol and spoil our liver smoke too much and sicken our lungsWe can exercise to get muscles or train to run fast or jump high or to become very efficient at tennis or cricketThe body is able to do many things which ordinary people usually cannot do because they havent trained for thatWe know for example of people who can jump two or three times further than is common or run ten times faster than anyone elseWe may have seen people doing stunts with their bodies which look miraculousThere are also people who can use their minds in seemingly miraculous ways which are really just due to trainingMeditation is the only training there is for the mindPhysical training is usually connected with physical disciplineThe mind needs mental discipline practice in meditationFirst we can change our mind from unwholesome to wholesome thinkingJust like a person who wants to be an athlete has to start at the beginning of body training the same needs to be done for mind trainingFirst we cope with the ordinary later with the extraordinaryThe recollection of our own death brings us the realization that all that is happening will be finished very soon because all of us are going to dieEven though we may not know the exact date it is guaranteed to happenWith the death contemplation in mind it doesnt matter so much any more what goes on around us since all is only important for a very limited timeWe may be able to see that only our kammamaking matters doing the best we can every single day every single momentHelping others takes pride of placeThere is no substitute for thatSomeone else can benefit from our skills and possessions since we cannot keep them and cannot take them with usWe might as well give all away as quickly as possibleOne of the laws of the universe is the more one gives away the more one getsNobody believes it thats why everyone is trying to make more money and own more things yet it is a law of cause and effectIf we would believe it and act accordingly we would soon find outHowever it will only be effective if the giving is done in purityWe can give our time our caring our concern for others wellbeingWe have the immediate benefit of happiness in our own heart when we see the joy we have given to someone elseThis is about the only satisfaction we can expect in this life which is of a nature that does not disappear quickly because we can recollect the deed and our own happinessIf we really believe in our impending death not just use the words our attitude towards people and situations changes completelyWe are no longer the same person thenThe one we have been until now hasnt brought us complete satisfaction contentment and peacefulnessWe might as well become a different person with a new outlookWe no longer try to make anything last because we know the temporary nature of our involvementConsequently nothing has the same significance anymoreIt could be compared to inviting people to our home for a mealWe are worried and anxious whether the food will taste just right whether all the comforts are there and nothing missingThe house should be immaculate for the guestsWhile theyre visiting we are extremely concerned that theyre getting everything they could possibly wantAfterwards we are concerned whether they like it at our house were happy there are going to tell other friends that it was a pleasant visitThese are our attitudes because we own the placeIf we are a guest we dont care what food is being served because thats up to the hostessWe dont worry whether everything is in applepie order because its not our houseThis body is not our house no matter how long we liveIts a temporary arrangement of no significanceNothing belongs to us were guests hereMaybe well be present for another week or year or ten or twenty yearsBut being a guest what can it matter how everything worksThe only thing we can do when we are guest in someones house is trying to be pleasant and helpful to the people were withAll else is totally insignificant otherwise our consciousness will remain in the marketplaceDoesnt it only matter to elevate our consciousness and awareness to where we can see beyond our immediate concernsThere is always the same thing going on getting up eating breakfast washing dressing thinking and planning cooking buying things talking to people going to work going to bed getting up over and over againIs that enough for a lifetimeAll of us are trying to find something within that daily grind which will give us joyBut nothing lasts and moreover all are connected with reaching out to get somethingIf we were to remember each morning that death is certain but now have another day to live gratitude and determination can arise to do something useful with that dayOur second recollection may concern how to change our mind from enmity hurtfulness and unhappiness to their oppositesRepeated remembering makes it possible to change the mind graduallyThe body doesnt change overnight to become athletic and neither does the mind change instantlyBut if we dont continually train it its just going to stay the same it has always been which is not conductive to a harmonious and peaceful lifeMost people find a lot of unpleasantness anxiety and fear in their livesFear is a human condition based on our ego delusionWe are afraid that our ego will be destroyed and annihilatedThis willingness to change our mind should make it possible to live each day meaningfully which is the difference between just being alive and livingWe would do at least one thing each day which either entails spiritual growth for ourselves or helpfulness and consideration for others preferably bothIf we add one meaningful day to the next we wind up with a meaningful lifeOtherwise we have an egocentric life which can never be satisfyingIf we forget about our own desires and rejections and are just concerned with spiritual growth and eventual emancipation and being helpful to other people then our dukkha is greatly reducedIt reaches a point where it is only the underlying movement in all of existence and no longer personal suffering and unhappinessAs long as we suffer and are unhappy our lives are not very usefulHaving grief pain and lamentation does not mean we are very sensitive but rather that we havent been able to find a solutionWe spend hours and hours buying food preparing it eating it washing up afterwards and thinking about the next mealTwenty minutes of recollection on how we should live should not be taxing our timeNaturally we can also spend much more time on such contemplations which are a way to give the mind a new directionWithout training the mind is heavy and not very skillful but when we give the mind a new direction then we learn to protect our own happinessThis is not connected with getting what we want and getting rid of what we dont wantIts a skill in the mind to realize what is helpful and happiness producingThis new direction which arises from contemplation can be put into actionWhat can we actually doWe have all heard far too many words which sound right but words alone wont accomplish anythingThere has to be an underlying realization that these words require mental or physical actionThe Buddha mentioned that if we hear a Dhamma discourse and have confidence in its truth first we must remember the wordsThen we can see whether we are able to do what is required of usIf we contemplate to be free of enmity we can recollect such a determination again and againNow comes the next step How can we actualize thatWhen going about our daily life we have to be very attentive whether any enmity is arising and if so to substitute with love and compassionThat is the training of the mindThe mind doesnt feel so burdened then so bogged down in its own predetermined course because we realize change is possibleWhen the mind feels lighter and clearer it can expandActivating the teachings of the Buddha changes the awareness of the mind so that the everyday ordinary activities are no longer so significantThey are seen to be necessary to keep the body alive and the mind interested in the manifold proliferations that exist in the worldThe realization arises that if we have been able to change our mind even that much there may be more to the universe than we have ever been able to touch upon with the ordinary mindThe determination may come to make the mind extraordinaryJust as in an athlete enormous feats of balance discipline and strength of the body are possible just so it is feasible for the mindThe Buddha talked about expanded awareness as a result of proper concentration time and time againRight concentration means a change of consciousness because we are then not connected to the usual relative knowingBeing able to change our minds direction we are no longer so enmeshed in the ordinary affairs but know that there must be moreThrough having been disciplined strengthened and balanced a mind can perform feats of mental awareness which seem quite extraordinary but are just a result of trainingIt means getting out of the mental rutIf we have a wet driveway and drive a truck over it time and time again the ruts get deeper and deeper and in the end the truck may be stuck fastSuch are our habitual responses that we have in our everyday affairsPracticing meditation lifts us out of those ruts because the mind gets a new dimensionContemplation and resulting action make a new pathway in our lives where the old ruts are left behind Those were a constant reaction to our sense stimuli of hearing seeing smelling tasting touching and thinkingIts a great pity to use a good human life just to be a reactorIt is much more useful and helpful to become an actor which means deliberate thinking saying and doingIt is possible to eventually have the kind of concentration where the meditation subject is no longer neededThe meditation subject is nothing but a key or we can also call it a hook to hang the mind on so that it will not attend to worldly affairsWhen concentration has arisen it can be likened to the key having finally found the keyhole and the door being unlockedWhen we unlock the door of true samadhi we find a house with eight rooms which are the eight meditative absorptionsHaving been able to enter the first room there is no reason why with practice determination and diligence we cannot gradually enter into all of themHere the mind actually lets go of the thinking process as we know it and reverts to a state of experiencingThe first thing that happens when concentration has come together is a sense of well beingUnfortunately there is a mistaken view prevalent that the meditative absorptions are neither possible nor necessaryThis view is contrary to the Buddhas teachingAny instructions he has ever given for the pathway to liberation always included the meditative absorptionsThey are the eight steps on the noble eightfold pathIt is also incorrect to believe that it is no longer possible to attain true concentration many people do so without even realizing it and need support and direction to further their effortsMeditation needs to include the meditative absorptions because they are the expansion of consciousness providing access to a totally different universe than we have ever realizedThe mental states that arise through the meditative absorptions make it possible to live ones daily life with a sense of what is significant and what is notHaving seen for instance that it is possible to grow large trees one no longer believes that trees are always small even though the trees in ones own backyard may be tiny because the soil is poorIf one has seen large trees one knows they exist and one may even try to find a place where they growThe same applies to our mental statesHaving seen the possibility of expanded consciousness one no longer believes that ordinary consciousness is all there is or that the breath is all there is to meditationThe breathe is the hook that we hang the mind on so that we can open the door to true meditationHaving opened the door we experience physical wellbeing manifesting in many different waysIt may be a strong or a mild sensation but it is always connected with a pleasant feelingOf that pleasure the Buddha said This is a pleasure I will allow myself Unless one experiences the joy of the meditative state which is independent of the world one will never resign from the world but will continue to see the world as ones homeOnly when one realizes that the joy in the meditative state is independent of all worldly conditions will one finally be able to say The world and its manifold attractions are not interesting any more so that dispassion will set inOtherwise why should one resign from that which occasionally does give pleasure and joy if one has nothing elseHow can one do thatIt is impossible to let go of all the joys and pleasures which the world offers if one has nothing to replace themThis is the first reason why in the Buddhas teaching the meditative absorptions are of the essenceWe cant let go when we are still under the impression that with this body and these senses we can get what were looking for namely happinessThe Buddha encourages us to look for happiness but we need to look in the right placeHe said we would be able to protect our own happinessEven the very first instance of gaining physical pleasure in meditation already illuminates the fact that something inside ourselves gives joy and happinessThe physical wellbeing also arouses pleasurable interest which helps to keep us on the meditation pillowAlthough it is a physical sensation it is not the same sort of feeling that we are familiar withIt is different because it has arisen from a different sourceOrdinary pleasant physical feelings come from touch contactThis one comes from concentrationObviously having different causes they must also be different in their resultsTouch is gross concentration is subtleTherefore the meditative feeling has a more subtle spiritual quality than the pleasant feeling one can get through touchKnowing clearly that the only condition necessary for happiness is concentration we will refrain from our usual pursuits of seeking pleasant people tasty food better weather more wealth and not squander our mental energy on thoseThis is therefore a necessary first step towards emancipationWe are now entering mind states that go beyond the everyday worldly affairs We all know the mind that is connected with ordinary mattersSuch a mind worries about all sorts of things is anxious has plans memories hopes dreams likes dislikes and reactionsIts a very busy mindFor the first time we may become acquainted with a mind which doesnt contain all these aspectsPleasurable wellbeing has no thinking attached to it its an experienceHere we finally realize that the kind of thinking were aware of will not give us the results we had hoped forIt is just good enough to project a willingness to meditateWe learn even from that very first step that the world cannot do for us what concentration can doHappiness independent of outer conditions is far more satisfying than anything to be found in the worldWe are also shown that the mind has the ability to expand into a different consciousness with which we had no previous contact so that we gain firsthand experience of the fact that meditation is the means for spiritual emancipationBecause of having had this pleasurable feeling an inner joy arisesThis gives the meditator the assurance that the pathway towards nonself is a pathway of joy and not of dukkhaThereby the natural resistance to nonself is greatly lessenedMost people resist the idea that they are nobody even after they have understood it intellectuallyBut being able to experience these first two aspects of meditation gives a clear indication that this is only possible when the self which is always thinking is temporarily buriedBecause when the self is active it immediately says Oh isnt that nice and the concentration is finishedIt has to be and experience where nothing says I am experiencing The explanation and understanding of what one has experienced comes laterThis is a clear realization that without self the inner joy is a much greater and more profound nature than any happiness one has known in this lifeTherefore the determination to really come to grips with the Buddhas teachings will come to fruitionUntil then most people pick out a few aspects of the Dhamma which theyve heard about and think that is sufficientIt may devotion chanting festivals doing good works moral behavior all of which is fine but the reality of the teaching is a great mosaic in which all these different pieces fall together into one huge all encompassing wholeAnd the central core is nonselfIf we use only a few of these mosaic pieces we will never get the whole pictureBut being able to meditate makes a great deal of difference in ones approach to that whole conglomerate of teaching which encompasses body and mind and completely changes the person who practices like thatWe have to base our meditative ability on our daily practiceWe cannot hope to sit down and meditate successfully if all we can think about are worldly affairs and if we do not try to reduce anger envy jealousy pride greed hate rejection in daily lifeIf we use mindfulness clear comprehension and a calming of sensual desires we have a foundation for meditationAs we practice in everyday affairs in conjunction with meditation we see a slow and gradual change as if an athlete has been trainingThe mind becomes strong and attends to the important issues in lifeIt doesnt get thrown about by everything that happensIf we can give some time for contemplation and meditation each day and not forget mindfulness we have a very good beginning for an expansion of consciousnessEventually the universe and we ourselves look quite different based on our changed viewpointThere is a Zen saying First the mountain is a mountain then the mountain is no longer a mountain and in the end the mountain is a mountain again First we see everything in its relative reality every person is a different individual every tree is a particular kind everything has some significance to our own livesThen we start practicing and suddenly we see everything in its relative reality every person is a different individual every tree is a particular kind everything has some significance to our own livesThen we start practicing and suddenly we see a different reality which is universal and expansiveWe become very involved with our own meditation and do not pay much attention to what is going on around usWe see an expansion and elevation of our consciousness know that our everyday reactions are not importantFor a while we may pay attention to just that and to living in a different realityIn the end we come right back to where we were doing all the same things as before but no longer being touched by themA mountain is just a mountain againEverything returns to the same ordinary aspect it used to have except its no longer significant or separateA description of an arahant in the Discourse on Blessings is although touched by worldly circumstance never the mind is wavering The Enlightened One is touched by worldly circumstances he acts like everybody else he eats sleeps washes and talks to people but the mind does not waverThe mind stays cool and peaceful at all timesIf we want to understand kamma and rebirth correctly we have to see them in the light of nonselfThey proclaim nonself quite vividly and yet most people usually dont take that into consideration at all but talk about my kamma and my rebirthEspecially my rebirth which is absurdDo they mean the last one or future oneDo we think it will be me againHowever in ordinary language we have little choice yet the spoken word has evolved out of our thinking processesPeople often ask what is reborn if it isnt meKamma as a residual effect in the rebirth consciousness is reborn but it certainly doesnt look or act like the one we know doesnt have the same name may not have the same form or sex may not even be humanIt has no other connection than kammaSince we can see quite clearly that the one who is reborn only connects through kamma in the rebirth consciousness with a previous life we can see just as clearly that kamma is impersonal without identityWhile we talk about my kamma its really an impersonal processIt is not crime and punishment although it may appear like that and is one of the most commonly held viewsMany of our entrenched views are so deeply ingrained that it becomes extremely difficult to understand anything radically differentKamma actually just means actionIn the India of the Buddha thats how it was understoodIn order to make people aware of what it really implies the Buddha said Kamma oh monks I declare is intention which arises first in our thoughts then generates speech and actionThis was the new interpretation that the Buddha gave to kamma because it was largely misunderstood and used as predetermined destinyThere were teachers in his day that taught it that way which was denounced by the Buddha as wrong view misleading and liable to have unwholesome resultsThis view of predetermined destiny is just as rampant today as it was at the Buddhas timeIt is often voiced like this Theres nothing I can do about it its my kamma This is the greatest folly one can adhere to because it puts the onus of ones own intentions on some nebulous previous person whom one doesnt even knowIn other words one doesnt take responsibility for ones own actions which is a very common failingIt is harder to find a person who does take responsibility than to find one who doesntMost people dont want to take responsibility for themselves if they can just manage to stay aliveFrom that difficulty arises the idea of predetermined destinyWhat can I do its not my fault its my kamma That takes away all possibility for practicing the DhammaThe Buddha said If that were so the holy life would not be possible nor would it be feasible to become enlightened This is the first wrong view that one has to quickly eliminate from ones thinking process if one wants to practice a spiritual disciplineKamma is intention and intention is now which means kamma is being made now in every waking momentHowever when two people make the same kamma they do not get the same resultsThis is another point the Buddha emphasizedSince kamma is impersonal it is strictly concerned with a flow of events which are creating results by themselvesIts a matter of cause and effectThats all there is and the Buddhas teaching is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effectSometimes we see people who are very nice they would not hurt a fly and yet a lot of misfortune befalls themOr others who are difficult and unfriendly but everything always seems to go right for themHow is it possibleIt depends entirely upon their accumulations of good or bad kamma that have resulted in their particular mind continuumThe Buddha gave the following simile If one puts a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water that cup becomes undrinkableIf one puts a teaspoon of salt in the Ganges River it doesnt make the slightest difference to the river the water remains exactly the same If one makes bad kamma and has only a cupful of good kamma the results will be disastrousIf one has a river full of good kamma to support one the results will be negligibleTherefore we can never compare the results that people have because we dont know their past historiesThe residual mind continuum that we bring with us certainly has a bearing on this life particularly on where we are born under what circumstances and in what sort of familyThe Buddha gave a simile for that If there is a herd of cows locked in a barn and the barn door is opened the cow that is the strongest will go out firstIf there isnt one like that then the one who is the habitual leader will go out first if there is no habitual leader then the one nearest the door will go out firstIf there is none like that they will all try to go out at the same time This depicts the mind moments at deathSince death is imminent for everyone no matter what their age it is skillful to be ready for it nowThe last thought moment at death is the one that impels the rebirth consciousness to its next destinationWe can compare that to going to sleep at night and our last thought moment is that we will wake up at four oclock in the morningMost people can easily do thatThe last thought moment becomes the first one upon wakingDying is exactly the same except that the body that wakes up is a new one and looks different nowIt is likely that it will be a human being again unless one has behaved too badly for such a rebirthEven though people often wish for rebirth in a deva realm most people probably return as human beingsThe last thought moment is the one that connects with the strongest experience in this life timeIf for instance one has murdered a person that would be a very strong memory and could be the last thought momentIf one has built a monastery or temple that may be a very strong though formationOr if one has always kept ones moral conduct intact that may be the last thought momentWhatever is the strongest in ones mind that is most likely to ariseOtherwise ones habitual thinking takes overIf one has usually been dissatisfied or angry then that will be in the mindIf one has had much livingkindness compassion and helpfulness toward others those thoughts will ariseIf there is no particular thinking habit then that which comes nearest the sense doors at death takes precedenceThe last sense to go is hearingIt is very common therefore in most religions that some devotional words are chanted by monks or priests which may help to have a good last thought momentIf these last mental formations are wholesome ones rebirth will be favorableThat doesnt mean that the rest of the kamma resultants disappearIt only means that the impulsion that arises at death takes a certain directionTherefore the last thought moments are of crucial importanceIf one has been a very generous person that can be a last thoughtIt is therefore considered extremely beneficial to remind a dying person of all the good things they have done in this life such as their generosity bringing up their children well their kindness because ordinary worldlings are apt to have regrets and selfblameIt has in recent years been recognized that dying is a very important part of living even though in the West many people do not believe in rebirthEveryone pays a lot of attention to a baby being born because that baby is going to be around for a long time and will be an important member of the familyBut few have paid sufficient attention to the death moment because after all that person is gone finishedbut it is now understood that this is not a wholesome way of treating a human being and in the West there are many hospitals for terminally ill and dying people where great attention is paid to their mind states to reduce or eliminate fear and anxietyYet hardly anyone there believes in rebirth but even without that death is considered very importantAnother factor has entered into our death experienceWe are now technologically advanced enough so that in some instances people who were clinically dead could be brought back to life using new methods that are available in Western hospitalsA number of these people talked to their doctors about their death experiencesSome doctors particularly DrMoody wrote about these phenomenaAn outstanding feature of the stories told is the fact that they were practically identical in their important aspectsThis gives us another clue to nonselfAll of them without fail were extremely pleased with their death and reluctant to come backOne woke up extremely angry at the doctor for being instrumental in reestablishing the life continuumThe experiences were all connected with a very bright light containing total awareness of the mind but lacking a bodyEach person was able to see hisher own body in the hospital bed and wandered off towards the bright light quite aware of these occurrences including watching the doctor at workThen removing themselves from the hospital and entering an area of bliss happiness and great peace some of them talked about beings they metMost of them described one particular being which was light None of the descriptions had any religious symbolism in them but all of them were similar some identicalWith such books becoming more widely known the death moment has gained its rightful importanceIn the five daily recollections the Buddha asks us to remember that we are of the nature to dieAt other times he talks about the fact that the last thought moment is extremely important and consequently it is essential to get ones thoughts in order nowOn ones deathbed its too lateThe wholesome aspects of our thoughts are always connected with loving kindness compassion generosity and equanimityIf we arouse those in our minds now as a habitual way of thinking we can carry that with us to our deathbedWe are then assured not only of a favorable rebirth at the very least but also of harmony during our lifetimeThis will make it possible for us to easily practice the Dhamma againIf we are born into a very poor family where nobody has enough to eat it will be very difficult to sit down in meditation because in a poor family everybody has to work to surviveIf we are reborn in a society where meditation is unknown it will be very difficult to continue our practiceIt is not wise therefore to wait till old age and death but rather get our thinking process in order nowThis entails knowing our thoughtformation through mindfulness and attentionOur appearance here is very shortlived  even years is not very long  so we can think of ourselves as a guest performer always waiting for applauseNaturally that makes life pretty difficultFirst one has stage frightIs one going to perform properlyHaving given the performance will the applause be followingIf one doesnt get it one feels devastatedBeing a guest performer on this planet is a skillful way of thinking but waiting for the applause is wrong viewIf we know that were being the best we can with all our faculties we dont have to wait for somebody elses approvalWe can have right intention again and againThats what matters most because intention towards goodness concerns both oneself and othersLess selfconcern frees us to embrace othersWe must not decline in Dhamma and meditation practice of course because only if we have developed ourselves to some extent can we help others otherwise we act in ignorance which will not bring good resultsIf we are concerned with our next rebirth we are really living in a dreamThe person who is making the kamma now is not the one whos going to reap the resultsThe only connection will be the kammic residue the resultEven this connection is very tenuous because we can break the chainIf a person has made a lot of bad kamma and in the next rebirth makes much good kamma the bad resultants may never fruit and vice versaThe case in point is Angulimala who killed people and yet became an arahant because he came to be in a monastery under the Buddha where his bad kamma didnt get a chance to fruitHowever Mahamoggallana already an arahant was killed by robbers and his bones pulverized due to past kammaWe cannot establish a credit account of good kamma against all eventualities because we have no jurisdiction over the person who will inherit the kamma that we made in this lifeBut making good kamma now brings immediate results happiness and contentment in the mind and usually some happiness for others alsoIf one is able to give happiness to others there is again a cause for joy for oneselfIts useless to think about kamma made in a past life or to be made in a future lifeNone of us will know anything about the next life nor do we remember anything from our last lifeWhy worry about these thenOnly this moment right now is importantThe past is like a dream and the future is yet to comeWhen the future actually happens its always the presentTomorrow never comes when it does its called todayOne cannot live in the future nor in the pastOne can only live this single momentIf we really paid attention to every single moment we would meditate wellWe would also have no doubt about impermanenceIn fact we would see it so clearly we could let go of our attachments our clingingWe could consider thus Have I used every moment to the best advantage If we have made some bad kamma in the past we can resolve to quickly perform some good actionThats the only value the past can provideOtherwise the most effective and compelling aspect of impermanence is that we are moving away from thought speech and action so quickly that we cannot even remember them never mind hold on to themYet were trying to hold on to other people to our ideas views and opinions we hang on to this body to physical manifestation and mental aberrations and try to make them solidIts impossible and cannot be done theres only each momentWe can easily see in digital clocks how each moment comes and goesJust watch a clock for five minutes and realize five precious moments of your live are goneThe past is actually forgotten except some highlights but otherwise it has disappearedThat shows us with clarity that we are a flowing phenomenon without any substanceWere putting a substance into it out of an ignorant appraisal of totally untrue reality in which we are livingIt is like a theater something we have made up ourselves where people wear costumes and say their lines and believe this to be real lifeWe want to keep the theater going but that is not possible and so everybody has dukkha which cannot be eliminated through nonknowing or indifference but only through a change of awareness and viewKammamaking is initially in the mindOur mental formations make our kammaUnless we become master of our mind we cannot escape from making bad kammaThe mind is constantly in danger of thinking something unwholesomeThe negativities in the mind are innumerable I dont like it cant stand it Im afraid its boring All are negativities concerned with angerI want to get it keep it renew it are also bad kamma connected with greedAll arise in the mindVery few people watch their mindThey believe it to be difficult and tiringBut its much more tiring to make bad kamma because the results are heavy and unpleasantVery few people have that inner buoyancy which denotes independent joyMost people are bogged down by their minds negativities not by outer circumstancesWatching ones own mind and making sure that one practices the four supreme efforts is the most beneficial thing one can do for oneself and secures good kammaOut of our thoughts arise speech and actionWe cant talk without having thought it first and we cant act without having made up our mind to do soAlthough people speak and act so impulsively that they are not aware that a thought has gone ahead that doesnt mean there was noneIt just means that mindfulness and clear comprehension were lackingOur mind is the most precious asset we haveNo jewel can compare with it because the mind contains the seed of enlightenmentUnless we use it properly were foolishly burying a jewel in the dirtPeople often do so primarily because they have had no training otherwiseWhen we recognize that we have this most precious jewel of a mind we will guard it from being scratched bumped and dirtied losing its luster and brilliance but rather make sure that it remains pure and luminous and thereby make good kammaThe action itself the Buddha said is not of the foremost importance its the intention behind itEven generosity can be extended from a wrong motivationIf the intention is to store up some merit for the future thats rather selfishIf its done out of compassion for those who have less that is the ideal wayYet even with wrong motivation its still better to be generous than notTheres good kamma in it because one has let go of something that one ownsThe guard we keep on our mind will assure that whatever we do is done with right intention the second step on the Noble Eightfold Path which is our guidelineKamma making depends on the mind and the minds purity depends on meditationIf we meditate diligently and regularly eventually we will see with clarity what goes on in our mindSome people are satisfied with gaining a little peace but even that is already an advantage and growth aspectIf we watch the mind in meditation we will learn to watch the mind also in daily livingThen we have a very good chance of making good kammaIf we become tired of the everrecurring cycle of loss and gain praise and blame fame and illfame happiness and unhappiness we need to make a determined effort to shed clinging and cravingThis effort has meditation as its base but thats not allMeditation is a means for gaining access to the ability to rid oneself of the tendencies of greed and hateThe meditative process gives the mind the clarity to see these tendencies within oneself so that one can do something about themOur duty in this life as human beings with senses and bodies intact and able to hear the true Dhamma is to guard our mind and experience its original nature which is purity luminosity pliabilitySuch a mind can reach the depth of the teaching where we find nobody that owns the mindThe Buddha spoke about five spiritual faculties which turn into spiritual powers if we cultivate and develop themWe all have these faculties within and developing them means making them powerful qualities which become factors of enlightenmentAs long as they are only faculties they are potentials for enlightenmentThe Buddha compared them to a team of horses with one lead horse and two pairs that are pulling a wagonThe lead horse can go as fast or as slow as it likes the others have to fall into step with itThe pairs have to be in balance with each other otherwise if one goes faster than the other the wagon will toppleThe leading faculty is mindfulnessIt is up to us how much of it we can find in any given momentMindfulness is a momenttomoment mental factor which can be compared to an observerIf we have an observer with us all the time it is more likely that we will stay on the pathThe first pair that has to be balanced is faith and wisdomThere is an analogy that the Buddha gave for these two qualities he compared faith to a blind giant who meets up with a small very sharpeyed cripple called wisdomThe blind giant named faith says to the small sharpeyed cripple named wisdom Im strong and can go very fast but I cant see where Im goingYoure small and weak but have sharp eyesIf you will ride on my shoulders together we could go very far This tells us that faith without wisdom while being a strong faculty is yet unable to find the right directionWe say faith can move mountains but being blind faith doesnt know which mountain needs movingHowever coupled with wisdom there is enormous potentialThe reason for such strength is that heart and mind are brought into harmonyThe mind can have wisdom and the heart can have faithWhen heart and mind are brought to a point of coexistence of no separation the power which develops is far greater than just  It is more like to the power ofFaith as a quality in the heart has such great value because it is connected with loveWe can only have faith in something or someone we loveFaith is also connected to devotion which is a giving of oneself and a lessening of prideThese are valuable and necessary spiritual qualitiesIf we are devoted to a high ideal such as BuddhaDhammaSangha then we have the understanding that there is something greater than ourselvesThe devotion we can have for that ideal is manifested in giving our love and admiration respect and gratitude which are very important and helpful qualities to developBut the Buddha taught that blind faith is uselessBlind faith means that one believes what one is told without personal investigation that one has faith in something that ones family adheres to or because it has been written down in special books because it has been transmitted from teacher to disciple because it is something that one likes anyway that promises some mystical revelation or because the teacher is a respected personAll these are no reasons to follow a spiritual pathDo not believe because somebody told you soBut if there is some wisdom in the mind and without it life would be quite unbearable we can quite easily investigate whether our faith and devotion are justifiedWe can for instance verify the first and second Noble Truths within ourselves many times in a dayIf we do that we know what they mean only believing them is not very helpful because it will not make any difference in our hearts and mindsWe can check out the impermanence and unsatisfactoriness of all worldly phenomena without much difficultyThereby we gradually gain more and more wisdomThe unwavering faith in the BuddhaDhammaSangha is one of the results that a streamenterer gains when she has the first path moment because until then the fetter of doubt still existsIf we have established unwavering faith within ourselves in the veracity and exactitude of the Buddhas teachings we have taken an important stepThe heart quality within us will have opened up in a way which will be most helpful but understanding has to go alongIn Pali the one word citta denotes feeling and thinking but in English we have to distinguish between heart and mind because we consider feeling a heart quality and thinking a mind quality otherwise we cant express what we really meanOur thinking capacity is rationality and logic which is impaired by our emotionalism by the reactions to our feelingsThe formula for growth is purification of emotions brings clarification of thought If our emotions are pure as they are for example in devotion gratitude respect and faith our thoughts have a much greater capacity for clarityThe impure emotions connected with passions of either wanting or not wanting are those which hinder our thinking capacityWe cant think straight when we are under the sway of strong emotionsOur education system doesnt take any notice of that nor do parents teach this to their children yet the Buddha taught it quite clearlyEach human being has a right and left hemisphere in the brain which we classify as male and female the right being female left being maleThe left or male side is in charge of the right side of the body and vice versaJust as the pairs of horses have to balance both sides male and female have to attain a harmonious wholeThe male side is usually connected to our rationality logic linear thinking understandingThe female side is connected to feelings nurturing caring compassion love all the emotional qualitiesEach of us has both sides the emotional and the mental capacityVery few people develop both equallyTherefore their cart often topplesEmotionalism is just as much a danger as thinking without being in touch with ones feelingsThat too can go very much astrayIn school we were taught to debateWe were given a subject to debate with another childWhen we finished we changed sides and were asked to hold the opposite view and debate giving all factors of the other sideAny child can do it any grownup can do itIt is just straightforward thinkingOne can have the opposite opinion by the flip of a coinThere is no inherent truth in any opinion because its simply linear thinkingHowever if these thoughts are connected to our feelings we can no longer debate the opposite sideThis is the old story of having to bite into a mango to know its tasteWe can be told many things about a mangoIts sweet delicious soft but we cannot imagine its taste unless we get the feeling of the mango on our tongue and have the personal experienceThen we can no longer debate whether the mango is sweet or not because we have experienced the truthThis is the difference between just thinking or thinking coupled with the experience of feelingA person who goes too far on the side of rational thinking has to learn to balance with feelings the female sideAnyone who thinks to the extent where the experience of feelings is hardly known has to practice much mindfulness of feelingsOn the other hand the female side is often emotionalismThis means we are carried away by our emotions and consequently our thinking is impairedThe quality of logical thinking of delving into a thought process and being able to analyze is not possible when the emotions are at the forefrontOf course in women this has a connection to the mores of the patriarchal society but primarily it is due to the fact of not having developed ones potential for both sides which is inherent in all of usThe person who is primarily analytical is often under the impression that this will actually bring about all the desired resultsSuch a person unless prodded and told often enough will not try to get in touch with feelingsThe one who is always relating and reacting to emotions is so habituated that she can no longer do anything else until shown through the meditative process that there is an alternativeIf one lives only in relation and in reaction to ones emotions life can become quite difficultPeople who live like that often try to deaden their emotions as a way out of their dilemmaThats of course not the answer rather to purify themNaturally the person who is a thinker also has to purify the emotions but before such a person can do that she first needs to get in touch with themThe one who lives with emotions and reacts to them all the time also has to be in touch with them but not to deaden them but to encourage wholesome reactionsAs the purification of the emotions takes place thinking will no longer be overshadowed by diffuse uncertaintiesUnless we do that we only use half of our potentialThis is what faith and wisdom can mean to us the emotions and the thinkingWhen we cultivate both we develop our faculties into powersHarmonizing our emotional with our thinking capacities is the essence of harmonizing faith with wisdomA powerful mind is a great asset but only in conjunction with purified emotionsFaith is one such purified emotionFaith is much easier for people whose primary defilement is greed rather than hateFaith arouses pleasant feelings which is greeds directionIn this case greed is an asset although basically it is of course a negative characteristicBut if we use it in a positive way we are engaged in a purification process wanting that which is wholesome which leads us to the supermundaneFirst greed opens up into faith resulting in pleasant feelingsThen we can use greed to want successful meditation streamentry liberationAll are cravings but theyre going in the right direction of using greed to get rid of greedThat is our best approach because greed is only truly eliminated by the nonreturnerIf we use our craving in that manner we are at least searching for that which will give us the greatest benefit rather than pleasure through the sensesThe Buddhas path is called the middle path which means a path of balanceWe have to balance all extremes so that they become a useful basis for a harmonious person whose practice will flourishThis is one reason why the Buddha recommended the meditation on the loathsomeness of the bodyPeople often say they dont want to think of their body as loathsome it is a good working machine and very usefulBut we are actually enamored with our body we are hanging on to it loving it trying to preserve it keeping it young and beautifying itWe are attached to it and consider it me The loathsomeness of the body meditation is not designed to disgust us but only to create a balance to our identification with our bodyWe can compare this with walking on a tightrope if we balance too far to the right we fall down too far on the left we toppleConstant balancing is necessary which has to be done by everyone for themselvesIf we know ourselves to be reacting to our emotions we need to start analyzing and inquiring into ourselvesIt is difficult for someone who has always lived in reaction to their emotions to see beyond themThe meditation practice helps greatly because the tranquillity that is bound to arise to some extent is conducive to penetration into realityWe need some selfknowledge otherwise we cant make any changesIntrospection and attention to ones feelings and thoughts should provide enough insight into ourselves to lay the foundation for a meaningful changeThe other pair is energy and concentrationIts not physical energy thats needed but rather mental energy which has little to do with the capacities of the bodyWe need unwavering determination for this practice which is transformed energyThe Buddha compared us with the man whos wearing a turban that is on fireObviously if a man is wearing a turban that is on fire he is most anxious to get rid of itThat same kind of determination is needed to practice diligentlyEnergy is also dependent upon onepointed directionWe realize what is most important and dont vacillate between social life social action practice entertainment and the many other options open to usEverybody has more energy for those things they likeWe have to be very careful that we dont use up our energy searching for pleasant sense contacts because we like themWe have to be attentive to the fact that pleasant sense contacts are so shortlived they will never give us complete satisfaction and that were using up our energy without getting any real fulfillmentSo it turns into a waste of our energyIf we see clearly through attention mindfulness and introspection that if we put our energy into meditation and practice of Dhamma our dukkha is greatly reduced thereby and that we actually have a mode of living which includes everything else then we will certainly turn in that directionThe rest of daily living happens anywayMost people use up about  of their energy just to stay aliveNot that they have to work so hard to make a living but just to attend to their daily duties and responsibilities just to keep goingIf our energy is used for meditation mindfulness and bare attention the mind faculties sharpen to the point where minor things and duties necessary to stay alive are done in an easy and harmonious flowWe can start using our energy for that which is most importantIf energy is not coupled with concentration it becomes restlessness and we can notice that in meditationSometimes there is no concentration yet there is a lot of energyThen mind and body become restless we would like to jump up and run awayIf concentration is too strong and there is no energy then the third hindrance arises namely sloth and torporThat is also easily noticeable in meditationPeople who are used to concentrating and can do it well may occasionally lack energy and consequently concentration becomes conducive to sleepinessThat is a time when the meditation should be directed towards insight rather than calmCalm meditation which is pure concentration may result in sleepiness when there is not enough energyBut insight meditation with attention on impermanence the constant arising and ceasing of thoughts and feelings may bring up the energy that is neededAs we only have a limited amount of vigor we have to use it in the best possible wayMost people do not realize that energy is a great asset and squander it on totally irrelevant activitiesWhen we realize that it is essential for the spiritual path then we may become more careful with itAs the body gets older physical energy is reduced but that does not have to include mind energyOn the contraryWhen the body is young and full of vigor a lot of physical activity may take place and the mind may be neglectedIn an older person when body activity becomes less the mind may receive most of the attention and mental energy could be increasedEnergy and concentration have to balance primarily in meditationWhen these faculties become powers they result in the meditative absorptionsWhen wisdom becomes a power it means insight into the three characteristics of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and corelessnessWhen faith turns into a power then it also manifests as the four immeasurable emotions loving kindness compassion sympathetic joy equanimityMindfulness is a power when all four foundations are habitually attended toTo become a master of all of these aspects is an ideal but to practice them is a necessityAnd since all of us have these faculties within there is every reason to cultivate themOne finds oneself a more harmonious and balanced person with less difficulties capable of helping othersTo develop these five faculties should be a primary object in ones lifeThe balancing of them needs to be seen as connecting heart with mindThere are three ways to approach the DhammaOne is by acquiring knowledge through study of the Buddhas discourses trying to remember them as faithfully as possibleThat is very useful for the propagation of the teaching through lectures and booksAnother way is through devotion offering flowers and incense reciting devotional verses giving gifts and making meritGenerosity and meritorious action were highly recommended by the Buddha but he didnt put any value on just being in the presence of monks and nunsOnce there was a monk who was so enraptured with the Buddha that he never wanted to be out of his sightWhen this monk became sick one day and was unable to see the Buddha he became despondentThe other monks asked him why he was so unhappyHe explained that he was depressed because he could not see the Buddha who then came to visit the sick monk and said to him What do you see in this vile formThere is nothing to see in thatWhoever sees me sees the Dhamma whoever sees Dhamma sees meThe third approach to Dhamma namely practice has always been the one most highly recommended by the BuddhaHe said a person with real reverence and devotion is one who lives according to the teachingThere are a number of steps to be taken when we approach the Dhamma through practiceThe foundation would be moral conduct meritorious actions making good kammaWithout such a foundation we do not have enough security within to be peaceful and at ease with ourselves which are prerequisites for meditationThis has sometimes been misinterpreted to mean that we should not meditate unless we have already complete purity of precepts and gained perfect mindfulnessBut that doesnt follow because its meditation that helps us to gain mindfulness and gives us insight into the efficacy of the preceptsThe next practice aspect is to guard our sensesThis is frequently mentioned by the Buddha so that it bears repeating and rememberingWithout guarding our senses we are always open to being tempted into wanting and craving resulting in turmoil in the mindOur sense contacts are triggers for lust and hateOur senses are so permanently engaged that we have lost sight of their impact are taking all that for granted and think thats just the way it isWe also believe that what we see hear taste touch smell and think is really exactly as we are interpreting itThats a fundamental errorEveryone experiences their sense contacts in an individual mannerHere is an example The food Westerners eat is considered baby food in Asia food spiced in the Asian way appears like hellfire to the Western palateEven such a basic necessity as food shows up as a completely opposite experienceWe can infer from that that we all live in our own worldPeople argue vehemently because they believe their world must be the right one and even kill each other because of unresolved differencesThe Buddha was often asked such a question as Is the world finite or infinite eternal or not His answer was What is the worldThe world is our sense contacts When asked questions such as these the Buddha always brought the questioner back to practiceWhen we know that the world we live in consists of our sense contacts we have something to practice withWhen we know that the world is eternal or not what is there to practice withOur senses include thinking which is an almost constantly operating facultyAt this moment we have touch sound sight and thought contactFour of our six senses are engagedBecause our senses have been at work all our lives we believe that is the only way life can be experienced which creates our deep craving to continue in this formThere is danger in this craving something most people are not aware of consciouslySubconsciously we all know about it because thats where our fears originateIf we examine ourselves for a moment we will realize that we harbor many fears all carrying different namesSome people are afraid of spiders or snakes some are afraid of the dark some are afraid of airplanes others that their loved ones may die or that they might lose all their moneyAll sorts of different names for exactly the same fear the fear of losing ones identifications the fear of unpleasant painful sense contacts ultimately the fear of annihilationYet losing this existence is a guaranteed outcome of being aliveIts just a matter of timeThese fears are caused by our attachment to our pleasant sense contacts identifying with them and believing that apart from our senses there is no other realityNaturally we want that to continue thenWe take our unpleasant experiences in stride expecting them to cease and the pleasant ones to arise againIf our unpleasant sense contacts are in the majority then we say we are having a lot of dukkhaOr we might say Im having a problem As a matter of fact we are all having the same problem namely that of not being enlightenedWhen we come to the realization that our sense contacts are very momentary and their inherent satisfaction a matter of opinion we will find it easier to let go of them during meditationMeditation will only happen when the sense contacts particularly the thinking are suspendedIf for instance the touch contact in the sitting position is recognized and attended to as unpleasant the mind starts working on thatRemembering what someone said yesterday last week or even ten years ago can start the mind churningThis is all due to our attachment to our senses and our identification with themFrom all sense contacts feelings arise there is no way that can be altered but we can stop ourselves from reacting to such feelings and believing that they belong to usTo get our meditation to a concentrated state we must refuse to react to feelings arisen from sense contactsThe more we practice this in daily life the easier it will be to become concentrated in meditationWe dont have to go along with this natural reaction of human beingsMeditative absorptions are supermundane and therefore require supermundane qualities in usWhenever the Buddha described the way to Nibbana he included the meditative absorptions as part of the practice to lead us to the inner realization of the DhammaGuarding our senses is not only important in meditation but equally valid in daily lifeIn a meditation course where there isnt as much input as in ordinary situation it is a little easier to protect our minds from liking or disliking what we see hear taste touch smell and thinkIn order to facilitate this we need to practice hearing only sounds without explaining to ourselves what it is we heardWhen the mind starts telling its story about the sound at least we will know what we are doing namely investing sound with a reality which gives it importanceThe same applies to eye contactIf for instance we are looking at a bush our mind will say Oh a cinnamon bush who planted itI wonder if we can use it Or any number of other ideasInstead of all this we can look at that which we call bush and be aware that our eyes are touching upon a form and thereby stopping the mind from making up storiesIf we can manage to do this once or twice outside of meditation we can use the same method of handling sense input in meditationWhen we guard ourselves against the mindmade details of sense contacts we are in less danger of falling into greed and hateWe will find this a great help in becoming concentrated in meditationOur lives are governed by our senses but we do not have to continue with thatIt is not compulsoryWithin the operation of our six senses it is not possible to find continued and unadulterated happinessIf it were possible we would already be blissfully contented since we have been having sense input day after day life after lifeThe answer does not lie in improving our sense contacts even though most people do try that but rather in improving our reactions so that eventually equanimity becomes our mode of livingThis is the promise the Buddha made to us namely that we can get out of all dukkha all problems but not by having only wonderful sense contacts and not a single moment of unpleasantnessSuch a thing has never been possible not even when the Buddha himself was aliveBut we can have moments when we are actually able to do just thatThat one moment gives us the initial experience what it is like to be free which is the only kind of freedom to be found in human lifeThere is no otherAnyone who understands the Buddhas explicit instructions especially those who meditate can practice in this mannerThe next step to be taken is mindfulness accompanied by clear comprehensionMindfulness is the mental factor of just knowing clear comprehension the one of understandingWe need bothThat too can and should be practiced in daily lifeMindfulness of the body was praised by the Buddha as leading to the deathless a synonym for NibbanaWhen we watch our bodys actions and realize that it can only follow the minds instructions this is our first step into insightUsually we take mind and body for grantedMost people are more interested in their body than in their mind and are looking after the body very wellVery few people are looking after their mindBeing aware of our bodys movements gives us a chance to be alert without thinking just knowingClear comprehension is our fourpronged mode of discrimination described previouslyWe might think that such discrimination would slow us down unduly that we wont be able to get our work doneActually it has the opposite effect because we will not do anything that is unnecessaryWhen we use mindfulness and clear comprehension again and again they will become a habit which will enhance our abilities to attain calm and insightWhen we experience our mind ordering our body around this is different from just knowing about itWe become intimately acquainted with our dual aspect of mind and body and can begin to investigate where is me in thatWe may eventually find that me is our wish to be eternal not to be annihilatedMost people would like to experience calm bliss and tranquillity in meditationBut those whose minds are very active need to gain insight first in order to become calmThose whose minds are more peaceful in any case find it easier to become calm first and gain insight laterA little calm creates a little insight and vice versaIn practice we work on both these aspects to give ourselves the best chance to develop both simultaneouslyWhen we watch the breath going in and out of the nostrils we try to achieve a calm and peaceful mindWhen the mind strays to thinking we first realize Im thinking and then see the impermanent nature of each thought and how it so often rolls along without any purposeThis is a valuable insight because we can infer that our thoughts are frequently not to be believed are unimportant have no solidity and do not provide a secure foothold for usWithout such an experience we might continue to believe all our thoughts and try using them as solid foundations for our lifebut when we see in meditation that we cant remember what we were thinking from one second to the next that belief is shattered never to arise againWhen we start doubting our thoughts that doesnt mean we start doubting ourselvesIt refers to doubting our views and opinions which is a most valuable practiceIn the discourse on livingkindness an arahant is described as being totally free from all viewsWhat the Buddha expounded to us were his own experiencesViewpoints are always based on our wrong assumption that there is a me and are therefore discolored by this underlying errorWhen we realize what our minds are up to we will eventually stop having so many viewpoints and thereby let go of some of the minds clutterMost minds are full of ideas hopes plans memories and opinionsRight and wrong are often based on culture or tradition and have no ultimate validityThey clutter up the mind and leave no space for a totally new outlook upon ourselves and the worldAn important step in this sequence is selfconquest which the Buddha described as the way to NibbanaAs long as we react to our feelings created through sense contacts we must admit that we are reactors rather than actors victims rather than mastersWe like to think of ourselves as more exalted than that yet when we observe reality that is all we can findAs soon as we have overcome this habitual reacting we have taken a step towards conquering ourselvesWe do not force ourselves into unpleasant situations which we havent learned to cope with yet because the mind will again react negatively which doesnt help us on the pathWe need not sit in excruciating pain in meditation but we need to observe our mind and its activityThis will assist us also in daily living when unpleasant feelings and dislike arise because of words we hear or sights we seeWhen we learn to accept things the way they are selfconquest has taken place which releases us from views and opinionsDukkha arises from the fact that we dont like the law of nature to which we are subjectWe dont like our loved ones dying we dont like physical pain or lack of appreciation we dont like losing what we prizeIf we could just accept the way it is it would go a long way towards looking at the world more realistically with less passion which is the way to freedomOur passionate desires keep us in boundsWhen we have the opportunity to sit quietly and watch ourselves new insights about ourselves may ariseWe are the prototype of impermanenceBut when our mind veers toward the past and starts rehashing old movies its time to turn it offThe past cannot be changedThe person who experienced the past no longer exists is only a fantasy nowWhen the mind strolls to the future imagining how we would like it to be we can let go by remembering the future has no reality eitherWhen it happens it can only be the present and the person planning the future is not the same one who will experience itIf we stay in this moment here and now during meditation we can use that same skill in daily lifeWhen we handle each moment with mindfulness and clear comprehension everything functions well nothing goes amiss our mind is content and inner peace can ariseKeeping our attention focused on each step on the way will eventually bring us to the summitThe four pathways to power are according to the Buddha essential aspects of realizing liberationHe said If a monk or nun has missed the four pathways to power they have missed the way to liberationIf they have practiced the four pathways to power they are practicing the right wayThese four pathways are initially mundane which means they are an endeavor which all of us are capable of pursuingOnly when they have become powers are they supermundane and constitute four of the factors of enlightenmentBecause they are so essential to practice and cannot be disregarded we need to know about them in detailWe have to understand them in an analytical way so that we can check up on our own resultsThis is the criterion that eventually turns knowledge into wisdomWe can learn any of the Buddhas teachings by heart thats not so difficult but consequently we need to look at these teachings in the light of personal endeavorWe can check whether our practice has borne fruit or notIf so we will continue in the same way as before if not we need to alter our approachBy investigating within whether we are actually doing what the Buddha taught and whether it has become part of our own inner being we gain insight into our minds capacityWhen we see that through practice we have been able to enlarge the abilities of our mind we will not become complacent but resolve to increase them furtherThe four pathways to power start out with chandhasamadhiChandha is intention and can be wholesome unwholesome or neutralIt also means desire or directionIn order to make it a pathway to power we have to use it as the intention towards complete insightSamadhi as part of the term means that the intention has to be fully concentrated and not dissipatedThis would be the difference between living a worldly life or living a life wholly dedicated to spiritual endeavorIn a worldly life we are forced to dissipate our intentions into different directionsIt is the nature of life in the worldThe necessity for obtaining and looking after many different objects even though we can minimize that will take up some timeThere are always people and material aspects who have a claim on usWe have to honor those claimsOur own ambitions and desires are being fostered in the world as being useful and commendableIn order to cultivate concentration of intention leading to total liberation we need to be in circumstances where no obstacles ariseAll four of the pathways have willpower as an adjunctConcentration of intention also includes onepointednessIt only becomes a true pathway when our intention is directed towards the greatest power of all namely the power arising from letting go of all cravingThe second pathway is concentration of energyEveryone has a certain amount of physical energy which sometimes becomes detrimental to our mental endeavor when there is too much restlessnessIf we have too little physical energy that is also counterproductiveBut mental energy can be increased namely by being onepointed using our energy in one direction only not having many irons in the fireWe need to be clear about what is of the utmost importance for us in this lifeThis needs checking up in the quiet introspection of our own contemplationWhat is it that I want most Where do I want to expend my energy What is my main intentionThe answer may not be to come to the end of dukkhaThat is all right tooBut we can benefit by concentrating our energy and intention no matter where we are heading as it will protect us from wasting our time with useless actionsThe willpower we can arouse depends very much on our insightIf we have seen the urgency of our own spiritual growth we will find it easier to have the will for practiceAll of us are subject to instinctual actions and reactions based on desire and cravingWillpower helps us to let go of these and direct our energy into different channelsUrgency is an essential part of successful practiceWhen our insights give rise to seeing the whole world on fire from craving and ourselves burning with it then urgency will become a natural part of our makeup and willpower a concomitant to itWillpower arises in direct proportion to urgency which is connected to our insight into the world around us the world which does not stop at our front door because it lives in our own heart and mindThe next pathway to power is concentration of consciousness or onepointedness of concentrationWhen intention and energy come together in a powerful way coupled with willpower meditative concentration can resultThe first two pathways are causes for the third one to arise leading to meditative absorptionsDeep tranquillity in ones meditation is the underlying factor needed for profound insights which can change an ordinary worldling to a noble one which is the goal of our practiceMost people today are not really aware of that but are interested in meditation to gain release from stressThat too is all rightWhy notThe Buddhas purpose and teaching were relief and release from dukkha once and for all so that it can never arise againIf we translate dukkha as stress which we can well do then we might say yes it is relief from stressBut the kind of release the Buddha had in mind is based on the depth of insight where we realize and experience that is isnt really dukkha that disappears but the me who is experiencing it vanishesOnepointed intention and onepointed effort lead to onepointed consciousnessThe mind finds itself in a state of awareness where there are no obstructions or obstacles resulting from thinkingInsight does not arise from thoughts but is an inner intuitive knowing quite different from discursive and logical thinking rather an outcome of a clear and calm mindThis leads the awareness into the depths of truth which has always been there but which did not rise to the surface before so that the mind could not grasp it previouslyWhat the Buddha experienced under the Bodhi Tree when he was able to formulate the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path was not a result of discursive thinking nor of logical or learned understandingIt was a deep inner experience which arose from a totally calm mind without obstructionsIt is our saving grace that a mind can do only one thing at a timeWhen we are calm and concentrated all our hindrances are momentarily laid to restThis is the boon of meditationWhen there are no obstacles in the mind it has the ability to recognize an entirely different depth than it does under ordinary circumstances when we are always in danger of having greed hate or deluded mind states ariseWhen we arouse the pathways to power we create a different dimension in the mindThis is essential as otherwise we may believe in the Buddha and his teaching but may not be able to prove it ourselvesIt is up to all of us to live the Dhamma in heart and mindThe fourth pathway is the concentration of investigation Subsequent to the experience of calm and tranquillity with their inherent expansion of consciousness comes investigation for insightThe meditative calm becomes a condition for insight through concentrated investigation when we realize the impermanence of even the best meditative statesNone of the pathways however only apply to meditationWhile they benefit us greatly in the context of meditation they are useful and practicable in all other moments of our livesWe certainly need concentrated intention in daily livingWe cannot one day intend to be kind the next day selfish then kind again and expect to be peaceful and happyWe also need to know what we are aiming for in mundane livingIf we want a university education we have to concentrate on that intentionWe cannot go to university one day stay home the next day and expect to pass examinationsConcentration of energy is also a basic requirement of daily livingIf we conserve our energy to use it where it bears the best fruit our mundane endeavors will flourish and be easily accomplishedIf we develop and cultivate right intention energy willpower and concentration we can increase our potential manifoldNotwithstanding any results we may see in ourselves we should never expect to be either totally perfect or totally imperfectWe need to look upon ourselves as practitioners those who are learningIn the Buddhas time they were called savaka which means hearer If we consider ourselves in that way we need not search for perfection or imperfection but rather try to draw nearer to giving up all ideas of me and mineConcentrated investigation of phenomena is an aspect of our moment to moment mindfulness which enables us to see anicca dukkha or anatta wherever we lookEverything that exits proclaims these three characteristics so that we need never be without Dhamma consciousnessUsually one of the three aspects becomes more pregnant with meaning for us and our mind veers in that direction to investigate the underlying truth behind the reality in which we liveWe are never without an object for investigationOur thoughts and feelings are full of these three characteristicsWhen there is a pleasant feeling can we keep itDo we feel unhappy when it is goneAre we beginning to see this whole person we are so concerned with as nothing but flux and flow with no solid core to be found anywhereWhen we look at ourselves again and again we will eventually realize that we cannot find an unchanging substance withinDepth of insight arises through the meditative processHowever we need to assist our practice by investigative thoughts and directions in daily livingIf our mind is concerned with worldly affairs or sensual pleasures during the day it is asking too much of it to become calm and insightful in the eveningIt is an unrealistic expectation which no mind can fulfillWe need to prepare our mind so that it is used to thinking in terms of Dhamma consciousness with mindfulness already established as a daily habitThen we can proceed with meditation without first having to shed all mental burdensWe are already facing in the right direction and can easily achieve calm and peacefulness which are our resource for mental energyWhen we are young we may be inclined to think that our body is our source of energyBut the body can fall sick at any time can be maimed or even dieOur real energy source lies in the fact that the mind can renew itself and become powerful through the arising of deep tranquillityThen it doesnt matter whether the body is old and decrepit or young and healthy because mind is the master and body the servantWe need the meditative calm as our fuel supplyIt is more important even than foodAlthough one does eventually have to have food again one can go without it for quite a long time much longer than usually thought possible and still have much energy to meditateWe have this natural resource within yet very few people take advantage of itIn order to make use of it the mind needs protection during daily living so that it is already in the right frame of consciousness when meditation beginsInsight into the futility of ambitions and desires helps to lessen discursive and distracting thinkingThe four pathways to power are mundane when we are practicing and become supermundane when we have perfected themThey bring total liberation from dukkha if culmination of intention energy willpower calm and insight is achieved which they demand of usNow the time has come to go home from this retreatIn order to take as much benefit as possible with us we need to be aware how to organize our daily livesIf we go back and do exactly as weve always done within a week everything will be forgottenComing to another meditation course in the future we would have to start all over againWho knows whether there is much time in this lifeThis is the only life the we can take responsibility forHere we have some control over how we spend our dayThe future is nonexistentIm going to meditate tomorrow is foolishThere is no tomorrow there is only nowWhen the next life comes its this life actually this is our next lifeFinding lots of reasons not to practice today is always possible the children the weather the husband the wife the business the economy the food anything will doWhat kind of priorities we have is strictly of our own makingIf the future does not exist and the past is completely gone what do we have leftA very fleeting moment indeed namely this oneIt passes quicker than we can say itBut by using each moment skillfully we can eventually have momenttomoment awareness which results in deep insightWhen getting up in the morning the first thing would be a determination to be mindfulBecoming aware of opening our eyes is the beginning of the day and the beginning of mindfulnessIf we have opened our eyes before becoming aware of that we can close them and start all over againAnd from that small incident we will gain an understanding of mindfulness and what it means then we can let the mind be flooded with gratitude that we have another whole day at our disposal for one purpose onlyNot to cook a better meal not to buy new things but to draw nearer to NibbanaOne needs enough wisdom to know how this can be accomplishedThe Buddha told us again and again but we are hard of hearing and not totally open to all the instructionsSo we need to hear it many timesBeing grateful brings the mind to a state of receptivity and joyful expectation of What am I going to do with this day The first thing would be to sit down to meditate maybe having to get up a little earlierMost people die in bed its a perfect place for dying and not such a perfect place for spending an unnecessarily long timeIf one has passed the first flush of youth one doesnt need so much sleep any moreIn most homes starting at oclock there is noiseIf that is so we need to get up early enough to avoid thatThat alone gives a feeling of satisfaction of doing something special to get nearer to NibbanaIf we have a whole hour available for meditation thats fine at least let us not practice under half an hour because the mind needs time to become calm and collectedThe morning hour is often the best for many people because during the night the mind is not bombarded with as many conscious impressions as it is during the day and is therefore comparatively calmIf we start meditating for half an hour and slowly increase it until we reach a whole hour thats a good programEach week we could add ten minutes to the daily practiceAfter the meditation we can contemplate the five daily recollectionsNow the mind is calm and collected and has more ability to reach an inner depthAll that is mine dear and delightful will change and vanishThe exact words do not matter that muchWords are concepts only the meaning counts the impermanence of our bodies of what we think we own such as people and belongings and being responsible for our own kammaAnother recollection is about having a loving and kind attitude towards oneself and others and to protect ones own happiness and wishing to same for all beingsHaving reflected on these two aspects in a meaningful way we can keep three things in mindFirst comes mindfulness bare attention to the prevailing mode of beingThat can be a physical activity without the mind going astray or it may be a feeling or a thought which has arisenPaying full attention not trying to bury it under discursive debris but knowing exactly what is happening in ones lifeWhen physical activity does not demand our attention we can again direct thoughts to the fleeting aspects of our own lives and everyone elses and reflect what to do in the short time availableWhen we consider this correctly kindness lovingness and helpfulness arise as prioritiesWe need not help a lot of people all at onceEven helping one person maybe someone who lives in the same house is beneficialIt is the attitude and motivation that count not the resultsMany people want to do some good but expect gratitudeThats spiritual materialism because they are aiming for a form of repayment for their goodness at least a very nice future lifeThat too is equivalent to getting pain not in the coin of the realm but through resultsBoth attitudes could be dropped and the realization reestablished that this is the only day I have let me use it to best advantage What is most important if I only have such a short time in this life Then we can act out of the understanding that in order to drew nearer to Nibbana we have to let go of selfconcern egocentricity selfaffirmation personal likes and dislikes because otherwise the ego will grow instead of diminishAs we affirm and confirm it more and more throughout this life it gets bigger and fatter instead of reducing itselfThe more we think about our own importance our own cares and concerns the further away we get from Nibbana and the less chance for peace and happiness arises in our livesIf someone has a very fat body and tries to go through a narrow gate he might knock hisher body against either side and get hurtIf someone has an extremely fat ego she might knock against other people constantly and feel hurt other peoples egos being the gate posts against which one knocksIf we have this kind of experience repeatedly we get to realize that it has nothing to do with other people but only concerns ourselvesIf we start each day with these considerations and contemplations we will tend towards not being overly concerned with ourselves but trying to think of othersNaturally there is always the possibility of accidentsAccidents of nonmindfulness of not being attentive to what we are doing accidents of impetuous instinctive replies or in feeling sorry for ourselvesThese occasions have to be seen for what they are namely accidents a lack of awarenessTheres no blame to be attached to other people or to oneselfWe can just see that at that particular moment we were not mindful and try to remedy it in the next momentTheres only the arahant who is fully enlightened who does not have accidents of that sortThe Buddha did not teach expression or suppressionBut instead he taught that the only emotions which are worthwhile are the four supreme emotions and that everything else needs to be noticed and allowed to subside againIf anger arises it doesnt help to suppress or to express itWe have to know that the anger has arisen otherwise well never be able to change our reactionsWe can watch it arising and ceasingHowever this is difficult for most people anger doesnt subside fast enoughInstead we can immediately remember that to express anger means that particular day which really constitutes our whole life contains a very unfortunate occurrence and therefore we can try to substituteIt is much easier to substitute one emotion for another than to drop one altogetherDropping means a deliberate action of letting goAs we have learned in meditation we can substitute discursive thinking with attention on the breath in daily living we substitute the unwholesome with the wholesomeUsually our anger arises towards other peopleIts not so important to us what animals do nor what people do whom we dont knowUsually we are concerned with those whom we know and who are near to usBut since that is so we must also be familiar with some very good qualities of these peopleInstead of dwelling upon any negative action of that person we can put our attention on something pleasant about themEven though they may have just used words which we didnt like at other times they have said things which were fineThey have done good deeds and have shown love and compassionIt is a matter of changing ones focus of attention just as we learn to do in meditationUntil this becomes very habitual in meditation it will be difficult in daily life but diligent practice makes it happenWe practice in spite of any difficultyIf we remove our attention from one thing and put it somewhere else thats all we need to work withWe will be protecting ourselves from making bad kamma and spoiling our whole dayWe may not have another dayThe immediate resultants of all our thoughts speech and action are quite apparentIf we keep our attention focused we will know that wholesome emotions and thoughts bring peace and happiness whereas unwholesome ones bring the oppositeOnly a fool makes himherself deliberately unhappySince were not fools well try to eliminate all unwholesomeness in our thinking and emotions and try to substitute with the wholesomeAll of us are looking for just one thing and that is happinessUnhappiness can arise only through our own ideas and reactionsWe are the makers of our own happiness and unhappiness and we can learn to have control over thatThe better the meditation becomes the easier it will be because the mind needs muscle power to do thisA distracted mind has no strength no powerWe cannot expect perfect results overnight but we can keep practicingIf we look back after having practiced for some time we will see a changeIf we look back after only one or two days we may not find anything new withinIt is like growing vegetablesIf we put seeds in the ground and dig them up the next day all we will find is a seedBut if we tend the seeds and wait some time we will find a sprout or a plantIts no use checking from moment to moment but it is helpful to check the past and see the changes taking placeAt the end of each day it can be a good practice to make a balancesheet possibly even in writingAny good shopkeeper will check out his merchandise at the end of the day and see which one was well accepted by the customers and which stayed on the shelvesHe will not reorder the shelf items but only the merchandise that sold wellWe can check our actions and reactions during the day and can see which ones were conductive to happiness for ourselves and others and which ones were rejectedWe do not reorder the latter for the next day but just let them perish on the shelfIf we do that night after night we will always find the same actions accepted or rejectedKindness warmth interest in others helpfulness concern and care are always acceptedSelfinterest dislike rejection arguments jealousy are always rejectedJust for one single day we can write down all our actions on the credit or debit side whether happinessproducing or notAs we do that we will find the same reactions to the same stimuli over and over againThis balance sheet will give a strong impetus to stop the preprogrammed unwholesome reactionsWe have used them for years and lifetimes on end and they have always produced unhappinessIf we can check them out in writing or see them clearly in our minds we will surely try to changeStarting the day with the determination to be mindful contemplating the daily recollections realizing that this is the only day we have and using it most skillfully and then checking it out in the evening on the balance sheet will give us a whole lifetime in one dayIf this is done carefully and habitually the next day which is our next life has the advantageous resultsIf weve had a day of arguments dislikes worries fears and anxiety the next day will be similarBut if we have had a day of lovingkindness helpfulness and concern for others well wake up with those same modes of beingOur last thought at night will become the first one in the morningThe kamma we inherit shows up the next day we dont need to wait for another lifetimeThats too nebulousWe do it now and see results the next dayBefore going to sleep its useful to practice lovingkindness meditationHaving done that as the very last thing at night it will be in ones mind first thing in the morningThe Buddhas words about lovingkindness were One goes to sleep happily one dreams no evil dreams and one wakes happily What more can one askApplying the same principles day after day there is no reason why our lives should not be harmoniousThat way were making the most of each day of our livesIf we dont do it nobody else willNo other person is interested in making the most of each day of our livesEveryone is interested in making the most of their own livesWe cannot rely on anyone else for our own happinessAs far as our meditation practice is concerned we must not allow it to slideWhenever that happens one has to start all over againIf one keeps doing it every day one can at least keep the standard attained in the retreat possibly improve on itJust like an athlete who stops training has to start all over again in the same way the mind needs discipline and attention because it is the master of the inner householdThere is nothing that can give us any direction except our own mindWe need to give it the possibility to relax to stop thinking for a little while to have a moment of peace and quiet so that it can renew itselfWithout that renewal of energy it decays just the same as everything else doesIf the mind is taken care of it will take care of usThis is a sketch of how to use ones day to day activity and practiceWe must never think that Dhamma is for meditation courses or special days it is rather a way of life where we do not forget the impermanence and unsatisfactoriness of the worldWe realize these truths within our own heart just thinking about them is uselessIf we practice every day in this way we will find relief and release from our cares and worries because these are always connected with the worldThe Dhamma transcends the worldNormally illness is something we all have but the type of illness where you can still do your work isnt recognized as illnessIts called the normal human state all over the worldYet really when the body is in its normal state its still ill in and of itself  simply that people in general are unaware of the fact that its the deterioration of physical and mental phenomena continually from moment to momentThe way people get carried away with their thoughts and preoccupations while theyre still strong enough to do this and do that Thats really complacencyTheyre no match at all for people lying in bed illPeople lying in bed ill are lucky because they have the opportunity to do nothing but contemplate stress and painTheir minds dont take up anything else dont go anywhere elseThey can contemplate pain at all times  and let go of pain at all times as wellDont you see the differenceThe emptiness of the mind when youre involved in activities is play emptinessImitation emptinessIts not the real thingBut to contemplate inconstancy stress and notselfness as it appears right inside you while youre lying right here is very beneficial for youJust dont think that youre whats hurtingSimply see the natural phenomena of physical and mental events as they pass away pass awayTheyre not youTheyre not really yoursYou dont have any real control over themLook at themExactly where do you have any control over themThis is true for everyone in the worldYoure not the only one to whom its happeningSo whatever the disease there is in your body it isnt importantWhats important is the disease in the mindNormally we dont pay too much attention to the fact that we have diseases in our minds ie the diseases of defilement craving and attachmentWe pay attention only to our physical diseases afraid of all the horrible things that can happen to the bodyBut no matter how much we try to stave things off with our fears when the time comes for things to happen no matter what medicines you have to treat the body they can give you only temporary respiteEven the people in the past who didnt suffer from heavy diseases are no longer with usTheyve all had to part from their bodies in the endSo when you continually contemplate in this way it makes you see the truth of inconstancy stress and notselfness correctly within youAnd youll have to grow more and more disenchanted with things step by stepWhen you give it a try and let go whos thereAre you the one hurting or is it simply an affair of the DhammaYou have to examine this very carefully to see that its not really you thats hurtingThe disease isnt your diseaseIts a disease of the body a disease of physical formIn the end physical form and mental events have to change to be stressful in the change to be notself in the change and the stressBut you must focus on them watch them and contemplate them so that theyre clearMake this knowledge really clear and right there is where youll gain release from all suffering and stressRight there is where youll put an end to all suffering and stressAs for the aggregates theyll continue to arise age grow ill and pass away in line with their own affairsWhen their causes and conditions run out they die and go into their coffinSome people when theyre healthy and complacent die suddenly and unexpectedly without knowing whats happening to themTheir minds are completely oblivious to whats going onThis is much worse than the person lying ill in bed who has pain to contemplate as a means of developing disenchantmentSo you dont have to be afraid of painIf its going to be there let it be there  but dont let the mind be in pain with itAnd then look  right now  is the mind empty of me and mineKeep looking on inKeep looking on in so that things are really clear and thats enoughYou dont have to go knowing anything anywhere elseWhen you can cure the disease or the pain lightens thats something normalWhen it doesnt lighten thats normal tooBut if the heart is simply empty of me and mine there will be no pain within itAs for the pain in the aggregates dont give it a second thoughtSo see yourself as luckyLying here dealing with the disease you have the opportunity to practice insight meditation with every momentIt doesnt matter whether youre here in the hospital or at homeDont let there be any real sense in the mind that youre in the hospital or at homeLet the mind be in the emptiness empty of all labels and meaningsYou dont have to label yourself as being anywhere at allThis is because the aggregates are not where you areTheyre empty of any indwelling personTheyre empty of any me or mine When the mind is like this it doesnt need anything at allIt doesnt have to be here or go there or anywhere at allThis is the absolute end of suffering and stressThe mind when it doesnt get engrossed with the taste of pleasure or pain is free in and of itself in line with its own natureBut I ask that you watch it carefully the behavior of this mind as its empty in line with its own nature not concocting any desires for anything not wanting pleasure or trying to push away painWhen the mind is empty in line with its nature theres no sense of ownership in it there are no labels for itselfNo matter what thoughts occur to it it sees them as insubstantial as empty of selfTheres simply a sensation that then passes awayA sensation that then passes away and thats allSo you have to watch the phenomena that arise and pass awayIn other words you have to watch the phenomenon of the present continuously  and the mind will be empty in that it gives no meanings or labels to the arising and passing awayAs for the arising and passing away thats a characteristic of the aggregates that has to appear as part of their normal nature  simply that the mind isnt involved doesnt latch onThis is the point you can make use ofYou cant go preventing pleasure and pain you cant keep the mind from labeling things and forming thoughts but you can put these things to a new useIf the mind labels a pain saying I hurt you have to read the label carefully contemplate it until you see that its wrongIf the label were right it would have to say that the pain isnt me its emptyOr if theres a thought that Im in pain this type of thinking is also wrongYou have to take a new approach to your thinking to see that thinking is inconstant stressful and not yoursSo whatever arises investigate and let go of whats right in front of youJust make sure that you dont cling and the mind will keep on being empty in line with its natureIf no thoughts are bothering you there may be strong pain or the mind may be developing an abnormal mood but whatever is happening you have to look right in look all the way in to the sensation of the mindOnce you have a sense of the empty mind then if theres any disturbance any sense of irritation youll know that the knowledge giving rise to it is wrong knowledge in and of itselfRight knowledge will immediately take over making the wrong knowledge disbandIn order to hold continuously to this foundation of knowing you first have to start out by exercising restraint over the mind at the same time that you focus your attention and contemplate the phenomenon of stress and painKeep this up until the mind can maintain its stance in the clear emptiness of the heartIf you can do this all the way to the end the final disbanding of suffering will occur right there right where the mind is emptyBut you have to keep practicing at this continuouslyWhenever pain arises regardless of whether its strong or not dont label it or give it any meaningEven if pleasure arises dont label it as your pleasureJust keep letting it go and the mind will gain release  empty of all clinging or attachment to selfness with each and every momentYou have to apply all your mindfulness and energy to this at all timesYou should see yourself as fortunate that youre lying here ill contemplating pain for you have the opportunity to develop the Path in full measure gaining insight and letting things goNobody has a better opportunity than what you have right nowPeople running around engaged in their affairs Even if they say their minds are disengaged theyre really no match for youA person lying ill in bed has the opportunity to develop insight with every inandout breathIts a sign that you havent wasted your birth as a human being you know because youre practicing the teachings of the Lord Buddha to the point where you gain clear knowledge into the true nature of things in and of themselvesThe true nature of things on the outside level refers to the phenomenon of the present the changing of the five aggregatesYou can decipher their code decipher their code until you get disenchanted with them lose your taste for them and let them goWhen the mind is in this state the next step is to contemplate it skillfully to see how its empty all the way to the ultimate emptiness  the kind of emptiness that goes clearly into the true nature lying most deeply inside where there is no concocting of thoughts no arising no passing away no changing at allWhen you correctly see the nature of things on the outer level until it is all clear to you the mind will let go let goThats when you automatically see clearly the nature of what lies on the inner level  empty of all cycling through birth and death with nothing concocted at all The emptiest extreme of emptiness with no labels no meanings no clingings or attachmentsAll I ask is that you see this clearly within your own mindThe ordinary emptiness of the mind is useful on one level but thats not all there isTrue emptiness is empty until it reaches the true nature of things on the inner level  something really worth ferreting out really worth coming to knowThis is something you have to know for yourself There are really no words to describe it but we can talk about it by way of guidance because it may happen that ultimately you let go of everything in whats called disbanding without traceThe minds point of disbanding without trace if you keep developing insight every day every moment like this will happen on its ownThe mind will know on its ownSo dont let the mind bother itself by getting preoccupied with pleasure or painFocus on penetrating into the mind in and of itself relentlesslyDo you see how different this is from when youre running around strong and healthy thinking about this that and the other thing This is why theres no harm in having lots of painThe harm is in our stupidity in giving labels and meanings to thingsPeople in general tend to reflect on the fleeting nature of life with reference to other people when someone else grows sick or dies but they rarely reflect on the fleeting nature of their own livesOr else they reflect for just a moment and then forget all about it getting completely involved in their other preoccupationsThey dont bring these truths inward to reflect on the inconstancy occurring within themselves with every momentThe fact that they can still do this and that think this and that say this and that makes them lose all perspectiveWhen you practice insight meditation its not something that you take a month or two off to do on a special retreatThats not the real thingIts no match for what youre doing right now for here you can do it all day every day and all night except when you sleepEspecially when the pain is strong its really good for your meditation because it gives you the chance to know once and for all what inconstancy is like what stress and suffering are like what your inability to control things is likeYou have to find out right here right in front of you so dont try to avoid the painPractice insight so as to see the true nature of pain its true nature as Dhamma and then keep letting it goIf you do this theres no way you can go wrongThis is the way to release from sufferingAnd its something you have to do before you die you know not something you wait to do when you die or are just about to dieIts something you simply keep on doing keep on insighting When the disease lessens you insight itWhen it grows heavy you insight itIf you keep on developing insight like this the mind will get over its stupidity and delusionIn other words things like craving and defilement wont dare hassle the mind the way they used toSo you have to give it your all  all your mindfulness all your energy  now that you have the opportunity to practice the DhammaLet this be your last lifetimeDont let there be anything born againIf youre born again things will come back again just as they are nowThe same old stuff over and over and over againOnce theres birth there has to be aging illness and death in line with your defilements experiencing the good and bad results they keep churning outIts a cycle of sufferingSo the best thing is to gain release from birthDont let yourself want anything any moreDont let yourself want anything any more for all your wants fall in with whats inconstant stressful and notselfWanting is simply a form of defilement and cravingYou have to disband these things right at the instigator the wanting thats nothing but craving for sensuality craving for becoming or craving for no becoming  the germs of birth in the heartSo focus in and contemplate at the right spot seeing that even though craving may be giving rise to birth at sensory contact you can set your knowing right at the mind right at consciousness itself and let there just be the knowing that lets go of knowingThis is something to work at until you have it masteredSetting your knowing at the mind letting go of knowing like this is something very beneficialTheres no getting stuck no grabbing hold of your knowledge or viewsIf the knowledge is right you let it goIf the knowledge is wrong you let it goThis is called knowing letting go of knowing without going and getting entangledThis kind of knowing keeps the mind from latching onto whatever arisesAs soon as you know something you let it goAs soon as you know something youve let it goThe mind just keeps on staying empty  empty of mental formations and thoughts empty of every sort of illusion that could affect the mindIt quickly sees through them and lets them go knows and lets go without holding onto anythingAll it has left is the emptinessYouve already seen results from your practice step by step from contemplating things and letting them go letting go even of the thought that you are the one in pain that you are the one whos dyingThe pain and the dying are an affair of the aggregates pure and simpleWhen this knowledge is clear and sure  that its not my affair theres no me in there  theres just an empty mind an empty mind empty of any label for itselfThis is the nature of the mind free of the germs that used to make it assume this and thatTheyre dead nowThose germs are now dead because weve contemplated themWeve let goWeve set our knowing right at the mind and let go of whatever knowing has arisen all along to the point where the mind is emptyClearIn and of itselfConsciousness when youre aware of it inwardly arises and passes away by its very own natureTheres no real essence to it  this is what you see when you look at the elemental property of consciousness pure and simpleWhen its not involved with physical or mental phenomena its simply aware of itself  aware pure and simpleThats called the mind pure and simple or the property of consciousness pure and simple in and of itself and it lets go of itselfWhen youre told to know and to let go of the knowing it means to know the consciousness that senses things and then lets go of itselfAs for the aggregate of consciousness thats a troublemaking consciousnessThe germs that keep piling things on lie in this kind of consciousness which wants to hang onto a sense of selfEven though it can let go of physical pain or of physical and mental events in general it still hangs onto a sense of selfSo when youre told to know the letting go of knowing it means to let go of this kind of consciousness to the point where consciousness has no label for itselfThats when its emptyIf you understand this or can straighten out the heart and mind from this angle there wont be anything leftPain suffering stress  all your preoccupations  will become entirely meaninglessThere will be no sense of good or bad or anything at allDualities will no longer be able to have an effectIf you know in this way  the knowing that lets go of knowing consciousness pure and simple  it prevents any possible fashioning of the mindThe dualities that fashion good and bad Theres really nothing to themThey arise and thats all there is to them they disband and thats all there is to themSo now we come to know the affairs of the dualities that fashion the mind into spirals that fashion the mind or consciousness into endless cyclesWhen you know the knowing that lets go of knowing right at consciousness in and of itself dualities have no more meaningTheres no more latching onto the labels of good and bad pleasure and pain true and false or whateverYou just keep on letting goEven this knowing that lets go of knowing has no label for itself saying I know or I see But this is something that lies a little deep that you have to make an effort to see clearly and rightlyYou have to keep looking in a shrewd wayThe shrewdness of your looking Thats something very important for only that can lead to AwakeningYour knowledge has to be shrewdSkillfulMake sure that its shrewd and skillfulOtherwise your knowledge of the true nature of things  on the inner or outer levels  wont really be clearItll get stuck on only the elementary levels of emptiness labeling and latching onto them in a way that just keeps piling things onThat kind of emptiness simply cant compare with this kind  the knowing that lets go of knowing right at consciousness pure and simpleMake sure that this kind of knowing keeps going continuouslyIf you slip for a moment just get right back to itYoull see that when you dont latch onto labels and meanings thoughts of good and bad will just come to a stopTheyll disbandSo when the Buddha tells us to see the world as empty this is the way we seeThe emptiness lies in the fact that the mind doesnt give meaning to things doesnt fashion things doesnt clingIts empty right at this kind of mindOnce youre correctly aware of this kind of empty mind youll no longer get carried away by anything at allBut if you dont really focus down like this there will only be a little smattering of emptiness and then youll find yourself getting distracted by this and that spoiling the emptinessThat kind of emptiness is emptiness in confusionYoure still caught up in confusion because you havent contemplated down to the deeper levelsYou simply play around with emptiness thats allThe deeper levels of emptiness require that you focus in and keep on looking until youre thoroughly clear about the true nature of things in the phenomenon of the present arising and disbanding right in front of youThis kind of mind doesnt get involved doesnt latch on to meanings or labelsIf you see this kind of emptiness correctly there are no more issues no more labels for anything in this heap of physical and mental phenomenaWhen the time comes for it all to fall apart theres nothing to get excited about nothing to get upset about for thats the way it has to go by its natureOnly if we latch onto it will we sufferThe Dhamma is right here in our body and mind simply that we dont see it  or that we see it wrongly latching on and making ourselves sufferIf we look at things with the eyesight of mindfulness and discernment what is there to make us sufferWhy is there any need to fear pain and deathEven if we do fear them what do we accomplishPhysical and mental phenomena have to go their own way  inconstant in their own way stressful in their own way beyond our control in their own waySo what business do we have in reaching out and latching on and saying that their stress and pain is our stress and painIf we understand that the latching on is what makes us suffer over and over again with each and every breath then all we have to do is let go and well see how there is release from suffering right before our very eyesSo keep on looking in to know in the way Ive described right at the mindBut dont go labeling it as a mind or anything at allJust let there be things as they are in and of themselves pure and simpleThats enoughYou dont need to have any meanings or labels for anything at allThat will be the end of all suffering When things disband in the ultimate way they disband right at the point of the elemental property of consciousness free of the germs that will give rise to anything furtherThats where everything comes to an end with no more rebirth or redeath of any kind at allThe practice is something you have to do for yourselfIf you know things clearly and correctly with your own mindfulness and discernment thats your tool wellsharpened in handIf the mind is trained to be sharp with mindfulness and discernment as its tool for contemplating itself then defilement craving and attachment will keep getting weeded out and cleared awayYou can look and see from the amount youve already practiced Arent they already cleared away to some extentThe mind doesnt have to worry about anything doesnt have to get involved with anything elseLet go of everything outside and then keep letting go until the mind lets go of itselfWhen you do this how can you not see the great worth of the DhammaSo I ask that this mind empty of attachment empty of any sense of self whatsoever be clear to you until you see that its nothing but DhammaGet so that its nothing but Dhamma perfectly plain to your awarenessMay this appear to you as it is on its own with each and every momentListening to the Dhamma when the mind has already reached a basic level of emptiness is very usefulIts like an energizing tonic for when were sick theres bound to be pain disturbing us but if we dont pay it any attention it simply becomes an affair of the body without involving the mind at allNotice this as youre listening The mind has let go of the pain to listen to the words leaving the pain to its own affairsThe mind is then emptyOnce the mind honestly sees the truth that all compounded things are inconstant it will have to let go of its attachmentsThe problem here is that we havent yet really seen this or havent yet reflected on it in a skillful wayOnce we do though the mind is always ready to grow radiantClear knowing makes the mind immediately radiantSo keep careful watch on thingsEven if you dont know very much just be aware of the mind as it maintains a balance in its basic level of neutrality and emptinessThen it wont be able to fashion the pains in the body into any great issues and you wont have to be attached to themSo keep your awareness of the pain right at the level where its no more than a mere sensation in the bodyIt can be the bodys pain but dont let the mind be in pain with itIf you do let the mind be in pain with it that will pile things on layer after layerSo the first step is to protect the mind to let things go then turn inward to look for the deepest most innermost part of your awareness and stay right thereYou dont have to get involved with the pains outsideIf you simply try to endure them they may be too much for you to endureSo look for the aspect of the mind that lies deep within and youll be able to put everything else asideNow if the pains are the sort that you can watch then make an effort to watch themThe mind will stay at its normal neutrality calm with its own inner emptiness watching the pain as it changes and passes awayBut if the pain is too extreme then turn around and go back inside for if you cant handle it then craving is going to work its way into the picture wanting to push the pain away and to gain pleasureThis will keep piling on piling on putting the mind in a horrible turmoilSo start out by solving the problem right at handIf the pain is sudden and sharp immediately turn around and focus all your attention on the mindYou dont want to have anything to do with the body anything to do with the pains in the bodyYou dont look at them you dont pay them any attentionFocus on staying with the innermost part of your awarenessGet to point where you can see the pure state of mind that isnt in pain with the body and keep it constantly clearOnce this is constantly clear then no matter how much pain there is in the body its simply an affair of mental and physical eventsThe mind though isnt involvedIt puts all these things asideIt lets goWhen youre adept at this its a very useful skill to have for the important things in life dont lie outsideThey lie entirely within the mindIf we understand this properly we wont have to go out to grab this or thatWe wont have to latch onto anything at all  because if we do latch on we simply cause ourselves needless sufferingThe wellbeing of the mind lies at the point where it doesnt latch onto anything where it doesnt want anythingThats where our wellbeing lies  the point where all suffering and stress disband right at the mindIf we dont really understand things though the mind wont be willing to let things goIt will keep on holding tight for it finds so much flavor in things outsideWhatever involves pain and stress Thats what it likesWe have to focus on contemplating and looking looking at the illusions in the mind the wrong knowledge and opinions that cover it up and keep us from seeing the aspect of the mind thats empty and still by its own internal natureFocus on contemplating the opinions that give rise to the complicated attachments that bury the mind until its in awful straitsSee how mental events  feelings perceptions and thoughtformations  condition the mind condition the property of consciousness until its in terrible shapeThis is why its so important to ferret out the type of knowing that lets go of knowing ie that knows the property of consciousness pure and simple when mental events havent yet come in to condition it or when it hasnt gone out to condition mental eventsRight here is where things get really interesting  in particular the thoughtformations that condition consciousnessThey come from ignorance rightIts because of our not knowing or our wrong knowing that theyre able to condition thingsSo I ask that you focus on this ignorance this notknowingIf you can know the characteristics of notknowing this same knowledge will know both the characteristics of thoughtformations as they go about their conditioning and how to disband themThis requires adroit contemplation because its something subtle and deepBut no matter how subtle it may be the fact that weve developed our mindfulness and discernment to this point means that we have to take an interest in itIf we dont theres no way we can put an end to stress or gain release from itOr if you want you can approach it like this Focus exclusively on the aspect of the mind thats constantly emptyIf any preoccupations appear to it be aware of the characteristics of bare sensation when forms make contact with the eye or sounds with the ear and so forthTheres a bare sensation and then it disbands before it can have any such meaning as good or bad If theres just the bare sensation that then disbands theres no sufferingBe observant of the moment when forms make contact with the eyeWith some things if youre not interested in them no feelings of liking or disliking ariseBut if you get interested or feel that theres a meaning to the form sound smell taste or tactile sensation youll notice that as soon as you give a meaning to these things attachment is already thereIf you stop to look in this way youll see that attachment is something subtle because its there even in the simple act of giving meaningIf you look in a superficial way you wont see that its attachment  even though thats what it is but in a subtle wayAs soon as theres a meaning theres already attachmentThis requires that you have to be good and observant  because in the contact at the eyes and ears that we take so much for granted many sleightsofhand happen all at once which means that we arent aware of the characteristics of the consciousness that knows each individual sensationWe have to be very observant if we want to be able to know these thingsIf we arent aware on this level everything will be tied up in attachmentThese things will keep sending their reports into the mind conditioning and concocting all kinds of issues to leave the mind or consciousness in an utter turmoilSo if we want to look purely inside we have to be very very observant because things inside are subtle elusive and sensitiveWhen the mind seems empty and neutral Thats when you really have to keep careful watch and control over it so as to see clearly the sensation of receiving contactTheres contact pure and simple then it disbands and the mind is emptyNeutral and emptyOnce you know this youll know what the mind is like when it isnt conditioned by the power of defilement craving and attachmentWe can use this emptiness of the mind as our standard of comparison and it will do us a world of goodUltimately youll see the emptiness of all sensory contacts as in the Buddhas teaching that we should see the world as emptyWhat he meant is that we observe bare sensations simply arising and passing away knowing what consciousness is like when it does nothing more than receive contactIf you can see this the next step in the practice wont be difficult at all  because youve established neutrality right from the startThe act of receiving contact is no longer complicated The mind no longer grabs hold of things no longer feels any likes or dislikesIts simply quiet and aware all around within itself at all timesEven if you can do this much you find that you benefit from not letting things get complex from not letting them concoct things through the power of defilement craving and attachmentEven just this much gets rid of lots of problemsThen when you focus further in to see the nature of all phenomena that are known through sensory contact youll see that theres simply bare sensation with nothing at all worth getting attached toIf you look with the eyes of true mindfulness and discernment youll have to see emptiness  even though the world is full of thingsThe eye sees lots of forms the ear hears lots of sounds you know but the mind no longer gives them meaningsAt the same time things have no meanings in and of themselvesThe only important thing is the mindAll issues come from the mind that goes out and gives things meanings and gives rise to attachment creating stress and suffering for itselfSo you have to look until you see all the way throughLook outward until you see all the way out and inward until you see all the way in all the way until you penetrate inconstancy stress and notselfnessSee things as they are in and of themselves in line with their own nature without any meanings or attachmentsThen there wont be any issuesThe mind will be empty  clean and bright  without your having to do anything to itNow the fact that the mind has the viruses of ignorance or of the craving that gives rise to things easily means that we cant be carelessIn the beginning you have to supervise things carefully so that you can see the craving that arises at the moment of contact  say when theres a feeling of painIf you dont label it as meaning your pain craving wont get too much into the actBut if you do give it that meaning then there will be the desire to push the pain away or to have pleasure come in its placeAll this even though weve never gotten anything true and dependable from desiringThe pleasure we get from our desires doesnt lastIt fools us and then changes into something elsePain fools us and then changes into something elseBut these changes keep piling up and getting very complicated in the mind and this is what keeps the mind ignorant Its been conditioned in so many ways that it gets confused deluded dark and smolderingAll kinds of things are smoldering in here This is why the principle of the knowing that lets go of knowing is such an important toolWhatever comes at you the knowing that lets go of knowing is enough to get you throughIt takes care of everythingIf you let it slip simply get back to the same sort of knowingSee for yourself how far it will take you how much it can keep the mind neutral and emptyYou can come to see this bit by bitIn the moments when the mind isnt involved with very much when its at a basic level of normalcy  empty quiet whatever  keep careful watch over it and analyze it as wellDont let it just be in an oblivious state of indifference or else it will lose its balanceIf youre in an oblivious state then as soon as theres contact at any of the sense doors theres sure to be attachment or craving giving rise to things the instant in which feeling appearsYou have to focus on keeping watch of the changes the behavior of the mind at every momentAs soon as your mindfulness lapses get back immediately to your original knowingWere all bound to have lapses  all of us  because the effluent of ignorance the most important of the effluents is still there in the mindThis is why we have to keep working at our watchfulness our investigation our focused awareness so that they keep getting clearer and clearerMake your mind ripe in mindfulness and discernment continuouslyOnce theyre ripe enough for you to know things in a skillful way youll be able to disband the defilements the very minute they appearAs soon as you begin feeling likes and dislikes you can deal with them before they amount to anythingThis makes things a lot easierIf you let them loose so that they condition the mind making it irritated murky and stirred up to the point where it shows in your words and actions then youre in terrible straits falling into hell in this very lifetimeThe practice of the Dhamma requires that we be ingenious and circumspect right at the mindThe defilements are always ready to flatter us to work their way into our favorIf we arent skillful in our awareness if we dont know how to keep the mind under careful supervision well be no match for them  for there are so many of themBut if we keep the mind well supervised the defilements will be afraid of us  afraid of our mindfulness and discernment afraid of our awarenessNotice when the mind is empty aware all around with no attachments to anything at all The defilements will hide out quiet as if they werent there at allBut as soon as mindfulness slips even just a little they spring right upThey spring right upIf you recognize them for what they are the moment they spring up theyll disband right thereThis is a very useful skill to haveBut if we let them get to the point where they turn into issues theyll be hard to disbandThats when you have to bear with the fight and not give upWhatever happens start out by bearing with it  not simply to endure it but so as to examine it to see what its like how it changes how it passes awayWe bear with things so that we can see through their deceits the way they arise persist and disband on their ownIf they disband while were examining them and clearly seeing their deceitfulness we can have done with them for goodThis will leave the mind in a state of freedom and independence empty entirely within itselfIf you can learn to see through things right away the moment they arise  what you might call your own little instantaneous awakenings  your aware ness will keep getting brighter and brighter stronger and more expansive all the timeSo work at them  these little instantaneous understandings  and eventually when things come together in an appropriate way there will be the moment where theres the instantaneous cutting through of defilements and effluents once and for allWhen that happens then  nibbanaNo more taking birthBut if you havent yet reached that point just keep sharpening your knives your mindfulness and discernmentIf theyre dull they wont be able to cut anything through but whatever shape theyre in keep cutting through bit by bit whatever you canI ask that you keep at this examining and understanding all around within the mind until you reach the point where everything is totally clear and you can let go of everything with the realization that nothing in the five aggregates or in physical and mental phenomena is me or mineKeep trying to let go and that will be enoughEach moment as theyre taking care of you here in the hospital do what has to be done for your illness but make sure that theres this separate special awareness exclusive to the mind  this knowing that simply lets go of itselfThat will end all your problems right thereThose who practice the Dhamma should train themselves to understand in the following stagesThe training that is easy to learn gives immediate results and is suitable for every time every place for people of every age and either sex is to study in the school of this body  a fathom long a cubit wide and a span thick  with its perceiving mind in chargeThis body has many things ranging from the crude to the subtle that are well worth knowingThe steps of the trainingTo begin with know that the body is composed of various physical properties the major ones being the properties of earth water fire and wind the minor ones being the aspects that adhere to the major ones things like color smell shape etcThese properties are unstable stressful and uncleanIf you look into them deeply you will see that theres no substance to them at allThey are simply impersonal conditions with nothing worth calling me or mine When you can clearly perceive the body in these terms you will be able to let go of any clinging or attachment to it as an entity your self someone else this or thatThe second step is to deal with mental phenomenaFocus on keeping track of the truth that these are characterized by arising persisting and then disbandingIn other words their nature is to arise and disband arise and disband repeatedlyWhen you investigate to see this truth you will be able to let go of your attachments to mental phenomena as entities as your self someone else this or thatTraining on the level of practice doesnt simply mean studying listening or readingYou have to practice so as to see clearly with your own mind in the following stepsaStart out by brushing aside all external concerns and turn to look inside at your own mind until you can know in what ways it is clear or murky calm or unsettledThe way to do this is to have mindfulness and selfawareness in charge as you keep aware of the body and mind until youve trained the mind to stay firmly in a state of normalcy ie neutralitybOnce the mind can stay in a state of normalcy you will see mental formations or preoccupations in their natural state of arising and disbandingThe mind will be empty neutral and still  neither pleased nor displeased  and will see physical and mental phenomena as they arise and disband naturally of their own accordcWhen the knowledge that there is no self to any of these things becomes thoroughly clear you will meet with something that lies further inside beyond all suffering and stress free from the cycles of change  deathless  free from birth as well as death since all things that take birth must by nature age grow ill and diedWhen you see this truth clearly the mind will be empty not holding onto anythingIt wont even assume itself to be a mind or anything at allIn other words it wont latch onto itself as being anything of any sortAll that remains is a pure condition of DhammaeThose who see this pure condition of Dhamma in full clarity are bound to grow disenchanted with the repeated sufferings of lifeWhen they know the truth of the world and the Dhamma throughout they will see the results clearly right in the present that there exists that which lies beyond all sufferingThey will know this without having to ask or take it on faith from anyone for the Dhamma is paccattam ie something really to be known for oneselfThose who have seen this truth within themselves will attest to it alwaysFor those of you who have never sat in meditation here is how its done Fold your legs one on top of the other but dont cut off the nerves or the blood flow or else the breath energy in your legs will stagnate and cause you painSit straight and place your hands one on top of the other on your lapHold your head up straight and keep your back straight too  as if you had a yardstick sticking down your spineYou have to work at keeping it straight you knowDont spend the time slouching down and then stretching up again or else the mind wont be able to settle down and be stillKeep the body straight and your mindfulness firm  firmly with the breathHowever coarse or refined your breath may be simply breathe in naturallyYou dont have to force the breath or tense your bodySimply breathe in and out in a relaxed wayOnly then will the mind begin to settle downAs soon as the breath grows normally refined and the mind has begun to settle down focus your attention on the mind itselfIf it slips off elsewhere or any thoughts come in to intrude simply know right there at the mindKnow the mind right at the mind with every inandout breath for the entire hourWhen you focus on the breath using the breath as a leash to tie the mind in place so that it doesnt go wandering off you have to use your enduranceThat is you have to endure painFor example when you sit for a long time theres going to be pain because youve never sat for so long beforeSo first make sure that you keep the mind normal and neutralWhen pain arises dont focus on the painLet go of it as much as you canLet go of it and focus on your mind For those of you whove never done this before it may take a whileWhenever any pain or anything arises if the mind is affected by craving or defilement itll struggle because it doesnt want the painAll it wants is pleasureThis is where you have to be patient and endure the pain because pain is something that has to occurIf theres pleasure dont get enthralled with itIf theres pain dont push it awayStart out by keeping the mind neutral as your basic stanceThen whenever pleasure or pain arises dont get pleased or upsetKeep the mind continuously neutral and figure out how to let goIf theres a lot of pain you first have to endure it and then relax your attachmentsDont think of the pain as being your painLet it be the pain of the body the pain of natureIf the mind latches tight onto anything it really suffersIt strugglesSo here we patiently endure and let goYou have to practice so that youre really good at handling painIf you can let go of physical pain youll be able to let go of all sorts of other sufferings and pains as well Keep watching the pain knowing the pain letting it goOnce you can let it go you dont have to use a lot of enduranceIt takes a lot of endurance only at the beginningOnce the pain arises separate the mind from itLet it be the pain of the bodyDont let the mind be pained tooThis is something that requires equanimityIf you can maintain equanimity in the face of pleasure or pain it can make the mind peaceful  peaceful even though the pain is still painThe mind keeps knowing enduring the pain so as to let it goAfter youve worked at this a good while youll come to see how important the ways of the mind areThe mind may be hard to train but if you keep training it  if you have the time you can practice at home at night or early in the morning keeping watch on your mind  youll gain the understanding that comes from mindfulness and discernmentThose who dont train the mind like this go through life  birth aging illness and death  not knowing a thing about the mind at allWhen you know your own mind then when any really heavy illness comes along the fact that you know your mind will make the pain less and lessBut this is something you have to work at doing correctlyIts not easy yet once the mind is well trained theres no match for itIt can do away with pain and suffering and doesnt get restless and agitatedIt grows still and cool  refreshed and blooming right there within itselfSo try to experience this still quiet mindThis is a really important skill to develop because it will make craving defilement and attachment grow weaker and weakerAll of us have defilements you knowGreed anger and delusion cloud all of our heartsIf we havent trained ourselves in meditation our hearts are constantly burning with suffering and stressEven the pleasure we feel over external things is pleasure only in halfmeasures because theres suffering and stress in the delusion that thinks its pleasureAs for the pleasure that comes from the practice its a cool pleasure that lets go of everything really free from any sense of me or mine I ask that you reach the Dhamma thats the real meat inside this thing undisturbed by defilement undisturbed by pain or anything elseEven though theres pain in the body you have to figure out how to let it goThe bodys simply the four elements  earth water wind and fireIt has to keep showing its inconstancy and stressfulness so keep your mindfulness neutral at equanimityLet the mind be above its feelings  above pleasure above pain above everythingAll it really takes is endurance  endurance and relinquishment letting things go seeing that theyre not us not oursThis is a point you have to hammer at over and over againWhen we say you have to endure you really have to endureDont be willing to surrenderCraving is going to keep coming up and whispering  telling you to change things to try for this or that kind of pleasure  but dont you listen to itYou have to listen to the Buddha  the Buddha who tells you to let go of cravingOtherwise craving will plaster and paint things over the mind will struggle and wont be able to settle downSo you have to give it your allLook at this hour as a special hour  special in that youre using special endurance to keep watch on your own heart and mindThe most important thing in the daily life of a person who practices the Dhamma is to keep to the precepts and to care for them more than you care for your life  to maintain them in a way that the Noble Ones would praiseIf you dont have this sort of regard for the precepts then the vices that run counter to them will become your everyday habitsMeditators who see that the breaking of a precept is something trifling and insignificant spoil their entire practiceIf you cant practice even these basic beginning levels of the Dhamma it will ruin all the qualities youll be trying to develop in the later stages of the practiceThis is why you have to stick to the precepts as your basic foundation and to keep a lookout for anything in your behavior that falls short of themOnly then will you be able to benefit from your practice for the sake of eliminating your sufferings with greater and greater precisionIf you simply act in line with the cravings and desires swelling out of the sense of self that has no fear of the fires of defilement youll have to suffer both in this life and in lives to comeIf you dont have a sense of conscience  a sense of shame at the thought of doing shoddy actions and a fear of their consequences  your practice can only deteriorate day by dayWhen people live without any order to their lives  without even the basic order that comes with the precepts  theres no way they can attain purityWe have to examine ourselves In what ways at present are we breaking our precepts in thought word or deedIf we simply let things pass and arent intent on examining ourselves to see the harm that comes from breaking the precepts and following the defilements our practice can only sink lower and lowerInstead of extinguishing defilements and suffering it will simply succumb to the power of cravingIf this is the case what damage is doneHow much freedom does the mind loseThese are things we have to learn for ourselvesWhen we do our practice of selfinspection in higher matters will get solid results and wont go straying off into nonsenseFor this reason whenever craving or defilement shows itself in any way in any of our actions we have to catch hold of it and examine whats going on inside the mindOnce were aware with real mindfulness and discernment well see the poison and power of the defilementsWell feel disgust for them and want to extinguish them as much as we canBut if we use our defilements to examine things theyll say everything is fineThe same as when were predisposed to liking a certain person Even if he acts badly we say hes goodIf he acts wrongly we say hes rightThis is the way the defilements areThey say that everything we do is right and throw all the blame on other people other thingsSo we cant trust it  this sense of self in which craving and defilement lord it over the heartWe cant trust it at allThe violence of defilement or this sense of self is like that of a fire burning a forest or burning a houseIt wont listen to anyone but simply keeps burning away burning away inside of youAnd thats not allIts always out to set fire to other people tooThe fires of suffering the fires of defilement consume all those who dont contemplate themselves or who dont have any means of practice for putting them outPeople of this sort cant withstand the power of the defilements cant help but follow along wherever their cravings lead themThe moment theyre provoked they follow in line with these thingsThis is why the sensations in the mind when provoked by defilement are very important for they can lead you to do things with no sense of shame no fear for the consequences of doing evil at all  which means that youre sure to break your preceptsOnce youve followed the defilements they feel really satisfied  like arsonists who feel gleeful when theyve set other peoples places on fireAs soon as youve called somebody something vile or spread some malicious gossip the defilements really like itYour sense of self really likes it because acting in line with defilement like that gives it real satisfactionAs a consequence it keeps filling itself with the vices that run counter to the precepts falling into hell in this very lifetime without realizing itSo take a good look at the violence the defilements do to you to see whether you should keep socializing with them to see whether you should regard them as your friends or your enemiesAs soon as any wrong views or ideas come out of the mind we have to analyze them and turn around so as to catch sight of the facts within usNo matter what issues the defilements raise focusing on the faults of others we have to turn around and look withinWhen we realize our own faults and can come to our senses Thats where our study of the Dhamma our practice of the Dhamma shows its real rewardsThe passage for reflection on the four requisites is a fine pattern for contemplation but we never actually get down to putting it to useWere taught to memorize it in the beginning not simply to pass the time of day or so that we can talk about it every now and then but so that we can use it to contemplate the requisites until we really know them with our own mindfulness and discernmentIf we actually get down to contemplating in line with the established pattern our minds will become much less influenced by unwise thoughtsBut its the rare person who genuinely makes this a continuous practice For the most part were not interestedWe dont feel like contemplating this sort of thingWed much rather contemplate whether this or that food will taste good or not and if it doesnt taste good how to fix it so that it willThats the sort of thing we like to contemplateTry to see the filthiness of food and of the physical properties in general to see their emptiness of any real entity or selfTheres nothing of any substance to the physical properties of the body which are all rotten and decomposingThe body is like a restroom over a cesspoolWe can decorate it on the outside to make it pretty and attractive but on the inside its full of the most horrible filthy thingsWhenever we excrete anything we ourselves are repelled by it yet even though were repelled by it its there inside us in our intestines  decomposing full of worms awful smellingTheres just the flimsiest membrane covering it up yet we fall for it and hold tight to itWe dont see the constant decomposition of this body in spite of the filth and smells it sends outThe reason were taught to memorize the passage for reflecting on the requisites and to use it to contemplate is so that well see the inconstancy of the body to see that theres no self to any of it or to any of the mental phenomena we sense with every momentWe contemplate mental phenomena to see clearly that theyre notself to see this with every momentThe moments of the mind  the arising persisting and disbanding of mental sensations  are very subtle and fastTo see them the mind has to be quietIf the mind is involved in distractions thoughts and imaginings we wont be able to penetrate in to see its characteristics as it deals with its objects to see what the arising and disbanding within it is likeThis is why we have to practice concentration to make the mind quiet to provide a foundation for our contemplationFor instance you can focus on the breath or be aware of the mind as it focuses on the breathActually when you focus on the breath youre also aware of the mindAnd again the mind is what knows the breathSo you focus exclusively on the breath together with the mindDont think of anything else and the mind will settle down and grow stillOnce it attains stillness on this level youve got your chance to contemplateMaking the mind still so that you can contemplate it is something you have to keep working at in the beginningThe same holds true with training yourself to be mindful  alert in all your activitiesThis is something you really have to work at continuously in this stage something you have to do all the timeAt the same time you have to arrange the external conditions of your life so that you wont have any concerns to distract youNow of course the practice is something you can do in any set of circumstances  for example when you come home from work you can sit and meditate for a while  but when youre trying seriously to make it continuous to make it habitual its much more difficult than thatMaking it habitual means being fully mindful and aware with each inandout breath wherever you go whatever you do whether youre healthy sick or whatever and regardless of what happens inside or outThe mind has to be in a state of allencompassing awareness while keeping track of the arising and disbanding of mental phenomena at all times  to the point where you can stop the mind from forming thoughts under the power of craving and defilement the way it used to before you began the practiceTry keeping your awareness with the breath to see what the still mind is likeIts very simple all the rules have been laid out but when you actually try to do it something resistsIts hardBut when you let your mind think or things no matter what its all easyIts not hard at allTry and see if you can engage your mind with the breath in the same way its been engaged with the defilementsTry engaging it with the breath and see what happensSee if you can disperse the defilements with every inandout breathWhy is it that the mind can stay engaged with the defilements all day long and yet go for entire days without knowing how heavy or subtle the breath is at allSo try and be observantThe bright clear awareness that stems from staying focused on the mind at all times Sometimes a strong sensory contact comes and can make it blur and fade away with no trouble at allBut if you can keep hold of the breath as a reference point that state of mind can be more stable and sure more insuredIt has two fences around itIf theres only one fence it can easily breakNormally the mind isnt willing to stop and look to stop and know itself which is why we have to keep training it continually so that it will settle down from its restlessness and grow stillLet your desires and thoughtprocesses settle downLet the mind take its stance in a state of normalcy not liking or disliking anythingTo reach a basic level of emptiness and freedom you first have to take a stanceIf you dont have a stance against which to measure things progress will be very difficultIf your practice is hitormiss  a bit of that a little of this  you wont get any resultsSo the mind first has to take a stanceWhen you take a stance that the mind can maintain in a state of normalcy dont go slipping off into the futureHave the mind know itself in the stance of the present Right now its in a state of normalcyNo likes or dislikes have arisen yetIt hasnt created any issuesIts not being disturbed by a desire for this or thatThen look on in to the basic level of the mind to see if its as normal and empty as it should beIf youre really looking inside really aware inside then that which is looking and knowing is mindfulness and discernment in and of itselfYou dont need to search for anything anywhere else to come and do your looking for youAs soon as you stop to look stop to know whether or not the mind is in a state of normalcy then if its normal youll know immediately that its normalIf its not youll know immediately that its notTake care to keep this awareness goingIf you can keep knowing like this continuously the mind will be able to keep its stance continuously as wellAs soon as the thought occurs to you to check things out youll immediately stop to look stop to know without any need to go searching for knowledge from anywhere elseYou look you know right there at the mind and can tell whether or not its empty and stillOnce you see that it is then you investigate to see how its empty how its stillIts not the case that once its empty thats the end of the matter once its still thats the end of the matterThats not the case at allYou have to keep watch of things you have to investigate at all timesOnly then will you see the changing  the arising and disbanding  occurring in that emptiness that stillness that state of normalcyTo lead your daily life by keeping constant supervision over the mind is a way of learning what life is forIts a way of learning how we can act so as to rid ourselves more and more of suffering and stress  because the suffering and stress caused by defilement attachment and craving are sure to take all sorts of formsOnly by being aware with true mindfulness and discernment can we comprehend them for what they areOtherwise well simply live obliviously going wherever events will lead usThis is why mindfulness and discernment are tools for reading yourself for testing yourself within so that you wont be careless or complacent oblivious to the fact that suffering is basically what life is all aboutThis point is something we really have to comprehend so that we can live without being obliviousThe pains and discontent that fill our bodies and minds all show us the truths of inconstancy stress and notselfness within usIf you contemplate whats going on inside until you can get down to the details youll see the truths that appear within and without all of which come down to inconstancy stress and notselfnessBut the delusion basic to our nature will see everything wrongly  as constant easeful and self  and so make us live obliviously even though there is nothing to guarantee how long our lives will lastOur dreams and delusions make us forget that we live in the midst of a mass of pain and stress  the stress of defilements the pain of birthBirth aging illness and death All of these are painful and stressful in the midst of instability and changeTheyre things we have no control over for they must circle around in line with the laws of kamma and the defilements weve been amassing all alongLife that floats along in the round of rebirth is thus nothing but stress and painIf we can find a way to develop our mindfulness and discernment theyll be able to cut the round of rebirth so that we wont have to keep wandering onTheyll help us know that birth is painful aging is painful illness is painful death is painful and that these are all things that defilement attachment and craving keep driving through the cycles of changeSo as long as we have the opportunity we should study the truths appearing throughout our body and mind and well come to know that the elimination of stress and pain the elimination of defilement is a function of our practice of the DhammaIf we dont practice the Dhamma well keep floating along in the round of rebirth that is so drearily repetitious  repetitious in its birth aging illness and death driven on by defilement attachment and craving causing us repeated stress repeated painLiving beings for the most part dont know where these stresses and pains come from or what they come from because theyve never studied them never contemplated them so they stay stupid and deluded wandering on and on without endIf we can stop and be still the mind will have a chance to be free to contemplate its sufferings and to let them goThis will give it a measure of peace because it will no longer want anything out of the round of rebirth  for it sees that theres nothing lasting to it that its simply stress over and over againWhatever you grab hold of is stressThis is why you need mindfulness and discernment to know and see things for yourself so that you can supervise the mind and keep it calm without letting it fall victim to temptationThis practice is something of the highest importancePeople who dont study or practice the Dhamma have wasted their birth as human beings because theyre born deluded and simply stay deludedBut if we study the Dhamma well become wise to suffering and know the path of practice for freeing ourselves from itOnce we follow the right path the defilements wont be able to drag us around wont be able to burn us because were the ones burning them awayWell come to realize that the more we can burn them away the more strength of mind well gainIf we let the defilements burn us the mind will be sapped of its strength which is why this is something you have to be very careful aboutKeep trying to burn away the defilements in your every activity and youll be storing up strength for your mindfulness and discernment so that theyll be brave in dealing with all sorts of suffering and painYou must come to see the world as nothing but stressTheres no real ease to it at allThe awareness we gain from mindfulness and discernment will make us disenchanted with life in the world because it will see things for what they are in every way both within us and withoutThe entire world is nothing but an affair of delusion an affair of sufferingPeople who dont know the Dhamma dont practice the Dhamma  no matter what their status or position in life  lead deluded oblivious livesWhen they fall ill or are about to die theyre bound to suffer enormously because they havent taken the time to understand the defilements that burn their hearts and minds in everyday lifeYet if we make a constant practice of studying and contemplating ourselves as our everyday activity it will help free us from all sorts of suffering and distressAnd when this is the case how can we not want to practiceOnly intelligent people though will be able to stick with the practiceFoolish people wont want to botherTheyd much rather follow the defilements than burn them awayTo practice the Dhamma you need a certain basic level of intelligence  enough to have seen at least something of the stresses and sufferings that come from defilementOnly then can your practice progressAnd no matter how difficult it gets youll have to keep practicing on to the endThis practice isnt something you do from time to time you knowYou have to keep at it continuously throughout lifeEven if it involves so much physical pain or mental anguish that tears are bathing your cheeks you have to keep with the chaste life because youre playing for realIf you dont follow the chaste life youll get mired in heaps of suffering and flameSo you have to learn your lessons from painTry to contemplate it until you can understand it and let it go and youll gain one of lifes greatest rewardsDont think that you were born to gain this or that level of comfortYou were born to study pain and the causes of pain and to follow the practice that frees you from painThis is the most important thing there isEverything else is trivial and unimportantWhats important all lies with the practiceDont think that the defilements will go away easilyWhen they dont come in blatant forms they come in subtle ones  and the dangers of the subtle ones are hard to seeYour contemplation will have to be subtle too if you want to get rid of themYoull come to realize that this practice of the Dhamma in which we contemplate to get to the details inside us is like sharpening our tools so that when stress and suffering arise we can weaken them and cut them awayIf your mindfulness and discernment are brave the defilements will have to lose out to themBut if you dont train your mindfulness and discernment to be brave the defilements will crush you to piecesWe were born to do battle with the defilements and to strengthen our mindfulness and discernmentWell find that the worth of our practice will grow higher and higher because in our everyday life weve done continuous battle with the stresses and pains caused by defilement craving and temptation all along  so that the defilements will grow thin and our mindfulness and discernment strongerWell sense within ourselves that the mind isnt as troubled and restless as it used to beIts grown peaceful and calmThe stresses and sufferings of defilement attachment and craving have grown weakerEven though we havent yet wiped them out completely theyve grown continually weaker  because we dont feed themWe dont give them shelterWe do what we can to weaken them so that they grow thinner and thinner each timeAnd we have to be brave in contemplating stress and pain because when we dont feel any great suffering we tend to get complacentBut when the pains and sufferings in our body and mind grow sharp and biting we have to use our mindfulness and discernment to be strongDont let your spirits be weakOnly then will you be able to do away with your sufferings and painsWe have to learn our lessons from pain so that ultimately the mind can gain its freedom from it instead of being weak and losing out to it all of the timeWe have to be brave in doing battle with it to the ultimate extreme  until we reach the point where we can let it goPain is something always present in this conglomerate of body and mindIts here for us to see with every momentIf we contemplate it till we know all its details we can then make it our sport seeing that the pain is the pain of natural conditions and not our painThis is something we have to research so as to get to the details that its not our pain its the pain of the aggregatesKnowing in this way means that we can separate out the properties  the properties of matter and those of the mind  to see how they interact with one another how they changeIts something really fascinating Watching pain is a way of building up lots of mindfulness and discernmentBut if you focus on pleasure and ease youll simply stay deluded like people in generalThey get carried away with the pleasure that comes from watching or listening to the things they like  but then when pain comes to their bodies and minds to the point where tears are bathing their cheeks think of how much they sufferAnd then they have to be parted from their loved ones which makes it even worseBut those of us who practice the Dhamma dont need to be deluded like that because we know and see with every moment that only stress arises only stress persists only stress passes awayAside from stress nothing arises aside from stress nothing passes awayThis is there for us to perceive with every momentIf we contemplate it well see itSo we cant let ourselves be obliviousThis is what the truth is and we have to study it so as to know it  especially in our life of the practiceWe have to contemplate stress all the time to see its every manifestationThe arahants live without being oblivious because they know the truth at all times and their hearts are clean and pureAs for us with our defilements we have to keep trying because if we continually supervise the mind with mindfulness and discernment well be able to keep the defilements from making it dirty and obscuredEven if it does become obscured in any way well be able to remove that obscurity and make the mind empty and freeThis is the practice that weakens all the defilements attachments and cravings within usIts because of this practice of the Dhamma that our lives will become freeSo I ask you to keep working at the practice without being complacent because if in whatever span of life is left to you you keep trying to the full extent of your abilities youll gain the mindfulness and discernment to see the facts within yourself and be able to let go  free from any sense of self free from any sense of self  continuouslyThe mind if mindfulness and awareness are watching over it wont meet with any suffering as the result of its actionsIf suffering does arise well be immediately aware of it and able to put it outThis is one point of the practice we can work at constantlyAnd we can test ourselves by seeing how refined and subtle our allaround awareness is inside the mindWhenever the mind slips away and goes out to receive external sensory contact Can it maintain its basic stance of mindfulness or internal awarenessThe practice we need to work at in our everyday life is to have constant mindfulness constant allaround present awareness like thisThis is something we work at in every posture sitting standing walking and lying downMake sure that your mindfulness stays continuousLiving in this world  the mental and physical phenomena of these five aggregates  gives us plenty to contemplateWe must try to watch them to contemplate them so that we can understand them  because the truths we must learn how to read in this body and mind are here to be read with every momentWe dont have to get wrapped up with any other extraneous themes because all the themes we need are right here in the body and mindAs long as we can keep the mind constantly aware all around we can contemplate themIf you contemplate mental and physical events to see how they arise and disband right in the here and now and dont get involved with external things  like sights making contact with the eyes or sounds with the ears  then there really arent a lot of issuesThe mind can be at normalcy at equilibrium  calm and undisturbed by defilement or the stresses that come from sensory contactIt can look after itself and maintain its balanceYoull come to sense that if youre aware right at awareness in and of itself without going out to get involved in external things like the mental labels and thoughts that will tend to arise the mind will see their constant arising and disbanding  and wont be embroiled in anythingThis way it can be disengaged empty and freeBut if it goes out to label things as good or evil as me or mine or gets attached to anything itll become unsettled and disturbedYou have to know that if the mind can be still totally and presently aware and capable of contemplating with every activity then blatant forms of suffering and stress will dissolve awayEven if they start to form you can be alert to them and disperse them immediatelyOnce you see this actually happening  even in only the beginning stages  it can disperse a lot of the confusion and turmoil in your heartIn other words dont let yourself dwell on the past or latch onto thoughts of the futureAs for the events arising and passing away in the present you have to leave them aloneWhatever your duties simply do them as you have to  and the mind wont get worked up about anythingIt will be able to at least some extent to be empty and stillThis one thing is something you have to be very careful aboutYou have to see this for yourself that if your mindfulness and discernment are constantly in charge the truths of the arising and disbanding of mental and physical phenomena are always there for you to see always there for you to knowIf you look at the body youll have to see it simply as physical propertiesIf you look at feelings youll have to see them as changing and inconstant pleasure pain neither pleasure nor painTo see these things is to see the truth within yourselfDont let yourself get caught up with your external dutiesSimply keep watch in this way insideIf your awareness is the sort that lets you read yourself correctly the mind will be able to stay at normalcy at equilibrium at stillness without any resistanceIf the mind can stay with itself and not go out looking for things to criticize or latch onto it can maintain a natural form of stillnessSo this is something we have to try for in our every activityKeep your conversations to a minimum and there wont be a whole lot of issuesKeep watch right at the mindWhen you keep watch at the mind and your mindfulness is continuous your senses can stay restrainedBeing mindful to keep watch in this way is something you have to work atTry it and see Can you keep this sort of awareness continuousWhat sort of things can still get the mind engagedWhat sorts of thoughts and labels of good and bad me and mine does it think upThen look to see if these things arise and disbandThe sensations that arise from external contact and internal contact all have the same sorts of characteristicsYou have to look till you can see thisIf you know how to look youll see it  and the mind will grow calmSo the point we have to practice in this latter stage doesnt have a whole lot of issuesTheres nothing you have to do nothing you have to label nothing you have to think a whole lot aboutSimply look carefully and contemplate and in this very lifetime youll have a chance to be calm and at peace to know yourself more profoundly withinYoull come to see that the Dhamma is amazing right here in your own heartDont go searching for the Dhamma outside for it lies withinPeace lies within but we have to contemplate so that were aware all around  subtly deep downIf you look just on the surface you wont understand anythingEven if the mind is at normalcy on the ordinary everyday level you wont understand much of anything at allYou have to contemplate so that youre aware all around in a skillful wayThe word skillful is something you cant explain with words but you can know for yourself when you see the way in which awareness within the heart becomes special when you see what this special awareness is aboutThis is something you can know for yourselfAnd theres not really much to it simply arising persisting disbandingLook until this becomes plain  really really plain  and everything disappearsAll suppositions all conventional formulations all those aggregates and properties get swept away leaving nothing but awareness pure and simple not involved with anything at all  and theres nothing you have to do to itSimply stay still and watch be aware letting go with every momentSimply watching this one thing is enough to do away with all sorts of defilements all sorts of suffering and stressIf you dont know how to watch it the mind is sure to get disturbedIts sure to label things and concoct thoughtsAs soon as theres contact at the senses itll go looking for things to latch onto liking and disliking the objects it meets in the present and then getting involved with the past and future spinning a web to entangle itselfIf you truly look at each moment in the present theres really nothing at allYoull see with every mental moment that things disband disband disband  really nothing at allThe important point is that you dont go forming issues out of nothingThe physical elements perform their duties in line with their elementary physical natureThe mental elements keep sensing in line with their own affairsBut our stupidity is what goes looking for issues to cook up to label to think aboutIt goes looking for things to latch onto and then gets the mind into a turmoilThis point is all we really have to see for ourselvesThis is the problem we have to solve for ourselvesIf things are left to their nature pure and simple theres no us no them This is a singular truth that will arise for us to know and seeTheres nothing else we can know or see that can match it in any wayOnce you know and see this one thing it extinguishes all suffering and stressThe mind will be empty and free with no meanings no attachments for anything at allThis is why looking inward is so special in so many waysWhatever arises simply stop still to look at itDont get excited by itIf you become excited when any special intuitions arise when the mind is still youll get the mind worked up into a turmoilIf you become afraid that this or that will happen that too will get you in a turmoilSo you have to stop and look stop and knowThe first thing is simply to lookThe first thing is simply to knowAnd dont latch onto what you know  because whatever it is its simply a phenomenon that arises and disbands arises and disbands changing as part of its natureSo your awareness has to take a firm stance right at the mind in and of itselfIn the beginning stages you have to know that when mindfulness is standing firm the mind wont be affected by the objects of sensory contactKeep working at maintaining this stance holding firm to this stanceIf you gain a sense of this for yourself really knowing and seeing for yourself your mindfulness will become even more firmIf anything arises in any way at all youll be able to let it go  and all the many troubles and turmoils of the mind will dissolve awayIf mindfulness slips and the mind goes out giving meanings to anything latching onto anything troubles will arise so you have to keep checking on this with every momentTheres nothing else thats so worth checking onYou have to keep check on the mind in and of itself contemplating the mind in and of itselfOr else you can contemplate the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves or the phenomenon of arising and disbanding  ie the Dhamma  in and of itselfAll of these things are themes you can keep track of entirely within yourselfYou dont have to keep track of a lot of themes because having a lot of themes is what will make you restless and distractedFirst youll practice this theme then youll practice that then youll make comparisons all of which will keep the mind from growing stillIf you can take your stance at awareness if youre skilled at looking the mind can be at peaceYoull know how things arise and disbandFirst practice keeping awareness right within yourself so that your mindfulness can be firm without being affected by the objects of sensory contact so that it wont label things as good or bad pleasing or displeasingYou have to keep checking to see that when the mind can be at normalcy centered and neutral as its primary stance then  whatever it knows or sees  it will be able to contemplate and let goThe sensations in the mind that we explain at such length are still on the level of labelsOnly when there can be awareness right at awareness will you really be able to know that the mind that is aware of awareness in this way doesnt send its knowing outside of this awarenessThere are no issuesNothing can be concocted in the mind when it knows in this wayIn other wordsThe only thing you have to work at maintaining is the state of mind at normalcy  knowing seeing and still in the presentIf you dont maintain it if you dont keep looking after it then when sensory contact comes it will have an effectThe mind will go out with labels of good and bad liking and dislikingSo make sure you maintain the basic awareness thats aware right at yourselfAnd dont let there be any labelingNo matter what sort of sensory contact comes you have to make sure that this awareness comes firstIf you train yourself correctly in this way everything will stopYou wont go straying out through your senses of sight hearing etcThe mind will stop and look stop and be aware right at awareness so as to know the truth that all things arise and disbandTheres no real truth to anythingOnly our stupidity is what latches onto things giving them meanings and then suffering for it  suffering because of its ignorance suffering because of its unacquaintance with the five aggregates  form feelings perceptions thoughtformations and consciousness  all of which are inconstant stressful and notselfUse mindfulness to gather your awareness together and the mind will stop getting unsettled stop running after thingsIt will be able to stop and be stillThen make it know in this way see in this way constantly  at every moment with every activityWork at watching and knowing the mind in and of itself That will be enough to cut away all sorts of issuesYou wont have to concern yourself with themIf the body is in pain simply keep watch of itYou can simply keep watch of feelings in the body because the mind thats aware of itself in this way can keep watch of anything within or withoutOr it can simply be aware of itself to the point where it lets go of things outside lets go of sensory contact and keeps constant watch on the mind in and of itselfThats when youll know that this is what the mind is like when its at peace It doesnt give meanings to anythingIts the emptiness of the mind unattached uninvolved unconcerned with anything at allThese words  unattached uninvolved and unconcerned  are things you have to consider carefully because what they refer to is subtle and deepUninvolved means uninvolved with sensory contact undisturbed by the body or feelingsUnconcerned means not worried about past future or presentYou have to contemplate these things until you know them skillfullyEven though theyre subtle you have to contemplate them until you know them thoroughlyAnd dont go concerning yourself with external things because theyll keep you unsettled keep you running keep you distracted with labels and thoughts of good and bad and all that sort of thingYou have to put a stop to these thingsIf you dont your practice wont accomplish anything because these things keep playing up to you and deceiving you  ie once you see anything it will fool you into seeing it as right wrong good bad and so forthEventually you have to come down to the awareness that everything simply arises persists and then disbandsMake sure you stay focused on the disbandingIf you watch just the arising you may get carried off on a tangent but if you focus on the disbanding youll see emptiness Everything is disbanding every instantNo matter what you look at no matter what you see its there for just an instant and then disbandsThen it arises againThen it disbandsTheres simply arising knowing disbandingSo lets watch what happens of its own accord  because the arising and disbanding that occurs by way of the senses is something that happens of its own accordYou cant prevent itYou cant force itIf you look and know it without attachment there will be none of the harm that comes from joy or sorrowThe mind will stay in relative normalcy and neutralityBut if youre forgetful and start latching on labeling things in pairs in any way at all  good and bad happy and sad pleasing and displeasing  the mind will become unsettled no longer empty no longer stillWhen this happens you have to probe on in to know whyAll the worthless issues that arise in the mind have to be cut awayThen youll find that you have less and less to say less and less to talk about less and less to think aboutThese things grow less and less on their ownThey stop on their ownBut if you get involved in a lot of issues the mind wont be able to stay stillSo we have to keep watching things that are completely worthless and without substance to see that theyre notselfKeep watching them repeatedly because your awareness coupled with the mindfulness and discernment that will know the truth has to see that This isnt my selfTheres no substance or worth to it at allIt simply arises and disbands right hereIts here for just an instant and then it disbandsAll we have to do is stop and look stop and know clearly in this way and well be able to do away with many many kinds of suffering and stressThe normal stress of the aggregates will still occur  we cant prevent it  but well know that its the stress of nature and wont latch onto it as oursSo we keep watch of things that happen on their ownIf we know how to watch we keep watching things that happen on their ownDont latch onto them as being you or yoursKeep this awareness firmly established in itself as much as you can and there wont be much else youll have to remember or think aboutWhen you keep looking keep knowing like this at all times youll come to see that there are no big issues going onTheres just the issue of arising persisting and disbandingYou dont have to label anything as good or badIf you simply look in this way its no great weight on the heartBut if you go dragging in issues of good and bad self and all that then suffering starts in a big wayThe defilements start in a big way and weigh on the heart making it troubled and upsetSo you have to stop and look stop and investigate really deep down insideIts like water covered with duckweed Only when we take our hand to part the duckweed and take a look will we see that the water beneath it is crystal clearAs you look into the mind you have to part it you have to stop stop thinking stop labeling things as good or bad stop everythingYou cant go branding anythingSimply keep looking keep knowingWhen the mind is quiet youll see that theres nothing thereEverything is all stillEverything has all stopped insideBut as soon as theres labeling even in the stillness the stopping the quiet it will set things in motionAnd as soon as things get set into motion and you dont know how to let go right from the start issues will arise waves will ariseOnce there are issues and waves they strike the mind and it goes splashing all out of controlThis splashing of the mind includes craving and defilement as well because avijja  ignorance  lies at its rootOur major obstacle is this aggregate of perceptions of labelsIf we arent aware of the arising and disbanding of perceptions these labels will take holdPerceptions are the chief instigators that label things within and without so we have to be aware of their arising and disbandingOnce were aware in this way perceptions will no longer function as a cause of sufferingIn other words they wont give rise to any further thoughtformationsThe mind will be aware in itself and able to extinguish these things in itselfSo we have to stop things at the level of perceptionIf we dont thoughtformations will fashion things into issues and then cause consciousness to wobble and waver in all sorts of waysBut these are things we can stop and look at things we can know with every mental moment If we arent yet really acquainted with the arising and disbanding in the mind we wont be able to let goWe can talk about letting go but we cant do it because we dont yet knowAs soon as anything arises we grab hold of it  even when actually its already disbanded but since we dont really see we dont knowSo I ask that you understand this basic principleDont go grasping after this thing or that or else youll get yourself all unsettledThe basic theme is within Look on in keep knowing on in until you penetrate everythingThe mind will then be free from turmoilEmptyQuietAwareSo keep continuous watch of the mind in and of itself and youll come to the point where you simply run out of things to sayEverything will stop on its own grow still on its own because the underlying condition that has stopped and is still is already there simply that we arent aware of it yetWe have to catch sight of the sensation of knowing when the mind gains knowledge of anything and yet isnt aware of itself to see how it latches onto things physical form feeling perceptions thoughtformations and consciousnessWe have to probe on in and look on our ownWe cant use the teachings weve memorized to catch sight of these thingsThat wont get us anywhere at allWe may remember The body is inconstant but even though we can say it we cant see itWe have to focus on in to see exactly how the body is inconstant to see how it changesAnd we have to focus on feelings  pleasant painful and neutral  to see how they changeThe same holds true with perceptions thoughtformations and so forthWe have to focus on them investigate them contemplate them to see their characteristics as they actually areEven if you can see these things for only a moment itll do you a world of goodYoull be able to catch yourself The things you thought you knew you didnt really know at all This is why the knowledge we gain in the practice has to keep changing through many many levelsIt doesnt stay on just one levelSo even when youre able to know arising and disbanding with every moment right in the present If your contemplation isnt continuous it wont be very clearYou have to know how to contemplate the bare sensation of arising and disbanding simply arising and disbanding without any labels of good or bad Just keep with the pure sensation of arising and disbandingWhen you do this other things will come to intrude  but no matter how they intrude its still a matter of arising and disbanding so you can keep your stance with arising and disbanding in this wayIf you start labeling things it gets confusingAll you need to do is keep looking at the right spot the bare sensation of arising and disbandingSimply make sure that you really keep watch of itWhether theres awareness of sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations just stay with the sensation of arising and disbandingDont go labeling the sight sound smell taste or tactile sensationIf you can keep watch in this way youre with the pure present  and there wont be any issuesWhen you keep watch in this way youre keeping watch on inconstancy on change as it actually occurs  because even the arising and disbanding changesIts not the same thing arising and disbanding all the timeFirst this sort of sensation arises and disbands then that sort arises and disbandsIf you keep watch on bare arising and disbanding like this youre sure to arrive at insightBut if you keep watch with labels  Thats the sound of a cow Thats the bark of a dog  you wont be watching the bare sensation of sound the bare sensation of arising and disbandingAs soon as theres labeling thoughtformations come along with itYour senses of touch sight hearing and so forth will continue their bare arising and disbanding but you wont know itInstead youll label everything  sights sounds etc and then there will be attachments feelings of pleasure and displeasure and you wont know the truthThe truth keeps going along on its ownSensations keep arising and then disbandingIf we focus right here  at the consciousness of the bare sensation of sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations  well be able to gain insight quicklyIf we know how to observe things in this way well be able to see easily when the mind is provoked by passion or greed and even more easily when its provoked by angerAs for delusion thats something more subtle something you have to take a great interest in and investigate carefullyYoull come to see all sorts of hidden things  how the mind is covered with many many layers of filmIts really fascinatingBut then thats what insight meditation is for  to open your eyes so that you can know and see so that you can destroy your delusion and ignoranceYou have to find approaches for contemplating and probing at all times so as to catch sight of the flickerings of awareness to see in what ways it streams out to know thingsBe careful to catch sight of it both when its knowing is right and when its wrongDont mix things up taking wrong knowledge for right or right knowledge for wrongThis is something extremely important for the practice this question of right and wrong knowing for these things can play tricks on youWhen you gain any new insights dont go getting excitedYou cant let yourself get excited by them at all because it doesnt take long for your insight to change  to change right now before your very eyesIts not going to change at some other time or placeIts changing right nowYou have to know how to observe how to acquaint yourself with the deceits of knowledgeEven when its correct knowledge you cant latch onto itEven though we may have standards for judging what sort of knowledge is correct in the course of our practice dont go latching onto correct knowledge  because correct knowledge is inconstantIt changesIt can turn into false knowledge or into knowledge that is even more correctYou have to contemplate things very carefully  very very carefully  so that you wont fall for your knowledge thinking Ive gained right insight I know better than other people so that you wont start assuming yourself to be specialThe moment you assume yourself your knowledge immediately turns wrongEven if you dont let things show outwardly the mere mental event in which the mind labels itself is a form of wrong knowing that obscures the mind from itself in an insidious wayThis is why meditators who tend not to contemplate things who dont catch sight of the deceits of every form of knowledge  right and wrong good and bad  tend to get bogged down in their knowledgeThe knowledge that deceives them into thinking What I know is right gives rise to strong pride and conceit within them without their even realizing itThis is because the defilements are always getting into the act without our realizing itTheyre insidious and in their insidious way they keep getting into the act as a matter of course for the defilements and mental effluents are still there in our characterOur practice is basically a probing deep inside from the outer levels of the mind to the inner onesThis is an approach that requires a great deal of subtlety and precision The mind has to use its own mindfulness and discernment to dig everything out of itself leaving just the mind in and of itself the body in and of itself and then keep watch of themThe basic challenge in the practice is this one point and nothing else this problem of how to look inward so that you see clear throughIf the mind hasnt been trained to look inward it tends to look outward simply waiting to receive its objects from outside  and all it gets is the confusion of its sensations going in and out in and outAnd even though this confusion is one aspect of change and inconstancy we dont see it that wayInstead we see it as issues good and bad pertaining to the selfWhen this is the case were back right where we started not knowing whats whatThis is why the minds sensations when it isnt acquainted with itself are so secretive and hard to perceiveIf you want to find out about them by reading a lot of books you end up piling more defilements onto the mind making it even more thickly covered than beforeSo when you turn to look inward you shouldnt use concepts and labels to do your looking for youIf you use concepts and labels to do your looking there will be nothing but concepts arising changing and disbandingEverything will get all concocted into thoughts  and then how will you be able to watch in utter silenceThe more you take what youve learned from books to look inside yourself the less youll seeSo whatever youve learned when you come to the practice you have to put all the labels and concepts youve gained from your learning to one sideYou have to make yourself an innocent beginner once moreOnly then will you be able to penetrate in to read the truths within youIf you carry all the paraphernalia of the concepts and standards youve gained from your learning to gauge things inside you you can search to your dying day and yet wont meet with any real truths at allThis is why you have to hold to only one theme in your practiceIf the mind has lots of themes to concern itself with its still just wandering around  wandering around to know this and that going out of bounds without realizing it and not really wanting to know itselfThis is why those with a lot of learning like to teach others to show off their level of understandingAnd this is precisely how the desire to stand out keeps the mind obscuredOf all the various kinds of deception theres none as bad as deceiving yourselfWhen you havent yet really seen the truth what business do you have making assumptions about yourself that youve attained this or that sort of knowledge or that you know enough to teach others correctlyThe Buddha is quite critical of teachers of this sortHe calls them people in vain Even if you can teach large numbers of people to become arahants while you yourself havent tasted the flavor of the Dhamma the Buddha says that youre a person in vainSo you have to keep examining yourselfIf you havent yet really trained yourself in the things you teach to others how will you be able to extinguish your own sufferingThink about this for a momentExtinguishing suffering gaining release from suffering Arent these subtle mattersArent they completely personal within usIf you question yourself in this way youll be on the right trackBut even then you have to be carefulIf you start taking sides with yourself the mind will cover itself up with wrong insights and wrong opinionsIf you dont observe really carefully you can get carried off on a tangent  because the awareness with which the mind reads itself and actually sees through itself is something really extraordinary really worth developing  and it really eliminates suffering and defilementThis is the real honest truth not a lot of propaganda or liesIts something you really have to practice and then youll really have to see clearly in this wayWhen this is the case how can you not want to practiceIf you examine yourself correctly in this way youll be able to know whats realBut you have to be careful to examine yourself correctlyIf you start latching onto any sense of self thinking that youre better than other people then youve failed the examinationNo matter how correct your knowledge you have to keep humble and respectful above all elseYou cant let there be any pride or conceit at all or it will destroy everythingThis is why the awareness that eliminates the sense of self depends more than anything else on your powers of observation  to check and see if theres still anything in your knowledge or opinions that comes from the force of pride in any sense of self You have to use the full power of your mindfulness and discernment to cut these things awayIts nothing you can play around atIf you gain a few insights or let go of things a bit dont go thinking youre anything specialThe defilements dont hold a truce with anyoneThey keep coming right out as they likeSo you have to be circumspect and examine things on all sidesOnly then will you be able to benefit in ways that make your defilements and sufferings lighter and lighterWhen we probe in to find the instigator  the mind or this property of consciousness  thats when were on the right track and our probing will keep getting results will keep weakening the germs of craving and wiping them outIn whatever way craving streams out for being or having in any way at all well be able to catch sight of it every timeTo catch hold and examine this being and having in this way though requires a lot of subtletyIf you arent really mindful and discerning you wont be able to catch sight of these things at all because the mind is continually wanting to be and to haveThe germs of defilement lie hidden deep in the seed of the mind in this property of consciousnessSimply to be aware of them skillfully is no mean feat  so we shouldnt even think of trying to wipe them out with our mere opinionsWe have to keep contemplating probing on in until things come together just right in a single moment and then its like reaching the basic level of knowing that exists on its own with no willing or intention at allThis is something that requires careful observation the difference between willed and unwilled knowingSometimes theres the intention to look and be aware within but there come times when theres no intention to look within and yet knowledge arises on its ownIf you dont yet know look at the intention to look inward What is it likeWhat is it looking forWhat does it seeThis is a basic approach you have to hold toThis is a level you have to work at and one in which you have to make use of intention  the intention to look inward in this way But once you reach the basic level of knowing then as soon as you happen to focus down and look within the knowledge will occur on its ownOne night I was sitting in meditation outside in the open air  my back straight as an arrow  firmly determined to make the mind quiet but even after a long time it wouldnt settle downSo I thought Ive been working at this for many days now and yet my mind wont settle down at allIts time to stop being so determined and to simply be aware of the mind I started to take my hands and feet out of the meditation posture but at the moment I had unfolded one leg but had yet to unfold the other I could see that my mind was like a pendulum swinging more and more slowly more and more slowly  until it stoppedThen there arose an awareness that was sustained by itselfSlowly I put my legs and hands back into positionAt the same time the mind was in a state of awareness absolutely and solidly still seeing clearly into the elementary phenomena of existence as they arose and disbanded changing in line with their nature  and also seeing a separate condition inside with no arising disbanding or changing a condition beyond birth and death something very difficult to put clearly into words because it was a realization of the elementary phenomena of nature completely internal and individualAfter a while I slowly got up and lay down to restThis state of mind remained there as a stillness that sustained itself deep down insideEventually the mind came out of this state and gradually returned to normalFrom this I was able to observe how practice consisting of nothing but fierce desire simply upsets the mind and keeps it from being stillBut when ones awareness of the mind is just right an inner awareness will arise naturally of its own accordBecause of this clear inner awareness I was able to continue knowing the facts of whats true and false right and wrong from that point on and it enabled me to know that the moment when the mind let go of everything was a clear awareness of the elementary phenomena of nature because it was an awareness that knew within and saw within of its own accord  not something you can know or see by wantingFor this reason the Buddhas teaching Sabbe dhamma anatta  All phenomena are notself tells us not to latch onto any of the phenomena of nature whether conditioned or unconditionedFrom that point on I was able to understand things and let go of attachments step by stepIts important to realize how to focus on events in order to get special benefits from your practiceYou have to focus so as to observe and contemplate not simply to make the mind stillFocus on how things arise how they disbandMake your focus subtle and deepWhen youre aware of the characteristics of your sensations then  if its a physical sensation  contemplate that physical sensationThere will have to be a feeling of stressOnce theres a feeling of stress how will you be aware of it simply as a feeling so that it wont lead to anything furtherOnce you can be aware of it simply as a feeling it stops right there without producing any taste in terms of a desire for anythingThe mind will disengage right there  right there at the feelingIf you dont focus on it in this way craving will arise on top of the feeling  craving to attain ease and be rid of the stress and painIf you dont focus on the feeling in the proper way right from the start craving will arise before youre aware of it and if you then try to let go of it itll be very tiringThe way in which preoccupations take shape the sensations of the mind as its aware of things coming with every moment the way these things change and disband These are all things you have to focus on to see clearlyThis is why we make the mind disengagedWe dont disengage it so that it doesnt know or amount to anythingThats not the kind of disengagement we wantThe more the mind is truly disengaged the more it sees clearly into the characteristics of the arising and disbanding within itselfAll I ask is that you observe things carefully that your awareness be allaround at all timesWork at this as much as you canIf you can keep this sort of awareness going youll find that the mind or consciousness under the supervision of mindfulness and discernment in this way is different from  is opposite from  unsupervised consciousnessIt will be the opposite sort of thing continuallyIf you keep the mind well supervised so that its sensitive in the proper way it will yield enormous benefits not just small onesIf you dont make it properly sensitive and aware what can you expect to gain from itWhen we say that we gain from the practice were not talking about anything else Were talking about gaining disengagementFreedomEmptinessBefore the mind was embroiledDefilement and craving attacked and robbed it leaving it completely entangledNow its disengaged freed from the defilements that used to gang up to burn itIts desires for this or that thing its concocting of this or that thought have all fallen awaySo now its empty and disengagedIt can be empty in this way right before your very eyesTry to see it right now before your eyes right now as Im speaking and youre listeningProbe on in so as to knowIf you can be constantly aware in this way youre following in the footsteps or taking within you the quality called buddho which means one who knows who is awake who has blossomed in the DhammaEven if you havent fully blossomed  if youve blossomed only to the extent of disengaging from the blatant levels of craving and defilement  you still benefit a great deal for when the mind really knows the defilements and can let them go it feels cool and refreshed in and of itselfThis is the exact opposite of the defilements that as soon as they arise make us burn and smoulder insideIf we dont have the mindfulness and discernment to help us know the defilements will burn usBut as soon as mindfulness and discernment know the fires go out  and they go out coldObserve how the defilements arise and take shape  they also disband in quick succession but when they disband on their own in this way go out on their own in this way they go out hotIf we have mindfulness and discernment watching over them they go out coldLook so that you can see what the true knowledge of mindfulness and discernment is like It goes out it goes out coldAs for the defilements even when they arise and disband in line with their nature they go out hot  hot because we latch onto them hot because of attachmentWhen they go out cold look again  its because theres no attachmentTheyve been let go put outThis is something really worth looking into the fact that theres something very special like this in the mind  special in that when it really knows the truth it isnt attachedIts unentangled empty and freeThis is how its specialIt can grow empty of greed anger and delusion step after stepIt can be empty of desire empty of mental processesThe important thing is that you really see for yourself that the true nature of the mind is that it can be empty This is why I said this morning that nibbana doesnt lie anywhere elseIt lies right here right where things go out and are cool go out and are coolIts staring us right in the faceThe Buddha taught that we are to know with our own hearts and mindsEven though there are many many words and phrases coined to explain the Dhamma we need focus only on the things we can know and see extinguish and let go of right in each moment of the immediate present  better than taking on a load of other thingsOnce we can read and comprehend our inner awareness well be struck deep within us that the Buddha awakened to the truth right here in the heartHis truth is truly the language of the heartWhen they translate the Dhamma in all sorts of ways it becomes something ordinaryBut if you keep close and careful watch right at the heart and mind youll be able to see clearly to let go to put down your burdensIf you dont know right here your knowledge will send out all sorts of branches turning into thoughtformations with all sorts of meanings in line with conventional labels  and all of them way off the markIf you know right at your inner awareness and make it your constant stance theres nothing at all no need to take hold of anything no need to label anything no need to give anything namesRight where craving arises right where it disbands Thats where youll know what nibbana is like Nibbana is simply this disbanding of craving Thats what the Buddha stressed over and over againIn June the Khao Suan Luang community celebrated Upasika Kees nd birthday  an important milestone in a culture that calculates years in twelveyear cycles  by printing a collection of excerpts from her Dhamma talksThe following selections are drawn from that collection The first requirement when you come to practice is that you need to be the sort of person who loves the truth  and you need to possess endurance to do whats trueOnly then will your practice get anywhereOtherwise it all turns into failure and you go back to being a slave to your defilements and cravings just as before When you dont contemplate yourself how much suffering do you cause for yourselfAnd how much do you cause for othersThese are things we should contemplate as much as we canIf we dont we keep trying to get get getWe dont try to let go to put things aside to make any sacrifices at allWe just keep trying to get for the more we get the more we want If youre greedy and stingy then even if you have loads of money the Buddha says youre poor poor in noble treasures poor in the treasures of the mindEven if you have lots of external wealth when you die it all goes to other people it turns into common property but you yourself are left poor in virtue poor in the Dhamma The mind without its own home  a mind without the Dhamma as its home  has to live with the defilementsThis defilement arises and the mind goes running after itAs soon as it disappears that one arises over there and the mind goes running after thatBecause the mind has no dwelling of its own it has to keep running wild all over the place Practicing to put an end to defilement and suffering is a high level of practice so you first have to clear the ground and put it in good orderDont think that you can practice without any preparation If you live for your appetites all you can think of is getting things for the sake of your appetitesIf you dont develop a sense of contentment or a sense of shame on the beginning level itll be hard to practice the higher levels The important part of the practice lies in contemplatingIf you dont contemplate discernment wont ariseThe Buddha taught us to contemplate and test things to the point where we can clearly know for ourselvesOnly then will we have a proper refugeHe never taught us to take refuge in things we ourselves cant see or do If you truly want to gain release from suffering you have to practice truly you have to make a true effortYou have to let go starting with outward things and working inwardYou have to free yourself from the delusion that falls for delicious allures of every kindThe important point in letting go is to see the drawbacks of what youre letting goOnly then can you let it go once and for allIf you dont see its drawbacks youll still be attached and will miss having it around If youre going to let go of anything you first have to see its drawbacksIf you just tell yourself to let go let go the mind wont easily obeyYou really have to see the drawbacks of the thing youre holding onto and then the mind will let go of its own accordIts like grabbing hold of fire When you feel the heat you let go of your own accord and will never dare grasp it again Its hard to see the drawbacks of sensual passion but even harder to see the drawbacks of more subtle things like your sense of self On the beginning level of the practice you have to learn how to control yourself in the area of your words and deeds  in other words on the level of virtue  so that you can keep your words and deeds at normalcy calm and restrainedIn this way the mind wont follow the power of the crude defilementsWhen violent urges arise you stop them first with your powers of enduranceAfter youve been able to endure for a while your insight will gain the strength it needs to develop a sense of right and wrong and in this way youll see the worth of endurance that it really is a good thing When you do good let it be good in line with natureDont latch onto the thought that youre goodIf you get attached to the idea that youre good it will give rise to lots of other attachments When a mind without pride or conceit gets a scolding it shrinks back like a cow hit by a stickYour sense of self will disappear right before your eyesA good cow even it sees only the shadow of the whip or the stick stays still and composed ready to do quickly what its toldA meditator who can reduce her pride and conceit is sure to make progress and will have nothing heavy to weigh down her mindThe mind will be still and empty  free from any attachment to me or mineThis is how the mind grows empty If youre the sort of person whos open and honest youll find your window for disbanding suffering and defilement right where youre honest with yourself right where you come to your sensesYou dont have to go explaining high level Dhamma to anyoneAll you need is the ordinary level of being honest with yourself about the sufferings and drawbacks of your actions so that you can put a stop to them so that you develop a sense of wariness a sense of shameThats much better than talking about highlevel Dhamma but then being heedless complacent and shameless When you look back to the past you see that its all an affair of your own heedlessnessEven though you knew the Buddhas teachings and were able to explain them correctly still the heart and mind were in a state of heedlessnessActually when people know a lot of Dhamma and can show off a lot of their knowledge they can be more heedless than people who know only a littleThose whove never read Dhamma books tend to be more heedful for theyre more modest and know that they need to read their own minds all the timeThose whove read a lot of books or heard a lot of talks tend to get complacentAnd in this way they become heedless and disrespectful of the Dhamma We have to figure out how to use our own mindfulness and discernment to look inwardly at all times for no one else can know these things or see these things for usWe have to know for ourselves When things are weak and watery they flow awayWhen theyre solid they dont flowWhen the mind is weak and devoid of strength its always ready to flow away like waterBut when the mind is endowed with mindfulness and discernment when its solid and true in its effort it can withstand the flow of the defilements When you first start meditating its like catching a monkey and tying it to a leashWhen its first tied down itll struggle with all its might to get awayIn the same way when the mind is first tied down to its meditation object it doesnt like itItll struggle more than it normally would which makes us feel weak and discouragedSo in this first stage we simply have to use our endurance to resist the minds tendency to stray off in search of other objectsOver time it will gradually grow tame You want the mind to be quiet but it wont be quietSo what do you have to do what do you have to focus on what do you have to know so that you can see how the arising and passing away of fabrication occurTry to look carefully and youre sure to know for yourself for its not anything hidden or mysteriousIts something whose basic principles you can catch sight of yourself What can we do so that the mind doesnt get distracted with its preoccupations or its nonsensical mental fabricationsWe have to give the mind something to focus its awareness on for if its awareness isnt focused on one thing it wanders around to know other things other matters aside from itselfThis is why theres the practice of focusing our awareness on the body or on the breath making the breath the post to which we tie our monkey  the mindIn other words we use mindfulness to keep the mind focused on the breathThis is the first step in the practiceTraining the mind to stay focused on the breath is something we have to do continuously with each inandout breath in every posture  sitting standing walking lying downNo matter what youre doing stay focused on the breathIf you want you can simply stay focused on nothing more than the sensation of the breath without determining whether its long or shortKeep breathing normallyDont force the breath or hold the breath or sit with your body too tenseSit straight and face comfortably straight aheadIf youre going to turn to the left make sure to be focused on the breath as you turnIf you turn to the right stay focused on the breath as you turnWhatever posture you use is up to you but stay focused on the breath continuouslyIf your attention lapses bring it back to knowing the breath againWhatever youre doing at any time watch the breath with every inandout breath and youll be developing mindfulness and alertness  fullbody selfawareness  at the same time youre being aware of the breathWhen you walk you dont have to focus on the steps of the feetFocus on the breath and let the feet do the stepping on their ownLet each part of the body perform its function on its ownAll you have to do is stay focused on the breath and youll have fullbody awarenessWhether the eye is looking at sights or the ear is listening to sounds stay focused on the breathWhen you look at a sight make sure that knowing the breath underlies the lookingWhen you listen to a sound make sure that knowing the breath underlies the listeningThe breath is a means for making the mind quiet so you first have to train yourself with itDont be in a hurry to get higher resultsTrain the mind to stay under the control of mindfulness continuously for days on end  to the point where the mind cant let its attention lapseIt will come to stay more and more with the breath focused on knowing the breath continuously and then other things will stop on their own Thinking stops speaking stopsWhatever tasks you have to do you can still do them while at the same time keeping track of the breath each and every momentIf there are any lapses you come back to knowing the breath againTheres nothing else you have to think aboutBe aware of the breath at the same time youre aware of the normalcy of the mind When the mind can maintain its stance in normalcy you can observe the breath and see that its at normalcy tooWhen their normalcy is in balance you focus down on knowing that the breath is simply a natural phenomenon  the wind propertyThe body as a whole is composed of the four properties earth water fire and windSo here were focused on the wind propertyThe wind property is a natural phenomenon not us or oursThe mind is then at normalcy not thinking or fabricating anything to stir things upIt too is a natural phenomenon pure and simpleIf its not fabricated into anything else if its not burned by defilements it can stay still and at normalcyWhen you stay focused on the breath in every posture its a means of blocking the mind from traipsing around with its thoughts and labelsYou have to be intent on training the mind to stay with the breath with every posture Thats how youll come to know what the mind is like when it has mindfulness of breathing as its dwelling place Focusing on the breath helps the mind grow quiet more than any other method  and its not at all tiringSimply breathe comfortablyIf you let the breath come in and out strongly it helps the breath energy and blood flow throughout the bodyIf you breathe deeply so that the stomach muscles relax it helps to prevent constipationWhen you train with the breath it exercises both the body and the mind and in this way everything calms down in a natural way more easily than if we try to calm things down with force or threatsNo matter how much you threaten the mind it wont surrenderItll run all over the placeSo instead we train it to fall in line with nature  for after all the breath is an aspect of natureWhether youre aware of it or not the breath breathes in line with its natureOnly when we focus on it are we aware of itThe body is also an aspect of natureThe mind is an aspect of natureWhen theyre trained in an appropriate way there arent a lot of problems that you have to solveThe flow of blood and breath energy in the body improves the state of your nervesIf you train your mindfulness and alertness to be aware of the whole body at the same time youre aware of the breath the breath will flow effortlesslyIf you sit for long periods of time this practice will help keep the blood and breath energy flowing naturallyYou dont have to fight the breath or hold it inWhen you place your feet and hands in the meditation posture dont tense them upIf you relax them so that the blood and breath energy flow easily it will be very helpfulFocusing on mindfulness of the breath is appropriate in every way  appropriate for the body appropriate for the mindBefore his awakening when he was still a bodhisattva the Buddha used mindfulness of breathing more than any other practice as the dwelling place for his mindSo when you practice it you too will have mindfulness of breathing as the dwelling place for your mindThat way the mind wont wander around fabricating thoughts and getting embroiledYou have to get it to settle down and be stillAs soon as anything springs up focus on the breathIf you try to focus directly on the mind right from the start it might be too difficult to manage if youre not familiar with itIf you want to focus directly on the mind thats fine too but you have to be aware of it with every inandout breathMake your awareness continuous for long periods of time Work at this in every posture and see what results arise
